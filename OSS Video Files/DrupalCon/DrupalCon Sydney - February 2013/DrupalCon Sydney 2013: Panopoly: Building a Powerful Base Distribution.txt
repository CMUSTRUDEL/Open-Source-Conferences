Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Panopoly: Building a Powerful Base Distribution
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	Panopoly is an Apps enabled distribution of Drupal powered by lots of Chaos Tools and Panels magic. The distribution is designed to be both a general foundation for site building and a base framework upon which to build other Drupal distributions.

This session will rock out with the latest and greatest version of Panopoly, the soon to be released 1.0. We will discuss the major features of the distribution, talk about how the different contributed modules that are working together, and do a live demonstration around key functionality.

Afterwards, we will dig into the technical details to talk about the anatomy of a Drupal distribution and outline the steps that are required to extend Panopoly to customize your own "sub distribution".

Come to this session to learn both about Panopoly and about what it takes to build your own Drupal distribution!

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,730
and welcome to the last session of the

00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:08,550
first session day of drupalcon today

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:12,179
we're going to talk about panoply which

00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,880
is a base distribution that's designed

00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,820
to allow people to have easy and quick

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,410
access to build Drupal sites so as I was

00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:21,600
mentioning a little earlier about thirty

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,699
percent of this talk is around how base

00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,730
distributions work how install profiles

00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,779
work how you build Drupal products

00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,789
seventy percent of the talk is on

00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:32,009
monopoly which is a particular base

00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:33,960
distribution and one that has a lot of

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:37,290
these functionality and pieces that will

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,590
talk about so to sort of jump in there

00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:41,940
in terms of details so my name is Matt

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,430
Cheney I live in San Francisco

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,190
California I'm not a particularly

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,840
technical person by trade I was went to

00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:51,239
school to be a librarian so I'm very

00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,670
focused on content and layout and how

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,289
people specifically end users and

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,320
information specialists get stuff

00:00:55,289 --> 00:01:00,180
published to the Internet professionally

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,160
I founded a company chapter 3 which is a

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,899
web design and development company in

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,970
San Francisco and now work at a company

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:08,130
called Pantheon systems which I also

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,049
found it to help make people have better

00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:12,689
development and sort of hosting

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:15,090
environments it's a magical platform for

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:16,830
Drupal stuff everything I show you here

00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,380
you can actually check out and try on

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,880
Pantheon for for his developer which is

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,640
very cool there's some slides at the end

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,990
to talk about that um in terms of Drupal

00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,850
I'm really a big fan of the panels

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,430
module which I assume a lot of folks the

00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:31,979
room have used and hopefully love it's a

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,140
powerful sort of engine for tools to

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,900
make websites and a a lot of what can

00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,159
Apple II does sort of extends that and

00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:40,320
specifically I care a lot about Drupal

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,329
distributions that part of the sort of

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,100
thinking in terms of Pantheon is that

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:46,259
will live in a world where drupal will

00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,670
run twenty percent of the internet and I

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,680
feel that the way we get there as a

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,829
community and as a software project is

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,810
to take Drupal which by itself doesn't

00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:56,790
do a whole lot and make it work in

00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,890
particular vertical so you can spin up a

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,020
website in a box for whatever particular

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:02,790
use case you have and a lot of the work

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,590
around base distributions sort of tries

00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,710
to get us there by making it easy and

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,390
simple for you as developers or as site

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,220
owners to have the ability to spin up

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,680
something in a box that works for you

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,350
use case so let's start here with sort

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,870
of the main premise so like I mentioned

00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,430
Drupal sort of by default this is the

00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:23,280
starting screen when you install Drupal

00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:25,110
7 is it can be anything it's a great

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,780
deal of Legos that have a lot of

00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,520
positive and powerful functionality to

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,320
them that we all know the kinds of

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,030
things you can build with Drupal but

00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,160
that you sort of start here as an end

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,780
user so when you're new to Drupal or if

00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,940
you're evaluating Drupal it doesn't look

00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:40,710
like a whole lot out of the box and then

00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,140
in most cases you're going to need to

00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:45,150
install to run some additional code be

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,890
on Drupal whether if that's modules that

00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:48,660
you're downloading or code you're

00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,090
writing to actually get it to be what we

00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,730
want it to be and contrast that with

00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,380
WordPress that runs you know 10 10 times

00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,700
the kind a number of sites that Drupal

00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,890
runs WordPress does something very

00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:01,020
particularly out of the box it's a blog

00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:02,970
like you're starting screen has your

00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:06,090
first blog post your sidebar has your

00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:08,370
comments and blog categories your entire

00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,440
experience is set up and designed for

00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,180
that kind of thing and I think when we

00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,770
sort of look at how we as a Drupal

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,630
community create a world where

00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:17,670
double-digit percentage of the internet

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,920
runs Drupal we need to provide more

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:21,330
solutions like WordPress where you have

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,610
an out-of-the-box experience that's

00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,380
really powerful it just is sort of

00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:28,709
tricky to do for a lot of reasons but we

00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:30,600
have some successes distributions are in

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,940
the Drupal space we have distributions

00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:35,100
for for e-commerce stores distributions

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,540
for internet distributions for NGO size

00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,880
distributions for government or

00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:40,650
university or you name it and there's

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,209
varying quality and sort of support

00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,610
ability of these kinds of things but

00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:46,560
Drupal can be made to do the kinds of

00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:49,140
vertical use cases that we're all

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,940
looking for as a as a community to get

00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:52,769
there and a lot of these distributions

00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:54,959
are getting a lot of pick up in their

00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:57,000
specific spaces there's a lot of people

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,350
that are around today that use for

00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,910
example drupal as part of our e-commerce

00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:01,530
store but might not actually know

00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,030
they're running Drupal they just know

00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,130
they're running commerce Kickstarter or

00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,530
something like that and the same is true

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,510
for a lot of different spaces and I

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,640
think this is where I love to see Drupal

00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:14,489
go the problem is that these

00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,680
distributions are hard to maintain their

00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:17,940
hard to build and they require actually

00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:20,370
a fair amount of sort of technical

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,289
know-how to get these things working

00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,419
I've built several distributions in my

00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:25,050
life and you know just even getting

00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,580
started with

00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,530
writing this tall profile is hard

00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,139
picking the modules that you want to use

00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,280
and how they work together as hard

00:04:30,139 --> 00:04:34,590
taking Drupal and creating a better

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,180
admin experience having a WYSIWYG or

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:38,460
providing people the ability to sort of

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,650
expand what you've done later all are

00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,259
very hard problems to solve and it's no

00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:45,720
surprise that from that last slide that

00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:46,979
a lot of these distributions are things

00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,259
that are being done with companies that

00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:51,720
have venture-funded money or are very

00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:53,879
large professional services firms or are

00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,740
having external funding to really make

00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,379
these work because to build something

00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,389
like this for your drupal sort of

00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:02,639
product is actually a lot of work and

00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:05,699
constitutes hundreds if not thousands of

00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,969
developer hours to solve these kinds of

00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:10,860
problems and that creates you know a

00:05:08,969 --> 00:05:13,349
huge barrier which is why I think we

00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:14,909
don't see as many of these Drupal

00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:18,210
products and distributions as we might

00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:19,680
we might otherwise want to see threes

00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,259
has a pretty pretty interesting blog

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,550
post after the release of Drupal 5 that

00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:25,889
with this is now five six years ago

00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,659
where he sort of looked at the install

00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:29,580
profile feature in Drupal which allows

00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:31,229
you to sort of make Drupal do something

00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,180
out of the box beyond the standard

00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:34,860
functionality and in post he talks about

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,810
how great this functionality is and it

00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,810
is great but then he predicts that in

00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:42,029
2006 i believe 2007 that will see a

00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,500
tsunami of drupal distributions as part

00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:45,750
of sort of what he thought would happen

00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,120
and we saw some obviously but we didn't

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,229
see a tsunami by any means and i think a

00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,150
lot of that is because these are hard

00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:53,430
problems to actually build distributions

00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,539
um terms of just the audience quick show

00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:57,000
of hands who's like maeda drupal

00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:59,279
distribution or aspires to or whatever

00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,539
that's great okay that's actually

00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,949
actually that's quite a few more people

00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:03,360
and I expected so you've probably

00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:06,090
struggle with some of these problems and

00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,889
are definitely doing doing what this

00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:11,190
guys doing which is reinventing the

00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:12,629
wheel I've you know looking at the code

00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,759
of a lot of the drivel distributions are

00:06:12,629 --> 00:06:16,740
out there working a lot of people you

00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,020
sort of see these same problems being

00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:20,909
solved like most distributions will ship

00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,949
with a WYSIWYG for example which in

00:06:20,909 --> 00:06:24,449
Drupal 7 isn't isn't by default so you

00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,340
have to install some modules and do

00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:27,599
configuration to get there most

00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,400
distributions will provide better

00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:31,590
administrative experiences will provide

00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:33,870
a lot of these kind of extra things and

00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:35,490
I think one of the things that I really

00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,320
feel is important and this is really

00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,550
where panoply is coming from and this is

00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,890
where this whole concept of

00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,660
bass distribution is coming from is that

00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,550
I think we want to create a situation

00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,620
where people who are building Drupal

00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:48,570
products either for you know fun or

00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:51,240
profit have a starting point that's

00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:52,800
better than that like blue screen that

00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,160
is Drupal by default they have something

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,620
that exists as a you know you know

00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,600
higher level starting point and this is

00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,910
a Drupal problem that we've seen we've

00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,560
seen before that um in the world of

00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,870
theming for people who make themes like

00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,550
it's very there's a lot of options in

00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:10,950
the theming world for base themes or

00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:13,170
starter themes that actually take a lot

00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:15,360
of the problems or tasks that femurs are

00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:17,460
usually doing on every site they theme

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,860
and providing those is sort of a common

00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:22,110
common set of repositories and what I

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,390
sort of want to argue for or suggest is

00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,310
that similar to how base themes work in

00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:28,470
the sort of theming space that we can

00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:31,170
have this concept of base distributions

00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:32,670
with inside Drupal and these base

00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:34,530
distributions are things that are going

00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:37,140
to soar first and foremost is simply

00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:38,790
bundle common functionality together be

00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:41,310
it a WYSIWYG or enhancements on a

00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:43,680
WYSIWYG be it a set of layouts pietà

00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,270
improved search system or whatever and

00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,340
these are going to be sitting things

00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:49,500
that anybody can draw on who wants to

00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,240
build a distribution to have in their

00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,130
stuff so the panoply stuff which will

00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,690
show you in just a bit all of those

00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:57,210
things are things that if you want to

00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:59,640
use that that kind of sort of magical

00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,860
Drupal thing in your site you can sort

00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,570
of easily extend on what panoply has to

00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,700
do to do that for your distribution and

00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:07,830
sort of from from ground zero you get

00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,450
all these things second is that you want

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,250
to provide sane and smart defaults for

00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,840
people who are doing drupal site

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,090
building either as distributions or a

00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,190
standalone things this is relatively

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,900
straightforward but mostly just to say

00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:20,820
hey we want to give you a higher

00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,470
starting point been Drupal's blue screen

00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,150
that asks you to do some sort of weird

00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:26,130
stuff and we want to have the ability

00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,480
though to have that be overridden that

00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,580
it doesn't always have to be the way it

00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,290
is it's just a default and then the

00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:33,180
third and probably most important thing

00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:35,340
here is that part of it I think a good

00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,320
base theme for example is strong

00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,330
documentation around how to extend each

00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,650
of the different pieces of it and I with

00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:42,600
Penn opoly or with other distribution

00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:44,490
based distributions I feel important

00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,290
thing is explaining to people how do you

00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:47,610
go beyond what you have and how do you

00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,080
extend it and that documentation is

00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,580
critical because having struggled

00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,200
through a lot of distribution writing is

00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:53,670
assume a lot of you

00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,710
you folks have there's things that you

00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,300
just don't really pick up like the

00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,640
modules are loaded all in alphabetical

00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,080
order with no dependency checking like

00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,550
that's not something that's intuitive

00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,740
it's not something how Drupal handles

00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,240
itself elsewhere but in terms of

00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,860
building a stall profiles it is so

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,600
that's sort of what we're looking to do

00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,790
and and this is sort of then in the

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,280
panoply space what this looks like right

00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:15,780
we've got drupal 7 at the bottom that

00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:17,580
exists as just the core core

00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,380
functionality in the Drupal 8 were a

00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,900
little look the same of course but just

00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,760
with Drupal 8 in the module space we

00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:26,190
have a set of contributed modules that

00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,290
are brought in by the base distribution

00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,550
by panoply these are things that you

00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:31,740
know probably needs to do what it needs

00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,720
to do and what I think a lot of modules

00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,980
people use their sites and then on top

00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,230
of it actually sits the base

00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,670
distribution panoply that allows you to

00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,830
have a lot of the functionality I'll

00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,240
show you the important thing though here

00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,190
is that we have additional layers that

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,170
can be built on top of this thing so if

00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:48,150
you look at distributions that are being

00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:50,310
worked on in the Drupal space like open

00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:53,310
Academy for universities or open atrium

00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,870
for it for ngos and internets these are

00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:56,100
things that are basically taking this

00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,350
stack and putting their own

00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,850
functionality on top of it as a way to

00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,900
sort of extend where they're going and

00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,120
this is where I feel the bass

00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,890
distribution can really win by saying

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,230
let's find the right modules final right

00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,300
core stuff and then build a set of stuff

00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,770
everybody needs and then let folks who

00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,240
are building distributions sit at the

00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:16,200
top of the stack and make stuff that

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,630
really really works for them so why

00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,920
panoply what are the specific features

00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,350
that would make you want to use a base

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,730
distribution or features that if you're

00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,380
just building a site you'd want to have

00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:27,210
I mean the kind of stuff that the base

00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:29,100
distribution gives you isn't necessarily

00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:31,440
only for people who want to build other

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,690
distributions it's completely acceptable

00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,610
and valuable to use it as a starting

00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:38,910
point for building your own site even if

00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:41,670
there's just one of them so in terms of

00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:43,920
sort of the what value you get the

00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:46,650
number one value is really a question of

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,690
module selection it's about saying when

00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:51,300
I start from scratch in Drupal the first

00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,980
thing that I before I started using base

00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,900
distributions would do is I would just

00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,940
go get a bunch of modules i know i need

00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,350
one of the things panoply does is it

00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:00,330
says i'm already going to go get you a

00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:02,040
bunch of best practice default modules

00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:04,080
like you're going to want to have views

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,100
on your site to do any of the

00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,329
complicated things you want to do so

00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,339
let's just go ahead and get the right

00:11:07,329 --> 00:11:11,709
version of views installed configured

00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:13,360
permissioned and ready to go and let's

00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:16,329
do that for a bunch of other modules

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,490
sort of down the bound the path so we

00:11:16,329 --> 00:11:21,160
have in terms of selections a pretty

00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,810
good foundation of modules that most of

00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,940
you are going to use on most your site's

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:27,579
things like views or paths auto or

00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:29,350
WYSIWYG or entity or jQuery updater

00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:31,569
things that make Drupal better but

00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:33,519
require some you know technical

00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:35,079
awareness of how they work together and

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,509
some testing to make sure that that

00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:38,920
stack works like some like jQuery update

00:11:37,509 --> 00:11:41,380
super useful to provide some

00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,029
higher-level UX functionality but can

00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,980
break other stuff if you don't have the

00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:47,050
appropriate patches and and sort of

00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:48,399
testing and what panoply less sort of

00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:50,310
says is hey we're going to give you a

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,110
stack with all of these modules

00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,540
connected together permission together

00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:56,769
and ready to go so that you can start

00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,180
building on top of that you don't have

00:11:56,769 --> 00:12:00,370
to get all this stuff installed or

00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,649
configure and this is sort of you know

00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,480
these are all optional in some kitten or

00:12:02,649 --> 00:12:06,250
most of these are optional in the sense

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,779
you can sort of remover or not remove

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:10,089
them if you want but it's that sort of

00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:12,130
same default philosophy at work and

00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:14,529
that's so these are her the base modules

00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:16,540
that we have we also have some very

00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:19,720
specific modules for actually how you

00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:21,430
build distributions features is the sort

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,370
of core of that kind of technology but

00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:26,560
things like uuid or default config or

00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:28,029
default content or stuff like that are

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:31,329
things they're necessary if you want to

00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:32,620
build Drupal distributions and are

00:12:31,329 --> 00:12:34,750
things that panoply sort of already

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,399
establishes for you provide you clear

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:38,110
patterns for how to use for your stuff

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,250
and really get to you that leg forward

00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:44,139
these are all sort of bundled by default

00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:46,449
the sort of heart of panoply it's

00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:49,180
obviously the panels modules if you've

00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:51,310
used panels before it's like panoply has

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,380
those things but it's or really goes

00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,509
well beyond that which you'll see but

00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,459
the important thing is that panels the

00:12:55,509 --> 00:12:59,529
panels module is just one of actually

00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:02,470
many different modules across different

00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:04,839
projects that really gets you that kind

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,759
of awesome functionality you would want

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,680
to have in terms of drag and drop and

00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:10,930
and configurability extendibility so

00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,730
beyond just panels panel Iser is a newer

00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:15,130
module it's very useful takes all the

00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,839
panels stuff applies it to nodes feel

00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:19,389
double panel pains uses the entity

00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,840
system in Drupal provide you very smart

00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:21,550
sort of

00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:24,100
pain objects that work like blocks you

00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:26,470
can drop anywhere with clearfield UI on

00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,510
it p.m. existing pages lets you panel

00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:30,460
eyes everything panels breadcrumbs make

00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:32,860
sure the breadcrumb and insight path

00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:35,290
thing all works well and the panel's IP

00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:36,850
is the sort of drag and drop front-end

00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:39,100
thing that's sort of a the crown jewel

00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,690
of what panoply does but that this is

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,000
all set up for you by default when you

00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,890
get panoply and it's something you can

00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,810
use if you want or disable if you want

00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,670
you have a lot of options but it's not

00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:50,110
easy tech to get working and get working

00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:53,590
right together and that's one of the

00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:57,040
benefits the last bit is just the UX

00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:58,450
improvements so Drupal 7 has a lot of UX

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,700
improvements that have gone on and

00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,830
controls things and in some cases are in

00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,660
Drupal 8 but our stuff that we can make

00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,100
better in Drupal 7 just by turning on

00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:08,230
the right modules and making sure

00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,970
they're tested and integrated and so

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:12,010
there are various things from module

00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:14,680
filter which is a great way to improve

00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:17,590
the display of the modules page to an

00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,180
admin bar at the top to having pop-ups

00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:21,400
to pick dates instead of having to type

00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,690
in strings or having the ability to save

00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,520
as draft different things these are

00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:26,170
options that if you have them on your

00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,850
site people are going to really notice

00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:30,100
the difference and we'll find a more

00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:31,930
usable experience but our stuff that in

00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,910
terms of building normal sites you might

00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,170
not actually go in and and download just

00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:37,960
because it requires some thinking and

00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:39,640
what Napoli's giving you this ability to

00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,200
make your site better by providing you

00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,050
this all out of the box in a sort of

00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,910
sustained and supported way and that

00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,740
sort of then by just turning on panoply

00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:49,470
as a base distribution you get all of

00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:53,410
these modules already configured and

00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:58,060
you're off to the races advantage to is

00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:59,680
layouts so layouts are common need on

00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,240
sites people want to have their sights

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,920
laid out in different ways sometimes

00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,080
that's sidebar left sometimes that

00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,210
sidebar right but there's a whole lot of

00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:09,670
other cases that sort of need to be

00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:11,410
addressed and as femurs or developer as

00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,870
your end up writing you know different

00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,520
kinds of layout and CSS routines to make

00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,380
this stuff work the way you want it to

00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,270
work and that can get a little tedious

00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,950
it can definitely take time and energy

00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:23,410
out of your product project and it can

00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:25,210
require you know some complexity if you

00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,830
want to change the layouts so what

00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:30,070
properly does to help address this is

00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:31,930
provide layouts for you out of the box

00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:33,490
so there's 31 layout set panoply ships

00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,230
with these are the layouts

00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:36,940
there you can change them at any page

00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:38,709
which will show you but the important

00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:40,570
thing is that all cross-browser tested

00:15:38,709 --> 00:15:42,610
they're all responsive for mobile

00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,260
support and they're all sort of

00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:46,000
pre-baked in it so that anything you

00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,950
build on top of monopoly in terms of

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,140
your own distribution your own site you

00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:52,120
can just drop in one of these layouts

00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:54,459
and it'll just work and that's very

00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:56,260
helpful because this require you to

00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:58,000
rebuild these things each time you have

00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,920
a library of things are tested and

00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,080
supported by a larger group of people

00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,790
and you can sort of depend on these at

00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,529
least as a minimum being there so you

00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:06,850
need to make more if you want but that

00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:08,589
this is the kind of thing that ends up

00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:10,420
being super helpful for site builders

00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:12,880
and designers because they don't have to

00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:14,140
go ahead and and make all this stuff and

00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,670
figure how to make it responsive and

00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:18,430
things and that's obviously a key

00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:21,160
feature turns what we're going search is

00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:23,050
another feature super important Drupal

00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,200
search isn't particularly strong in this

00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:28,120
area part of it because Drupal search is

00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,470
sort of a lowest common denominator kind

00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,480
of functionality so it doesn't do a

00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:33,160
whole lot of crazy database stuff it

00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,220
obviously can't assume the backend like

00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:39,220
solar or Sphinx to actually do your

00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:41,290
database exchanges but panoply by virtue

00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,730
of using the Search API module which is

00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:45,130
a great module and really extensive

00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,829
Drupal search experience can give you an

00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:49,870
experience out of the box that looks

00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:52,000
more like this where you have a your

00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:54,490
search results or a view which is easy

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,770
to theme and customize you've got facets

00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,450
for like content type or date and you

00:16:56,770 --> 00:17:00,700
have the whole page being a panelized

00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:02,620
experience so that allows you to go

00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,720
beyond just having the normal Drupal

00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:07,329
search but having a pretty strong robust

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,740
option out of the box and you just get

00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:12,160
that by virtue of turning the thing on

00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:14,679
which is very cool content editing and

00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,050
WYSIWYG as I mentioned earlier this is

00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:19,059
like a critical part of most like modern

00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:21,490
web content management systems and a

00:17:19,059 --> 00:17:23,230
necessary piece for a lot of people to

00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:26,050
put their thoughts and opinions and

00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:27,850
stuff online Drupal 8 will likely have

00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:29,230
one of these things that will go well

00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:31,450
that'll work you know hopefully pretty

00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,770
well Drupal 7 doesn't one of the things

00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,260
properly does is provide you that

00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:37,240
experience and it's not just like

00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:39,760
turning on a WYSIWYG and having it work

00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,280
it's about making a really sort of you

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,990
know best to breed experience so we have

00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:46,310
tiny MC which we had used for a while

00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,930
and now also ck editor

00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:50,120
which is probably what we'll be in

00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:52,160
Drupal core and that those editors are

00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,530
obviously visually going to provide that

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,630
WYSIWYG experience but behind the scenes

00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:58,520
were integrating the WYSIWYG module to

00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:00,530
make all that sort of work along with

00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,930
the caption filter module to do stuff

00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:05,240
like that caption on the right media

00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:07,190
module to bring in media assets image

00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:09,980
resize filter to allow for in the

00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:12,500
automatic image resizing and scaling on

00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:14,390
the fly wysiwyg filter to make sure that

00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,610
we can have all that complicated markup

00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:18,200
go through the security filters but

00:18:16,610 --> 00:18:20,660
nothing we don't want which is actually

00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:22,370
a pretty tricky task and pathologic to

00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:24,350
manage some of the links and and other

00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,340
URLs that are put in there and all of

00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,740
this stuff there's like a lot of

00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:29,420
thinking and man-hours and people hours

00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:31,880
that went into making sure that this was

00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,350
WYSIWYG really really really works for

00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,820
people and that's something that you

00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,620
just sort of gap by default so if you've

00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,210
ever gone and have to configure WYSIWYG

00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,740
you don't need to do that anymore you

00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:41,660
just use a base distribution and you

00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,910
have it anyone who's is your site has it

00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:46,340
which is which is very very useful and

00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,900
I'll show you this in the demo but as a

00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:49,790
sort of key feature for what a base

00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:53,000
distribution can do providing that

00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:56,990
experience is critical last couple of

00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,280
things so user administration or site

00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:01,130
administration is really important

00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,050
Drupal by virtue of beings were a box of

00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:05,300
Lego's with a lot of developer sort of

00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:07,340
interactions doesn't necessarily have a

00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,440
particularly strong content editing

00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,330
experience that's something that will be

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,830
improved hopefully in Drupal 8 but that

00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:14,900
one of the things panoply does is sort

00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:17,300
of give you that kind of wordpress style

00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:19,730
experience now so it'll turn your you're

00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,990
sort of no dad or node edit page into

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,820
something that looks a lot more like

00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:25,340
this where you've got obviously the

00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,350
WYSIWYG but like your left side focused

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,810
mostly on liquid content the right side

00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,340
a set of options around that and it can

00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:34,010
give you that kind of experience without

00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:35,780
having to do any extra customization and

00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:37,730
this is something that will make your

00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:39,650
users much more appreciative of flow of

00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,660
the interaction of the website much less

00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:43,250
confused about what's going on and give

00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,680
them a sort of consistent experience

00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,630
across any kind of content editing

00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:51,230
they're doing on the site which in our

00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:53,120
experience has been really helpful this

00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,680
is also true for the sort of other

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,350
pieces of content you want to add to

00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,300
your sites that aren't nodes so a pretty

00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:59,900
common request that I've seen in the

00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,060
Drupal space

00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:04,910
for someone who wants to say add an

00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:07,280
image to a sidebar how sort of one would

00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:09,550
go off and do that that's not actually

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,410
that easy to do in Drupal surprisingly

00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:14,270
mostly because you know having control

00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:15,680
of what stuff shows up in the sidebar is

00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,780
a different interface from where you

00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:19,970
upload files is a different interface to

00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:22,040
how you do you know define some of the

00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:24,110
things that go there and so one of the

00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,880
sort of key pieces that properly can do

00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:28,250
by virtue of leveraging feel double

00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,900
panel pains and panels is provide you

00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,850
this sort of cool experience we're like

00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,130
any place on the site if you want to add

00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:36,440
something you can just click and say add

00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,420
me something it gives you these options

00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:39,890
as sort of what you want to add and you

00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,650
can pick do you want to have linked

00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:45,380
quick links or files or a map or video

00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:47,690
or a submenu or something like that and

00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:50,150
those all sort of get popped up with

00:20:47,690 --> 00:20:51,530
their own configuration boxes that allow

00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,630
you to sort of say i want to add an

00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:55,640
image and I want this alt text and it

00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:57,440
needs a caption and you know I want to

00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,570
make it a link or however you want to do

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,370
it and that becomes really helpful

00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,680
because you can turn it over to another

00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:06,830
content editor an end user and say I

00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:08,210
want to be able to have control of my

00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:10,250
sight after you've built it for me or

00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,690
after I've installed it I can use this

00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:14,420
kind of stuff to really get in the guts

00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:17,030
of it then the last and most important

00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:19,130
piece here is that Drupal websites are

00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:21,140
by virtue of how they get built very

00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:24,110
complex so like you look at a any

00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:25,820
sufficiently complex triple site and I

00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,740
assure you some of the contents being

00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:30,710
built by blocks some by views some by

00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:32,990
nodes some done in the themes on through

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:35,540
custom modules like you're never going

00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:37,940
to have a clean understanding as an end

00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:38,990
user of what comes from what and even if

00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,880
you turn on something like the

00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,440
contextual links or the contextual

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,940
module where you can have little

00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:46,220
contextual links on each piece of

00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,500
content if you hit edit that thing it

00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,360
can go to a block screen it can go to a

00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,580
view it can go to a note edit page and

00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:55,160
this becomes really hard to change what

00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,180
you have later so I mean there's plenty

00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,980
of people have room obviously build

00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,600
Drupal sites no problem to change them

00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,640
you want to hand it over as someone

00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,650
who's not a drupal developer you run

00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,360
into problems really fast and if you're

00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:07,460
trying to make a distribution for other

00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,860
people this is like an essential problem

00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:12,110
to solve because i need to say i want to

00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,639
give you a whatever website in a box i

00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:15,499
wanted to turn it on and i want you

00:22:13,639 --> 00:22:17,570
to make a new page on it and have it

00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:18,829
like be the kind of rich content

00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:22,279
management content editing experience

00:22:18,829 --> 00:22:25,339
that people want from a CMS and so what

00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:27,649
we're doing in properly which is sort of

00:22:25,339 --> 00:22:31,009
extremely important is that every single

00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:32,299
page on a panoply site you know you can

00:22:31,009 --> 00:22:34,099
turn it off if you want but by default

00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:35,959
you're getting this black bar at the

00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:37,729
bottom that gives you these options to

00:22:35,959 --> 00:22:40,369
customize the page or change the layout

00:22:37,729 --> 00:22:42,289
and just by customizing it you get into

00:22:40,369 --> 00:22:43,849
this kind of editing experience it's

00:22:42,289 --> 00:22:45,619
really helpful and this is really what

00:22:43,849 --> 00:22:48,200
i'm trying to sell i think first and

00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:50,359
foremost you all is that this kind of

00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:53,989
model of saying i want to edit a site

00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:55,820
click customize and have that ability to

00:22:53,989 --> 00:22:57,409
customize this is what people want in

00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,539
their distributions this is what people

00:22:57,409 --> 00:23:02,089
want in a lot of cases as end-users your

00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:03,919
site and this is what you can get by

00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:07,279
just using a base distro like like

00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:14,749
panoply so let's dive in and see how

00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:19,359
that works alright so I don't know put

00:23:14,749 --> 00:23:21,709
it back to mirroring and let's get going

00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:26,359
so I've turned on I've installed panoply

00:23:21,709 --> 00:23:30,289
just uh as a sort of base thing I

00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:32,539
haven't changed any of it from what you

00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:34,249
normally see so if you guys went on and

00:23:32,539 --> 00:23:35,659
I downloaded the tarball or went on

00:23:34,249 --> 00:23:37,429
Pantheon and got this up and running

00:23:35,659 --> 00:23:39,019
this is what you would get the only

00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:40,999
thing I've done sort of I guess special

00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:43,249
is I turned on the panoply demo module

00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:45,469
which just provides some content so you

00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:47,899
can see images and M pieces and stuff

00:23:45,469 --> 00:23:50,749
like that so the stuff that I think is

00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:52,999
sort of the super coolest here is this

00:23:50,749 --> 00:23:53,989
is this black bar like I mentioned so I

00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:56,450
can sort of show you some these

00:23:53,989 --> 00:23:58,369
interaction patterns so changing layout

00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,409
is super nice so I want to change the

00:23:58,369 --> 00:24:02,209
layout of the front page you can see

00:24:00,409 --> 00:24:03,889
I've got this kind of layout up here

00:24:02,209 --> 00:24:06,589
it's it's grayed out to indicate that's

00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:08,589
what I have but if I wanted to flip the

00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:11,059
page I can just click on the other

00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:13,729
layout it'll go from this to that and

00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:15,739
hit save and then right there in my

00:24:13,729 --> 00:24:17,719
browser it'll actually go ahead and

00:24:15,739 --> 00:24:20,899
Reese I and realign the way out of that

00:24:17,719 --> 00:24:22,429
page this is nice because I've been able

00:24:20,899 --> 00:24:24,379
to change where the content lays out

00:24:22,429 --> 00:24:26,329
what CSS using to do the layout all

00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,820
without having to go into the code or do

00:24:26,329 --> 00:24:29,279
anything

00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,539
complicated four-seamers who people who

00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,950
change layouts and stuff that can

00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:34,590
actually get a little complicated if

00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:35,820
you're not using a tool like this but

00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:38,309
you know there's some white space here I

00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:40,259
might not want that and I can sort of

00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:42,419
play around till I get sort of the kind

00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:47,370
of layout experience that I really want

00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:48,539
so let's try let's try that one and now

00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:50,460
we have something that approaches a

00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:52,350
little a little more reasonable and this

00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,149
is true on the home page obviously this

00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:55,950
and then that's powered by panels and

00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:58,139
page manager this is also true in any

00:24:55,950 --> 00:25:00,570
node or any user or any taxonomy term

00:24:58,139 --> 00:25:03,470
you get that same ability to change the

00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:05,250
layout and that's super cool I think

00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:07,740
there are peace you get is the ability

00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:09,470
actually customize what's on the page so

00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,899
when I hit customized I get this

00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:15,179
interface that that got designed up and

00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:18,899
it's got the each individual sort of

00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:21,299
area on the site with a special like bit

00:25:18,899 --> 00:25:23,490
at the top so i can go ahead and hit

00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:25,549
this plus button and this gives me this

00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:28,649
ad interface that i'd mentioned before

00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:31,139
so the ad interface is cool because you

00:25:28,649 --> 00:25:33,149
actually have the ability to select

00:25:31,139 --> 00:25:35,610
between the various widgets on here what

00:25:33,149 --> 00:25:38,250
you want to add you also have the

00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:40,139
ability to predefine things that you

00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:41,970
might want to add to the site and these

00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:44,360
are these can be views these can be

00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:46,350
custom content pains or whatever and

00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,909
this is where I think the new sort of

00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:50,759
distribution context you can get a lot

00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:52,620
of mileage so in this den ah Polly demo

00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:54,389
module we've actually gone ahead and say

00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,759
let's define three different sort of

00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:58,679
widgets or blocks or pains that you

00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:59,850
might want to have on your site and you

00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:01,529
could think of this if you want to make

00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:03,480
a university distribution you might have

00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:05,759
courses or events or if you want to make

00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:08,759
a news site you might have recent news

00:26:05,759 --> 00:26:10,019
or feature news or whatever but each of

00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:12,149
these things that gives you a version of

00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:14,399
what this thing looks like and you can

00:26:12,149 --> 00:26:16,740
go ahead and say ok I want to show say a

00:26:14,399 --> 00:26:18,629
list of these items and then it'll

00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,490
actually give you this editing interface

00:26:18,629 --> 00:26:22,799
to actually change the different

00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:24,779
properties on this so this is all done

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,659
through panels and the panel's ipe to

00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:29,759
get this interface but that these kinds

00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:32,549
of pieces here are actually options that

00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:34,679
are coming out of views so Earl miles

00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:36,419
who wrote panels also real views like a

00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:37,950
lot of the logic is really similar and

00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:40,290
there are really good interactions and

00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:42,060
integrations between the two so

00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:44,280
so we can go ahead and change stuff

00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,870
that's like pretty you know easy to do

00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,070
in views on the front end so we can

00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:49,440
actually go ahead and get rid of the

00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:51,240
image if we wanted or we could get rid

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,780
of the the teaser text where we could

00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:56,490
could add an image but we could you know

00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:58,940
or maybe not at an image but organize it

00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:01,980
in the table sort it with whatever

00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:03,750
properties and we can really sort of you

00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,670
know have that kind of customization

00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:08,340
experience as sort of an end user

00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:09,780
without having to go on to the back end

00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,820
to do any of these kinds of things and

00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:15,480
let's say we'll go ahead and change this

00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:16,650
let's just have to and this is the kind

00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,060
of power that I think a lot of people

00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:20,040
when they come to Drupal are sort of

00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,300
expecting Drupal to do when they hit

00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:23,370
edit and have to go to this sort of

00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,380
airplane dashboard that is the views you

00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:28,110
I people get a little bit freaked out

00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:30,330
and they get confused having something

00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:32,040
that's a lot more sort of there and and

00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:33,510
sort of visual is really helpful because

00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:36,210
I can sort of see in this preview what

00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:38,880
I'm getting before I get it so we'll go

00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:40,050
ahead and add that which is cool um once

00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,730
we've added it we can obviously go

00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:43,920
customize it again and we'll get those

00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:46,800
same options but we also get the ability

00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:48,630
to actually stylize it so one of the

00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,920
things that panels sort of ships with is

00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:51,690
the ability to create these things that

00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,700
are called silo plugins and their

00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:55,920
charges basic theme functions that

00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,320
provide sort of common design patterns

00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:00,840
for each individual thing so you can do

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,760
things as basic as add the CSS class to

00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,290
what you're talking about two things as

00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,590
complicated as adding JavaScript or

00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:09,510
other things so the neat piece here is

00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,920
I've taken the panoply demo module we

00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:13,260
define a few of these things these are

00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,240
just Drupal drupal.org style palette

00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:17,790
colors but you can actually go ahead and

00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,970
create backgrounds and you know

00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:23,280
different kinds of visual

00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,950
representations and by just simply doing

00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:27,570
this we can write there in the UI

00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:29,040
actually change the the color and

00:28:27,570 --> 00:28:31,770
display of what this thing's look like

00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:33,900
and this is I think a huge huge a huge

00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,760
benefit to people building distributions

00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,650
we're creating their own themes because

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,360
instead of just saying hey if you guys

00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:41,880
want to change how this looks go change

00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,650
CSS you can actually predefine a bunch

00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,510
of options that like meets the

00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:47,010
particular style palette or style guide

00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:49,050
of the site and have a really

00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:50,760
first-class experience with changing how

00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:53,010
all that stuff works and that's

00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,210
something that I think can be really

00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:56,370
valuable to end user

00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:58,830
is because if you give them a CSS in a

00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:59,880
digital editor they might get a little

00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,440
freaked out because they don't know what

00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,910
that is or they're not super pro with

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,310
that you give them this kind of thing

00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:07,110
you get a lot of mileage out of it I'm

00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:09,690
so go ahead and save this say to this

00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:11,340
page you also get the abilities because

00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:13,380
you can sort of have how the sort of

00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:15,600
visual look of what things are that you

00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:19,440
can sort of see before you save you can

00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:21,720
hit cancel if you want so for example we

00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,010
can you know go ahead and drag stuff

00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,550
around and maybe have it in different

00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:30,150
positions or in some cases remove it all

00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:32,700
together and have a sort of better sight

00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:34,170
while doing it and that's I think to to

00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,850
me like that's the cut this is the kind

00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:38,580
of feature that people really like and

00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:40,200
really want to have in their um in their

00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:42,110
content management system and you sort

00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,480
of get this in the in the case of

00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:49,500
monopoly so as I said it's true for this

00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:53,010
page this is a actual node page there's

00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:54,660
a sort of default template for this kind

00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:56,670
of node type that like shows like this

00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:59,100
and all content you make will look like

00:29:56,670 --> 00:30:01,020
this but if you want to go customize it

00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,490
you can customize it on a per item basis

00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,250
you can make this node look different

00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:07,140
which is sort of cool so let's say y'all

00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:09,330
so that's that sort of piece one you can

00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,830
edit existing stuff the other cool thing

00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:12,270
that you can do with monopoly is that

00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:14,280
you actually could go ahead and add new

00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:16,860
stuff with the sort of cooler interface

00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:19,080
so I'll go ahead and hit add content

00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,180
when we add content we get sort of two

00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:22,200
options out of the box these are options

00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,330
that are going to be pretty pretty

00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,130
familiar folks in the Drupal 8 world

00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:28,260
where you have the ability to create a

00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:29,880
Content page which is an anode and

00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:32,760
Drupal speak but it's a piece of content

00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,830
or you can do a landing page which is

00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:37,020
something that's going to be a lot more

00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:40,500
sort of sort of static and it's not

00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:42,210
necessarily the kind of kind of like you

00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,670
know your need a thousand weeks ago on a

00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:46,350
site to show you a Content page this is

00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:51,620
the sort of editing interface I

00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:56,130
mentioned before so they will say great

00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:58,230
and this is modeled very very closely

00:30:56,130 --> 00:31:00,330
off the WordPress editing editing screen

00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:02,340
we have the title as a sort of

00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:04,860
privileged item that's bigger we have a

00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:07,170
URL for the title that's coming out of

00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,590
path auto but is visible to the end user

00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:09,000
so they

00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:12,270
sort of see what what you are all

00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,450
they're editing we have the actual you

00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:17,250
know wysiwyg area where you can actually

00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:19,440
type sort of all the text you want as

00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:22,679
well as as work with the media

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,779
integration or the caption integration

00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:28,470
or whatever and this is all stuff they

00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:30,299
sort of get set up and and hooked in

00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:32,460
just by virtue of sort of turning off da

00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:34,080
police you can upload new files you can

00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:35,610
pull them off the web or you can you can

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,309
pull them from your library of files you

00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:39,510
sort of get them all there which is cool

00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:41,909
you also get the ability to sort of you

00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:43,200
know depending on what kind of settings

00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:45,539
you want you can have an advanced menu

00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,250
or a more basic menu but you get all

00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:50,970
these cool WYSIWYG features and it all

00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:52,590
works sort of relatively securely you

00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:54,539
got that date pop-up which I mentions

00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:56,760
you can have the ability to sort of set

00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:58,049
publishing deadlines for stuff just by

00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:00,960
virtue of having this little JavaScript

00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:03,539
pop-up you have all your sort of you

00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,760
know business logic or config options on

00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:07,860
the the right side of the page so you

00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,690
can actually you know you know decide

00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:15,360
hey I want to put this in the menu and

00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:17,370
and pick where without having to having

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,289
to like you know scroll down the bottom

00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:20,940
find the de clap ssible fieldset get the

00:32:19,289 --> 00:32:22,649
right thing and then we have this save

00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,720
as draft functionality at the bottom

00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:26,850
then instead of making published like a

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,409
checkbox on another a longer list of

00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:30,390
options it becomes a very first class

00:32:28,409 --> 00:32:32,789
kind of operation so if I want to put

00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:34,860
this thing live I can just hit publish

00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:37,110
if I want to save it as a draft state I

00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:39,120
hit save as draft will go ahead and

00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:40,919
publish it just because it's the demo

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,860
but this is something that when you sort

00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:45,149
of do some user testing with different

00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,830
users they very much like the sort of

00:32:45,149 --> 00:32:48,990
click button as being the kind of action

00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:51,570
that would show what they want so this

00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:53,970
is you know just a normal page similar

00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:55,409
to other other ones and we can go ahead

00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:57,690
and customize that if we wanted but

00:32:55,409 --> 00:32:58,799
that's some sort of the experience

00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:00,480
people would get when they when they

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,490
edit you know whatever kind of content

00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,070
you're saying the second thing is these

00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,779
landing pages that are very cool so a

00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:12,360
landing page is something that we can

00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:17,480
see with try the balcony and then we'll

00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:17,480
put a URL about and add it to

00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:21,460
and what this is doing is this is

00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:24,400
actually using a sort of like page

00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:26,380
creation wizard inside CTools that says

00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,240
let's go ahead and make this thing put

00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:30,429
it in the menu and then give us this

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,470
sort of like canvas like approach where

00:33:30,429 --> 00:33:35,590
if I hit customized I don't have one

00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:37,600
area to put in content and we can build

00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:38,740
up a quick page here for you sort of the

00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:44,710
show you what you want so we'll add a

00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:47,140
list of content we'll make it they get

00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:55,620
these content pages let's not do the

00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:55,620
images but let's not do the dates and

00:33:56,309 --> 00:34:06,580
let's do it in reverse post order so go

00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:10,690
ahead and add these items we now have

00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:12,940
some items on the page that and I

00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:15,879
sidebar to it we'll go ahead and add a

00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:17,830
sidebar now if we get customized we have

00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:20,290
the sidebar we can go ahead and add will

00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:24,669
go and add an image because that's sort

00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:28,619
of neat so I had earlier I got make sure

00:34:24,669 --> 00:34:28,619
the Opera House which is great

00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:40,139
nope you don't need to create content

00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:41,429
types or views there's a few the two

00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:43,260
contacts with the content I've we do

00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:45,000
have is a sort of page type that you can

00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:47,159
use and then there are some views that

00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,899
are done is very flexible views that you

00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:51,510
can sort of configure sort of that run

00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:53,250
time and then all of these like pieces

00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:55,919
these aren't nodes these are actual like

00:34:53,250 --> 00:35:01,500
fuel double panel paint entities they

00:34:55,919 --> 00:35:03,180
get established so we'll go ahead and I

00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,770
also make this reusable which is a cool

00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:07,530
demo but ok we'll go ahead and add the

00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:09,270
add the picture and now we have the

00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,859
picture added to the sidebar which is

00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:12,270
which is really useful for an about page

00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:15,330
you might want to show off where you're

00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:18,440
from or what's going on go ahead and add

00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:18,440
go ahead

00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:29,740
and this is this is a sort of cool

00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:32,740
module that is it's a simple gmaps

00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:38,440
module which was basically created just

00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:43,110
to that basically just take like a

00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:47,140
string of where you're where you are and

00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:53,170
then turn it and turn it into an actual

00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:56,200
address so this is San Francisco and we

00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:58,210
now have a map there in just cool let's

00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:02,670
go ahead and change the layout to plate

00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:02,670
will put a three column operation here

00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:06,400
the other thing you'll notice pretty

00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:09,160
quickly is that the actual images

00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:13,510
themselves have some cool responsive

00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:16,000
logic to them so what happens is when

00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:18,130
you sort of move stuff around the images

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,200
will resize to sort of fit their

00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:21,460
appropriate proportions and that becomes

00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,770
really useful because if you actually

00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:25,240
put this onto a mobile phone the layouts

00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:26,650
themselves will condense and then the

00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:30,370
images will condense and you get a

00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:31,990
pretty good like responsive mobile site

00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:33,550
out of the box it's not like a hundred

00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:35,080
percent you know you can sort of break

00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:37,210
it by putting in your own content in

00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:39,100
certain ways like that great framework

00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:41,260
to get up and going with mobile quickly

00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,820
without having to like do a lot of work

00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,680
to get it there you sort of tweaking an

00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:46,060
existing working site then sort of from

00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,920
scratching you like how do I do this and

00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:52,240
trying to figure it out which is pretty

00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:56,410
cool so we built this thing up other

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:58,870
stuff we can add there's um just to sort

00:36:56,410 --> 00:37:00,670
of show you the list of options we can

00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:02,260
add links which is really useful you can

00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,730
add like a list of quick links to your

00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:06,550
site some pretty common thing you have

00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:08,560
deep tabular data which is cool you can

00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:10,090
add an actual video you can add a

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,010
spotlight rotator where you have

00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:14,320
different images that sort of cycle

00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:16,900
between you can add just text which

00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,640
gives you a WYSIWYG or whatever the

00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:20,260
other piece which you'll see is that now

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:22,840
there's this new category in here call

00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:24,490
reusable content so if I make something

00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,440
that I think needs to be like used on

00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:28,450
multiple pages I can actually just go

00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,370
ahead and check that box i did when i

00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:33,820
created that and it'll actually go ahead

00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:35,800
and provide you that you know sort of

00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:37,690
option on any page in your site so now

00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:40,150
that I have this Opera House image

00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:42,010
I can reuse that across the rest of the

00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:43,330
site and that becomes super useful

00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,980
because you can sort of build up a

00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:47,110
library of these things as an end user

00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:49,570
that you can then let other people use

00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:51,190
or configure elsewhere but that you can

00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:53,560
sort of just control by virtue of like

00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:55,510
doing a few options on in the UI and

00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,460
that becomes nice because you might want

00:37:55,510 --> 00:38:05,170
to use say a list of links or image

00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:06,850
elsewhere on your site alright other

00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:08,050
stuff that's sort of cool here so

00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:11,080
there's there's some cool admin

00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:12,910
interfaces that probably will ship with

00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,220
so you can control which layouts you get

00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:17,940
you can control the different pages on

00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:20,710
the site you can look at the different

00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:22,690
configuration options or you can see

00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:25,210
sort of the different items that will

00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:27,610
fill up or not show up and this becomes

00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:29,020
helpful because as an admin or as a

00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:33,360
distribution author you can sort of

00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:33,360
build beautiful stuff yeah

00:38:37,209 --> 00:38:43,369
yeah so the question is on revision so

00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:45,799
the the Opera House image is because

00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:49,309
it's an entity and because it exists in

00:38:45,799 --> 00:38:51,680
this world of of entities that there are

00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:52,609
revisions on those pieces of content the

00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,279
same things true when I actually

00:38:52,609 --> 00:38:57,380
customize the page and change change

00:38:55,279 --> 00:38:59,180
pieces here that's actually because it's

00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:01,759
app analyzer entity that's also saved as

00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:04,249
revisions how those get exposed to users

00:39:01,759 --> 00:39:05,660
is more of a back-end admin deal but the

00:39:04,249 --> 00:39:07,819
framework there because we're leveraging

00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:10,430
this sort of core Drupal concepts and

00:39:07,819 --> 00:39:11,660
already have that kind of and so there's

00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:13,219
been some cool work done with like

00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:15,109
especially panel Iser where people

00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:16,759
actually have sort of future revisions

00:39:15,109 --> 00:39:18,739
that are like you can set up a whole

00:39:16,759 --> 00:39:20,479
thing to schedule in the future and like

00:39:18,739 --> 00:39:22,219
all your whole front page will change or

00:39:20,479 --> 00:39:26,420
your whole whatever page will change is

00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:28,039
very cool but you know you can do a lot

00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:29,239
with this kind of interface and I think

00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:30,769
sort of in terms of the base

00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:32,900
distribution and the point of this talk

00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:34,969
is that like as someone who wants to

00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,619
build a distribution for others giving

00:39:34,969 --> 00:39:38,180
them these kinds of interaction and

00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:40,190
administration patterns are really

00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:41,569
helpful because it lets you break out of

00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:44,109
this sort of light you have to be a

00:39:41,569 --> 00:39:46,339
drupal developer to do something and

00:39:44,109 --> 00:39:48,380
gives you the ability to sort of just to

00:39:46,339 --> 00:39:50,180
be like a smart like thinking content

00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:52,630
editing person and being able to

00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:55,279
understand sort of sort of what happens

00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:58,249
at a great conference I did a version of

00:39:55,279 --> 00:40:00,619
this talk in this in San Diego a couple

00:39:58,249 --> 00:40:01,969
weeks now back and actually talked to

00:40:00,619 --> 00:40:04,009
some folks would use pathway for a lot

00:40:01,969 --> 00:40:05,420
of their sites as a consultancy and they

00:40:04,009 --> 00:40:06,949
actually like they were building stuff

00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:08,390
at every week they do demos that our

00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:09,979
clients and the stuff they build and

00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:11,479
sort of show hey we built you a new page

00:40:09,979 --> 00:40:12,709
or whatever and then are telling me

00:40:11,479 --> 00:40:14,180
about one meeting where they sort of did

00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:15,349
that and then the end of meeting the

00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:17,329
clients were interred Jackson's like

00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:19,699
what can I show you what I bill and like

00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:21,529
they basically went loose like made like

00:40:19,699 --> 00:40:23,449
several of the pages that were TV made

00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:24,920
with this system and we're able to sort

00:40:23,449 --> 00:40:26,209
of put it all in our content rearrange

00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,829
it the way they want and like that's

00:40:26,209 --> 00:40:29,690
really really exciting to me because

00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:31,609
that's like the kind of empowerment and

00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:33,170
the kind of like thing that I think open

00:40:31,609 --> 00:40:34,999
source and sort of a Drupal system

00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:36,289
should be doing for people should be

00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:38,420
giving you if you have good ideas and

00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:39,799
good content the ability just to go out

00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:41,959
and really sort of make something

00:40:39,799 --> 00:40:43,759
awesome happen with that and I think

00:40:41,959 --> 00:40:46,099
something like Napoli is a good good

00:40:43,759 --> 00:40:47,660
sort of direction for that so there's

00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:48,949
some other features in here that sort of

00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,390
I know can definitely show off people

00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:52,190
are interested in but the

00:40:50,390 --> 00:41:05,390
thing for for me is just you get a base

00:40:52,190 --> 00:41:06,980
distribution has some stuff yeah yes so

00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:08,990
the question is say I want to make a

00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:10,789
view slideshow do I have to get figure

00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:12,619
and views first or can it work so

00:41:10,789 --> 00:41:14,900
panoply ships with this spotlight

00:41:12,619 --> 00:41:16,760
functionality that looks a lot like what

00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:19,760
view slideshow will look like it's

00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:22,279
actually it's actually a custom a custom

00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,980
entity type using the jquery cycle

00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:28,400
library it works very much the same so I

00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:31,099
don't have any images that are that are

00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,510
big enough to show you the full on but I

00:41:31,099 --> 00:41:34,130
can try to show you what that interface

00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:37,069
would look like so if you had ads

00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:39,470
spotlight it's basically asking you to

00:41:37,069 --> 00:41:40,700
sort of say give me a title a link to

00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:42,230
where to go in an image and it will

00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,549
actually go do that and no you wouldn't

00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:45,619
have to touch views for that kind of

00:41:43,549 --> 00:41:47,569
thing at all it just would happen within

00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:49,940
this it's also neat because once you

00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:51,470
save it you can go and customize it you

00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,299
can edit all the fields right there

00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:55,400
which is huge if you've ever configure a

00:41:53,299 --> 00:41:57,319
feud slideshow you've got to build like

00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,759
you got to build a node type for it and

00:41:57,319 --> 00:41:59,960
then you've got to make the view for it

00:41:58,759 --> 00:42:01,609
then you have to configure the settings

00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,319
for it and it's just a lot of Drupal

00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:15,470
this is much more straightforward to end

00:42:03,319 --> 00:42:19,250
users yeah yep in this you cannot know

00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:22,549
you cannot reuse it in this but any of

00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:25,160
the images that are saved say you say I

00:42:22,549 --> 00:42:29,319
added that image if I was to go ahead

00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:31,400
and say add a new piece of content

00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:33,410
because that because that image is

00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,319
stored as like a sort of first class

00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:38,660
Drupal file it's in the files table it

00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:39,980
has any kind of like permission you want

00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:41,900
to do around that or virgin you want

00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:45,589
around that is there and I could go

00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:49,009
ahead though and add it use it as part

00:42:45,589 --> 00:42:51,019
of the WYSIWYG so the images there that

00:42:49,009 --> 00:42:53,359
spotlight piece just has a manual upload

00:42:51,019 --> 00:42:55,039
but for most of the stuff that actually

00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:57,529
uses the Drupal file stuff you can

00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:59,180
actually use it there and then having

00:42:57,529 --> 00:43:00,559
this kind of library which media module

00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:02,420
does becomes real helpful for site

00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:04,569
editors the thing to sort of go and run

00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,569
with it

00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:27,830
yeah let me um let me show you that then

00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:29,150
well let me let me run through that and

00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:30,110
then I can show you then we can talk

00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,730
some more about some of properly

00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:33,470
features because i feel i have a few

00:43:31,730 --> 00:43:34,940
slides here at the very end which are

00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:36,620
basically like so how do you build it

00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:39,140
how do you extend it how do you do it so

00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:41,420
I've got a Drupal drupal.org node page

00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:43,640
that sort of tries to explain hey I want

00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:45,290
to use panoply but I want to go and add

00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,480
my own module my own theme what does

00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,680
that look like so to sort of show you

00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:53,120
that off this is just real

00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:54,470
straightforward Zelda graphic for for

00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,120
people who recognize that but to

00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:58,280
actually make a Drupal distribution need

00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:00,800
three things more or less you need an

00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,600
info file it which is just a standard

00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:05,000
list of what modules and dependencies

00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:06,590
you need you need a profile file which

00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:08,510
is some business logic for installing

00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:10,220
the Drupal site and then you need a make

00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:12,440
file which is just the sort of you know

00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:15,080
the recipe logic to put it all together

00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,760
and you can do a lot more than this but

00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:18,710
like at sort of the core you basically

00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:20,780
tell Drupal what modules i'm using how

00:44:18,710 --> 00:44:23,240
to get those modules and then some logic

00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:24,890
on how they get installed so to sort of

00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:28,010
talk about this and how you would add

00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:29,780
your own so I this is more or less

00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:30,950
what's in ponopolis ike additive some

00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:33,140
stuff so it would look right on the

00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:35,150
slide but like in theoretical II and

00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:37,130
conceptually it's it's the same so this

00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:39,320
is what ponopolis info file looks like

00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:40,580
it basically says here's the name of the

00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,320
thing here's the description of thing

00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:44,030
and here's all the different core

00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,530
components that we're going to need so

00:44:44,030 --> 00:44:49,550
this is stuff that's coming from panoply

00:44:45,530 --> 00:44:50,870
in terms of its its modules and you can

00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:52,850
there's like these are all pretty much

00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:54,380
optional like if you're not using search

00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:55,850
you don't have to have ponopolis search

00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:57,350
in your version but if you want to make

00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:59,570
a sub profile you want to use ponopolis

00:44:57,350 --> 00:45:01,280
a base distribution you would sort of

00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:02,720
make your own like this where you're

00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,660
basically changing the name and

00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,550
description for for your purposes leave

00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:09,170
in the panoply stuff and then at the

00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:10,610
bottom you can add your own sort of

00:45:09,170 --> 00:45:12,110
custom stuff so this is where you could

00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:13,970
add let's say you want to use web form

00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:16,010
which is a great module ponopolis and

00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:17,900
use it but a lot of people do say your

00:45:16,010 --> 00:45:20,090
distribution needs it you just go ahead

00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:21,500
and add it to the end or you can go

00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:23,360
ahead and add a custom module you have

00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:26,170
and you just were to add it right then

00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,170
in there yeah

00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:40,010
yeah so the so the question is this

00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:43,130
looks more like working less like it

00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:44,150
inheritance so that there is an issue in

00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:45,799
the drupal issue queue which you're

00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:49,099
probably mentioning that basically

00:45:45,799 --> 00:45:51,500
allows you to sort of do the very

00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:53,299
specific kind of like base base override

00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:55,849
that you would use is for in fema ng in

00:45:53,299 --> 00:45:58,400
for drupal distributions the problem is

00:45:55,849 --> 00:46:00,349
that issue it isn't yet it isn't yet in

00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,030
Drupal 7 and the blocker for that has it

00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:03,170
needs to be in Drupal 8 but the way this

00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:05,450
works and reply it's a little different

00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:08,359
and so whether or not that actually ever

00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:10,789
gets into Drupal 7 is going to be sort

00:46:08,359 --> 00:46:12,619
of an open question so right now the way

00:46:10,789 --> 00:46:14,750
I've sort of structured it with the base

00:46:12,619 --> 00:46:16,339
distribution stuff is to say look like

00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:18,680
let's just keep this real simple right

00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:21,380
let's just require you to like use these

00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:23,119
modules and then that'll be sort of how

00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:24,289
you would actually get get going over if

00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:25,579
you're not really forking it in the

00:46:24,289 --> 00:46:28,160
sense because you're still running all

00:46:25,579 --> 00:46:30,230
this code the same way you're just sort

00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:33,140
of having some ability to customize it

00:46:30,230 --> 00:46:34,700
if and when that patch ever gets in then

00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:36,109
what you can do is all you'd have to do

00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:38,510
is instead of having this part right

00:46:36,109 --> 00:46:40,099
here with all the dependencies you would

00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:42,230
just at the bottom at the top put base

00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:44,089
and you would get that um totally valid

00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:46,190
approach works the same for me it's just

00:46:44,089 --> 00:46:47,930
a question if I wanted to run on a non

00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:49,789
patch version of Drupal core versus

00:46:47,930 --> 00:47:07,069
saying you can use this but you must use

00:46:49,789 --> 00:47:10,430
a patch yeah so yeah so the how often is

00:47:07,069 --> 00:47:12,500
it updated yeah so the modules get

00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:15,619
updated a fair bit in terms of the

00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:17,960
different different process different

00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:19,460
projects that are bundled in and one of

00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:20,750
the cool things is that this is the make

00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,980
files sort of like part two of the

00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:24,230
Trinity you need to do to get these

00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:26,270
things up and running um there's sort of

00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:27,829
business logic when you sort of build a

00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:29,660
version of monopoly they'll actually

00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:32,150
pull in all the dependencies of an

00:47:29,660 --> 00:47:34,220
individual module so if you use panoply

00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:36,049
WYSIWYG it'll go tell you to build

00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:37,990
WYSIWYG module caption filter module

00:47:36,049 --> 00:47:40,210
image resize module and gay

00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:42,010
those in there as virgins get updated

00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:43,600
part of the sort of the maintenance of

00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:45,580
this of the base distribution is to go

00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:47,680
out and get the new version to implement

00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:50,410
it in and then push out a new version of

00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,820
monopoly as a base distro and so there's

00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:53,920
a fair bit of testing and evaluation

00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:55,900
that goes into that and that part of the

00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,330
sort of core folks we're working on

00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,890
panoply they'll go ahead and say let's

00:47:58,330 --> 00:48:01,869
okay we have a new version of this let's

00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:03,400
make sure it works right and so all you

00:48:01,869 --> 00:48:05,800
have to do is a sort of site developer

00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:07,480
if you're using panoply or a distro

00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,770
author is sort of pay attention to that

00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,630
but you sort of get that kind of

00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:12,580
updating and maintenance for free

00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:19,780
basically because you're building on top

00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:21,520
of something else like yes yes you can

00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:22,869
you can update modules as normal if you

00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:24,700
want to go off into your own thing or a

00:48:22,869 --> 00:48:27,160
new version of top play comes out you

00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:28,960
can just ditch the old panoply profile

00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:31,150
directory drop the new one in and then

00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,500
you'll have all up to date once but is

00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:34,300
there's no lock into it you know you can

00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,860
sort of just do as you want with inside

00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:37,420
Drupal and then with inside the make

00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:49,210
file you want to add more stuff you just

00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:50,710
add add stuff there but yeah if you're

00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:53,470
updating so the process of updating

00:48:50,710 --> 00:48:55,540
panoply as a profile is instead of

00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:57,670
updating the entirety of Drupal core you

00:48:55,540 --> 00:49:00,640
can just update the individual directory

00:48:57,670 --> 00:49:02,560
it's / profile / monopoly and then you'd

00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:05,800
opt in all the controls themes and

00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:08,350
libraries that monopoly uses in the case

00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:10,060
where Drupal core self is updated and

00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:12,880
needs to be updated then you would have

00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:14,500
to update that as well but um you get a

00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:22,590
couple options on the Drupal award page

00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:22,590
and what to download yes

00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:41,900
yes oh yeah definitely the easiest way

00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:43,700
to go for is just to have panoply when

00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,020
properly updates you grab stuff that you

00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:48,110
want to help you then you just grab the

00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:49,760
new version you're good to go and any

00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:51,770
distribution and drupal the Lord makes

00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,119
this great because if you've got this

00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:55,160
make file on your distribution

00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:57,410
drupal.org will actually go off and and

00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:59,570
build at the whole downloadable file

00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:01,400
that contains Drupal core and all the

00:49:59,570 --> 00:50:03,110
modules you need as just one download

00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,880
and that's something that is that's a

00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:06,760
pretty straightforward self up to date

00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,750
wait for new version the distribution

00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,400
downloaded through sir bution use it

00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:12,619
there are cases though we're like you

00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,330
have say a security update comes out you

00:50:12,619 --> 00:50:16,730
want to have you know your thing patched

00:50:14,330 --> 00:50:18,080
20 minutes from now like nothing in the

00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:19,700
architecture here is preventing you from

00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:22,400
updating your own modules if you need a

00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:25,910
new version or whatever it just makes it

00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,140
easier to do it that way and that's what

00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:30,110
this make file sort of helps the power

00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:31,460
the third piece of that Trinity just for

00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:34,580
completeness sake is that there is a dot

00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:37,340
profile file there's this bit of logic

00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:38,840
here that is sort of necessary to make

00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:40,520
the properly stuff work it basically

00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:42,980
says turn on dependencies of

00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:44,900
dependencies in our install profile but

00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:46,790
that you can also put a lot of other

00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:48,140
business logic in so if you're making

00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:49,760
your own distribution as a base

00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:51,740
distribution using top is a base

00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,619
distribution and say you want to have a

00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:55,910
single single sign-on setup step you can

00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:57,980
just go ahead and add that in your

00:50:55,910 --> 00:51:00,500
profile and then you'll spin up your

00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:02,660
your product with all the properly stuff

00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:04,369
plus extra stuff you have and those

00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:06,670
three things sort of get you a profile

00:51:04,369 --> 00:51:06,670
yeah

00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:27,030
oh yeah absolutely absolutely i mean i

00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:30,359
think and part of the the cool logic

00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:32,250
here is that um in terms of this piece

00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:34,650
this is also a patch that's that's

00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:35,910
against Drupal core if it was to go in

00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:38,580
which would to make these dependencies

00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:39,900
stuff manage that's something that since

00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:41,700
it probably won't going serves a lot of

00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:44,160
complex around that all we're doing is

00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:46,290
offloading the actual business logic for

00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,150
how to do this into a separate file

00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:49,830
that's in the module so as long as

00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:51,960
you're installing properly core and

00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:53,280
you're calling it all the updates that

00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:54,930
you're happy they're happening to that

00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:57,450
like business logic are happening in

00:51:54,930 --> 00:51:59,609
this um panoply core profile link file

00:51:57,450 --> 00:52:01,650
so yeah you would run into problems if

00:51:59,609 --> 00:52:02,940
you change this but you're not in a

00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:05,010
situation where you have to like

00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:06,930
maintain any sort of diff between what

00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:09,119
Papa Lee's doing what you're doing that

00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:10,590
there isn't a there isn't a connection

00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,180
that has to happen beyond this and even

00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:13,859
this is ultimately optional if you

00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:16,109
define all the modules that you want in

00:52:13,859 --> 00:52:17,820
your info file but the important thing

00:52:16,109 --> 00:52:19,440
is that you're not you don't have to

00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:21,599
work against an upstream you sort of

00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:30,240
just like run with the controls the

00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:31,410
propyl he has and you're good to go yeah

00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,730
I mean we wouldn't we wouldn't change

00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:34,890
probably got profile in any way that

00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:37,619
would break we have like I do hard coat

00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:41,160
it to have west coast time that could

00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:43,170
potentially change but no I mean there's

00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:44,940
the whole point of base distribution is

00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:47,280
that we don't want to have situations

00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:48,510
where people do have to do get stuck on

00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,490
their own that they should use the

00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:52,920
modules and the different details here

00:52:50,490 --> 00:52:54,270
ought to make their distributions but

00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:58,410
then can sort of go on their own on

00:52:54,270 --> 00:53:00,480
merry way so there's um much folks are

00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:02,280
using it sort of right now the there's a

00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,470
couple Drupal products open academy in

00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:07,200
open atrium they're both having versions

00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:08,550
that are stuff with panoply base over

00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:10,619
the cavities out now you can take a look

00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:12,330
at how this stuff works and HR n is

00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:14,220
being worked on for drupal 7 should be

00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:15,660
ready by drupalcon portland and that'll

00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,130
be great cuz i love open nature meetings

00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:18,570
one of the best drupal products and

00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:21,060
really addresses a large market of

00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:23,010
people having ponopolis for that dragon

00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:25,200
real stuff is very cool and then in the

00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:26,760
sort of university space UC berkeley

00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,920
uses it for a lot of their sort of

00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,300
campus sites and the government of

00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:32,550
canada uses it for a lot of their

00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:33,990
federal government sites and they sort

00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:35,759
of take this base distribution approach

00:53:33,990 --> 00:53:37,619
and have plenty of their own

00:53:35,759 --> 00:53:39,749
quirements on top of it but really get

00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:43,199
you in a place where you can actually do

00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:47,519
for the cool cool cool extra stuff on

00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:49,109
your own so yeah I mean that's you can

00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:51,479
get it just two terms of checking it out

00:53:49,109 --> 00:53:52,619
see dribble or gets available and

00:53:51,479 --> 00:53:54,539
there's a new version out that what's in

00:53:52,619 --> 00:53:56,099
the screenshot but you can read I got

00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:58,499
there's a bunch of documentation around

00:53:56,099 --> 00:54:00,119
what's going on and so you know you can

00:53:58,499 --> 00:54:02,099
get the downloads and check out the code

00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:03,449
you'll have to install it but it's just

00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:05,009
the same kind installation as drupal

00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:06,989
normal I'm although you might want to

00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:08,099
put a little more memory into it but you

00:54:06,989 --> 00:54:11,880
can read there's a bunch of the base

00:54:08,099 --> 00:54:15,439
distribution stuff on here to learn how

00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:18,209
to sort of do that and there's also the

00:54:15,439 --> 00:54:19,829
Pantheon or where I work you can get the

00:54:18,209 --> 00:54:21,709
ability if you sign up for a Pantheon

00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:23,999
account which is free you can install

00:54:21,709 --> 00:54:25,859
get created new site and you can

00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:27,599
obviously pick Drupal core as a new site

00:54:25,859 --> 00:54:28,979
you could also pick monopoly and you'll

00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,599
spin up a whole version of what I showed

00:54:28,979 --> 00:54:33,719
you so you can play around with it which

00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:35,819
is which is pretty useful other than

00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:37,889
that definitely definitely interested in

00:54:35,819 --> 00:54:40,619
some questions and I can go back to sort

00:54:37,889 --> 00:54:42,899
of sort of my larger demo but i'm very

00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:43,859
curious sort of how people how they're

00:54:42,899 --> 00:54:45,659
seeing themselves using base

00:54:43,859 --> 00:54:47,339
distributions questions about some of

00:54:45,659 --> 00:54:49,709
the functionality and propylene or other

00:54:47,339 --> 00:55:03,749
stuff and will maybe start the front

00:54:49,709 --> 00:55:05,819
work back gotcha so in terms of the how

00:55:03,749 --> 00:55:08,819
it compared to spark so sparks also a

00:55:05,819 --> 00:55:12,389
base distribution more or less it you

00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:14,489
know in it it's set up to sort of make

00:55:12,389 --> 00:55:16,439
content editing better um it's very much

00:55:14,489 --> 00:55:18,689
focused in terms of a lot of its it's

00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:20,459
sort of push right now on getting sort

00:55:18,689 --> 00:55:22,229
of Drupal 8 in the right place so a lot

00:55:20,459 --> 00:55:23,699
of the Drupal 7 stuff was sort of proof

00:55:22,229 --> 00:55:25,619
of concept to show how Drupal 8 will

00:55:23,699 --> 00:55:27,319
work a lot of thats being cleaned up and

00:55:25,619 --> 00:55:29,669
pushed out as sort of formal releases

00:55:27,319 --> 00:55:32,130
spark stuff so more interested in this

00:55:29,669 --> 00:55:34,319
sort of edit in-place kind of

00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:36,899
functionality on a field level so it's

00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:38,339
not giving you this kind of like chrome

00:55:36,899 --> 00:55:39,749
the like sort of drag and drop like

00:55:38,339 --> 00:55:41,339
whole areas around its not trying to

00:55:39,749 --> 00:55:43,139
standardize all the components together

00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:45,179
and it's very much geared towards more

00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:46,979
of a Drupal 8 kind of environment where

00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:48,740
this is working in Drupal 7 and the

00:55:46,979 --> 00:55:49,970
Drupal 8 version of this

00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:52,100
is going to try to keep more of this

00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:53,540
sort of like in place editing kind of

00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:55,340
experience this is where this is where I

00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:57,260
feel it's really the key value kenapa

00:55:55,340 --> 00:56:00,170
leah is integrating everything like this

00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:02,000
and that serve as a difference in terms

00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:03,910
of difference with node stream sonos

00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,170
dream is a also based distribution

00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:08,150
maintained by wonder crowd that they

00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:11,360
useful other internal projects and a lot

00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:14,200
of other folks use it that is that's

00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:16,730
more of AI think in-house kind of intro

00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:19,340
distribution just because what it's it's

00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:21,110
set up in a somewhat complicated way and

00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:22,970
is less focused on sort of the end user

00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:25,400
kind of drag and drop and more as a good

00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:27,080
developer starting point which if you're

00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:28,880
if you're getting into being a good

00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,320
drupal developer you can get a lot of

00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,840
value out of downloading node stream

00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:34,460
working with it but it's not as much set

00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,930
up to hand off the end user that would

00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:38,180
ponopolis trying to do is be a base

00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:39,500
distro for products that you can hand

00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:47,000
off to someone who can configure

00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:49,940
independent of of that code yeah yeah so

00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,680
um yes so Pavel plays well a it's

00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:53,660
we had some we have another people

00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:55,250
trying it out and we put some patches in

00:56:53,660 --> 00:57:05,390
so it will install with drush and that's

00:56:55,250 --> 00:57:07,700
sort of a gordoo yeah so question is

00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:09,890
using it with organic groups I've done a

00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,990
little bit open atrium is using it

00:57:09,890 --> 00:57:13,730
extensively with organic groups and

00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:14,869
there was a couple patches we pushed up

00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:17,720
to make sure that that worked with the

00:57:14,869 --> 00:57:19,700
panel Iser context but um I check out

00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:21,830
their development stuff to get a better

00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:23,540
view but as far as I know it was more or

00:57:21,830 --> 00:57:26,180
less smooth sailing once they got past a

00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:29,840
few initial quirks and yeah and works

00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:31,040
just fine yeah absolutely absolutely

00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,790
mean a lot of the philosophy with

00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,290
monopoly is that we're not really

00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:34,760
changing all of what Drupal does we're

00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:37,130
just using the entity system and

00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:39,410
providing optionality so if you can make

00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:41,300
a page in Drupal that doesn't use any of

00:57:39,410 --> 00:57:42,859
the stuff if you want it just gives you

00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:48,520
the option to use it because it's a

00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:48,520
little better friend users yeah yes

00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:02,619
yeah so a question is of the layouts if

00:58:00,729 --> 00:58:04,119
there's a lot let's let's lock it down

00:58:02,619 --> 00:58:06,219
yes there is a there's a land

00:58:04,119 --> 00:58:08,170
administration page and it gives you a

00:58:06,219 --> 00:58:11,199
list of all of them you can enable or

00:58:08,170 --> 00:58:14,920
disable them depending on what you want

00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:17,019
and that provides you with with that

00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:18,429
kind of flexibility you can also there's

00:58:17,019 --> 00:58:19,660
also some patches in the panel's queue

00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:21,400
to actually allow you to do this on a

00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:23,259
per node basis if you want or with more

00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:25,479
fine-grained control but just for the

00:58:23,259 --> 00:58:27,789
interface we're trying to get you more

00:58:25,479 --> 00:58:29,769
sort of enable or disable for the whole

00:58:27,789 --> 00:58:38,679
site but yeah you can definitely lock

00:58:29,769 --> 00:58:41,619
that down other questions yeah yeah so

00:58:38,679 --> 00:58:43,029
questions on performance i would say

00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:45,609
that like ponopolis not doing anything

00:58:43,029 --> 00:58:47,829
that drastically different than sort of

00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:50,529
drupal plus a few bus the modules that

00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:52,900
we have the lot of this sort of like

00:58:50,529 --> 00:58:57,249
magical code in Drupal is actually done

00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:58,989
with with for this for more of an admin

00:58:57,249 --> 00:59:00,429
thing so I mean sometimes there's a

00:58:58,989 --> 00:59:03,130
little delay so in the admin screens but

00:59:00,429 --> 00:59:04,569
that's that may or may not be related in

00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:06,519
terms of the performance I think the

00:59:04,569 --> 00:59:07,989
biggest problem with performance that

00:59:06,519 --> 00:59:09,549
you're going to see with panoply site

00:59:07,989 --> 00:59:11,769
similar how you see the panel's site

00:59:09,549 --> 00:59:14,619
isn't anything about the code execution

00:59:11,769 --> 00:59:16,449
path it's more about how extendable it

00:59:14,619 --> 00:59:18,579
makes people allow them to build sites

00:59:16,449 --> 00:59:20,529
so like it's so easy just to like a de

00:59:18,579 --> 00:59:22,569
like a list of items and sort it by this

00:59:20,529 --> 00:59:24,549
and you can really make complex pages

00:59:22,569 --> 00:59:26,499
and that will create performance issues

00:59:24,549 --> 00:59:27,880
not because of the specific code but

00:59:26,499 --> 00:59:29,979
just because it lets you build a lot of

00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:31,150
stuff real easy but in terms of the

00:59:29,979 --> 00:59:32,949
performance stuff like I've definitely

00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:34,029
done the profiling of it and stuff

00:59:32,949 --> 00:59:35,259
there's nothing that's there's nothing

00:59:34,029 --> 00:59:36,640
that's happening here that's any

00:59:35,259 --> 00:59:39,759
different than the normal drupal site

00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:45,299
with the modules it has and its can be

00:59:39,759 --> 00:59:45,299
pretty fast if you want it to be yeah

00:59:54,920 --> 01:00:00,360
yes so the question is on cropping

00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:02,220
images are there the only thing that's

01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:03,960
built in right now is there's this image

01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:06,690
resize filter where you can actually

01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:08,070
adjust above and you can adjust like

01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:10,050
sort of the size of an image and that

01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:11,790
will resize but you don't have any

01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:13,740
ability to make judgments about what to

01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:16,530
show it's simply simply a size issue um

01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:19,350
there are several solutions in the in

01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:21,470
Drupal 7 gland that will do things like

01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:24,030
that I played around with them there's

01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:26,100
positives and minuses on both so I

01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:27,660
there's it's been an issue queue for a

01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:29,960
while and people the announcer ideas but

01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:32,730
there's nothing that i think is works

01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:34,980
sufficiently stable e to have it be

01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:37,650
included but it's you can do all these

01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:39,420
image like fields or just image fields

01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:41,460
you can you add additional ways to work

01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:45,330
with that if you want it just doesn't

01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:47,780
anything out of the box for it other

01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:47,780
questions yeah

01:00:58,469 --> 01:01:02,349
yeah sure so the question here is to

01:01:01,089 --> 01:01:04,059
tell you how do you write create themes

01:01:02,349 --> 01:01:06,099
with this stuff so I think an important

01:01:04,059 --> 01:01:08,019
design philosophy here is it all what

01:01:06,099 --> 01:01:09,910
this is responsive Arctic as a theme so

01:01:08,019 --> 01:01:11,859
it gets responsive stuff but all panoply

01:01:09,910 --> 01:01:14,499
is really concerned about is the content

01:01:11,859 --> 01:01:16,630
content variable in your theme so you

01:01:14,499 --> 01:01:18,819
can pop in any arbitrary theme onto the

01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:20,529
site and a work you're just sort of only

01:01:18,819 --> 01:01:22,660
having the content stuff be controlled

01:01:20,529 --> 01:01:24,489
by ponopolis and the layouts themselves

01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:26,859
will only work in the content content

01:01:24,489 --> 01:01:28,630
region right so you can't change the top

01:01:26,859 --> 01:01:30,579
the header or any of those things with

01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:32,130
those layouts so by that virtue you

01:01:30,579 --> 01:01:36,130
could sort of have that sort of exists

01:01:32,130 --> 01:01:37,689
on its own and you can have alternate

01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:40,329
layouts for the rest of your site there

01:01:37,689 --> 01:01:41,589
are a couple cool integrations including

01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:43,269
the radix theme which is probably the

01:01:41,589 --> 01:01:45,579
best of this to take tutor bootstrap and

01:01:43,269 --> 01:01:47,559
apply it to to this stuff and then you

01:01:45,579 --> 01:01:48,910
can actually go go change it and and

01:01:47,559 --> 01:01:50,259
make that all work really well but

01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:51,880
theming is really straightforward

01:01:50,259 --> 01:01:53,499
there's a dock page on it but it's

01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:56,049
basically like do your normal drupal

01:01:53,499 --> 01:01:58,059
theme just be aware that we're doing

01:01:56,049 --> 01:01:59,589
responsive stuff this way and that you

01:01:58,059 --> 01:02:02,459
want to leave the content variable own

01:01:59,589 --> 01:02:06,509
you're fine you're fine works just fine

01:02:02,459 --> 01:02:06,509
other ? yeah

01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:19,200
cessful system yeah so questions on

01:02:17,070 --> 01:02:20,640
running a CRM as far as I know no

01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,570
problem I mean there's nothing that

01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:23,820
we're doing architectural that would

01:02:21,570 --> 01:02:25,109
prevent that you'd have to install it it

01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:26,880
doesn't you don't get any help along

01:02:25,109 --> 01:02:36,869
that way but it's not in any way blocked

01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:38,550
and likely yeah if you can get access to

01:02:36,869 --> 01:02:40,710
the content you can expose it in pan

01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:41,940
monopoly and then you could probably I'd

01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:44,190
be curious to see if someone did do that

01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:45,690
like how that would work but as far as i

01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:47,849
know that should be relatively I

01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:52,260
straightforward as getting cities set up

01:02:47,849 --> 01:02:59,970
in the first places I maybe one more

01:02:52,260 --> 01:03:01,410
question yeah um yes it doesn't turn

01:02:59,970 --> 01:03:04,170
block module is not enabled by default

01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:06,660
you can turn it on um block says as a

01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:09,000
concept is more or less I mean the word

01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:10,470
block is existing in Drupal 8 but a lot

01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:12,270
of what I'm showing you now this is also

01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:13,650
part of the philosophy topolice a lot of

01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:15,630
it ponopolis trying to do is give you

01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:17,910
the kind of stuff that's in Drupal 8 but

01:03:15,630 --> 01:03:19,770
you could have panoply now that you can

01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:21,630
have the ability to create these like

01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:23,310
smart blocks which you know which

01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:25,200
rubellite will have that look more like

01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:27,300
the plug-in system chaos tools is using

01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,609
a less like block module that you can

01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:30,720
have the kind of like you know

01:03:28,609 --> 01:03:32,310
responsive and drag and drop stuff the

01:03:30,720 --> 01:03:33,960
admin interfaces in the woods new wig

01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:35,880
and you can get a lot of these pieces

01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:37,500
right now and a lot of the road map for

01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:39,599
panoply is saying okay like here's what

01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:41,940
people need in d7 let's make that work

01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:43,920
awesome for distros in d7 then when

01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:45,450
Drupal 8 world let's go take the stuff

01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,820
that won't be in Drupal 8 make sure that

01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:50,070
get keeps improperly but let Drupal core

01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:51,630
do as much of that work as possible so

01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:53,460
definitely things like blocks we're

01:03:51,630 --> 01:03:54,720
trying to get rid of because that's the

01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:57,240
way blocks to have worked up through

01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:58,650
Drupal 7 are very limited and don't

01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:00,420
really give you that kind of

01:03:58,650 --> 01:04:01,830
functionality you can see we can add an

01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:04,410
image give it a style and throw it on

01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:05,820
there and yeah so in general we're

01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:07,200
trying to monopolise create a strong

01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:09,540
base distribution that a lot of people

01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:11,250
can use provide you a lot of features

01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:13,369
right now that are really useful and

01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:16,170
make it super straightforward to extend

01:04:13,369 --> 01:04:19,609
for your own products and stuff so thank

01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:19,609
you all for listening check it out

01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:25,500
and I'll be wants to use it or player

01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:28,940
Altidore beer a less of the conference
