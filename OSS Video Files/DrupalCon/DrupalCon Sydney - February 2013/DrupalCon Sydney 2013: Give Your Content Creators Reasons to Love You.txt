Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Give Your Content Creators Reasons to Love You
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	Easy & Intuitive are two words that usually don't go together with content creation. Generally our content creators have to bend over backwards to understand how Drupal (or us Devs) built their site. This results in longer training, slower uptake of the flexibility of Drupal, forgetting what goes where and potentially -- less usage of the CMS and less fresh content.

This is not an ideal situation.

In this session I will present a number of techniques and best practices that us Developers can implement quickly and effectively. The aim of course is to remove that complexity that creates a very real barrier between the actual content owners and their usage of Drupal.

I will demo techniques and will highlight a number of real-world sites that I have built that employ some of these techniques.

Some of the topics covered:

Advanced content layout techniques
Creating intuitive User Interfaces for your content creators
Taxonomy driven layouts
Faceted search
Some of the modules covered:

Bean
Context
Views
Facet API

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
summed up and now I know there's a lot

00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,879
more to it but in terms of user

00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,189
experience for creating content there's

00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:10,679
finding editing and placing so of course

00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:12,269
finding again Drupal doesn't people has

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:15,179
kind of basic administration screen

00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:17,220
which you know well it's helpful it

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,050
doesn't really answer a lot of the needs

00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,270
of you know we're really wanting to get

00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,640
the content that's somebody created

00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:26,010
finding it was easily editing the

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,490
traditional node forms can be tricky at

00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:32,640
best they can be 18 screens long and I

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:35,040
think for normal people it's it's

00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,270
daunting there's lots of tower there's

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,250
lots of forms there's lots of fields

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,960
there's lots of little help things

00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:42,629
there's the wonderful little sort of

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,309
WYSIWYG HTML drop-down below the editor

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,850
interface that just looks ugly and

00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:52,440
lastly placing content can also be quite

00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:55,440
tricky with most triple sites so how do

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,850
we make krupal better well I'll talk

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,309
about a little bit of a tech but I'll

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,750
try to keep it to a minimum basically I

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:02,309
want to show sort of patterns and

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,680
practices of things that we can do to

00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:07,200
again improve the usability of a Drupal

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,820
site for the editing of content and

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,590
there will be a little bit of tech talk

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,140
but I'll try to keep it to a minimum so

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,830
I show of hands is there are any

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,840
developer slanted people in the room

00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:23,549
okay so a decent amount and more of

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:27,600
content sites builders it's a good good

00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:29,640
mix yeah I really wanted to aim the talk

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,270
really I sort of best practice content

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,070
workflow and the reason I sort of can

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:36,570
say best practices I've worked with a

00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,530
lot of very large scale projects and

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,110
I've worked with a lot of really good

00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,240
teams doing really good stuff so it's

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,770
not just necessarily my viewpoint but

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,810
it's sort of working across the last six

00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,780
or seven years on quite large scale

00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:51,090
projects you know hun 10 users 100 users

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,630
5 users using the system and millions of

00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,130
people viewing the site and I'd also

00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,140
like to make it interactive as well so

00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,020
you know stop me at any time ask me

00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,850
questions say I'm wrong say I'm glad my

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,670
ideas are full of crap I'm happy to hear

00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,469
that just let me know so stop me anytime

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,560
please oh there will be time at the end

00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:11,780
for questions but and lastly the the

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,910
main thing is you know

00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,230
demand more from the developers in the

00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:16,819
room or the developers that are working

00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,110
in your site because there are some

00:02:16,819 --> 00:02:20,030
things that can be done that aren't that

00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,430
difficult but do make a tremendous

00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,780
difference and you don't the hat core

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,830
you don't do anything crazy and

00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,990
basically everything i'm going to show

00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:28,819
you is a contributed module some of them

00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:32,150
are in different states some of them

00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:34,520
aren't fully released yet so first off

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:37,520
I'd like to focus on finding of the

00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,050
findability of content so essentially

00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,030
we've got I've got two main items here

00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,950
so there's workflow and then searching

00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:45,380
and browsing so workflow is and when I

00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:48,290
when a content editor rocks up and

00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,790
starts to want to do something how do

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:52,340
they do that how do we effectively make

00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,410
it easy for them to first off find what

00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,090
they need to do and do it again Drupal

00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,170
sort of has many different paths and

00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:59,000
generally you can go to the content

00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,860
admin screen or you know that there's no

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:07,610
really central point of reference for a

00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:09,890
user to focus in on that so generally

00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,870
you know they might might begin on the

00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:14,540
regular administration screen which

00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,950
isn't very useful and in that i'll be

00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,410
switching back forth between lots of

00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:22,430
tabs so sorry for that but there's this

00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:24,049
really nice module called workbench that

00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:26,090
module essentially what it does it kind

00:03:24,049 --> 00:03:28,940
of creates a user landing page for that

00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,950
editor here's the administer

00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:32,120
administrator of the site and you can

00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,790
see they're basically there recently and

00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:37,160
edited content over here and it shows

00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:39,230
you the type if it's published or not

00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,400
and when it was last updated and then

00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,410
down here you can see just the overall

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,540
content of the site and these are all

00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:46,310
views so they're all fully customizable

00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:48,560
you can create essentially any sort of

00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:51,350
tabs and it also integrates really well

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,420
with the workflow workbench workflow so

00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,769
that you can say like I want to see my

00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,150
content that is waiting to be published

00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:58,040
I want to see my content that is in

00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,540
review and so on and so forth and

00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,030
there's just additional tabs at the top

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,910
for that so again it gives a nice

00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:07,579
landing page you just essentially you go

00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:09,200
to my workbench they can you can

00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:11,690
actually make a user's landing page as

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,329
soon as they log in and it does a nice

00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:16,310
really concise point of reference for

00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:17,570
for that user and then there's also a

00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:18,769
nice little tab over here for creating

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,599
content so anything they're allowed to

00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:22,840
create they can not quickly then create

00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:22,840
new content

00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:30,230
you know so that's now gets cut to

00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,610
searching and browsing and that's the

00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,889
other kind of sore spot I think and

00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:36,320
that's the one area where you can make

00:04:33,889 --> 00:04:38,690
immediate benefits for our for end users

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,380
in the traditional Drupal content

00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:46,370
finding screen is pretty law I mean it

00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:47,810
allows you to try to find I've got the

00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,400
good ones i want to show you everyone's

00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,370
seen a bad one I sure i'll just skip to

00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,889
the convoy here's one that's called

00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:57,650
enterprise base what this does is it

00:04:54,889 --> 00:05:00,200
allows essentially a customizable entry

00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:02,030
point to content and you can essentially

00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,460
at any any fields that you want that's

00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:06,290
pertinent to the to the content traders

00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,750
so we've got the you know the normal

00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:10,040
published promoted and sticky but the

00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,740
other nice thing is author so there's a

00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:16,400
nice autocomplete for author in there

00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:18,200
and help everything this means so you

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,690
can also do contains and then there's a

00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,310
nice little drop down for tags so a user

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,860
can say I'm looking for all my content

00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:26,990
that is tagged as cartoon click on

00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,950
filter and immediately you can see and

00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,950
you can also see you can actually

00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:32,960
customize the actual results so you get

00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:35,210
a nice image there which again it helps

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,740
visually to see what the content is so

00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:38,720
it's quite a vast improvement over the

00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:40,039
you know it's subtle in some ways but it

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,169
is quite a vast improvement over the

00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:44,060
traditional way where you get to click

00:05:42,169 --> 00:05:46,669
one thing at a time to view the results

00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,500
and you get no matter what content type

00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:50,510
you have it all looks the same and it's

00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:53,570
hard to actually find out what that is

00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:55,850
and this miss module again also has

00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:58,160
these really nice features so that again

00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,630
it's available you know through drop

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,580
downs and things but you can say okay

00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:05,270
I'm just interested in articles from

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:07,220
myself I'm just interested in the city

00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,050
do we have any have a lot of content

00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,820
sorry I mean been interested in events

00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,289
that i've created and so immediately you

00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,419
can just drill down to the content

00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:19,910
that's relevant to me or any anybody

00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:22,010
else and find it quite easily the

00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:27,380
question was what's the module name and

00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:28,780
the answer is enterprise base enterprise

00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:32,139
underscore base i think it was what

00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:33,880
and it was created by level 10 and it's

00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:35,860
still in a beta form but really what it

00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,440
is it's a prepackaged set of views that

00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:41,350
override the traditional content screens

00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,630
and the nice thing is as well as you can

00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,490
actually customize this the results /

00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:47,770
content type so for events it might be

00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,990
more more you have you know the event

00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,100
date and maybe load that location or

00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:53,050
anything that's relevant to that

00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,970
specific content type because in general

00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:56,620
users tend to I mean developers think of

00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:57,910
everything that's a node with fields and

00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,710
everything's the same and you know it's

00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,150
all think everything's wonderful but

00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,410
real people think of them has actually

00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,720
different pieces of content there's an

00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:07,180
event there is an article there's a blog

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,760
post and it allows you to more easily

00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,890
find that content so yeah this is a

00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,840
great module it's not it's not released

00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:20,140
there's not a full release yet but I

00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:21,820
think it's quite close views book

00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,660
operations it ought ments it you

00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,090
actually need to have usable

00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,400
cooperations in it what did you can do

00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,330
all this stuff if you're a developer or

00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,310
if you've got developers you can

00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,660
actually do this quite easily it really

00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,820
it's just a number of like I said

00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:37,030
prepackaged views that integrates with

00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:38,260
views block operations and here's the

00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:41,560
fuse blow up operations you can add

00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:47,140
different ones but but yeah it's sort of

00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:49,090
a prepackaged version so the question

00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,000
was how is this different from views

00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:53,860
bulk operations and views bulk

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,010
operations for people are familiar are a

00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:58,390
way of basically adding custom things to

00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:01,030
this drop-down menu and then being able

00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:02,830
to perform it over your content so they

00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:06,280
might you might have a custom workflow

00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:09,310
that says take all these nodes and send

00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,490
them to so-and-so for review and things

00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,490
like that

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,880
yeah and I was going to ask to like I

00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,199
would imagine you know if I asked the

00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,960
question of what do you think of

00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,360
Drupal's in like built-in view sort of

00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,220
content administration functions what

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:36,800
sort of answers i would get so and if

00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:36,800
anybody wants to chime up yeah

00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:46,820
yeah yeah kind of yeah you use your site

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,640
to find your content I was working on a

00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:52,940
fairly large project actually last year

00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:54,350
with it's quite a large site and there

00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:58,730
was a point where there was going to be

00:08:54,350 --> 00:09:01,060
a demo to the company to for them to

00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:03,230
actually get introduced to Drupal and

00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:05,210
again this is where the developers you

00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:09,230
know weren't showing you love basically

00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:11,180
half hour for the on-site demo we sort

00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:13,940
of whacked up a few quick views and

00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:16,100
things like that in using use block

00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,870
operation few other things just to get

00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,090
rid of because we know that everyone

00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:22,250
hates the built in Drupal administration

00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:24,860
we've never had a client like it and

00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,660
it's not intuitive and it basically

00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:30,200
people kind of just kind of thing well

00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:32,630
this is it so again I'm very guilty of

00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,750
all these things and hopefully trying to

00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:37,160
get better at them so my name is David

00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,680
and yeah here we go here's the built in

00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,840
Drupal screen so you know everything is

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,240
quite painful you can only do one thing

00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:46,340
at a time you can't you can't type any

00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,010
search features in there you can sort by

00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:54,680
tag author and things like that so it's

00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:56,990
a you know quite limited okay that

00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:58,490
brings us to the second of the three

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:01,520
things editing so how can we improve

00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:03,770
drupal's editing abilities again you

00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:06,860
know the whole node edit tab thing again

00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:10,490
it sort of makes sense but at the same

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:12,290
time I think it leads a lot to the

00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:14,240
imagination in terms of you know the

00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,860
disconnect between you know and I think

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,440
with Drupal 7 and the overlay they tried

00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,570
to sort of improve that a little bit but

00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,560
I think they kind of didn't hit the

00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:23,330
target you know I think they thought

00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:24,890
that by having an overlay and having

00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,910
that appear on the screen that if people

00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,910
would feel a little bit disconnected

00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:30,770
from what they were doing but I think it

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,360
didn't work and we we always turn it off

00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:36,380
and people don't like it it slows down

00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:38,630
the site so there's a case of you know

00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,100
and overlay it's sort of a an idea that

00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:41,960
didn't work out well so what are some

00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,300
other things that we can do so one thing

00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:46,280
is is to take the the node edit screen

00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:47,660
itself the content edit screen it should

00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,930
say and make it less cluttered and more

00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:49,930
intuitive

00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:54,519
oh yeah here we go here's an example of

00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:56,769
a traditional I'm sure everyone here has

00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:58,240
seen this where is title tags body and

00:10:56,769 --> 00:11:00,850
basically even the most simple content

00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,380
type have is 18 screens long and it's

00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,269
just bit really ridiculous and here's

00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,649
the second part of it and they did make

00:11:04,269 --> 00:11:08,829
it a little bit shorter by putting in

00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:11,019
the the tabbed thing so that was kind of

00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:13,389
came around in six and seven but again

00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:15,399
you know it's it's not very intuitive it

00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:18,790
doesn't really you know kind of cut it

00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:20,949
so one thing that's kind of coming out

00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:24,190
is monopoly which is a distribution of

00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:26,380
Drupal and it's sort of a an entire best

00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:28,660
practice way of building a site from

00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:31,180
from start to finish from the back end

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,800
so how to better find content how to

00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,660
better edit content it had a better

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,800
place content and it's not quite

00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,750
finished and I think there's actually a

00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,029
talk later on today about monopoly which

00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,680
I would recommend everyone to go to if

00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:45,579
they're interested but it's a really

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,920
brilliant system I think of phase two is

00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:50,860
working on that sorry let me go to my

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,930
browser here and yeah so here you can

00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,459
see very traditional edit screen you

00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:56,860
know you've got it's just it just goes

00:11:54,459 --> 00:11:58,870
on and on and on and on and it's just

00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,459
quite mind-numbing and doesn't really

00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,760
make sense so how can you make that

00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:05,139
better well here's ponopolis basically

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,819
we've got multi columns it looks a lot

00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:09,010
more like WordPress which is quite nice

00:12:06,819 --> 00:12:11,500
we got permalink we can edit the title

00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:13,029
there we don't have to repeat title I

00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,860
think people know that and I think

00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:17,709
people know that this is a body and they

00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:20,319
don't have to have that you know the

00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:21,880
huge block of text below that explains

00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:25,060
over and over and over over over again

00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,490
what what you're doing so I think you

00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,779
can there should be a little I got it

00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:30,880
already button here something like that

00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:32,350
you know so it's like yeah thank you

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:38,170
thank you thank you for telling me that

00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:40,500
go away now please and there that's

00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,500
what's that

00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:44,940
displace me I'll touch on that later on

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,500
actually display sweet is more on the on

00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,900
the visual front end of things and how

00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:55,980
to make your content shape it a little

00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:57,810
bit better so this yeah yep III will

00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,760
cover displaced wait a little bit in the

00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:04,140
upcoming but I don't really talk about

00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:06,420
it in terms of that coming back to

00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:08,790
kenapa Lee and they've also sort of re

00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,620
architected some of the other ideas and

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,030
this is Drupal 7 so this they basically

00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,400
taken a lot of the ideas from triple-a

00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:15,810
and then backported them so Drupal 8 is

00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,070
going to look a lot like this and so a

00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:18,420
lot of the really cool stuff is

00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,130
happening in Drupal 8 which sucks

00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,780
because Drupal a it's not gonna be ready

00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,370
until its realize be said and so maybe

00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:26,460
later this year or when it's ready and

00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:27,930
even then when it's released you know

00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,250
it's maybe I can be stable people aren't

00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:31,140
gonna launch it and probably maybe until

00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:34,380
mid next year when people really start

00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:36,090
to use it so it's not it's not helpful

00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:39,090
whereas they taken a lot of features

00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:41,940
from Drupal 8 and and back part of them

00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:45,030
to to Drupal 7 so this is essentially a

00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:46,320
suite of modules in a distribution so

00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:47,670
you can actually if you have a

00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,930
pre-existing site you can actually bring

00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:51,060
a lot of the stuff into your existing

00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:52,860
site and really clean up the experience

00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,240
so again you know we've got things like

00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,120
featured image well you know like rather

00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,290
than here's the traditional screen you

00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,140
know here's my featured image its way

00:13:58,290 --> 00:14:02,550
down here and you know there's really no

00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:05,070
again it's quite disconnected from how

00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,750
you might think of your content and that

00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:09,510
backhand panoply you got it way at the

00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,800
top you know you images bigger alt text

00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:12,570
is really prominent and all the other

00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,520
things that are hidden which is quite

00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,720
nice and then many options you know

00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,760
that's an important thing you know it's

00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:21,480
very down in the in the traditional

00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,830
screen into a tab right here and as

00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,000
developing provide many link and then

00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,430
look at that it's just you know a

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,040
thousand options it's just you know wait

00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:31,830
you know what does that mean I really

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:34,140
don't know and I'm a developer so it's

00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:35,790
just it's just really dumb and whereas

00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:37,350
on nopalea the other they've actually

00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:38,760
thought about what to real people how do

00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,830
they how to real people think how to

00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,750
real people want to create content how

00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:44,160
do people want to take that piece of

00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,230
content and put it into a menu structure

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:49,140
so you got you can put the title there

00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,800
and then you've got you know the linking

00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,720
it into their

00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,310
publishing options that simplify it a

00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,170
little bit again it's a bit more like

00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:58,950
WordPress which is which is good it's

00:14:55,170 --> 00:15:00,899
nice to learn from somebody else and now

00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:02,730
we've got so Edmond date and time and

00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,019
things like that so it's taken a lot

00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,940
from WordPress it's also taking a lot

00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:08,130
from a lot of UX you I things from

00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:11,370
Drupal 8 and like I said really bundled

00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:12,570
them into one really nice system and I'm

00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,250
not sure when they're really when the

00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:15,870
release of official release of monopoly

00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,279
will be but again there's a session

00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,610
later on today which I'm sure you can

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:25,769
ask the the fellow or the you know when

00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:28,320
that might be and and then lastly so

00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:31,560
yeah there's the Save button so yeah

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,490
that's a really nice system and to be

00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,399
honest I actually just learned about

00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:37,769
that in January you know like i said i'm

00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,510
a developer but there's so much things

00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:41,160
going on and everything's kind of like

00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:42,570
drupal 8 through polite your plate but

00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,399
there are some sensible people out there

00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:45,810
that you know are actually thinking well

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,769
that's very far off we've got lots of

00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:48,839
clients we've got lots of customers

00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:50,040
right now so you know let's let's

00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:51,420
withdrew play people do what they want

00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,240
and let's take what they're doing and

00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:55,500
apply it to the masses and you know so

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,810
they're definitely sharing a love so you

00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:01,070
know you see the people from kenapa

00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:01,070
distribution they thank you

00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:11,770
you can customize it so basically it's

00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:13,210
it's using panels panels is sort of a

00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,800
drag drop kind of thing and what they're

00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,150
doing is they've they've technically

00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,920
taken panels which allows you to

00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:20,290
override anything and they've

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,820
overwritten the the note edit screen and

00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:24,040
just made it look pretty and made it

00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:25,690
look make sense and so definitely out of

00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,940
the box so if I go back to this edit

00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,590
screen here if I had say 40 fields in

00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:32,350
here by default they would just keep on

00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:33,610
appearing down here and on but it would

00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:36,670
be up to you to they made me push some

00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:38,950
of those to the to the sidebar and I can

00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:43,240
actually show you to kind of jumping

00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:47,620
ahead a little bit okay you would

00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:49,600
actually get this is something we'll be

00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,830
showing soon you actually get to say

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,610
changes layout so your note at its

00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,690
screen you can imagine you could

00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:55,720
actually choose any one of these layouts

00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:57,520
for your note edit screen you know

00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,600
whatever would make most sense for that

00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,280
I mean you've ever you could imagine

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,140
there would be an image gallery where it

00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,010
would make sense to have the user could

00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,569
actually click on each one of these

00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:05,980
boxes and add an image and they visually

00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:08,110
see what that looks like on the Edit

00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:10,870
screen you know the any one of these

00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:13,600
things can be used as that node layout

00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:16,810
and note edit layout as well as for the

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,520
front end so it's it's pretty cool

00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,170
really opened it up opens up lata and

00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:22,480
again this stuff was available has been

00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,610
available for a while with pure panels

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,829
but I guess to be honest I've always

00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:29,470
really not liked panels I've never used

00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:32,650
it for a lot of reasons performance and

00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:34,990
UI for two it's it's really heavy does

00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:37,660
way too much and the UI is awful so you

00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:39,730
taking making an awful Drupal you I even

00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,900
worse but putting panels in place and so

00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:42,940
again the nice thing that they've done

00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,680
with panoply and a lot of things are

00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:47,080
doing this something called analyzer is

00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,880
they've sort of set up a panels is a

00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,470
powerful engine but it really sucks to

00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,850
use it and no one can make sense of it

00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,310
unless you're a developer there's all

00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:56,380
the overrides and it's just 800 screens

00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:57,910
to do any basic thing so what they've

00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,160
done is said well why don't we just have

00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:01,390
a button that says changes layout and so

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,630
you can literally click on that button

00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:08,500
and then change your layout anyways I'm

00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:10,909
dumping ahead of myself and I need to

00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:14,230
I'll get to that when i get to the

00:18:10,909 --> 00:18:14,230
placing that comes in

00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,340
you can panoply is a Drupal 7

00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:27,320
distribution it's in a sort of a release

00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:29,150
candidate stage right now and it's a

00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,730
suite of there's a number of ponopolis

00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:34,070
and it's also bundled together a lot of

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:36,350
exec existing panel modules and a few

00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:39,500
other best practice things as well but

00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:40,790
you can if you hope they'll document it

00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,340
but he said effectively you can grab

00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:45,020
those bits that they've done and drag

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,820
those into sort of piece of nail into

00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,100
your own site so you can slowly improve

00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:50,990
you know over time you know what you

00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:52,640
have it I wouldn't recommend it

00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:54,290
basically dropping all in place you

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,000
might want to start with the node at its

00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:58,220
screen at first clean that up and then

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,320
start adding the layout because you're

00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,030
also one again I'm joking help myself

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,010
when i get to the placement part i'll

00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:07,100
answer that otherwise we'll be all over

00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,960
the place so yes monopoly it's a great

00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,490
it's a great system the other thing is

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,800
how do we make content editing actually

00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:13,700
faster you know what would be really

00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,430
great if you could actually just

00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,930
literally go to a page and half on

00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:21,140
something's are editing it that's what

00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:22,940
spark does so spark is also was a triple

00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,260
seven thing and then everyone thought

00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,030
that is so cool we should make it true

00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,370
polite and stop the Drupal 7 part of it

00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:30,200
which again sucks because Drupal 8 is

00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:32,450
the cool shiny toy but it's not to be

00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,130
available to most sites for at least

00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,110
probably a year and a half to be honest

00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,970
I mean it might be released by the end

00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:39,680
of the year but people launching sites

00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:41,900
on it probably either probably some

00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,820
issues even with three saying that it

00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,680
probably the most stable system which I

00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:50,870
agree but there still is going to be

00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:52,490
issues so let me jump to spark and again

00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:54,110
there's some really nice people have

00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:56,480
actually backported spark to Drupal 7

00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:58,400
again so we should find out who they are

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,740
and sure share the load with up because

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,410
it's a lot of work so here's an again

00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:05,180
another example of a screen very you

00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:07,790
know just some demo content a big image

00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:09,860
some body checks and tags normally you

00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:12,140
would click on the Edit thing which

00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:15,620
everyone's familiar with and again you

00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:17,720
get that horrible screen but spark

00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:19,300
allows you to do inline editing there's

00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,830
a little thing that says quick edit

00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:24,590
click on that and I'm switched into

00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:26,720
content is like inline editing mode so i

00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:30,650
can just click on the title make some

00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,540
changes i'm not going to save that and

00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:33,520
it's nice to it actually it warns you

00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:36,390
that with you if you

00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,390
you jump out of it

00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:44,770
if I jump out of it it says hey you know

00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:46,600
you want to describe this changes

00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:49,180
there's not so it's really quite

00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,130
intuitive it uses Ajax so it's fast done

00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:53,020
you know things like that so I click out

00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:55,030
and I've saved that say that note it's

00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:56,470
done you know there's no sort of

00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,330
disconnect and sort of what I think they

00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:00,100
were trying to do it overlay but just

00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:02,470
didn't have the you know the ability to

00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:03,940
so I think this is a really really great

00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:05,920
feature this will be built into Drupal 8

00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,559
but again this is being backported to

00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,970
Drupal 7 and should be ready in the next

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,530
I'd imagine a few months I mean it's

00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:14,679
ready now you know like it depends upon

00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:15,880
how stable you want things to be but you

00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:18,910
can sort of add it to your repertoire

00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,860
you know your your quiver of things I'll

00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,990
have all the links that I'm talking

00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,250
about I'll have on the web page as well

00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,929
i know i'm talking about quite a few

00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:29,700
things so i'll put them was on the web

00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:29,700
page and i'll update the slides as well

00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:35,080
yeah spark is the question was his spark

00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:39,190
is in line anything any decor for Drupal

00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,210
8 and it will be which is right so yeah

00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:46,260
I mean Drupal I it's going to be amazing

00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:46,260
in a year and a half and

00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,759
yep

00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:57,159
yeah this is this is a Drupal 7 site so

00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:59,620
there they have started back courting it

00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:01,629
and it's feature its feature parity with

00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,980
Drupal 8 so all the nice things that are

00:22:01,629 --> 00:22:04,450
under polite they're bringing to Drupal

00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,710
7 and they're keeping as they add new

00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:07,899
things with Drupal 8 they back forth

00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:09,879
into Drupal 7 and this is a Drupal 7

00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:11,080
site I want to add so everything i'm

00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:12,970
showing you is Drupal 7 there's no

00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,259
Drupal 8 here so everything in here is

00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:15,940
expectedly you can either use it now

00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:17,740
some of its stable some of its going to

00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:18,669
be stable and I wanted to make sure I

00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,159
didn't show anything that was true

00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:22,899
polite because it's too far from now and

00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:28,480
we can't use it and that's not showing a

00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:29,830
whole lot of love to everyone so good

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:34,870
question that's coming in the layout

00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:37,000
part of it sorry yeah so that's the nice

00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:37,899
thing about a lot of these tools is you

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,490
know now that they're doing all this

00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:40,720
work Andrew polite it's a lot it's a lot

00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:42,700
of work to actually back for it because

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:45,990
rubellite is quite a big change from

00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:49,659
Drupal 7 as classes and Symphony and

00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:52,179
object-oriented stuff and drupal 7 is

00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:54,190
sort of spaghetti you know it's nice to

00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:57,190
get e code in a way it's nice in triple

00:22:54,190 --> 00:23:02,139
its way they dribble six but it's a lot

00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:04,570
of work to back for that stuff so here's

00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:05,860
that so also when your content editing

00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:07,960
you can imagine entries touched on that

00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,730
you know mobile editing so when the New

00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,289
York transit system went down they

00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,250
couldn't use their laptops things like

00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,450
that are they couldn't access in the

00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,610
office they have their tablets they had

00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:16,779
their mobile phones you know they put

00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:18,549
they weren't using probably things like

00:23:16,779 --> 00:23:22,480
this but how can you make your system

00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:25,090
more usable on on devices whether it's a

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,029
phone or a tablet or whatever and again

00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:29,740
the normal drupal menu system doesn't

00:23:28,029 --> 00:23:31,059
work well with touch you know you have

00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,950
to eight hundred klicks to get anywhere

00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:34,570
or it's really tiny or as you as you

00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:37,029
collapse the system down the menu just

00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:39,610
goes all over the place so Drupal 8 out

00:23:37,029 --> 00:23:41,590
of the box has as we showed a nice multi

00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:44,500
touch a touch friendly interface that

00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:48,480
scales through two pcs that's developed

00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:51,309
for Drupal 7 as well touch base menu and

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,129
that's what you see up here so there's

00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:55,870
an it's a big finger friendly lay out

00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:58,029
our big finger friendly sort of thing

00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:59,769
and and faceless show is saying too that

00:23:58,029 --> 00:24:01,330
you know you don't see these icons in

00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:03,159
the mobile version because they're too

00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:04,650
big but now I mean the pc version see

00:24:03,159 --> 00:24:06,750
the CP icons

00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,890
and so it's you can't quite tell right

00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:11,250
now I mean I could definitely touch up

00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:13,980
my finger but that's all multi-touch

00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:15,360
friendly and you get a nice big target

00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,350
there so you can you know you don't have

00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,290
to do eight hundred klicks to get

00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:21,000
anywhere it's again you can kind of hop

00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:22,860
three or four levels deep to get to what

00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,260
you want and you know you can add

00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,810
content you can find content so that's a

00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:29,370
really nice you know feature as well so

00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:30,750
you can use that it by default or maybe

00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:33,800
just for your only for your mobile sites

00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:36,330
and that one is called I don't remember

00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,710
there was too many modules so I like i

00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:39,450
said i'll put though with all the names

00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:42,930
on this because literally I was in

00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:44,640
Boston in January and one thing the Aqua

00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:46,140
is working on right now is demos and

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,670
we're going to give those those demos

00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,080
are going to be released back to anyone

00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:50,880
who wants to use them because Drupal

00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,890
doesn't generally demoed very well and

00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,310
there are distributions but a lot of

00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:58,200
times they tend to be you know quite

00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:59,580
one-sided are eccentric to certain

00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,750
things and so essentially what we're

00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,340
trying to do is we're trying to taking

00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,750
the best of everything and wrapping them

00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:07,020
up into wine and so there's actually a

00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:08,580
guy that was hired in January with off

00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,080
we had just filled demos and

00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,440
distributions and this is what i'm using

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:16,460
right now his his make file which is a

00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,440
drug thing but effectively every time he

00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:21,240
optimizes build i can just rebuild it

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,960
and instantly have sort of the latest

00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:26,730
and greatest use a usable system here so

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,070
it's his name is branch win so

00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:31,310
definitely he's a good guy since you're

00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,310
have a go

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:39,690
so lastly getting to the placement of

00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:42,870
content you know generally Drupal uses

00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:44,850
blocks and you know it's again sort of

00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:46,410
not to intuitive you know how do you how

00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,360
do you sort of place content do you have

00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:50,280
to have your designer do things do you

00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:53,370
have to you know ask the developer to

00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:55,380
change things and so there's again three

00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:57,090
sort of areas I want to defeat focus on

00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,830
one of those is automatic placement of

00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:01,020
content so sort of thinking about your

00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:02,610
site in terms of buckets that you want

00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,780
to fill and sort of thinking about the

00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:06,330
information architecture of your site

00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:08,760
you might rather than happen to manually

00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,450
place content in different slots you

00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,059
might want to say well I want

00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:14,700
automatically anything tagged as this

00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:17,309
and sorted by day to appear here and

00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:18,299
kind of and so on and so forth the other

00:26:17,309 --> 00:26:19,620
one is dragged and dropped layouts

00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:20,700
anything that was one of the questions

00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,260
asked is you know how do you change

00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:24,390
things around I'll show you that that's

00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,460
again kenapa Lee and then WYSIWYG

00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:28,020
content blocks and what that means again

00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,669
it's sort of uh I don't know what that

00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:31,320
means really it's not a very good

00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:35,190
description for it so it's better to

00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,450
show you what what I mean so again I was

00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:38,610
touching on that sort of a bad pattern

00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:40,500
that's that's used to sort of place

00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:42,299
content is maybe people seen that where

00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,039
you have a node and then there's no

00:26:42,299 --> 00:26:45,600
there's like 100 node reference fields

00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:46,950
and so there's kind of throwaway nodes

00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,320
that are used for nothing else but you

00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:52,080
just add content to and then use that

00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,610
for a feature that's that pattern is

00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:55,320
used a lot but it really isn't very

00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:56,970
scalable and it doesn't again make sense

00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:58,500
because you have you have a content type

00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:01,020
it doesn't nothing but list other

00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,909
content by referencing other nodes and

00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:09,990
it's a really ugly kind of look up is he

00:27:02,909 --> 00:27:12,900
typing it's very clean look up so I was

00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:14,520
going to show yeah basically the thing

00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,380
that you need then is kind of think

00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,520
about flexible themes clasp collapsible

00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:19,500
layouts and then something called

00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,299
context so again this kind of comes to

00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,950
the notion of how do you think of your

00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:24,150
site in terms of like this bucket that

00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:27,270
needs to be filled with doing pieces of

00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:29,549
content you know it does require the

00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:33,570
theme to be architected in a way that is

00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:35,909
compatible and when I show you the when

00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:37,770
I show you the the panels lay out some

00:27:35,909 --> 00:27:39,630
essentially what happens is panels takes

00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:41,850
over the layout of the entire page and

00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:43,679
your designer effectively just creates a

00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:46,260
header or footer and a nice kind of big

00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,970
white space in the middle and

00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:50,910
takes over that big white space and lets

00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:52,500
you do elders layout things so you know

00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:54,690
it gives a lot of power and flexibility

00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:56,430
back to content creators and 22 site

00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:58,260
builders it takes a little bit of the

00:27:56,430 --> 00:27:59,610
power away maybe from the designers but

00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:04,110
you know it's a kind of a good and bad

00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:06,150
thing so back to content placing you

00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:08,040
know good block so blocks sort of is

00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,480
kind of its I mean it's been built into

00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:11,580
Drupal since the beginning and it's a

00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,530
way of placing content and adding little

00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,610
reusable components but again to use

00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:17,310
blocks you have to go to the block

00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:20,250
administration screen which it can be

00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:21,270
quite bewildered and you know you see

00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,650
you have this you have every single

00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:24,960
block available and then you have to

00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:26,580
like drag them up and things around so

00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,630
it's again and not very intuitive and

00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,120
you know it takes a bit of training to

00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:32,310
understand what that means so something

00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,860
better is something called beans so

00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:37,140
beans i think is it's an acronym for

00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:42,720
something that's just really geeky it's

00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:44,880
like blocks entities are not know there

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,890
you go that doesn't really mean anything

00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,480
to most people and it doesn't really

00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:50,220
mean anything to me either exactly what

00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,170
it means is they've taken they take the

00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,280
notion of a block and they made it feel

00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,750
double so you can almost think of a

00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,430
block as a reusable piece of content

00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:58,140
that you can just attach anything want

00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:00,600
to it and then reuse that anywhere

00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:06,480
through at your site so I've got a few

00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:08,880
demonstrations of that here's a site

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,830
that I that I worked with nails mode

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,100
which is the North Australian Indigenous

00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:17,040
land and sea management agency and this

00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:19,740
was a very very early Drupal 7 site that

00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:23,670
sort of just kept on being built and so

00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:26,700
it went from Drupal beta to Drupal 7.15

00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:28,080
before it finally was released and so I

00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,960
sort of learned Drupal 7 along the way

00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:34,730
which is great and you can sort of see

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,540
here I'll switch to the home page here

00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:39,380
it's got you know a fairly traditional

00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:42,210
day out it's got a big image it's got

00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,920
this thing that you know goes to

00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:46,010
different images it's got these things

00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:48,420
these are blocks for instance so

00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:50,820
basically what that means is if I if I

00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:52,620
edit this so I can show you the bad and

00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,060
the good part of it so here's the bad

00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:56,640
thing this is just a block so you've got

00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:58,080
the block description in the body and so

00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,420
you know they have to scale that image

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,860
to the right size so somebody

00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,180
to go into photoshop scale that image to

00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:05,150
the right size that it fits into that

00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:07,580
layout they have to make sure that this

00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:09,230
thing links to the right section they

00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:11,390
have to add the right amount of text so

00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:13,130
that's blocks any blocks are dumb their

00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:15,920
one stop shop for anything you want to

00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:17,990
use and I made the home page before I

00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:20,480
found a little beans so sort of the

00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:22,370
story of that so this is a block and

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,230
here's the wonderful region you know so

00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:26,450
you actually have to choose which reason

00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:27,920
region it's showing up on you know it's

00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,290
just again it just goes on and on and on

00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,540
and on and it doesn't it's not really

00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:34,460
intuitive and whenever they need to edit

00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:36,320
this ice I just tell them I haven't

00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:39,860
emailed me and change it because it's so

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,390
easy to like they they they delete that

00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:43,880
or they get a huge image and it just

00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:45,950
looks terrible in the home page and so I

00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,240
was really frustrated and I was kind of

00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:50,000
looking for what's a better way of

00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,460
allowing people to so this is the

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,680
WYSIWYG editing thing how can you have a

00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:57,350
nice layout but make it easy for people

00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:59,720
to edit that aren't designers that

00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:02,420
aren't web developers so here's the bad

00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,430
way here's a block it just it's a it's a

00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:06,740
dribbles use it for ever but it's it's

00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:08,240
just dumb so I'm going to switch to a

00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,550
newer section of site that we built a

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,980
few months ago and when I already

00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:15,320
learned about beans there's a very

00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,850
similar blocks as you can see but when i

00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:18,800
click on this they get a little thing

00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:21,440
called edit which is kind of nice so

00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,700
it's it's our I'm already not and just

00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,040
to be even nicer if it was using the

00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,660
panoply layout and I probably wasn't

00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:29,180
available to time so you can see how you

00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:31,700
can get better and better but now I

00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:33,860
could put in a title I can this is just

00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,570
I can upload a 500 megabyte image if i

00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:38,330
wanted to or whatever and it'll scruple

00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:41,000
scale it to the right size there's the

00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:42,560
there's the the country text there is a

00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,050
nice there's the editor right there so

00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,850
yeah it's it's it's actually a node

00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:49,070
content or it's actually a piece of

00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:51,380
content that is edited as you would

00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:53,690
think of almost any Content item and and

00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:59,030
then which you use use this place week

00:31:53,690 --> 00:32:00,710
to to render that into this so it takes

00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:02,660
that those five or six fields of

00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:04,640
information and basic crates you know

00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:06,470
this so it's kind of an evolution of

00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,090
what of a dumb block it is something

00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:10,400
much more intelligent and you can tune

00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:11,630
that too

00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:18,770
anything you want and that's where the

00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:20,510
wysiwyg part becomes exactly exactly

00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:24,350
that's an excellent point so that the

00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:26,990
point made was blocks our content and so

00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:28,220
you can't export blocks into features or

00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:29,180
into code and things like that so it

00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:32,360
really makes the whole workflow

00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:34,490
difficult whereas a bean is an entity

00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,140
which can be exported into code and so

00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:38,000
the placement the content everything

00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,830
about it can be you can export it and so

00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,570
it works much better in many larger

00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:44,270
organizations workflows for development

00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:46,580
cycles so that's yeah a technical point

00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:49,040
that is another big reason that beans

00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:50,960
and a version of beans is actually being

00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,280
integrated into Drupal 8 so blocks would

00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,050
become much more intelligent in Drupal 8

00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:57,070
they're not going to just be the kind of

00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:57,070
a dumb block they are now

00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:07,860
yeah oh yeah exactly so any any field

00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,390
that you any like a map you could even

00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,070
have a map field in there and I mean

00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:14,580
anything you want to do at the drupal

00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:17,070
field you can add to this that's an

00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:19,950
entity which in Drupal parlance is

00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:22,380
effectively just the ability to add any

00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:23,610
field that you want and actually I mean

00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:32,850
that you brought that up I can actually

00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:35,309
just show you the blog site so I won't

00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:36,929
do this I was gonna show you show the

00:33:35,309 --> 00:33:42,090
fields on it but I i I'm not paying

00:33:36,929 --> 00:33:45,480
attention i might screwed up I'd much

00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:46,730
one that's actually the bean the

00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,140
question was is that a block filter

00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:50,760
that's actually the bean interface so

00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,710
you actually like you correct content

00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,880
types you actually create bean types so

00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:56,460
you're kidding you're creating custom

00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:58,320
blocks that can be then reused so you

00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,520
can imagine Oh get me one second you can

00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,740
imagine you could actually create and

00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:04,320
again this this isn't you could create a

00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:06,210
slideshow being that they somebody could

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,369
upload six images and some text or they

00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:10,859
get links to things and you know

00:34:08,369 --> 00:34:13,980
effectively that could just be you know

00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:15,480
a reusable component of functionality

00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,649
and the nice thing about beans is again

00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,960
it's almost like this drag-and-drop

00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:21,030
reusable component that you can make

00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,379
once and then just use it I could have

00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:25,230
used the same thing on the information

00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:27,300
hub and and just drag drop it and then

00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:29,040
you know put in unique content because

00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,780
it's like a note you know but it's but

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,220
it's a bean so it actually integrate to

00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:35,359
the block system but it gets rid of

00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,359
water with the missing of the blocks

00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:41,789
yeah definitely the question was going

00:34:39,539 --> 00:34:44,579
to use blocks and beans definitely beans

00:34:41,789 --> 00:34:45,779
augment blocks and they sort of take you

00:34:44,579 --> 00:34:48,210
know they take over what the block

00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:50,250
normally would do and by then again in

00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:54,509
Drupal 8 the traditional block will be

00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:58,940
sort of a relic it'll just be it'll just

00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:58,940
be beans are being like things

00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,390
I would say it's lesson because to be

00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:17,200
honest a lot of stuff is being back

00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:19,390
ported from group light so there's

00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,890
always a difficulty upgrade paths and

00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:22,530
somebody asked the question Therese the

00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:25,390
other day they almost attacked him with

00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:27,040
saying how hard it is to upgrade and he

00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:28,630
said he felt bad but you know he said

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,740
talk to me afterwards so yeah I mean

00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:31,150
that's always going to be an issue in

00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:32,470
every module you add to your site

00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:33,880
doesn't make it may be that little

00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:36,370
harder to upgrade so it something yet to

00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:37,660
think about you know today with spark

00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:39,820
it's kind of a no-brainer because that's

00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:41,260
from google 7 our Drupal 8 and other

00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,580
things so kind of the nice thing about

00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,410
what these people are doing is they're I

00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:46,240
back porting features it also makes

00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:48,550
forward port or upgradability a little

00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,110
bit easier but yes I mean to be honest

00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,550
every single module you add to your site

00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:58,750
does make it that much harder to

00:35:51,550 --> 00:36:00,430
potentially upgrade well no it won't be

00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:02,200
but again because these modules are

00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:03,760
really really really popular and they're

00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:05,880
being developed by some of the biggest

00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,990
agencies triple agencies in the world

00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,000
chances are they will create a Drupal 8

00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:11,260
version or an upgrade path because

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,850
they're building this stuff for their

00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:14,560
clients and they're gonna have to

00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:16,540
upgrade their client sites in a year and

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:18,280
a half two years time so you can always

00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:20,320
bet you know you kind of you can bet a

00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,880
bit of money on a module that has any a

00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,880
thousand or more users or a couple

00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,470
thousand you know module users you kind

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,470
of see that on the module page a module

00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:30,460
that's got a few hundred or less

00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:32,170
probably not going to go anywhere you

00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:34,380
know so yeah I mean everything i'm

00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:36,700
showing is sort of a you know

00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:38,290
free-for-all and it's up to i guess

00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,090
everyone to determine if that fits the

00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:42,010
use case or not but yeah i mean i think

00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:44,080
that's a good point every module ii add

00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:46,680
does increase me flex it and can make it

00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,680
harder to upgrade

00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:55,849
yep

00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:06,969
yep

00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:16,160
they do they they do get a they do get a

00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:18,410
URL but it's not it's generally not

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,580
published if you know what I mean so

00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:22,160
it's effectively an you can also just

00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:25,700
kind of hide hide the path so I can

00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:28,250
actually go to this there actually is a

00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:30,440
URL for this this piece of content which

00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:31,460
is kind of weird so you can actually go

00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:32,840
to a page it's just should list this

00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,650
content but of course it's kind of all

00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,260
over the place through that's not

00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:37,910
properly aligned but you can just hide

00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:39,740
that path and then that way you don't

00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:41,840
get like in a normal system where you

00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:44,330
are overriding what a Content item is

00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:46,190
and as you said you have to exclude that

00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:47,300
from the search engines or your search

00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:49,610
result because otherwise people will

00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,960
always land on these result pages and

00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:52,700
never actually go to the actual result

00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,410
that they wanted to see and so like in

00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:55,940
solar or in mice ql or whatever your

00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:58,250
search engine is you have to exclude

00:37:55,940 --> 00:38:00,290
exclude these dummy content types and

00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:02,870
things like that and then it was tricky

00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:04,130
whereas beans do you know you can you

00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:05,660
can create a nice little WYSIWYG

00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:08,030
interface that says okay I want to make

00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:10,730
a slideshow so let's create a slideshow

00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:12,950
bean and have what multi-field for all

00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:14,120
that you know one or ten images and then

00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:15,500
you just put a little JavaScript around

00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:18,830
that or there's actually a slideshow

00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:20,630
module being there's 15 beans that you

00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:22,340
can download and there's two slideshow

00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:23,720
ones in so out of the box you get a

00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:26,450
slideshow and then you just drop that

00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,830
block in a page a bean and you add one

00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:29,750
or more images and it's got the

00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:32,450
JavaScript and jQuery us up and it just

00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:33,740
creates effectively what again I didn't

00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:35,060
it wasn't available when I started the

00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:37,100
site I would have been able to get this

00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:39,920
exact feature here and then you then

00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:42,110
your CSS person can style it out of the

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:44,240
box and it's that I had to like find a

00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:46,610
jquery thing and this is using views and

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,520
so that's the other this is the bad

00:38:46,610 --> 00:38:51,380
powder to like when you know when when

00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,670
somebody wants to change this what they

00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,200
actually have to do is they have to go

00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:56,060
to each separate piece of content and

00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:58,460
take it to something so you're saying

00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:00,110
okay well then it's detag something and

00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:02,090
so like again this it's kind of a

00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:03,770
thought that's every thoughtful of me to

00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:05,840
have done that so like that person now

00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:07,340
has to go through their their site find

00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:09,230
a piece of content that they want to

00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:11,270
show up here take it but then also

00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:13,190
remember which one they don't want to be

00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:14,510
on there anymore untag it and they have

00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:15,710
to do that and then the view it just

00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:19,520
picks up everything that's been tagged

00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:20,690
to X if this was a bean rather than

00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,370
having to make them do that they could

00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:23,570
click on this go to edit and then

00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:25,040
just have a nice prada complete thing

00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:27,410
that they could just type in I want

00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:29,840
these things to show up and I have

00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:33,740
another example 2 over being which is a

00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:35,960
little bit more simple here so here's

00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:40,450
again here's that demo site was this is

00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:44,300
all Drupal 7 here's a recent articles

00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:46,760
block beam and it's quite basic you know

00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:49,310
i'm just showing title image square

00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:51,920
image and some tags and so there's 53 of

00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:57,260
them there that's a beam so i can click

00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:58,130
on edit and hear what they've done is

00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,980
they've actually created a little

00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:03,290
interface to this beam so rather than be

00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:05,320
you know the normal fields i can just

00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:08,120
say ok well here's the title for it

00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,900
here's the view mode that i want here's

00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,810
how I want this thing to actually

00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:13,400
display so here I've chosen teaser with

00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,930
image and I've used display sweet to

00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,510
create a few new view modes which I'll

00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:21,830
show shortly and i want to show i'll

00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:25,040
just say two items i click save and so

00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:27,470
it's basically views ultra symbol and

00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:30,710
and see there now I've just edited that

00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:32,900
recent articles two things and and there

00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:34,730
you go so it's a really easy system and

00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:37,040
you can customize that to be as complex

00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:38,600
or easy as you want with drop-down lists

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,310
and all sorts of things so I can click

00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:41,360
on again you can see how easy to for

00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:44,090
somebody to say okay well I don't really

00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:48,980
like that layout you know let me say

00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:50,990
okay I want to show three things and I'm

00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:54,850
going to use a grid so this is another

00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:58,490
view that I've created I'll click Save

00:40:54,850 --> 00:41:00,110
and there you see it's the nice big

00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:02,300
image the title the top so it's a bit

00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:04,940
more visual you know it's like okay well

00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:07,220
that's that's a bit big I don't like

00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:10,880
that I'll just be the last example hear

00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:12,410
it click forever teaser that's just the

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,360
Drupal teather everyone you know it's

00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:18,890
just the normal Drupal teaser click on

00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:21,110
that and there it's just the teaser Just

00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:23,270
In in the side column so you can quickly

00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:25,490
see how easy it is for you know content

00:41:23,270 --> 00:41:26,900
layout people to have more control and

00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:30,050
flexibility over what they're doing

00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:32,690
without forcing them to use views or to

00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:34,160
sort of jump around to the site and grab

00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:36,260
pieces of content you know you

00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,880
you've wrapped up exact function

00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,010
functionality that you want that content

00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:41,990
editor to use or that layout person to

00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:43,730
use given them a few options which is

00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:46,490
really nice and then created as a beam

00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:48,829
and probably makes sense i can actually

00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:51,680
so you can drag the DRA crowd around so

00:41:48,829 --> 00:41:54,079
that's being it's a really nice module

00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,849
and it does a lot for layout and again

00:41:54,079 --> 00:42:00,440
they're bringing that into the fold of

00:41:55,849 --> 00:42:02,180
Drupal 7 so that's kind of what i vant

00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,470
about WYSIWYG is that you know it's kind

00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:04,520
of sums up what you're doing and you can

00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:05,930
clean you can save it you can easily see

00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,549
what you want to do so its dynamic

00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:10,160
content regions that are what you see is

00:42:07,549 --> 00:42:12,500
what you get and in case I didn't have

00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,960
internet connectivity I had some things

00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:18,020
here but I had internet connectivity so

00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:23,869
Oh skip over that and I'll go to layout

00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:25,400
now so the other really nice time I'll

00:42:23,869 --> 00:42:26,480
try to wrap it up if there's any

00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,640
question the other really nice thing

00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,500
about what they're doing the panels

00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:32,990
because panels iowa's felt was just

00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:34,579
rubbish like no one used it like said

00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:36,200
you know few people I don't mean to

00:42:34,579 --> 00:42:38,030
offend anybody they use it I just I

00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,829
didn't use it and blow these developers

00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:42,289
I talked to didn't use it and it just

00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:44,270
shocked me in when I was in Boston in

00:42:42,289 --> 00:42:46,190
January that every distribution is using

00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:47,660
panels it just you know he's sort of

00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:49,130
like you're learning at Santa isn't real

00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:50,450
or something like that like panels is

00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:52,849
being used so it's like oh that's that's

00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:53,930
weird you know but there's a reason

00:42:52,849 --> 00:42:55,880
because what they've done is they've

00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:57,410
effectively they've gotten rid of what

00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,640
was sort of evil about panels and

00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:00,829
they've made it they've got they've

00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:02,420
youth what's good about panels and so

00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:03,859
we've got this these nice big buttons

00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:05,119
here like I want me to show you what

00:43:03,859 --> 00:43:06,319
panels used to look like it was really

00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:08,990
horrible i'm sure some people have seen

00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:12,349
it like it's this 800 menu screen with

00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:17,180
800 tabs and there's no dover / rides

00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:18,950
with you know print signs and it just

00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:20,329
wasn't good it wasn't good i didn't like

00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:21,980
it so what they've done is they said

00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:23,299
well what do people want to do with

00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:24,170
panels they want to be able to customize

00:43:23,299 --> 00:43:25,910
the page and they wanna be able to

00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:28,400
change the layout so here's our hope my

00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:30,109
homepage it's really basic really ugly

00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,819
but it's just a demo site so i think we

00:43:30,109 --> 00:43:34,039
can customize this page you get this in

00:43:31,819 --> 00:43:36,470
line visual visual drag and drop

00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:38,329
interface so straight away i can scroll

00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:39,529
you know here's all my content you can

00:43:38,329 --> 00:43:42,170
the great thing is you still see your

00:43:39,529 --> 00:43:43,970
content but it's just in the context of

00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:47,390
the placement so here's the content

00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:50,539
there's a sidebar and you can just

00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:55,150
sorry these are really long but I can

00:43:50,539 --> 00:43:55,150
just grab this and drag it up to the top

00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:02,900
and that just gives me a nice drop slot

00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:06,619
I can even crazy take the that and put

00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:14,359
it over over there and put this one over

00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:16,039
here so and you can delete stuff so it

00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:17,539
has gives you total flexibility of the

00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:20,329
layout of your of your page and you can

00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:22,910
add you can add new blocks beans nodes

00:44:20,329 --> 00:44:24,109
content views all sorts of stuff so this

00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:28,039
is the views used to kind of look like

00:44:24,109 --> 00:44:28,819
this or but with more ugly stuff and so

00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:30,140
they've tried that they've try to

00:44:28,819 --> 00:44:31,519
simplify it and again I think you can

00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:33,559
filter this down so that you could say

00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:34,970
okay I only want people to access maybe

00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:37,160
like I want them to be able to easily

00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:40,250
reference another node for instance I

00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,599
want them to drop in a beam so you know

00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,859
the you can add some custom you can

00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,970
added and they've done some of these

00:44:42,859 --> 00:44:45,980
nice things like I want to sound add a

00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:48,890
quick image to the page I want to add a

00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:50,660
map i want to add a table and things

00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:56,180
like that so i could click on add a map

00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:59,029
and it put in a dress and so on and so

00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:01,640
it's kind of like the like being but

00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:04,940
they've augmented into panels so but you

00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:11,779
get you get a lot of you know

00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:13,640
interaction with your page and this is

00:45:11,779 --> 00:45:16,359
again part of the panoply distribution

00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:21,500
and it's not my person stable loading

00:45:16,359 --> 00:45:24,740
get out of here so switch to another you

00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:28,160
know here again customize this page I

00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:29,779
won't click on map this time drag and

00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,880
drop so there's there's an app party

00:45:29,779 --> 00:45:35,210
loaded there so I can drag and drop any

00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:36,440
of this content so you know again it

00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:40,369
makes it really easy you don't have to

00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:42,799
go to the block screen and I think

00:45:40,369 --> 00:45:44,539
there's a lock screen in here I'm sure

00:45:42,799 --> 00:45:47,829
everyone's seen a normal block Serena's

00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:47,829
it's not this intuitive for short

00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:57,680
click on map I hadn't clicked on that

00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:00,100
every for i thought i'm gonna click on

00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:05,900
that would be cool but it's not cool

00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:07,640
screwed me up there we go good so yeah

00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,930
and then again i can change layout I'm

00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:12,170
like this is a live site so I'm not

00:46:08,930 --> 00:46:16,400
going to change layout here changelist

00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:18,470
layout and I can show you I haven't done

00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:23,180
this either yet so probably screw up but

00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:24,440
I'll just go to that and and then it

00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,730
said it says you know how do you want to

00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,980
map you know you can actually take your

00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:29,480
existing content and map it and so it

00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:31,100
shows where you're going where your head

00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:32,510
and where you're going to and what the

00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:34,400
previews going to be so it's just it's

00:46:32,510 --> 00:46:36,710
really nice it's really good and you get

00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:38,060
total flexibility to your layout and you

00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,590
know you get a little get a little bit

00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:41,720
power from your designers and get it

00:46:39,590 --> 00:46:43,880
back to the content layout people so you

00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,500
can have really ugly looking sites or

00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:47,780
really good looking site so i guess the

00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:51,020
powers and your hands and i think i'm at

00:46:47,780 --> 00:47:00,560
merely at time so is it a 60 minutes or

00:46:51,020 --> 00:47:01,820
15 ok all right ok so yeah in review you

00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,030
know drupal can do better out-of-the-box

00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:07,340
drupal isn't very usable but it's got a

00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:09,590
lot of power under the hood these

00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:11,150
modules you know you kind of to just

00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:12,650
know what modules are out there like i

00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:15,110
said i just learned about a lot of the

00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:17,240
stuff in january and it's cool because i

00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:19,130
was thought I just Drupal 8 and I'm a

00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:22,040
developer so I didn't have any excuse

00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:23,720
and there's not much code either a lot

00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:25,610
of these things are dropping modules so

00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:28,340
you know they're not all stable yet and

00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:29,630
I'm happy to put in the module list of

00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:32,180
which ones are stable in which end do

00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:33,850
not and you get really great results so

00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:35,990
you know you can really kind of

00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:37,820
revolutionize you know in a way the

00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:40,190
usability of your site for your content

00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:44,900
creators which with sort of in between

00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:46,580
one in 30 modules so you know the user

00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:48,590
experience for content creators we've

00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:50,060
got finding editing and placing and you

00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:51,890
know those sort of things all together I

00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:54,380
think really do increase the usability

00:47:51,890 --> 00:47:55,760
of a Drupal site and sort of move it

00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:56,960
into another level I mean it's thing

00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,390
becomes way better than WordPress it

00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:01,599
becomes way better than many

00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:03,039
really commercial systems and almost

00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:05,069
everything that I showed is available

00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:08,559
well is all available today but stable

00:48:05,069 --> 00:48:10,059
maybe not okay I had to put the slide in

00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,940
somebody saw me typing it as I was

00:48:10,059 --> 00:48:15,819
getting ready aqua is hiring here in

00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:18,069
Australia and get in touch with me here

00:48:15,819 --> 00:48:22,920
somebody a rock with people and yeah

00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:22,920
it's a good company any questions

00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:38,910
I the question was beans are great but

00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:40,170
they're not revisional like a note is

00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:41,760
revisional and if you've got a site

00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:43,650
that's got a really complex workflow are

00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,329
these more comprehensive workflow how do

00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:47,369
you then not have a revision of

00:48:45,329 --> 00:48:49,650
something I haven't faced up but they

00:48:47,369 --> 00:48:52,310
are working on making beans revisional

00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:52,310
so

00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:04,570
no they're not yet panoply is that's

00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:07,210
just a distribution you can just go to

00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:08,470
Drupal drupal.org / project / monopoly

00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:11,130
and you can get almost everything I

00:49:08,470 --> 00:49:14,140
showed right out of the box with that

00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:16,480
the other one that aqua is working on is

00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:18,310
internal but i will probably push that

00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,890
out is just it's just a make file and

00:49:18,310 --> 00:49:22,270
it's just sort of pre-configured site

00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:24,610
with you know a few things here and

00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:26,020
there and i'll asks if we can get that

00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:27,490
it's just on our github account but it's

00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:31,620
locked away but it'd be great if we just

00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:31,620
push that to a drupal.org project

00:49:42,779 --> 00:49:48,319
yeah the question was you use context

00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:51,059
for layout can use beans definitely the

00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:54,809
the site that are showing here is

00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:57,599
entirely built with context so I didn't

00:49:54,809 --> 00:49:59,789
actually get to this one but basically

00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:00,989
everything here is laid out with context

00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:02,969
and again that's really nice what being

00:50:00,989 --> 00:50:06,029
themes are exportable as well so you can

00:50:02,969 --> 00:50:09,239
export your context is a way of like

00:50:06,029 --> 00:50:11,069
having your layout all in code and also

00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:12,539
it's again it's that idea of having more

00:50:11,069 --> 00:50:14,429
intelligent layout so that basically

00:50:12,539 --> 00:50:16,949
says I'm a bucket fill me up with the

00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:19,650
stuff that you want and so yeah I mean

00:50:16,949 --> 00:50:22,380
definitely beans integrate perfectly

00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:23,609
because being it's basically blocks or

00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:25,439
the wrapper and beans just spit inside

00:50:23,609 --> 00:50:26,729
of it so it kind of piggy backs off with

00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:29,390
a block so anywhere we can use a block

00:50:26,729 --> 00:50:29,390
you can use bean

00:50:36,049 --> 00:50:38,709
yep

00:50:50,309 --> 00:50:55,680
the question was I didn't touch on help

00:50:52,859 --> 00:50:58,259
as for a reason because I didn't have

00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:01,439
time and I didn't think of it and what

00:50:58,259 --> 00:51:03,869
would I recommend to to put in place for

00:51:01,439 --> 00:51:05,189
some sort of readily available help for

00:51:03,869 --> 00:51:06,719
people that aren't familiar with Drupal

00:51:05,189 --> 00:51:09,170
and again it's something we struggle

00:51:06,719 --> 00:51:11,939
with with the large scale projects and

00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:13,229
part of the the help that we're showing

00:51:11,939 --> 00:51:14,969
and we're trying to do is making this

00:51:13,229 --> 00:51:17,430
isn't more usable first off so it looks

00:51:14,969 --> 00:51:18,660
kind of wordpress looks like Facebook or

00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:19,859
something they're familiar with so that

00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:22,529
goes a long way because Drupal out of

00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:24,390
the box doesn't make sense so that's

00:51:22,529 --> 00:51:27,719
only a little bit of the way there are

00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:29,699
quite a few videos and and when things

00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:31,559
like that that you can access but a lot

00:51:29,699 --> 00:51:35,219
of them are going to pay but I don't

00:51:31,559 --> 00:51:36,689
there is the the help module that you

00:51:35,219 --> 00:51:38,309
can install but then it's just a bunch

00:51:36,689 --> 00:51:41,160
of text so I I don't think there really

00:51:38,309 --> 00:51:42,739
is as a clean way of saying like you

00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:44,910
know here's a really nice content

00:51:42,739 --> 00:51:47,839
context-sensitive help system that will

00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:47,839
kind of follow you along the way

00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:09,280
like he said that sounds good I like

00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:09,280
that yeah

00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:27,520
Pam was saying that they're they're

00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:29,140
working on a tour module that it gives

00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:31,210
somebody a visual tour of each piece it

00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:33,040
actually walks them through the editing

00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:45,300
components of a system i'm sure you can

00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:53,590
you can edit those is that is is that a

00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:56,140
release is it on do so it's a tour

00:52:53,590 --> 00:52:58,800
module talk to previousnext they're

00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,800
doing some good stuff

00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:38,870
the question altro summarises gentleman

00:53:37,190 --> 00:53:40,850
has uses files that are attached to

00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:42,620
nodes and those files or multiple

00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:44,270
authors and they might be referenced in

00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:46,940
multiple nodes and so how do they track

00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:48,260
the if when if a file is updated how do

00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:50,150
they track that through the different

00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:52,520
areas and he currently actually has

00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:55,970
another a node as a placeholder that's

00:53:52,520 --> 00:54:00,140
referenced into the I would say you use

00:53:55,970 --> 00:54:01,850
Drupal 6 or 7 okay for triple seven

00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:03,890
there's something called media module

00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:05,900
which actually takes a file and makes it

00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:07,670
feel double so what you again almost

00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:09,050
like I've taken with beans basically

00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:11,450
it's taking the file and turns it into a

00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:13,160
field of object that you can treat as an

00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:15,140
Etsy and so rather than having to

00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:17,150
reference a node with references file

00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:19,190
you actually referenced the file and you

00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:21,920
can have any you can revision that you

00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:23,720
can add authors to it tags to it it's

00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,180
anything you want to do with it it just

00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:27,830
becomes a reusable object so if you're

00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:30,320
using Drupal 7 i'd recommend to look at

00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:31,880
the media module and violence see but

00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:36,370
triple six I think you're doing the best

00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:36,370
thing with the node reference pattern

00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,900
yep

00:54:47,569 --> 00:54:52,999
oh that's a good question I'm glad you

00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:56,140
asked that there's a really cool stuff

00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:56,140
this is just locked up

00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:06,710
yeah that map just just did did me in

00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:06,710
here it's just horrible

00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,240
there we go

00:55:26,779 --> 00:55:29,799
Google Chrome

00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:47,410
the let me try I think I have enough

00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:50,050
time to restart Firefox I've got two

00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:53,320
minutes a minute and 10 seconds nine

00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:59,410
seconds this is a fast Mac so it's got

00:55:53,320 --> 00:56:04,930
an SSD so just the course i have 150

00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:13,930
tabs open in firefox so but yeah

00:56:04,930 --> 00:56:14,950
actually wanted to show show that the

00:56:13,930 --> 00:56:17,020
nice thing about fire fought the new

00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:20,290
version of firefox so it only loads the

00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:24,580
tab that you're on so I think look at

00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:25,840
that it's great and it only loads a tab

00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:28,290
you're on so that's really cool so

00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:37,230
that's why you can have 200 tabs and and

00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:39,460
not really screw things up here we go

00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:40,990
how does it affect responsive design

00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:42,430
this is a really cool thing up here

00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:45,160
which actually does that you can click

00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:47,500
on this and get a preview of what it

00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:51,700
looks like in mobile what it looks like

00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:56,890
on tablet and what looks like on your

00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:58,589
normal screen so no this isn't fun opoly

00:56:56,890 --> 00:57:02,710
this is our thing but I think this is

00:56:58,589 --> 00:57:07,839
part of monthly as well so that's this

00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:09,369
is party responsive and the theme so you

00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:12,790
can see here's those two the tab

00:57:09,369 --> 00:57:14,980
friendly you know buttons so yeah this

00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:16,780
is this is really cool it gets that into

00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:20,230
preview I mean that's the lazy version

00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:22,330
of just taking the browser and you know

00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:24,880
doing this but it's a lot cooler to

00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:26,890
click a button isn't it so I mean think

00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:31,839
it's the same thing but it's you know

00:57:26,890 --> 00:57:33,580
cooler to this lake best that's Barbie

00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:38,680
party behind the scenes and they've just

00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:40,930
made it responsive so panels and stuff

00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:42,339
and it all works with responsive and

00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:44,859
it's really cool so you can see you can

00:57:42,339 --> 00:57:47,470
preview every panel layout every input

00:57:44,859 --> 00:57:48,970
opoly is responsive so it's all built

00:57:47,470 --> 00:57:50,500
into how it's going to collapse for you

00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:52,040
so that's a great thing you can actually

00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,930
make a change to a page

00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:56,150
see exactly what's going to happen to

00:57:53,930 --> 00:58:02,180
your you know wonderful day out and let

00:57:56,150 --> 00:58:03,800
me try to jump to yeah here's the

00:58:02,180 --> 00:58:05,660
Kapolei distribution actually cannot

00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:15,220
have that built-in so I'll find out what

00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:15,220
that thing is and is it to spark cool

00:58:16,390 --> 00:58:18,990
yep

00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:29,260
what's up now bar thank you I had like

00:58:27,609 --> 00:58:31,300
eight hundred modules so I just couldn't

00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:35,470
keep track I have my notes on the thing
