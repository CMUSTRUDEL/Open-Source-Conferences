Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Real world continuous integration for Drupal
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	Continuous integration (CI) is a practice in software development that builds, tests and deploys changes automatically, usually multiple times a day, on each change to a code base.

Find out how this practice can apply specifically to Drupal projects and see a working continuous integration setup in action and in a Drupal context.

Intended audience
Developers and shops interested in scaling their teams by automating their build and deploy processes.
The tools and techniques demonstrated would be of particular use and interest to those using Drupal to develop distributions or applications/products.

Pre-requisites
It is assumed you are familiar with the basics of team software development including version control, multiple environments and code based development in a Drupal context (update functions, exportables, etc.)
You should also be familiar with using Drush to drive Drupal sites from the command line.

Topics covered
The presentation will be in two parts. Part one defines the different build, test and deploy stages of a CI workflow and gives tool recommendations for each stage including Drupal specific demonstrations. Part two demonstrates a complete CI stack that leverages the Aegir platform for parts of the build and deploy tasks. The Jenkins CI server (http://jenkins-ci.org/) will be utilised throughout.
