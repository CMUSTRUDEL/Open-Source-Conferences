Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Creating dynamic and accessible content in Drupal 7 using WAI-ARIA
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	You can create dynamic web content and make it accessible for people with disabilities too. An accessible website doesn't have to be a boring static website - don't let anyone tell you otherwise!

WAI-ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a W3C specification that helps make dynamic web content created using HTML and scripting languages more accessible. It extends HTML by providing additional attributes that can describe the roles, states, and properties of custom widgets so they are recognised by assistive technologies such as screen readers, making the content accessible to people with a disability.

This session will introduce WAI-ARIA and give an overview of the WAI-ARIA attributes that are available to increase the accessibility of dynamic content. It will also look at the inclusion and implementation of WAI-ARIA attributes within Drupal 7, drawing on practical examples from the Drupal community.
