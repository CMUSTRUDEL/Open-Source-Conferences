Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Creating dynamic and accessible content in Drupal 7 using WAI-ARIA
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	You can create dynamic web content and make it accessible for people with disabilities too. An accessible website doesn't have to be a boring static website - don't let anyone tell you otherwise!

WAI-ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) is a W3C specification that helps make dynamic web content created using HTML and scripting languages more accessible. It extends HTML by providing additional attributes that can describe the roles, states, and properties of custom widgets so they are recognised by assistive technologies such as screen readers, making the content accessible to people with a disability.

This session will introduce WAI-ARIA and give an overview of the WAI-ARIA attributes that are available to increase the accessibility of dynamic content. It will also look at the inclusion and implementation of WAI-ARIA attributes within Drupal 7, drawing on practical examples from the Drupal community.

good afternoon welcome to my

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:10,080
presentation my name is Sarah police I

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,150
go under the twiddle handle Sarah TP and

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,429
if anyone's tweeting today you might

00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,880
like to add the hashtag for

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,529
accessibility which is a 11 why everyone

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,760
takes it for 2 l's or what they've

00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:22,590
actually done is they've taken the

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,800
little letters out between the a and the

00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:29,250
way and that's how we get a 11 y or ali

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,009
as we refer to it verbally today I'd

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:34,710
like to talk to you about creating

00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:39,540
dynamic and accessible web content in

00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:44,430
Drupal 7 using a w3c standard called way

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:46,370
aria so a little bit about me I'm

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:51,809
currently the web accessibility

00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:53,820
evangelist q4 access i cured in essence

00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:57,120
i just get out there and i talked about

00:00:53,820 --> 00:01:00,690
accessibility back in 2002 i can still

00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,160
remember what my I guess the blinding

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,949
moment for me understanding

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,750
accessibility was when I was at a the

00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,280
Australian accessibility conference the

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,799
Aussie way conference and someone

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,110
brought up an image map in a browser

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,229
turned off images and there was

00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,970
absolutely no way for someone who was

00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:20,490
for instance blind or vision impaired to

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:23,159
actually navigate past the homepage

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,409
because all of that information was

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,970
inaccessible and I still remember today

00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:31,110
the feeling of sitting there it was the

00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:34,380
aha moment for me throughout 2002 to

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,360
2010 I've done a variety of things I've

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,820
got to take you back round but i'm not a

00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:41,430
Devon I'm not a drupal developer I am a

00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:43,829
Drupal user access like you that i

00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:46,200
mentioned i work four runs on a drupal 7

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,000
site and is accessible as does media

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,610
access australia which is our parent

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,560
company and we've got a few other Drupal

00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,390
site hanging around so I'm fairly good

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,740
at using Drupal but I've never had to

00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:00,810
actually do any coding in Drupal so I've

00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,369
done a range of things I've got the

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,540
techy background I've got a marketing

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:09,030
background and in 2010 I came to work

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,369
for media access Australia and then when

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:14,330
they set up access IQ

00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:16,540
which is a social enterprise aimed at

00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:19,760
actually helping government

00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,560
non-government there's anyone who wants

00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,409
to make accessible content we're there

00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:28,459
to assist through training and services

00:02:24,409 --> 00:02:30,470
and content and I became full-time for

00:02:28,459 --> 00:02:32,780
access IQ and go around talking about

00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,220
accessibility and doing training and

00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:38,840
generally being a jack-of-all-trades

00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:41,299
pretty much so I wanted to ask how many

00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,579
people have heard any of the following

00:02:41,299 --> 00:02:45,620
statements people who use screen readers

00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:47,060
and just in case for anyone in the

00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,790
audience doesn't know what a screen

00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,440
reader is for someone who is blind or

00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,180
vision impaired and has trouble seeing

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,370
the screen there's a piece of assistive

00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,140
technology called a screen reader and

00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,180
essentially a screen reader uses

00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:02,239
text-to-speech technology to actually

00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:04,549
read out what's on the screen usually

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:07,010
that's delivered in an audible fashion

00:03:04,549 --> 00:03:09,470
through your speakers sound so on and so

00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:13,099
forth but it can also be converted into

00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:15,019
Braille and so for people who are

00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:18,230
Braille users they have what's called a

00:03:15,019 --> 00:03:20,930
refreshable Braille display and it pops

00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:23,329
up a whole lot of pins which the Braille

00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:25,160
language is actually made of little sets

00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:27,260
of six pins and depending on the

00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,060
orientation there is what letter it is

00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,209
so that information can also be

00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:34,459
communicated through a Braille device

00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:37,430
today you'll see a number of examples of

00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:38,780
screen readers one like one because I

00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,989
promised myself I wasn't doing live

00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,430
demonstrations and then they showed the

00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:45,650
Australian law website with all that

00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,750
would be cool to demonstrate and here i

00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:49,639
am doing live demonstrations again but

00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:51,340
there's also going to be there's four

00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:55,489
videos today that i'm going to play

00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,859
unfortunately this projector is 800 x

00:03:55,489 --> 00:04:00,049
600 really not up to the task the videos

00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:01,609
are quite grainy I will explain what's

00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:03,709
happening and by and large it is a

00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:05,870
screen reader reading out information so

00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:08,120
you will definitely hear it but all of

00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:10,430
the videos are up on YouTube as my

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,250
slides on SlideShare so all of the links

00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,930
and that are all

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,640
in five should I so don't worry about

00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,850
dropping them down or anything like that

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,459
so back to what i was asking who's heard

00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:22,470
the the myth that people who use screen

00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:24,330
readers just turn off JavaScript so you

00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:28,620
can't use JavaScript if you're building

00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:30,510
an accessible website few people maybe

00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,820
about five or six that's really good

00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:34,050
usually maybe because you're all here

00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,220
and you're all interested in

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,600
accessibility you're a little bit

00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,570
smarter than that but that's one of the

00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,490
myths of often um sort of passed around

00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,290
the second one is that you can't have

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:50,580
dynamic content on an accessible website

00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:53,160
which has anyone heard that one heard if

00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:56,600
it wouldn't believe it lovely and the

00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:59,370
last one accessible websites are boring

00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,380
not I've got a good audience this is

00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:04,140
really good well these are the through a

00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,730
look these are three myths that often we

00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,860
hear and often we have to debunking

00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:10,169
today talking about Aria I guess

00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,990
addresses these three myths first off

00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:14,640
that people are not turning JavaScript

00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:17,430
off anymore because there are ways to

00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:20,729
actually make JavaScript or Ajax content

00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,320
accessible that and you know by that

00:05:20,729 --> 00:05:24,600
there's also ways to make dynamic

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,270
content accessible and so we're getting

00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,220
away from that whole concept of an

00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:30,690
accessible website has to be boring I

00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:35,310
can't do all of those neat you know

00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:38,250
funky things that I want to do so I

00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:40,530
mentioned way Aria so Aria stands for

00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,270
accessible rich Internet applications

00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:46,130
and it's a standard that's published by

00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:48,930
the w3c a web accessibility initiative

00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:51,750
the web accessibility initiative are the

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:54,120
guys who also publish a lot of the other

00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:55,710
accessibility standards we came to or

00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,500
the web content accessibility guidelines

00:05:55,710 --> 00:06:01,470
which I'll probably talk and touch on

00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:04,620
today is often the main one we look at

00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:05,970
if anyone here is working on government

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:08,400
websites you probably would have found

00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:10,560
that they're asking for accessible

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:15,479
websites that conform with week 82 and

00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:17,210
this is because in June of 2010 the Agra

00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:19,220
mo the Australian Government

00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,770
management organization release the

00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:24,199
national transition strategy otherwise

00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:27,229
known as the NTS and the NTS essentially

00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:30,229
outlined that all government or federal

00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:32,509
state and territory websites needed to

00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:35,900
be level a compliant which is the first

00:06:32,509 --> 00:06:37,490
level accessibility by the end of 2010

00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,530
so we've been and gone past that

00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:43,639
deadline and they must be double a

00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:46,009
compliant by the end of 2014 so this has

00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,720
done a huge amount for accessibility its

00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:50,930
broad accessibility back on the radar

00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:53,720
and obviously the the demand for people

00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:57,849
who can create accessible websites and

00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,849
web content home has definitely gone up

00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:04,910
so the problem we really grapple with

00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:06,889
with dynamic content comes down to the

00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:09,320
information that is communicated from

00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:12,169
the user agent so the web browser

00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:13,940
through to the assistive technology in

00:07:12,169 --> 00:07:16,699
essence when you've got static content

00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:18,830
that doesn't isn't being driven by a

00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:21,650
scripting language there's a contract

00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:24,349
between these two items and so elements

00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,210
like roles and states actually are

00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:29,750
communicated through to the assistive

00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:32,570
technology so for instance if a screen

00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:35,930
reader hits a link it looks at that link

00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:38,449
it knows it's a it has an a href

00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,849
reference and so it actually says to the

00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:42,620
user that this is a link and then it

00:07:40,849 --> 00:07:44,630
will actually announce the link text and

00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,940
all of that information that the fact

00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:50,270
that it is a link or that it is a button

00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:52,009
is communicated from the UI or user

00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:54,800
agent through to the assistive

00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:56,960
technology but when we've got JavaScript

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,509
actually driving that uicomponent

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,539
naturally changing elements within the

00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:05,479
Dom on the fly what happens is if we

00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:07,969
don't use a technology like aria that

00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:11,000
information the changes in roles and

00:08:07,969 --> 00:08:13,099
states and actions values changes and

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,590
relations doesn't actually translate

00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:18,650
through to the assistive technology so a

00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:20,380
good example is some let's say you've

00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:22,780
got a new site and

00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,090
in the corner you've got a little area

00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:27,280
that is actually dynamically updating so

00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:29,770
every minute that someone's on our

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,660
website is actually up for the latest

00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:33,820
headline and it updates automatically

00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,979
now for a screen reader user whitwer

00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,169
what I should say is visually we

00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:39,669
recognize that something has changed but

00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:41,229
for a screen reader users they don't

00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:44,050
actually know that something has changed

00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:46,240
on that website so they either don't

00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,800
know that that change has happened or if

00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,960
they happen to actually be reading that

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,330
out at the time using their screen

00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:56,550
reader suddenly it changes from reading

00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:59,890
about you know yesterday heatwave to

00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:04,270
give you an example of an example what's

00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:06,880
a nice to use headline what's to flood

00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:08,440
some happening now so that's why we

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:15,850
actually need to communicate this

00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:18,880
information to the screen reader so area

00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:22,840
actually is all about HTML attributes is

00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:25,210
essentially an extension to HTML and the

00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,550
attributes actually a divided into two

00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:30,730
main groups the first group is we have

00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:33,640
wait Aria roles and within those roles

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:35,680
we have four broad categories we have

00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:38,920
abstract roles so they're actually not

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:42,790
used when we're creating a website but

00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:45,730
we do have document structure roles and

00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:47,650
we also have landmark roles the other

00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,740
elements we have our state's and

00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:51,910
properties so these are to actually

00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:54,430
indicate to a screen reader when

00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:56,410
something actually changes so this

00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:59,470
includes widgets that are updating

00:09:56,410 --> 00:10:02,710
content or are actually changing state

00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:04,750
due to a user interaction live regions

00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:06,940
so updating content that's just

00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,950
refreshing on the screen things like

00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,770
drag-and-drop elements tree elements and

00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:14,140
also relationship attributes so these

00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:15,850
can be used certainly in all of your

00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:18,010
websites but they're definitely

00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,540
important for web applications where

00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:21,400
we're trying to simulate a lot of those

00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,800
things that we're used to in a desktop

00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,240
environment which currently are quite

00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,610
accessible when you say

00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,320
running under Windows or Mac but now

00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,760
we're moving into a web environment and

00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,130
we need to make sure that all of those

00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,130
interactive elements are also accessible

00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:40,680
so what we'll look at today first we'll

00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:43,450
look at page structure and in particular

00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:46,360
landmark roles within you're going to

00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:50,200
look at aria live regions for updating

00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:53,920
content using Aria on forms and lastly

00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:57,850
using area for widgets and at the end

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,860
touching on Drupal and the what you can

00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:02,470
find what area elements you can find in

00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,480
Drupal currently I've tended to focus in

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:06,370
this presentation more on the area side

00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,740
of things rather than the rueful side of

00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:11,680
things first off I'm not a Drupal expert

00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,899
but secondly you guys know how to patch

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,850
modules and that kind of thing so it's

00:11:13,899 --> 00:11:17,620
more about communicating what area can

00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,459
do so that you know you can take that

00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,459
back into your workplace

00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:31,660
so you're probably familiar with skip

00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:33,580
links there's a success criteria it's

00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,440
probably the only success criteria I'm

00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:37,510
going to quote which is two point one

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,660
point four and it's all about bypassing

00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:42,820
blocks of content and essentially it's

00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:45,100
that we have repeating blocks of content

00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,110
on a website no our banner our

00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:50,080
navigation elements now as we get

00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:52,450
familiar with the website we might not

00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,370
want to hear all of the information and

00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:57,010
the banner and all the information in

00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:58,930
the navigation for a screen reader they

00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:00,610
actually read information out linearly

00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:02,680
through the page from the top to the

00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,360
bottom and so they're forced to listen

00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:06,640
to all that information before they

00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,320
arrive at the the actual main content

00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,480
area which is often the area that

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,430
they're interested in and so because

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,480
there was no way to actually mark up a

00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:18,430
page with semantic information we used

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,380
skip links which is essentially just

00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,660
anchor links that usually are put at the

00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:24,520
top of a page and in this case on the

00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,160
NAB site they've got a skip to content

00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,860
link that when activated takes you down

00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,650
to the introducing the new way to trade

00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:36,270
so it was really a workaround because

00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:36,270
there wasn't anything better in place

00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:43,150
what area gives us it actually gives us

00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:46,450
nine landmark roles that we can we can

00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:47,800
use to mark up our page structure you'll

00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,110
see that some of them actually do

00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,360
overlap with html5 for instance we've

00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:56,530
got a role equals navigation and there's

00:12:52,360 --> 00:13:00,070
the nav item in html5 currently screen

00:12:56,530 --> 00:13:02,950
readers support area much more than they

00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:05,260
actually actually support html5 elements

00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:08,050
so if you are coding websites in html5

00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:10,750
I'd still recommend you use the Aria

00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:14,410
roles even if you are using the html5

00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:16,150
nav element or so on and so forth so to

00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:19,330
briefly go through the nine rolls we've

00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:20,920
got an aria role which is banner which

00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:22,630
is essentially you know the information

00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,280
that you've got on the top that usually

00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:27,070
consists of your logo and so on

00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:30,460
generally roles are assigned to give

00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:33,940
them they can actually be nested there's

00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:35,740
the role equal search to actually mark

00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:38,110
after your search box this is

00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,300
particularly important for people using

00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:41,980
screen readers because often they will

00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,440
use them and rely on the search function

00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,300
even more than we do because it's an

00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,790
easy way for them to find if there's

00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:52,120
some information on the website or even

00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:54,250
the webpage so it's important to mark up

00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,070
that area we've got Roli calls and

00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:59,770
navigation now this role can be used

00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:02,050
multiple times the roles that only

00:13:59,770 --> 00:14:04,990
should be used once according to the

00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:07,770
spec our banner main and content in pro

00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:10,210
so we can have multiple navigation items

00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:12,460
role equals main which is essentially

00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:14,590
your main content area and you could

00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:17,770
also you can also have role equals form

00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:19,510
and roll equals application having said

00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:22,120
that application is not very well

00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:24,070
supported by any assistive technology so

00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:27,220
I wouldn't actually recommend using it

00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:29,050
right now there's also an area role

00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:31,510
equals complementary which is for

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:33,810
complementary information so you know

00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:36,400
often you've got your right hand side

00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:38,140
elements that might be promotional

00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,300
elements or something like that they

00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,710
could be assigned a role of

00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:44,020
complementary having said that

00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:46,090
complementary can be nested within main

00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,580
and we'll see an example in a minute of

00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:51,160
where that occurs and our last one is

00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:55,230
content info and that essentially is the

00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,230
elements usually found in the footer

00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,860
one thing to note is work for the roles

00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,290
that you can actually use multiple times

00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:07,620
within a web page it's really good to

00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:09,890
use another area element called or

00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,660
attribute I should say called aria-label

00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:15,779
so the example here is we've got to

00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:18,060
navigation areas one which has an

00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:20,850
aria-label of main menu and another one

00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:23,490
which has an area mat aria-label of

00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:26,580
submenu when a screen reader is actually

00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:28,890
skipping from landmark to landmark that

00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:31,290
Aria label will actually be read out so

00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:33,420
if there's three navigation areas on the

00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:35,820
page it will actually not only identify

00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:38,910
them as navigation it will also identify

00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:41,040
them by their label so that a user can

00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:43,410
actually differentiate whether whether

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:49,230
they've hit the main menu navigation or

00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:51,529
sub menu navigation so I'm going to go

00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:54,540
to the Government of Canada website

00:15:51,529 --> 00:15:57,089
later on in the presentation I've got to

00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,890
Drupal distributions that actually have

00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:03,260
been created be created to be accessible

00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:07,260
out of box and one is the weg the

00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:08,930
website experience toolkit and it is

00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:12,149
that actually has been designed by the

00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:14,220
Government of Canada and the government

00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:21,000
can't or government of canada website is

00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:23,130
based on this particular module there

00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,730
with me I've got a few things open okay

00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:28,680
so this is the first video apologies for

00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:31,470
it being grainy what I'm showing you

00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,839
here is is that screen reader users can

00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:36,450
actually navigate landmark roles in two

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,339
ways one way is that they can actually

00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:41,310
bring up a dialog box which is what

00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:43,800
we'll see here and I it will actually

00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:47,100
allow them to navigate the landmark

00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,630
roles in a tree type structure so you

00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:51,570
can see we've got some nested elements

00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:53,959
there we've got search arm which is

00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:56,520
nested under banner and we've got a

00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:58,870
complementary and content info which is

00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,410
listed you will listen

00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:01,410
under Maine

00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:15,450
landmarks radio object alt deep treeview

00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:20,060
navigation one the five banner expanded

00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:24,540
to of five level one search one of one

00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:28,079
level zero navigation three to five main

00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:31,770
expanded four of five level one

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:35,790
complimentary one of two content info

00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:39,600
two of two level one level zero content

00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:43,440
info expanded five of five level one

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:47,850
navigation one dove two navigation two

00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:54,660
of two level one filed sub bang one of

00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:56,430
four to Ellie so that's just giving you

00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:58,350
an example of how a screen reader user

00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:00,420
may actually look at the overall

00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:07,940
navigation structure of a page using

00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:11,190
landmark roles the next video now is is

00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:13,470
exactly the same page but instead I've

00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:16,890
actually gone through this page using a

00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:19,530
shortcut key so this the shortcut key d

00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,420
actually jumps from landmark landmark I

00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:24,560
should say that all of these demos are

00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:27,810
done using a screen reader called NVDA

00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,310
it's free and open source so it fits in

00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:32,160
very well with this conference you can

00:18:29,310 --> 00:18:34,710
download it and it's homegrown it's

00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:38,160
actually developed by two blind

00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:40,080
developers up in Queensland so if you're

00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,290
looking for a free screen reader to test

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,900
on windows that's your guy and if I can

00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:48,630
can't encourage you these guys are they

00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:52,320
lift off grants and will actually

00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:54,660
project funding to to do this so if you

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,640
are using it and you can spare some

00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:58,020
money to give them a donation you can do

00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,970
that through their website I really

00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,580
would encourage it because it's the only

00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:04,380
free solution out there by comparison

00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:07,070
you've got commercial solutions like

00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,830
jaws which is the the keys

00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:12,889
motion for the windows environment it

00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:16,070
costs about 1,500 dollars to buy and

00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:18,080
then the upgrades are also close to a

00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:19,519
thousand dollars so i really want to

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,840
support these guys and allow them to

00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,269
keep on doing what they're doing because

00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:25,340
they're just doing an amazing job and

00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:31,700
they're the guys that often implementing

00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:33,860
things first navigation landmark

navigation landmark site navigation bar

00:19:44,629 --> 00:19:49,840

00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:52,549
where it says navigation land max

00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:55,190
landmark site navigation bar that's our

00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:58,009
Aria label tag coming in and actually

00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:00,289
being read out and communicated via the

00:19:58,009 --> 00:20:02,500
screen right heading level two mean

00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:04,789

00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:09,710
complimentary landmark supplemental

00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:12,190
content heading level two let's just

00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:15,049
give you an idea of what a screen reader

00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:17,539
here's for landmarks and also how

00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:20,059
beneficial it is I would still encourage

00:20:17,539 --> 00:20:23,080
you to include skip links within your

00:20:20,059 --> 00:20:25,639
template the reason is that although

00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:28,669
screen readers are actually reading out

00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:31,309
landmark roles you can't actually use

00:20:28,669 --> 00:20:34,250
and get to landmark roles using your web

00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:37,129
browser and you know it is useful for

00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:39,139
people say with who are screen magnifier

00:20:37,129 --> 00:20:40,820
users who actually magnify the screen

00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:43,159
rather than having it read out to them

00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:44,450
they might find those skip links useful

00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,460
and at the moment because the web

00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:48,710
browsers don't actually support landmark

00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:50,450
roles and have you know shortcut keys to

00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:53,620
use them I think it's still good to

00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:53,620
implement both solutions

00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:03,020
so there's quite good support for

00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:06,380
landmark roles within assistive

00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:09,160
technologies jaws 11 12 and 13 has

00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:11,600
complete support chromebox which is a

00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,820
screen reader that works specifically

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,460
with chrome has complete support as well

00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:19,730
voiceover which is the max screen reader

00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:22,310
which works on mac OS x and also on iOS

00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:24,800
devices supports or landmarks except for

00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:27,280
forms and NVDA support or landmarks

00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:29,750
except our applications and forms

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:31,370
window-eyes doesn't support Aria

00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,050
landmarks but thankfully there's only a

00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:37,730
small base of users still using

00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:40,910
window-eyes so the second topic is

00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:44,060
actually using Aria informs the other

00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:45,650
third I think Aria landmarks and REO the

00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,300
arrow elements in forms are two of the

00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:49,910
most easy things to be doing right now

00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:53,480
with very minimal effort and just

00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:55,580
working it into your coding practice so

00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,160
there's a few attributes that can help

00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:01,340
the first is Aria required so this

00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:04,300
attribute actually is added to your

00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:08,000
input element and essentially means that

00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:10,220
the input element is a required form

00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,140
field so this will be communicated again

00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:14,270
through the screen reader so that when

00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:16,520
they use the tab into a form field it

00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:18,170
will actually read out the labels such

00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:22,700
as first name and it will also identify

00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:25,340
the form field as being required again

00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:27,620
if you're using html5 do use both the

00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:33,170
html5 required and also the area

00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:35,480
required another nice element is Aria

00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:37,610
described by so often there's

00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,920
information in this example it's where

00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:42,650
it's got extra information about the

00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:44,450
characteristics of a password or what

00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:46,130
you need two things you need to meet in

00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:48,320
order for your password to be valid

00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:51,530
there's different ways that you can do

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,690
that in forms without REO usually at a

00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:56,390
minimum we suggest that it's at the very

00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:58,020
very top of the the form field so as a

00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:59,970
person navigates

00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,100
we threw our form they hear all of the

00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,930
information about restrictions at the

00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,360
top and then they navigate through the

00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:08,670
form fields but an even better way to do

00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:12,450
it with Aria described by is actually to

00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:14,670
be able to associate the input field

00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:17,580
with that piece of text so when the user

00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:19,710
again tabs into that input field it will

00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:22,890
actually read out not just the form

00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:25,200
label but it will also read out the

00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:27,960
information that is identified in the

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:31,500
area described by so in this case we've

00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:33,600
got a paragraph with an ID of password

00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:35,250
required that says your password must be

00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,170
eight characters in length and include

00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:39,510
one number and that's linked to the

00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:44,030
input field using our area described by

00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:44,030
with a value of password required

00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:51,120
another nice one re are in balance so

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,820
this can be used in form validation if

00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,040
there is a field that is invalid you can

00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,380
actually inject an area invalid equals

00:23:56,040 --> 00:24:00,510
true into that form and so as a user

00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,370
moves through that form again when they

00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:04,980
get that form field it will communicate

00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:07,230
that that form field is invalid you

00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:09,630
could also use the area described by

00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:12,420
also to point to an error message as

00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:14,730
well that informs the user of the error

00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:17,450
and also gives suggestions on how they

00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,450
might fix it

00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:25,220
and the last two elements are Aria label

00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:26,960
and Aria labeled by so the purpose of

00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,900
these elements are the same but you use

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:33,679
Aria labeled by if the label text is

00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:35,990
visible on the screen if the label tech

00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:41,630
isn't visible on the screen then you use

00:24:35,990 --> 00:24:44,510
an aria-label nice example of how this

00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:47,360
is used is this comes from a web aim

00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:49,970
presentation it's a little form that

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,530
says self destruct this page in form

00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:57,650
field five seconds and they've used

00:24:53,530 --> 00:25:01,010
aria-label sorry area labeled by to

00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:04,100
actually associate with three elements

00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:07,040
associated with the label element the

00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:09,530
time element and the second element so

00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:11,809
it will actually read our self destruct

00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:14,080
this page in five seconds or was one

00:25:11,809 --> 00:25:14,080
block

00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:24,860
just checking the time because I have a

00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:28,190
horrible horrible thing of going over

00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:30,950
time our low region so I mentioned our

00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:33,230
live regions are fantastic for dynamic

00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:36,200
content like stock tickers or news items

00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:37,850
that are dynamically updating what you

00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,549
can do is you can actually mark a

00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:43,460
particular region within a web page with

00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:45,500
an aria live attribute and there's three

00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:48,590
values that they re alive attribute can

00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:50,179
take the first one is off and that this

00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:52,730
just means that the updates are not

00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:55,580
announced to the user the second one is

00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:57,860
polite and that means that when

00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:59,750
something updates those updates will

00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,399
only be announced to the user if the

00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,440
user is idle so if they're not actually

00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:06,500
reading out anything else on the screen

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,330
and suddenly they stop accessing the

00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:11,179
page it will actually then read out that

00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:14,179
information the last one is re alive is

00:26:11,179 --> 00:26:16,640
equals assertive so that's where the

00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:18,409
really important updates the updates are

00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,419
announced as soon as possible but they

00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:22,760
don't it actually interrupt the user so

00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:24,529
often uses when they're reading a web

00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:27,200
page they'll have used the arrow down

00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:31,309
key and it will read sort of chunks of

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,049
text maybe about 10 to 15 words so for

00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:35,090
instance therefore user was using that

00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:37,010
method of reading a page when they got

00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:39,320
to the end of that particular chunk of

00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:40,730
text it would actually jump in and alert

00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:45,919
to them to the fact that there was a

00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:47,510
change there are also other attributes

00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,179
for live really regions that are

00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:52,730
actually communicate relevant so there's

00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:55,669
an area busy attribute which takes the

00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:57,380
values true or false and the assistive

00:26:55,669 --> 00:27:00,230
technology such as screen readers will

00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:02,779
only announced changes once Arya busy is

00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:04,730
equal to false so this actually allows

00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:07,059
you some control about when you actually

00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:10,640
communicate something to the user

00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:13,039
there's Arya atomic which also takes the

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:17,179
values of true or false and it only

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:19,309
reads out actual changes or the entire

00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:21,620
live region so if you've gotta give

00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:23,720
Martin upper live region but there's a

00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:26,179
certain only certain text within that

00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,540
right live region that's updating then

00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:28,730
you

00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:30,710
actually asked it just to up just to

00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:34,730
read out those updates or to read out

00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:36,740
the whole lot of text again the last one

00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:40,130
is re irrelevant so the values are

00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:42,830
additions removals or text so you can it

00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:44,450
actually reads out the changes to the

00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:50,330
library j'en depending on what your

00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:53,120
value is so for the next demonstration

00:27:50,330 --> 00:28:04,460
we're actually going to go to the yahoo

00:27:53,120 --> 00:28:05,840
7 website so unfortunately this is

00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,360
probably one of the ones that's going to

00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,640
be really hard to read to look at it's

00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:14,540
this video is broken up into two pieces

00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:17,210
the first piece is I've got a Firebug

00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:19,250
open here down the bottom and we've got

00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:20,450
the yahoo search on the typhoon I'll

00:28:19,250 --> 00:28:22,820
give you some context because it's

00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:25,790
really hard to look at that what I'm

00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:29,900
going to start to do is type in Drupal

00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:31,550
into yahoo 7 and if you can see of what

00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:35,810
would actually be having to use this

00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:39,280
text down here which reads it's a div

00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:42,140
class and it's re alive equals polite

00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:44,420
role equals status and then it's got

00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:47,240
some text which at the moment is no

00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:49,160
suggestions and as I start to type

00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,020
letters in what you'll see is is that

00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:53,360
that no suggestions actually will be

00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:56,270
dynamically updating with the number of

00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:58,370
suggestions in the drop-down list that

00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:59,990
are there the second part of the video

00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,970
is then what you here with the screen

00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:04,070
reader so it will essentially be

00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:05,870
mimicking what you'd see in Firefox but

00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:08,800
you can have a look at it on YouTube a

00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,800
little bit later as well

00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,130
so we're still at ten suggestions

00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:27,910
and now we've hit five suggestions to

00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:29,890
suggestions and one suggestion search

00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:34,240
query combo box collapsed has

00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:38,020
autocomplete editable blank the expanded

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:42,940
are ten suggestions you ten suggestions

00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:46,450
p ten suggestions a ten suggestions l 10

00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:51,490
suggestions space tipsy five suggestions

00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:57,640
Oh to suggestions m1 suggestions drupal

00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:59,799
commerce in drupal commerce yahoo7 so

00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:03,280
that's actually using a combination of

00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:05,500
area librarians and also some other Aria

00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:06,940
attributes to insert that so that the

00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,790
user actually knows that there are

00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:12,220
suggestions coming up underneath that

00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:14,500
text box and I find this particularly

00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:17,740
important I remember going to the

00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,480
Woolworth site and on the wall worst

00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:21,160
form it asks me and I was actually

00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,470
testing this for accessibility it asked

00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,450
me to sign up but it actually has to

00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:28,240
verify your address against a central

00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:30,100
database and it had the suggestions

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,130
popping up in that same way as

00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:35,020
suggestions underneath and that was not

00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:38,650
communicated to the screen reader at all

00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:41,260
and so unless you actually typed in your

00:30:38,650 --> 00:30:42,790
address exactly right there was no way

00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:44,590
to know that if you just press the down

00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:46,270
arrow you would actually get a number of

00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:47,830
options and you'd be able to select that

00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:50,140
option which was being sourced by the

00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:52,390
database which would then have a much

00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:55,740
better chance of actually being correct

00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:59,640
so this is I find really important for

00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,640
forms such as that as well

00:31:05,669 --> 00:31:15,010
so the last topic is area for widgets

00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:16,960
now re for widgets is a huge area that

00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:19,120
you could come across and um at the end

00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,799
of this presentation I've got a number

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:26,080
of references including this code from

00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:28,120
accessible jquery UI components

00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,710
demonstration which is on github which I

00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,630
do encourage you to go and have a look

00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:34,679
at because it's got some really nice

00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:39,309
examples of what you can do with them

00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:41,970
with code examples and if I actually no

00:31:39,309 --> 00:31:41,970
I haven't got it open

00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:54,559
I'll just click through because some

00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:56,330
it's a really nice library so it has it

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,429
actually has examples for sliders

00:31:56,330 --> 00:32:00,679
progress bars menu bars buttons

00:31:58,429 --> 00:32:03,470
dialogues checkboxes accordions trees

00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:06,799
carousels tabs tooltips auto complete

00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:08,330
and date picker and if you become

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,510
familiar with a screen reader you can

00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:14,990
run the screen reader over the examples

00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:16,880
which come under here and actually see

00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:20,960
what their what's do what's happening

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:23,299
and actually have a look at the code so

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,039
in my usual way as I said I wasn't going

00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:28,250
to do live demonstrations and then they

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,230
this morning we talked about the

00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:32,390
Australian law reform commission and I

00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:34,100
thought ah look at that menu I wonder

00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:36,110
whether that menu is accessible or not

00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:39,169
so I'd like to run the screen reader

00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:41,120
over it it is accessible but I would

00:32:39,169 --> 00:32:44,299
actually like you to think when you see

00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:47,240
how NVDA runs over it is is it actually

00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:52,460
usable for our user who's navigating

00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:54,559
through a menu taskbar 42 news and media

00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:58,250
at australian look out of let's skip to

00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:59,779
content link just ignore me while i get

00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:02,299
to the video cable lock and blink

00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:04,399
contact list with large recent out of

00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:07,429
list shopping cart link ok so we're just

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:09,440
about to tag into the main menu list

00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:13,539

inquiries alt shift three at this point

00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:44,659
I think if you weren't interested in

00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:46,880
anything to do with about and you could

00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:49,730
have determined that from hitting about

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:52,340
the first time you've spent a whole lot

00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:54,740
of time listening to 13 extra items that

00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:57,080
you didn't really need to now look

00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:59,090
I've offer practical solutions and are

00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:01,429
more for things being as accessible as

00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:04,309
they can but the next demonstration will

00:34:01,429 --> 00:34:06,770
actually show how you can use Aria to

00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:09,590
actually be able to navigate and expand

00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:12,169
menu items and not have to make it into

00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:13,970
that very very long list type structure

00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:16,100
where essentially a screen reader has to

00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:18,169
listen to all of the list items and all

00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:21,200
of the submenu items before they

00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:25,540
actually get through to the end so for

00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:25,540
mba and the exit they'll strip

00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:42,940
this is the menu bar from the exam

00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:45,279
github example I just showed you the

00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:47,769
screen reader is going to be navigating

00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:55,839
through the menu which is file edit view

00:34:47,769 --> 00:34:59,470
and more options file submenu 104 edit

00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:04,210
submenu two of four viewed submenu three

00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:10,539
or four more options submenu 404 file

00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:12,369
submenu 1040 so all there's instructions

00:35:10,539 --> 00:35:14,019
at the top but all I was doing there is

00:35:12,369 --> 00:35:15,819
actually using the cross arrow to

00:35:14,019 --> 00:35:18,039
navigate through each of those menu

00:35:15,819 --> 00:35:20,440
items I could also use the the tab

00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:24,640
element the tab key at least to get from

00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:27,519
those items and once i hit file i can

00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:31,660
use the down arrow to actually expand

00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:36,910
out that submenu open one of six save

00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:40,980
two of six save has three of six recent

00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:47,589
documents submenu 46 close five of six

00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:50,349
quit six of six copy one the fourth full

00:35:47,589 --> 00:35:52,119
screen one of three so because I'm in

00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:54,160
the submenu i can actually just move

00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:57,489
across into the next sub menu as well

00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:03,930
which is what i'm doing their file

00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:03,930
submenu one of four open one of six

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:10,329
piled submenu one of four edit submenu

00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:12,609
two of four so again that's another way

00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:14,739
of interacting with the menu where I

00:36:12,609 --> 00:36:16,569
went into file I got into the submenu

00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:19,150
the beep you heard was me pressing

00:36:16,569 --> 00:36:21,339
escape which brought me back up to the

00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:23,499
level one menu item and then I could

00:36:21,339 --> 00:36:27,190
never grow up navigate across so that's

00:36:23,499 --> 00:36:31,029
a completely completely keyboard

00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:33,099
operable menu item by someone so it's

00:36:31,029 --> 00:36:34,779
not we tend to focus with Aria or on

00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:36,130
people who are blind and vision-impaired

00:36:34,779 --> 00:36:37,230
using screen readers because obviously

00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:39,330
it's the communique

00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:41,130
with the screen reader but in this case

00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:44,130
this is also for people with a physical

00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:46,530
impairment where they might only be able

00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:48,180
to use the keyboard or even to use

00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:50,760
what's called a switch device where they

00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:53,550
have one or two or three main switches

00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,170
that actually replace the more complex

00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:57,060
keyboard because they don't have the

00:36:55,170 --> 00:37:00,260
fine motor control that actually allows

00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,260
them to use the keyboard

00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:14,090
so I'm not going to go into all the code

00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:21,460
you can have a look at that on the the

00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:26,210
jQuery website so lastly looking at

00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:28,160
Drupal with weight area so I'll be

00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:31,400
completely up front and say that this

00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:34,130
might not cover everything that's in

00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,380
Drupal 7 and also coming in Drupal 8

00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:39,620
however I do know there are a number of

00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:43,910
Drupal 7 themes with gray area boron

00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:50,810
genesis panels 960 GS they all have Aria

00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:52,130
landmarks already as part of them some

00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:54,620
ways that you can also get more

00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:56,480
information or become involved with the

00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:59,150
Drupal accessibility communities so

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,730
there's the accessibility Drupal group

00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:05,150
group which is spearheaded by Mike

00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:08,780
deferred he does fantastic work he has

00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:11,180
contacted a lot of us actually just in

00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:13,340
the last week or so to say hey guys look

00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:16,280
if you've made any updates to Drupal

00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:18,110
core it from Drupal 7 please let us know

00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,410
because we want to incorporate that into

00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:23,840
Drupal 8 so the Drupal age becomes even

00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:25,460
more accessible out of the box so if any

00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:28,270
of you are working on accessible

00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:31,730
websites and haven't submitted that they

00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:34,850
haven't submitted any of those patches

00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:37,190
back up I would suggest that you do so

00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:38,960
he's also put together a list of Drupal

00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:40,100
sites in the disability sector and I

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:43,580
guess you know being in the disability

00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:45,440
sector they tend to be accessible so if

00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:48,410
you are looking at Drupal sites that

00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:50,510
have been built in and more than likely

00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:52,730
accessible then I'd suggest having a

00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:54,800
look at that list as I mentioned before

00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:57,830
there's actually two Drupal

00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:02,110
distributions that have focused on

00:38:57,830 --> 00:39:06,190
accessibility the first one is the web I

00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:10,310
think it actually should be web w et

00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:13,829
anyway w/e T which as I said was done by

00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:15,900
the Government of Canada up and

00:39:13,829 --> 00:39:17,700
can be downloaded the other one which

00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:21,749
was recently released at the end of last

00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:23,519
year by previousnext was a go so a gov

00:39:21,749 --> 00:39:25,739
has been packaged so that it is

00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:27,329
accessible out of the box it has Drupal

00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:29,369
core plus a number of modules that

00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:32,039
government may need to build their

00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:34,739
websites it's also got accessible things

00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:37,440
that fit the branding previousnext

00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:39,599
actually worked with our egg ammo on the

00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,930
branding so I think from memory there

00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:45,630
are six themes to go with a tub and

00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:50,940
again that can be downloaded and set up

00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:53,219
as well so a few things with Aria

00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:55,410
validation Aria attributes don't

00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:57,359
validate in HTML 4 so if you're using

00:39:55,410 --> 00:39:59,640
any of the standard validators it's

00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:02,160
going to spit up errors it doesn't

00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:05,849
actually mean that it isn't conformant

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:09,239
and you sort of have to ignore the the

00:40:05,849 --> 00:40:11,579
success criteria about some performance

00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:13,680
in the web content accessibility

00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:15,900
guidelines so you kind of just ignore

00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,459
that one with an understanding that

00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:19,140
you've done rigorous testing to test

00:40:17,459 --> 00:40:22,940
that your Aria attributes are actually

00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:26,279
working as expected you can use the

00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:29,039
html5 doctype with Aria markup and then

00:40:26,279 --> 00:40:32,729
you can validate it using the w3c and

00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:34,739
you mark up validation service last time

00:40:32,729 --> 00:40:36,779
I checked they didn't they didn't sort

00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:38,640
of say it was completely stable but at

00:40:36,779 --> 00:40:41,849
least it won't actually throw up all of

00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:46,339
the area's errors if you are using Aria

00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:48,599
attributes so if you date takeaways

00:40:46,339 --> 00:40:50,579
dynamic content no longer has to be

00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:52,979
inaccessible to assistive technologies

00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:55,079
and it's really nice to see an audience

00:40:52,979 --> 00:40:56,910
who I seem to be preaching to the choir

00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:59,130
in the sense that you alway already know

00:40:56,910 --> 00:41:01,739
and believe that you can start using

00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:03,869
area now if you're not already and there

00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:06,180
are easy wins like the landmark roles

00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:08,339
and the forms that you can't form

00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:11,640
attributes some that you can use now

00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:14,249
that are really easy to do and the one

00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:17,059
thing I always think is it's kind of fun

00:41:14,249 --> 00:41:19,559
you know we live for a challenge

00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:21,440
development is all about challenges is

00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:22,849
all about you know finding solution

00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,010
two things and accessibility is no

00:41:22,849 --> 00:41:27,380
different it is as much of a challenge

00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:28,880
and as creative as you know a lot of the

00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:30,290
other endeavors you do when you're

00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:36,650
solving an issue it's just a different

00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:38,599
type of issue the obligatory slide or

00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:41,329
don't forget to fill out the session

00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:43,130
evaluations so my session creating

00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:45,500
dynamic and accessible content in Drupal

00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:49,040
7 using way aria I've got a bitly link

00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:50,390
there which is actually you can have a

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,990
look at it SlideShare I'm not going to

00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:55,790
read that out and just a reminder so the

00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:57,800
slides are on SlideShare with all of the

00:41:55,790 --> 00:42:00,140
links through to the elements that I've

00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,720
referenced today the videos arm are on

00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:04,849
YouTube and when you visit the

00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:08,630
SlideShare you'll get the pages of the

00:42:04,849 --> 00:42:11,300
area documents so they're the specs some

00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:13,369
area resources that I think are useful

00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:16,310
particularly if you're getting started

00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:18,859
and even more Aria resources these are

00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:21,290
more library based ones so the

00:42:18,859 --> 00:42:23,390
accessible jQuery UI that we saw

00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:25,579
demonstrated before Yahoo accessible all

00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:28,700
of your code library yahoo has a

00:42:25,579 --> 00:42:30,530
fantastic accessibility blog it's a they

00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,359
expose all of the things that they're

00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:33,770
doing they shove all their code into the

00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:35,810
code library that you can go and have a

00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:37,609
look at so it's a great resource to go

00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:40,490
and look at what you can do without you

00:42:37,609 --> 00:42:44,260
and learn from what they've done and

00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:46,819
also the Mozilla developer network area

00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:50,089
it's great and it also has quite a lot

00:42:46,819 --> 00:42:51,740
of links out to other content great blog

00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:54,740
where someone sort of rounded up a lot

00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:57,440
of the screen captures of people using

00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:59,599
area in different situations and so on

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:04,310
so forth so all of those are available

00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:06,790
on the slots and I'm done and I'm on

00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:06,790
time I think

00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:14,760
fishers and please feel free they don't

00:43:12,869 --> 00:43:17,070
necessarily have to be our ela related

00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:19,230
if from if they're more broader web

00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:21,950
accessibility happy to take questions

00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:21,950
about that

00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:38,590
yes so the technical spec is the one you

00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:40,120
want to have a look at the authoring

00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:42,670
practices is also a good one the

00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:45,280
technical spec is the normative document

00:43:42,670 --> 00:43:47,650
the authoring practices sort of look at

00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,030
how you put that into practice and what

00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:51,870
have you the prime is a good

00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:55,060
introduction sort of an overview of the

00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:59,070
issues and what way area does and so on

00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:59,070
so they form the suite of documents

00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:16,770
yes the menus were accessible yes I

00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:18,810
guess yes I wouldn't be surprised if

00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:22,080
it's an avi website i didn't know this

00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:24,810
morning and I think it's using super

00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:26,280
fish from I can't remember how I looked

00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:29,060
at that but I thought I think it's using

00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:31,650
super fish I guess it comes down to

00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:34,230
accessibility versus usability often we

00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:35,820
get quite caught up in is it we take two

00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:38,310
compliant does it meet the success

00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:40,080
criteria and that menu definitely meets

00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:41,820
the success criteria it's keyboard

00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:45,360
accessible is reading out all of the

00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:47,100
labels for the menu items of that which

00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,810
is why I say yes of successful and it

00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:50,580
even had shortcut keys which you could

00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:54,150
hear the screen reader announcing so

00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:55,710
that if you were revisiting the site you

00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:59,250
could use the shortcut keys to get the

00:44:55,710 --> 00:45:02,280
menu by comparison though I guess with a

00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:04,140
menu of 13 items and thankfully that one

00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,640
that was the longest menu in in the set

00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:07,800
the others weren't nearly as long or

00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:09,990
didn't have any sub menus but from a

00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:11,880
usability perspective if you're going

00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:14,040
through we visually sort of look at the

00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:16,410
top level and say or what information am

00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:18,750
I looking for that's the element I want

00:45:16,410 --> 00:45:20,460
let me extend that and look at that the

00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:23,670
way this is put together that doesn't

00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:25,950
give the user that option because it's

00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:29,970
actually listing and them as a nested

00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:32,070
list so it does come back to I think

00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:34,020
what I call user experience and getting

00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:37,280
away from the checklist mentality of it

00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,280
is we take two compliant

00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:44,230
it is compliant out of the boxes yeah

00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,520
yeah that's right and look there's

00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:50,950
always there's always arguments also for

00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:56,350
backwards compatibility and graceful to

00:45:50,950 --> 00:45:59,050
get deep thank you I just I wanted help

00:45:56,350 --> 00:46:01,660
you out from an assistive technology

00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:03,880
perspective so I don't have all of the

00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:06,490
stats that you might like you probably

00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:08,710
would need to look at which of the Aria

00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:10,900
attributes were supported in what

00:46:08,710 --> 00:46:13,360
assistive technologies and you get into

00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:15,460
this bind because it's not it's not a

00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:17,230
problem for NVDA because NVDA is free

00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:18,520
and every time someone pushes out an

00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:21,430
update you get it in the same with

00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:23,590
voiceover and even Orca on Linux you get

00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:25,990
those updates just and part is part and

00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:28,090
parcel but for Jaws users and in the

00:46:25,990 --> 00:46:31,750
commercial as a commercial product it is

00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:33,820
the you know it has a huge base it's

00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:37,630
often cost prohibitive for people to be

00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:39,340
upgrading their technology and so it's

00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:42,880
it's all there's always a little bit of

00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:44,770
a juggling act about when do you you

00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:48,880
know make it accessible using newer

00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:51,580
technologies and when you don't you and

00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:54,310
I don't have a good answer it's like do

00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:58,210
you support IE 6 or not it's sort of

00:46:54,310 --> 00:47:00,570
that question that sort of christian any

00:46:58,210 --> 00:47:00,570
further questions

00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:07,549
wonderful well thank you all very much

00:47:04,609 --> 00:47:09,380
for coming please feel free to grab me

00:47:07,549 --> 00:47:12,410
if you had a question you didn't want to

00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:15,130
ask publicly look forward to meeting you

00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:15,130
