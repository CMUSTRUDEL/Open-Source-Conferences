Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Core Conversations - Upgrading your modules to Drupal 8
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	This talk, led by webchick, will demonstrate how to take the code from a Drupal 7 module and convert it to Drupal 8. You'll learn about many of the new Drupal core APIs that are coming down the pipe, as well as some "gotchas" to be aware of. The hope is that this talk can be both fun and educational, but also serve as "usability testing" for the Drupal 8 developer experience, since we will still have time to refine APIs before Drupal 8's release (hopefully with *your* help!).
