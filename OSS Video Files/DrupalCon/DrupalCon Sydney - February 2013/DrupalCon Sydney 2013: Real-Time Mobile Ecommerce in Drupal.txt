Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Real-Time Mobile Ecommerce in Drupal
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	Tired of waiting in line? Sick of having to plan your events far in advance? Luna Park have been listening and will be launching the first real-time, mobile e-commerce system built on open, web-standards (no specialised application!!) by the end of 2012.

Luna Park is one of Sydney's most recognised attractions, a theme park sitting right under the arch of the Harbour Bridge. In operation for over 75 years, Luna Park has seen many changes in business model, with the most important recent changes being the advent of the internet and mobile computing. They compete for Sydney and the world's entertainment dollars among a diverse landscape, and they've aimed to use technology to stake their claim.

Over 2012, Luna Park Sydney worked to build an innovative new e-commerce system that would work directly with their ticketing system in real time. This made it possible to buy tickets with a mobile phone and have them accepted at the gate, or have a customer order from the comfort of their lounge using the same system.

To do this, the team had a number of challenges to face, including working with Luna Park's ticketing system, and designing an online shop that was optimised for mobile devices and desktop alike. They used Drupal Commerce as a base platform and integrated with multiple technologies to deliver the solution.

Luna Park have also sought to embrace technology for other ends, including leveraging a unified customer view using CiviCRM and integrating advanced social media mining techniques to target customers. But it's not just for business, they also have provided a better experience to customers by making it easy for them to share the time they had at Luna Park with their friends on the internet. The online shop integrates with all of these systems to seed systems with data, connect to external networks and to prepare customers for their day.

This presentation will cover how Luna Park has used Drupal to accomplish all these aims, and what they learnt on the way.

Key Luna Park staff will also be part of the presentation team.

functional and he's also the the main

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:59,600
development lead on the dribble con

00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:02,129
mobile app as well so cross-functional

00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,559
we primarily do a lot of integration

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:08,990
work we specialize in e-commerce mobile

00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:12,600
development primarily around consulting

00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:16,530
development and training and we're also

00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,509
platinum sponsor the event so a little

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:20,280
bit of background just a quick show of

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:24,540
hands how many people are actually from

00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:26,759
Australia or this area no Luna Park ok

00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,509
quite a people which is great Luna parks

00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,460
a really well-known icon for Sydney and

00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,619
for those of you that don't know Luna

00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,740
parks pretty similar to like a six flags

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:39,720
or a Disneyland in terms of the Union

00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,780
amusement park they've got rides games

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,369
concerts and events as well their

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,619
concert events is one of the interesting

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:49,560
aspects to their business because the

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:52,950
fact that they have several venues that

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,250
they run you know commercial events as

00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:59,610
well as public events as well as they've

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,110
got restaurants they've got a pool and a

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,040
few other things that they all manage

00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:09,209
together under the same same banner luna

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:12,390
park is also a pretty historical venue

00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:13,800
as well it's the it's one of only two

00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,060
amusement parks in the world

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,370
that's actually protected by the

00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,790
government and his heritage listed is

00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:23,640
original to open in 1935 and been a

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:29,310
major feature for Sydney's harbour since

00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:32,460
then so one of the things that they had

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,440
in terms of marketing and IT they had a

00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,080
lot of really disconnected systems that

00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,300
widely overlapped so people that were

00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,510
actually doing marketing for the events

00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,910
business versus doing marketing for the

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:48,450
park itself and other things weren't

00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:50,580
really connected they also had multiple

00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,470
different systems for e-commerce so they

00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,740
had an online ticketing system at a

00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:57,450
separate process for doing gift cards

00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:59,160
being able to take online merchandise

00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:01,140
purchases as well and restaurant

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:04,170
bookings these were all kind of really

00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,610
disconnected but at the same point they

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:10,560
had a lot of the same information in

00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:13,290
them so there existed a kind of major

00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,780
problem for Luna Park because of these

00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:17,820
different disconnected systems it was

00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:22,350
really inconsistent amounts of customer

00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:24,540
information we had 45 actually 47 I

00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,610
think different data sources that we

00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,560
were actually looking at they had

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,489
customer information this made are

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,620
really hard to kind of communicate

00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:33,239
effectively with for the marketing

00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,400
department they couldn't actually

00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:37,770
segment their data very well and they

00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:39,060
also couldn't really track when they

00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,700
were segmenting who was actually

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,620
responding back to them very well so

00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:47,310
really hard to manage any of their

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,930
marketing campaigns the the other big

00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,820
part to their system was the online

00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:54,840
ticketing system some of you may be

00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:56,459
familiar with seed adviser it really for

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,130
them works well for their concert and

00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,540
event sales but the problem was it

00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:02,070
really wasn't converting well for a lot

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,950
of their online stuff particularly their

00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:07,410
tickets to the park itself they had over

00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,970
a ninety percent fall-off rate in terms

00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,519
of actually getting people through the

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,970
cart so that ended up being a major

00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,830
concern for them so the main goals of

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:18,120
the project and I should probably

00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:20,130
emphasize that there was multiple

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,229
projects here it wasn't just a single

00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,700
project but the overall goals were

00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:24,990
really to kind of allow the marketing

00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,639
team to effectively communicate with

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,939
their customers being able to

00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,900
segment the data being able to also

00:04:29,939 --> 00:04:33,430
personalize that information in a way

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:36,310
that they could actually get a better

00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,110
engagement right they also wanted to be

00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:41,219
able to improve the ability to measure

00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,539
and track their customer experience so

00:04:41,219 --> 00:04:46,990
being able to see who's actually coming

00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:48,939
to the park what kind of response they

00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:50,860
were having on their marketing campaigns

00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:52,120
was really important them as well to be

00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,550
able to make their future campaigns a

00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,099
lot more effective and overall there was

00:04:54,550 --> 00:05:00,129
a lot of big push to improve the online

00:04:57,099 --> 00:05:02,590
experience for customers we did some

00:05:00,129 --> 00:05:04,539
testing of around their existing system

00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:07,180
and most people found it extremely

00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:10,740
confusing really hard to work with and

00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:13,419
so that was a big part of improving that

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:15,879
so I'm going to cover each of these in a

00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:17,229
bit more detail but the overall kind of

00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:20,139
approach that we took was a very

00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:22,659
integrated approach 12 first of all

00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:25,210
centralized their customer data and make

00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:26,379
it accessible for them we wanted to

00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,789
provide an integrated ecommerce

00:05:26,379 --> 00:05:30,569
experience rather than actually have

00:05:27,789 --> 00:05:32,620
multiple different systems for them and

00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:34,539
based off of some other tests and we've

00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,770
realized that mobile experience for them

00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:37,270
was going to be really important so we

00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,689
try to optimize for that experience as

00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:42,939
well and then based off of what they

00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:45,310
wanted to do in their marketing we also

00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:48,930
realized that social media was big a big

00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:54,129
component for their customer engagement

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:55,659
so with a centralized customer view this

00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:57,629
was actually the first project that we

00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:59,740
actually kind of came on with Luna Park

00:05:57,629 --> 00:06:01,479
it's probably a bit surprising for

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,039
anybody who knows to be CRM to actually

00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:06,969
see it used in a very strongly

00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:08,439
commercial context civvy CRM is open

00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:11,919
source CRM primarily aimed at the

00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:14,830
nonprofit sector for membership

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,750
engagement and kind of fundraising

00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:21,370
opportunities is tends to be where it

00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:23,349
actually strives or excels but service

00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,279
orem actually was chosen mainly because

00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:30,310
the fact it had the ability to have a

00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:31,750
relationship tracking feature for

00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,189
families which was really important to

00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,669
an apartment they want to be able to

00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:39,909
track when their mom comes to Luna Park

00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:41,500
with their three kids and it made it

00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:44,000
really difficult to kind of

00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:46,460
do that with traditional crm software

00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,990
because of the fact that the kids even

00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,090
though they may have their own email

00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,740
address you couldn't actually use the

00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,509
email address as a unique identifier

00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:56,270
because the mom would often put the

00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:59,750
email address in the same field for all

00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:01,250
all five people or whatever so we had to

00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:04,639
come up with some unique ways of kind of

00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:06,349
tracking that in the first pilot project

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,080
that we did with them was to actually

00:07:06,349 --> 00:07:11,180
take about 10 of those data sources that

00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:14,629
they already had and implement those

00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,069
into city crm we ended up setting up

00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:18,860
custom fields for each of the different

00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:20,090
sources and also tracking the authority

00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,270
of each of those different data sources

00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:24,729
with MC serum so wasn't necessarily some

00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:29,419
of the data sources were going to be

00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:31,039
kind of archived and deprecated over

00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:33,020
time but we wanted to make sure that we

00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,810
could maintain the integrity of the

00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,800
system overall as well so that if you

00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:39,139
were looking at a piece of information

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,729
and it can afflicted with a different

00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:41,990
system you would still be able to kind

00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:44,150
of backtrack to where that information

00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:49,279
came from and see which was more

00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:51,650
up-to-date or which was more accurate so

00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,089
this was kind of the next big piece the

00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:55,610
integrated e-commerce and this is going

00:07:53,089 --> 00:07:58,250
to be to some extent what we focus most

00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:01,669
of the talk on in terms of the technical

00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:05,330
side the integrated e-commerce system

00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:08,509
primarily consisted of taking that civvy

00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:11,120
CRM system that we had built as well as

00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:15,020
Drupal using drupal commerce module by

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,729
on by commerce guys as well as then

00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:22,339
integrating that with the ride access

00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:25,969
system called sanyo so drupal there

00:08:22,339 --> 00:08:28,009
wasn't really a huge amount of custom

00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:31,370
work on in terms of the drupal side of

00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:34,099
things we really tried to focus more on

00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:37,099
the actual commerce side and the user

00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:38,630
interface side of things the difficult

00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,130
part then was actually then trying to

00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:44,779
figure out how all that was Ben then tie

00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:46,570
back into the right access system so

00:08:44,779 --> 00:08:50,290
sanyo is a company that actually

00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:53,510
operates all the tills at the park and

00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,269
have the ability to actually determine

00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:57,949
whether or not that

00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:59,360
that person or that ticket has access to

00:08:57,949 --> 00:09:01,550
that particular ride because the fact

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,959
that Luna Park has different heights

00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,779
requirements for the different rides and

00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:12,380
that's embedded in the ticket access

00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:15,110
control so through some various bits of

00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:17,149
research not only talking with the

00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:20,600
marketing department but also talking

00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:22,310
with users as well we realized that you

00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,300
know mobile particularly the hospitality

00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:27,680
sector is a really major focus for them

00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:30,680
they've got a huge engagement on mobile

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,120
and that was another big part of why the

00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,279
existing ticketing system wasn't working

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,389
is that it didn't work at all on the

00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:37,490
mobile there was a lot of things were

00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:40,310
broken they're definitely wasn't a

00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:42,019
mobile optimized experience and that was

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:51,440
a big fall off a big part of the fall

00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:53,899
off right as well so the last little bit

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,370
of this piece as well was then how to

00:09:53,899 --> 00:10:01,850
actually engage with the customers in a

00:09:57,370 --> 00:10:04,040
social way as well so Linda Park

00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:06,740
actually worked with a marketing company

00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,829
called centric solutions to develop this

00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,779
concept of my experience and the idea

00:10:09,829 --> 00:10:15,050
basically was that some would actually

00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:17,540
be able to come to Luna Park register

00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:19,579
their ticket for kind of online rewards

00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:22,310
and then Luna Park would be able to

00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:25,939
track that customer throughout the park

00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:27,829
using an rfid tag once they've actually

00:10:25,939 --> 00:10:30,769
then tracked them the customer would be

00:10:27,829 --> 00:10:32,689
able to share things through there there

00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:34,339
my experience account so for example

00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:36,740
when you would get off of a roller

00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:38,750
coaster you'd be able to see your photo

00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,130
that we've been taken of you and be able

00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:43,279
to share that directly onto your

00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:46,220
facebook and that wouldn't actually cost

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:48,500
the customer or anything but then the

00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,880
idea is that not only does that gets

00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,189
shared and improve the experience for

00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,079
the customer but it also gets Luna parts

00:10:52,189 --> 00:10:55,630
brand out into social media and then

00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,430
you'll see other people's friends

00:10:55,630 --> 00:11:00,079
experience that on social media and

00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:04,069
hopefully completely to come back to

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:05,300
Luna Park again so I've got a short

00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:07,189
little video this was a promotional

00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,600
video that Luna Park did that probably

00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:10,809
explains the experience a little bit

00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,809
more

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,150
fun is all about sharing sharing heaps

00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:25,190
of stuff

00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:27,830
like the latest apps

00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:30,940
cool pics slife spawn fun moments and

00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:32,590
all the good times killing your best

00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,420
totally set out for with your smart

00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:45,459
phones and stuff and

00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:49,980
share your experience is really easy to

00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:49,980
tell your friends when you can share

00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:06,800
swipe your wristband to update your

00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:06,800
status

00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,930
Oh

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:26,730
hey I

00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:26,730
you

00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:38,500
enhance your experience with my

00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:42,000
experience at Luna Park so as I said

00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:45,490
that was the the my experience part of

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,069
the marketing department the other

00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:50,589
aspect of it was the actual you know

00:12:48,069 --> 00:12:51,670
that's the in park experience we wanted

00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:53,649
obviously them to be able to get more

00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,329
people to the park and a big part of

00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:59,279
that was then the actual ecommerce side

00:12:55,329 --> 00:13:02,560
of that so the idea was to push this at

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,600
this kind of mobile optimized experience

00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,149
so that instead of actually standing in

00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,069
line waiting to get into the park you'd

00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:10,839
be able to actually again for those of

00:13:09,069 --> 00:13:12,819
you that are familiar with it you can

00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:15,730
actually get to Luna Park by crossing

00:13:12,819 --> 00:13:17,920
the the harbor on a ferry so the idea is

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:20,560
that you can actually get on the ferry

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,019
to Luna Park and in the few minutes that

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,329
actually takes you to actually cross the

00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:26,910
harbor you can actually go through the

00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:28,810
checkout process and my time you get off

00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:31,269
everything's ready for you all you have

00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:33,129
to do is scan you you're the barcode on

00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:36,069
your phone to be able to then get access

00:13:33,129 --> 00:13:37,959
to the park otherwise we had problems

00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:40,120
with well Luna Park had problems with

00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:41,529
defected on really busy days sometimes

00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:46,569
people will stand in line for up to two

00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:48,639
hours so the main results of this kind

00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:52,660
of integrated approach were really

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,040
pretty powerful we we work with them to

00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:56,379
kind of deliver this integrated

00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,300
marketing platform they actually won an

00:13:56,379 --> 00:14:00,910
award for the best digital marketing

00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:04,870
campaign from the International

00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:07,839
Association of amusement parks we also

00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:11,139
saw based off of our initial testing and

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,519
improved customer experience the initial

00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:14,319
testing and I should probably clarify

00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:17,680
here the reason why we don't have more

00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:19,629
concrete results at this point is we've

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,329
had a few hardware delays so it hasn't

00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:24,309
actually launched yet it should actually

00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:27,069
launch at least the e-commerce side of

00:14:24,309 --> 00:14:28,420
this should launch in about a month but

00:14:27,069 --> 00:14:30,370
the initial testing suggested about

00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:32,379
eighty percent or more of the customers

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:35,199
can successfully complete the e-commerce

00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:37,540
without any additional assistance and

00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:41,590
should really drive the conversion rate

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:43,060
a lot higher as I said the conversion

00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:46,900
right for a lot of this stuff is still

00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:48,640
to be fully tested but the main

00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,350
improvement for a lot of this for Luna

00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:53,830
Park is that it really reduces the wait

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:55,930
time for customers and a big part of

00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:59,260
that as well as it reduces their load on

00:14:55,930 --> 00:15:01,300
staff and resources by and thereby

00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:02,710
increases the customer throughput that

00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:08,560
they can actually get into the park at

00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:10,360
any given time so I'll do a quick stop

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,890
right now I've gone through this pretty

00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,230
quickly because I want to give a lot of

00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:15,880
time for QA and also for a demo a bit

00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,740
later but before I switch over to

00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:31,960
Jeffrey is there any questions on what

00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:43,360
I've covered so far okay all right thank

00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:45,150
you good okay sir there are several

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,550
different component as we said before

00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:50,800
the so the core of the e-commerce site

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:57,160
was built on Drupal commerce and we had

00:15:50,800 --> 00:16:00,190
to sort of so customize and build some

00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:03,520
custom components to so make it work

00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:06,490
with the external sanyo system but we

00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,530
also had in mind to do a few things

00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:14,080
specifically to target this mobile

00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:19,810
experience okay the sanyo api is sort of

00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:24,630
a it's an external sternal system that

00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:30,300
we have talked to from our end using a

00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:33,400
custom-built sort of soap library well

00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:35,770
well the actual soap library itself was

00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:40,210
sort of off the shelf PHP software and

00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:45,670
we just built some custom PHP classes to

00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:47,410
talk to it so to run the when the

00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:52,060
various functions that needed while

00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:54,430
running actually the aim of this was to

00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,390
sort of simplify the process as far as

00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:59,170
the

00:16:55,390 --> 00:17:01,180
ap I was concerned so that could make

00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:05,680
the minimum number of transactions

00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:07,780
between the drupal site hands the API

00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:12,220
this woods of cut down on number of

00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:18,250
points of failure and would ensure that

00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:20,290
we would have a more sort of a more

00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:24,270
consistent experience from the developer

00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:26,680
point of view in the beginning there

00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:31,120
beginning if I recall correctly that

00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:32,590
wasn't actually an API to begin with we

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,620
actually ended up designing the API to

00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:39,910
integrate with sanyo Sonia is a dotnet

00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:42,190
based system built on Microsoft SQL and

00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:46,540
a bunch of other custom proprietary

00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:49,360
software so we designed an API on top of

00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:51,490
that which then we got the sanyo

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,950
implementers to to write an exposed to

00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:55,420
us rather than actually connecting

00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,280
directly to the database and

00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:59,020
manipulating things to make sure that

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,820
the system was more robust long term and

00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,050
unattainable we wanted to ensure that

00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,130
there was an API for us to work with

00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:07,480
rather than trying to manipulate

00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:09,520
database tables directly of course

00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,500
between the design and implementation

00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,710
stage there were a number of changes so

00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:17,500
we looked into ways to sort of verify

00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:20,410
their end of things and to verify that

00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,970
we were using it correctly so we took a

00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:24,070
number of steps to ensure this was the

00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:26,560
case we sort of developed a couple of

00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:28,360
ways of visualizing the output from the

00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:29,860
API at our end to make sure that

00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,710
everything was coming through as

00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:35,530
expected and we use the develop module

00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:38,710
in some ways there we also developed

00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:42,610
various unit tests for the module for

00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:45,730
the API modules we use simple test to do

00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:49,300
it and that was very useful as it turned

00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:53,080
out because not only did it help us sort

00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:55,870
of reliably determine whether the api's

00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:58,240
were functioning as expected and whether

00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:02,920
we were using them properly but it also

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:08,280
helped us manage to pick up some some

00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:10,890
bugs and downtime issues okay using

00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:13,080
using drupal commerce as major boon to

00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:16,040
us and that it supports multiple payment

00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:20,130
payment gateways right out of the box so

00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:21,960
so we ended up going with secure pay as

00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,700
sort of our main payment gateway but we

00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,580
have the option to add many others

00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:29,700
including PayPal or any others should we

00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:31,710
choose it and what payment gateway we

00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,500
end up using doesn't really matter as

00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:36,750
far as the sanyo API is concerned as

00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:40,110
long as it verifies that that payment

00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,730
has gone through that's all good and of

00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:45,470
course we designed the checkout process

00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:48,120
in such a way that should the that the

00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:51,450
customer data was able to be fed into

00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:53,220
civvy crm with the requisite indicator

00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:54,840
of whether they want to be signed up to

00:19:53,220 --> 00:20:00,000
any mailing lists or anything like that

00:19:54,840 --> 00:20:01,860
just note as well that the original spec

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,350
also the big reason for the multiple

00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:06,240
payment gateways being useful is that

00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:08,760
Luna Park one of the ability to have the

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,380
customer a lot choice of different

00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,150
payment gateways as well so we

00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:14,310
simplified that for the first launch but

00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:18,290
they're going to roll out a couple of

00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:18,290
different payment options in the future

00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:25,620
now for the mobile experience we

00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:28,950
actually ended up formulating a

00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:32,040
particular particular form of design

00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:35,460
that was a little bit more than a normal

00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:37,230
responsive design this I guess we've

00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,690
called responsive design extreme it's a

00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:41,900
combination of different things that are

00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:45,030
informed by multiple different methods

00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:47,460
we were fortunate enough to be able to

00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:52,650
do a round of use of testing based on

00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:55,290
the initial fully initial layout of the

00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:57,920
site and we were able to determine a

00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:04,230
couple of bits of crucial information

00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:06,180
one of which is that in particular kids

00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:11,610
seem to be have an innate understanding

00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:15,300
of a lot of the sort of the conventions

00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:17,340
of the web but but unfortunately the

00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:21,779
people with the purchasing power are not

00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:23,909
white as blessed so insane

00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:27,330
we had to work at providing some

00:21:23,909 --> 00:21:30,599
alternative visual cues to sort of help

00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:33,090
people continue through the two new

00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:34,710
through the checkout process this would

00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:38,789
help to sort of reduce friction

00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:41,159
hopefully increase conversion as far as

00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:44,549
the mobile side of things when we chose

00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:47,219
a methodology based on rests which is

00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:51,019
which expands to responsive design plus

00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:54,179
server-side components this is because

00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:56,429
well we we determined that while

00:21:54,179 --> 00:22:00,899
responsive design is really fantastic in

00:21:56,429 --> 00:22:02,779
terms of sort of resizing and rebuilding

00:22:00,899 --> 00:22:06,179
content-based things it's not

00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:08,909
necessarily doesn't really suit the way

00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:11,999
that various application based sites

00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:14,129
work and this definitely being a very

00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:17,639
much a part app-style oriented

00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:21,450
experience sorry this was something we

00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:24,499
wanted to find ways to improve on and so

00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:28,259
therefore we try to figure out ways to

00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:31,919
optimize the experience for mobile users

00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:34,559
including sort of providing more touch

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:40,139
or answered Q's of reducing the number

00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:42,509
of fields various indicators to ensure

00:22:40,139 --> 00:22:45,869
that users received more consistent

00:22:42,509 --> 00:22:48,379
feedback on what was happening and we

00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:51,509
also ended up building a number of

00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:53,940
little JavaScript based tools that would

00:22:51,509 --> 00:23:00,059
help to emulate a native app experience

00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:02,399
for instance let's say we have and have

00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:05,609
a bunch of markup that essentially

00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:07,919
renders an accordion on the desktop

00:23:05,609 --> 00:23:10,169
version on the mobile version that will

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,539
render out as a list of links and when

00:23:10,169 --> 00:23:14,639
you click the list of links and overlay

00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:17,219
will pop in from the side showing the

00:23:14,639 --> 00:23:19,799
content of that accordion pain there's

00:23:17,219 --> 00:23:22,649
similar we've got a similar thing to

00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:25,080
work for forms too we were able to break

00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:28,049
it up based on field set and use the

00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:32,639
headings as links that would essentially

00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:35,559
pop in the individual components of the

00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:37,690
form in those field sets as overlays

00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:41,289
and I'll be demonstrating them a bit

00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:43,149
later the one other thing I just want to

00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:45,490
stress that's probably not obvious is

00:23:43,149 --> 00:23:47,259
that this kind of technique allows the

00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:50,049
ability to actually have a significantly

00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:52,090
different experience on the mobile sighs

00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:54,549
browser rather than the desktop based

00:23:52,090 --> 00:23:56,080
versions but you're still actually using

00:23:54,549 --> 00:23:59,139
the exact same system in terms of

00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,519
content and delivery but you've got that

00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:07,330
optimized experience and that's how we

00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:10,029
learn with this approach okay lead as

00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:12,190
far as the checkout goes we had to do a

00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:15,399
fair bit of initial data modelling to

00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:18,399
account for the the pricing structure of

00:24:15,399 --> 00:24:21,580
the tickets and to account for the

00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:25,720
various upgrades and offers the Luna

00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:29,470
Park wanted to offer so we so we set out

00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:31,360
various pricing rules based on taxonomy

00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:34,480
various ways of grouping tickets

00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:37,480
together so for instance we had a

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,549
particular tax on me that so dictated

00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:43,119
the particular height that belonged to a

00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:46,149
particular ticket and we also defined

00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:49,749
another taxonomy that correspond to the

00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:53,289
period of the year now this in despising

00:24:49,749 --> 00:24:55,559
period could sort of be defined as being

00:24:53,289 --> 00:25:00,369
a pig period or an off-peak period and

00:24:55,559 --> 00:25:02,529
whenever someone selected a given time

00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:05,379
of year to visit the park whether it be

00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:07,960
today or tomorrow or next week or

00:25:05,379 --> 00:25:10,749
sometime in the next three months they

00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,789
would they would see on the list of

00:25:10,749 --> 00:25:17,279
available tickets once a correspondent

00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:17,279
to whatever period was set

00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:27,250
we also included the facility to sort of

00:25:24,639 --> 00:25:32,740
offer add-ons and upgrades for tickets

00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:37,120
and we need to find those using using

00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:40,690
node references and and other entity

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:43,659
references so we were able to we were

00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:44,830
able to check when their user was going

00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:47,740
to check out whether they had a

00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:51,039
particular type of product in their cart

00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:54,070
and and then see okay are there any

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:56,289
potential upgrades for this ticket are

00:25:54,070 --> 00:26:01,179
there any potential add-ons and we were

00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:03,789
able to programmatically display a form

00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:07,960
saying do you want to add any of this to

00:26:03,789 --> 00:26:12,970
your car or do you want to upgrade this

00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:15,399
particular product however since we

00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:17,889
figured that mobile users were not

00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:20,799
necessarily interested in going into

00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:22,659
depth with their order or anything say

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:24,820
they're on the ferry over and they just

00:26:22,659 --> 00:26:28,570
want to be able to buy a ticket quickly

00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:32,590
we were we specifically chose to ignore

00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:35,409
that and we were able to do so by using

00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:38,200
some of our client side tools to tell

00:26:35,409 --> 00:26:41,559
the server and whether or not they're on

00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:44,620
a mobile device and if that's the case

00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:46,720
it would just opted to skip those steps

00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:50,320
entirely and go straight to the checkout

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:53,019
page and we were able to use a number of

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,700
different tools to sort of get that I

00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:58,240
guess responsive experience at the

00:26:54,700 --> 00:27:03,549
server and including including just some

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:05,320
simple JavaScript the simple JavaScript

00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:08,970
client detection as well as using

00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:08,970
detector module and a few other things

00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:15,230
you want to the Des Moines

00:27:17,549 --> 00:27:24,389
so if you want to go ahead and escape so

00:27:22,289 --> 00:27:26,909
this is the the current design for luna

00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:28,379
park at the desktop version what's

00:27:26,909 --> 00:27:29,610
probably gonna be easiest for us to kind

00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:31,350
of demonstrate how some of this will

00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:32,970
operate is to actually go through the

00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:35,009
checkout process but actually show how

00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:38,159
this thing work responds on each of the

00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:39,809
different screens so i probably should

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,309
actually get out of full screen and then

00:27:39,809 --> 00:27:47,399
actually be able to change that and

00:27:41,309 --> 00:27:52,249
you'll see how who wants to go for it

00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:52,249
twice all right we'll do it twice then

00:27:55,779 --> 00:27:59,979
so one of the things that came out of

00:27:57,639 --> 00:28:03,940
the user testing was that because of the

00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:06,700
nature of this ticketing system or the

00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:08,799
ticket pricing structure a lot of

00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:10,539
computers were actually really confused

00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:12,249
about how to actually purchase tickets

00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:13,659
based off of height so one of the things

00:28:12,249 --> 00:28:17,649
that we introduced was this kind of

00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:18,759
ability to educate the users to to kind

00:28:17,649 --> 00:28:20,229
of teach them that this is how things

00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:21,549
are going to go in the future and if

00:28:20,229 --> 00:28:23,919
they have any questions it takes them

00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:25,239
back to their main corporate site where

00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,820
all that information is explained in

00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:29,139
more detail but it doesn't require us to

00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:31,389
actually go through it in the checkout

00:28:29,139 --> 00:28:36,059
process but this is obviously something

00:28:31,389 --> 00:28:36,059
that'll be bypass on the mobile version

00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:43,529
one thing to note of course is that the

00:28:39,369 --> 00:28:46,779
height indicator only being relevant for

00:28:43,529 --> 00:28:49,809
daily tickets is something we were able

00:28:46,779 --> 00:28:52,629
to skip and tile if someone decided to

00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:56,320
say go straight for annual annual passes

00:28:52,629 --> 00:28:57,549
in a future iteration of the site we're

00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,309
also going to be launching with

00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:05,279
merchandise so this pop-up window is

00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:05,279
only relevant for daily passes

00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:16,170
so this is this is the ability to

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,390
actually then choose a particular date

00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:20,220
period we gave basically a couple of

00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:22,440
shortcuts for today and tomorrow and

00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:26,550
then most of the functionality went into

00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,960
the selecting of the date period this is

00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:29,940
part of the text automated that we were

00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,580
talking about earlier and this actually

00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,170
then allows you to select or based off

00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:36,330
of this selection you'll get a different

00:29:34,170 --> 00:29:38,660
list of tickets on different pricing of

00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,660
tickets

00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:54,020
so you can see here that this was

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,490
potentially a bit complicated because

00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,140
the only do you have different types of

00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:58,910
tickets but potentially within the

00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:01,610
different tickets you had different

00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:05,350
options the way this is actually done is

00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:08,360
using products or people familiar with

00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:13,190
drupal commerce a product display node

00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:15,230
is actually in each accordion screen and

00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:17,570
then the different product variants are

00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:21,049
what actually then go vertically in that

00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:22,460
table and that that is also dependent on

00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:26,120
the different types of products that

00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:28,309
we're using as well and it may sound

00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:31,520
easier to actually write a lot of the

00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:32,870
stuff kind of hard coded and simplified

00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,120
but because of the fact that Luna Park

00:30:32,870 --> 00:30:36,409
is constantly changing their tickets we

00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,549
needed to make a system that was going

00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:40,190
to be flexible enough that they could

00:30:37,549 --> 00:30:42,020
actually get these kind of displays

00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:44,200
without having to constantly rebuild

00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:44,200
them

00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,950
you can see there gets you a little

00:30:59,629 --> 00:31:02,480
notification that you vet it to your

00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:04,129
cart you get the car on the side that's

00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:12,340
all pretty standard triple commerce

00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:12,340
functionality the other according pieces

00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,080
so you can see the different types of

00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:22,779
tickets then have a different type of

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:25,259
display and all of the text is obviously

00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:27,220
user editable so they can also introduce

00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:30,370
images or other kind of marketing

00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:32,590
promotions for the same point a lot of

00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:36,460
this information then is actually linked

00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:40,409
to the actual ticketing ticket accessing

00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:40,409
system sanyo to pull that information

00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:24,580
a lot of these fields are pretty

00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,280
standard experiences when you're

00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:28,540
actually working motorable commerce

00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,100
there are a couple of unique things so

00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:32,850
for example being able to insert the

00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:35,140
terms and conditions as well as we were

00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,580
inserting a custom field to actually

00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:41,070
determine whether or not the user wants

00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:44,310
to be signed up to various lunapark

00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:44,310
mailing lists

00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:56,670
and I forgot to mention as well at the

00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:59,730
beginning that this all of this at the

00:32:56,670 --> 00:33:02,100
moment was actually being hosted with

00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:04,200
our partner anchor which you may have

00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:09,420
seen downstairs they're also sponsoring

00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:11,640
triple silicon however I'm running this

00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,680
over my phone so that the delay on here

00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,630
is more than likely because of my phone

00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:18,050
internet connection not because of their

00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:18,050
hosting

00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,630
and I'll probably point this out on the

00:33:35,169 --> 00:33:39,520
next go around but for those that

00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:41,230
haven't you may look at also the

00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,140
checkout process and how the buttons

00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:45,490
actually change so one of the things we

00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,049
needed to be able to do to improve the

00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:50,260
customer experience was conditionally

00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:52,289
change what actually the buttons were in

00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:55,919
terms of moving forward and moving back

00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:58,570
and so once you've actually completed

00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:01,419
you also get a nice little check out

00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:03,940
complete now this particular purchase

00:34:01,419 --> 00:34:05,950
we've purchased 20 different tickets so

00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:09,490
you can actually download the individual

00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:12,520
tickets as a PDF and you'll then be able

00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:13,899
to actually get a barcode which then

00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:17,639
when you actually take through the park

00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:17,639
you'll actually be able to scan and

00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:28,950
ok

00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:40,270
you know

00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:55,270
I'll talk about a few other things as

00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:57,160
well one of the things that will be

00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:59,260
coming in future versions of this as

00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,869
well as the ability to actually have a

00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:03,520
more personalized online experience as

00:35:01,869 --> 00:35:05,319
well so right now we're not actually

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:07,690
even though we're collecting all of the

00:35:05,319 --> 00:35:09,940
information and being able to store that

00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:11,770
in the CRM for future marketing

00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:15,190
opportunities we're not actually

00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:17,619
creating an account for them in I took

00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:18,819
the back new latest version we take it

00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:21,520
back we are actually creating an account

00:35:18,819 --> 00:35:23,560
for them the first version is we didn't

00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:25,210
actually create accounts but we are

00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:28,960
creating accounts now to allow them to

00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:30,460
actually reclaim their tickets but the

00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,630
next version is also expected to have a

00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:34,150
more personalized experience where they

00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,890
can be able to customize what types of

00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,000
notifications they want to be or what

00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:41,589
type of mailing list they want to be

00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,750
involved in as well as getting games on

00:35:41,589 --> 00:35:45,550
lines physically for Luna Park and those

00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:49,450
kinda things as well and develop the

00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:52,630
more mature online experience so this is

00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:53,890
the mobile experience you notice their

00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:56,020
first page is not significantly

00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:59,530
different but it's obviously optimized

00:35:56,020 --> 00:36:01,839
smaller graphics and things move down

00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:03,250
below but now you'll begin to see that

00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,560
things are quite different instead of

00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:08,020
actually having a longer table you've

00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:10,450
got get to be able to actually see how

00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:14,910
these things become list items and use

00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:14,910
kind of more native style widgets

00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:21,680
we shall probably go back through and

00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:29,140
show them how to select how the

00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:29,140
different yeah

00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:34,890
so you can see this is a completely

00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:37,140
different style so instead of actually

00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:38,640
having just a you know a button or

00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:41,640
whatever else this actually becomes a

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,560
drop-down and then you get the same

00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,510
options as you would in the desktop

00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,270
version but the experience is obviously

00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:50,930
optimized for touch the buttons are

00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:59,820
obviously bigger there's a stronger

00:36:50,930 --> 00:37:01,320
touch element for them and then you'll

00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,580
see here there's also a lot of things

00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,810
that are probably hidden which you

00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:06,210
probably would have noticed in the

00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:08,220
desktop version so the little sidebar

00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:11,520
helper around the different height

00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:14,610
restrictions and those things those have

00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,890
all been kind of hidden and he passed

00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:19,680
away and when you actually open up the

00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:21,660
various tickets instead of actually

00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,400
having the same kind of graphical issue

00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:25,260
you actually then have a more

00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,000
streamlined mobile experience where you

00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:30,210
can actually then pick from there and

00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,700
you don't actually enter in the quantity

00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:34,110
that you want you just add individual

00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,540
into your cart considering that you're

00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:38,400
unlikely to buy both purchases on your

00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:41,240
mobile phone or more than likely justify

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,240
a few or one

00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:46,730
ok

00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:50,730
you can see the shopping cart is now all

00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:54,170
similar to the bottom since it's a

00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:54,170
secondary piece of navigation

00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:05,590
and then the shopping cart experience

00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,540
now when you actually go to check out

00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:08,890
one of the things that we realized on

00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:11,200
the mobile experiences that it's really

00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:12,640
a poor experience to have the same you

00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,400
know you still need the same number of

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,020
fields getting a really really long

00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:20,020
scrolling list of fields on a mobile

00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:21,369
experiences really poor so we broke it

00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:23,260
up in a way that allows people to

00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:24,700
actually enter it in and piecewise and

00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,500
they don't get scared about actually

00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,660
having to enter into so much information

00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:30,160
and then we visually indicate when

00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:33,210
they've successfully completed each

00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,210
little piece of the form

00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:09,530
so you can see there the different

00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:09,530
visual indicators on the right

00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:21,700
you get a file and chance to review your

00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:25,470
order which is all pretty standard stuff

00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:25,470
put your credit card details

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,990
and then you can put shorter

00:39:50,070 --> 00:39:54,210
okay so now you actually have a

00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:55,560
different style of the completion page

00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:58,260
even though the information again is the

00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:00,570
same to get some information about what

00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:03,930
is good to bring if you for example are

00:40:00,570 --> 00:40:06,560
not actually already on your way get the

00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:09,540
ability to also share that information

00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:14,820
with your friends in terms of social

00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:17,790
media and there's no pork information

00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:19,110
the last bit is actually then view your

00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,280
tickets actually on your phone and be

00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:22,580
able to actually then get into the park

00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,580
with that

00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:31,380
and this this is going to be further

00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:33,840
optimizing before we actually really sit

00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:36,180
this is still kind of dummy marketing

00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:39,320
material but then you'll be able to

00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:39,320
actually scan this at the park

00:40:46,099 --> 00:40:49,720
that covers most of demo

00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:11,770
yep

00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:21,630
no no no there there was some issues

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,550
that we had to deal with in terms of the

00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:26,160
standards of the different bar codes so

00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:27,809
as long as we actually use one of the

00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:32,160
standard bar codes it doesn't really

00:41:27,809 --> 00:41:33,599
matter about the scale so yeah but we

00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:41,220
did we did fight some of the standards

00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:43,500
initially so some next steps as I

00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:45,450
mentioned earlier a lot of this other

00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:48,329
stuff is already launched so CBC RM is

00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:50,280
already there the my mark my experience

00:41:48,329 --> 00:41:51,480
stuff has already been implemented and

00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,770
the ecommerce stuff is developed but

00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,380
it's the last piece that hasn't really

00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:56,849
been launched yet so that's going to be

00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:59,309
launched in approximately the next

00:41:56,849 --> 00:42:02,190
couple of weeks probably month just when

00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:05,040
we finish dealing with a few minor

00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:07,500
hardware issues the other big piece then

00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,200
is then to finish centralizing the CRM

00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,970
to integrate with the my experience and

00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:14,309
other data sources which will allow

00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:16,319
further kind of in park marketing

00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:17,670
opportunities the idea is once all of

00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:20,670
this stuff is integrated and tied

00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:22,680
together when somebody actually buy

00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:25,020
something online all that information is

00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:27,390
in the crm they come to the park they'll

00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:29,040
be able to then register for my

00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:31,020
experience and then you'll be able to do

00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,359
marketing opportunities for example when

00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:36,030
somebody actually gets off of the roller

00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:37,650
coaster they've come out you'll be able

00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:39,119
to actually see and know that they've

00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:41,690
just come off so the right next to the

00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,520
food port be able to then SMS them a

00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:46,829
10-percent discount for food and be able

00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:48,510
to market them in a way that can

00:42:46,829 --> 00:42:53,130
hopefully drive more business within the

00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:55,140
park as well so as well as and that's

00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:56,609
just one really specialized example but

00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:00,480
there's obviously tons of opportunities

00:42:56,609 --> 00:43:02,549
there but this often this then provides

00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:03,660
a platform for them to do a lot of

00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:06,809
different creative marketing

00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:08,849
opportunities as well as better manage

00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:13,579
their customer experience because

00:43:08,849 --> 00:43:16,170
obviously that's the best thing so

00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:19,980
that's it if anybody's got any questions

00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:22,430
we've got think just about 15 minutes so

00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,430
we're doing

00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:27,390
yes

00:43:28,799 --> 00:43:37,599
um there was a few few struggling pieces

00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:39,669
one of the things it was difficult to

00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:41,559
begin with was that this the civvy serum

00:43:39,669 --> 00:43:44,829
component actually started a little over

00:43:41,559 --> 00:43:47,559
a year ago by year and a half ago so

00:43:44,829 --> 00:43:48,880
about halfway through some of the stuff

00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:50,529
that we were doing with the commerce

00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,469
stuff we realized that we needed to

00:43:50,529 --> 00:43:55,869
actually upgrade to a significant major

00:43:53,469 --> 00:43:57,279
version of civ ecrm but that actually

00:43:55,869 --> 00:43:58,929
helped us a lot because the older

00:43:57,279 --> 00:44:01,209
version of serum was harder to work with

00:43:58,929 --> 00:44:04,029
the newer version see with serum had a

00:44:01,209 --> 00:44:05,469
much better API in terms of the web

00:44:04,029 --> 00:44:09,789
services and stuff and also allowed us

00:44:05,469 --> 00:44:11,140
the ability to make it easier for some

00:44:09,789 --> 00:44:13,839
of the future integrations we want to do

00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:15,849
to actually link so this is connected to

00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:17,439
their commerce website and will also

00:44:15,849 --> 00:44:19,269
then be connected to their remain

00:44:17,439 --> 00:44:21,219
corporate site but they've got a set of

00:44:19,269 --> 00:44:23,650
I think about another nine different

00:44:21,219 --> 00:44:26,799
websites that they all want to pull

00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:28,559
their information into civvy crm from so

00:44:26,799 --> 00:44:31,779
that's going to make that a lot easier

00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:35,079
however there was also a little bit of

00:44:31,779 --> 00:44:39,130
struggle with the fact that civil serum

00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:40,779
is kind of geared towards nonprofits

00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:43,979
rather than kind of a commercial side of

00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:45,819
things so I see a little bit of

00:44:43,979 --> 00:44:48,039
potential in the future for there to be

00:44:45,819 --> 00:44:50,109
some limitations just because the fact

00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:52,359
that one of the things that they want to

00:44:50,109 --> 00:44:55,419
pull in is there actual sales team from

00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:57,159
the events department and because the

00:44:55,419 --> 00:44:59,559
civvy CRM doesn't really have a sales

00:44:57,159 --> 00:45:01,329
pipeline kind of method built into it

00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:03,369
there's going to probably be a little

00:45:01,329 --> 00:45:05,619
bit of custom software that needs to be

00:45:03,369 --> 00:45:08,949
written there to provide a proposal

00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:11,099
system within CRM does that answer your

00:45:08,949 --> 00:45:11,099
question

00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:43,019
it is i mean i guess the point i would

00:45:40,709 --> 00:45:45,869
probably make their that right now we're

00:45:43,019 --> 00:45:47,849
only doing one way integration or you

00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:50,299
know in terms of the civvy crm component

00:45:47,849 --> 00:45:53,640
so it's only data coming into city crm

00:45:50,299 --> 00:45:56,339
and so but there and that's definitely

00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:59,249
the next piece that i mentioned for the

00:45:56,339 --> 00:46:00,660
cv crm integration is i'm getting a lot

00:45:59,249 --> 00:46:02,519
of these other data sources to come in

00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:06,719
and actually doing two-way integration

00:46:02,519 --> 00:46:08,130
for those that's you know we didn't want

00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:09,509
to kind of tackle the super hard problem

00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:11,209
first we want to tackle the easy one and

00:46:09,509 --> 00:46:14,609
see if it actually worked well

00:46:11,209 --> 00:46:16,979
particularly because a lot of those data

00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:22,469
sources we're trying to cut it down i

00:46:16,979 --> 00:46:25,859
mean even even half of that going from

00:46:22,469 --> 00:46:30,989
45 to 25 would be a big improvement just

00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:33,289
in terms of manageability but we'll see

00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:33,289
where we go

00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:48,110
yeah i'll add Jeffrey that's probably

00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:50,690
okay yes I know some of the content is

00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:53,810
just being shown or hidden and you can

00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:56,210
do that with simple media queries we

00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:58,820
some extent yes we use simple media

00:46:56,210 --> 00:47:00,410
queries but we also use a JavaScript

00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:02,720
based method which we try and detect

00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:05,990
these size of the browser and a couple

00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:08,630
of other aspects and moreover in the

00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:11,450
case of those sort of more complex user

00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:15,800
interface bits such as working with the

00:47:11,450 --> 00:47:18,920
accordion and the list of items we use

00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:23,930
that we try and use the JavaScript based

00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:26,660
size detection to to determine what

00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:29,210
aspect we should be displaying and then

00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:37,070
we sort of essentially initialize the

00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:38,870
proper widget for that aspect and pretty

00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:40,910
much but we try and keep the markup as

00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:48,620
lean as possible to ensure that it's not

00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:50,270
it's not too much overhead i should add

00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:53,180
one other thing that we didn't actually

00:47:50,270 --> 00:47:55,670
use on this project but has come out of

00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:56,720
some of this work which is a module we

00:47:55,670 --> 00:48:00,020
contributed back to the Drupal community

00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:02,150
called detector and it's a really cool

00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:05,600
little module for doing some of this

00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:08,120
stuff because it allows you to detect

00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:10,150
different properties of the browser and

00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:12,650
screen size is one of them and then

00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:14,570
conditionally change what you're going

00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:17,390
to do so we've built in the ability to

00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:19,700
actually alter it based off a context

00:48:17,390 --> 00:48:21,980
module and I think there's also some

00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:23,510
rules integration as well so you can do

00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:25,610
a lot of kind of really basic things

00:48:23,510 --> 00:48:27,380
using that without a whole lot of

00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:30,950
additional effort on the front end if

00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:32,390
you want to go down that path still need

00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:34,930
to do a bit of work on it before it's

00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:34,930
ready for prime time

00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:55,500
ok the price variation with taxonomy is

00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:59,130
probably explained like this the

00:48:55,500 --> 00:49:02,230
essentially we have several different

00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:04,420
variations of product per sort of

00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:07,150
product display if you will the product

00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:09,990
displays are a type of node and the

00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:13,090
product variations are essentially a

00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:16,810
commerce specific entity that are linked

00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:19,000
from the product display and we have

00:49:16,810 --> 00:49:21,700
different prices on all those variations

00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,720
and that's pretty much how we are able

00:49:21,700 --> 00:49:27,940
to sort of modify the price like that

00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:32,520
you would able to you'll be able to do

00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:35,260
the same sort of thing by say having

00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:37,119
Savior selling cushions or something if

00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:39,580
you want to sell different sizes you

00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:42,010
would set up size as a given taxonomy

00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:44,440
and assign different terms to your

00:49:42,010 --> 00:49:47,710
different product variations and you

00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:51,840
could do the same with colors or pretty

00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:51,840
much any other property you feel like I

00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:57,520
think one of the things that you may

00:49:55,330 --> 00:50:00,600
also be asking about is how does the

00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:03,850
taxonomy choice then drive the tickets

00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:05,109
the taxonomy choice in that we're

00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:08,140
actually doing is actually based off of

00:50:05,109 --> 00:50:10,000
the date and so the all of the different

00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:11,830
prices are represented as different

00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,020
variations we're not actually changing

00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:15,760
the price based off of the tech sauna me

00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:17,380
it's the other way around based off of

00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:19,930
the tech sauna me that they choose we

00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:22,090
then choose or we selectively display

00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:25,020
different product variants that they use

00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:25,020
okay

00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:41,140
yeah there was a few things I mean we we

00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:44,080
actually had a big debate about the

00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:47,500
upgrade an add-on process and whether we

00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:49,780
should completely remove it at all and

00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:53,800
kind of try to do it may be only in like

00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:56,260
a sidebar kind of thing but at the same

00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:58,210
point from the commercial side luna park

00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:00,790
that became some that they really wanted

00:50:58,210 --> 00:51:05,410
to actually have so we did our best to

00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:07,180
really minimize the number of clicks but

00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:10,510
also needed to make it a bit flexible so

00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:12,640
they there's basically the basic case

00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:15,550
right now is that any ticket that you

00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:17,619
actually buy they want to give you the

00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:20,440
option to actually upgrade it to an

00:51:17,619 --> 00:51:21,940
annual pass and it's actually I mean it

00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,650
makes commercial sense even from a

00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:26,109
consumer perspective because buying a

00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:27,820
ticket to like a standard ticket is like

00:51:26,109 --> 00:51:29,320
forty nine dollars or something like

00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:31,660
that and getting an annual passes

00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:33,640
ninety-nine dollars so if you're going

00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:35,500
to go there at all more than once it

00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:36,670
definitely makes sense and a lot of and

00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,619
that was part of the research that we

00:51:36,670 --> 00:51:40,359
found is that a lot of people because

00:51:38,619 --> 00:51:41,470
they have all these different pricing

00:51:40,359 --> 00:51:43,990
things a lot people got really confused

00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:46,630
so in some regards actually presenting

00:51:43,990 --> 00:51:48,670
them the upgrade was actually a benefit

00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:50,770
to them we had somebody actually come

00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:53,619
through our user testing who had been to

00:51:50,770 --> 00:51:55,990
Luna Park like 10 times over the last

00:51:53,619 --> 00:51:58,570
two years and so it was obviously very

00:51:55,990 --> 00:52:00,430
familiar with Luna Park and she had no

00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:02,710
idea that she could actually save so

00:52:00,430 --> 00:52:05,109
much money by getting an annual pass and

00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:06,609
she only found that out after going

00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:08,470
through our user testing and realized oh

00:52:06,609 --> 00:52:11,580
there's this option to do this and I've

00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:13,840
been doing it this way for so long so

00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:15,400
from that perspective we kind of that's

00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:17,790
how we went down that path does that

00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,790
answer your question

00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:35,690
there was a on to that point as well the

00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:37,520
one thing that it probably did influence

00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:39,710
that was the completion page our initial

00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:42,020
completion page was particular for the

00:52:39,710 --> 00:52:43,760
desktop was a lot more informative there

00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:45,349
was a lot more links to other things in

00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,510
the park and information that kind of

00:52:45,349 --> 00:52:49,760
stuff and after we kind of really like

00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:52,190
stripped out a lot of that stuff for the

00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,540
mobile version we kind of went back and

00:52:52,190 --> 00:52:55,730
looked at the desktop version was like

00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:57,230
wow this is way too much and so there

00:52:55,730 --> 00:53:05,300
was definitely there stuff there we

00:52:57,230 --> 00:53:11,570
pulled out I'm sorry I can't hear you

00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:14,690
can speak up so the question is sending

00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:17,180
the tickets to passbook on the iphone no

00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:18,500
we didn't or at least not yet it's

00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:22,160
definitely something I guess we we can

00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:23,180
look at but that being said one of the

00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,880
things we really wanted to make sure

00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:30,470
with this approach as well is that it's

00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:31,790
kind of device agnostic so you know the

00:53:30,470 --> 00:53:34,160
way for example that we did the

00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:36,020
drupalcon mobile app we actually did a

00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,270
lot of stuff based off of HTML in the

00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:40,250
back end but then each platform has

00:53:38,270 --> 00:53:41,480
their own build it was really important

00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:44,510
for us to be able to give this

00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:46,790
experience to users without necessarily

00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:49,910
having to determine or locked into a

00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:51,349
particular device so again kind of a

00:53:49,910 --> 00:53:53,240
small example we didn't expect this at

00:53:51,349 --> 00:53:55,130
all but in part of our user testing

00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:57,500
somebody happened to come in with a

00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:59,810
blackberry which is something we had not

00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:02,900
even factored into our requirements at

00:53:59,810 --> 00:54:04,070
all and he pulled it up and it more or

00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:06,020
less worked fine there was a few small

00:54:04,070 --> 00:54:08,330
CSS tweaks that we needed to do just on

00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:10,820
a few little buttons and stuff and that

00:54:08,330 --> 00:54:13,099
was that was it so we were really

00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:16,670
excited to see that that kind of cross

00:54:13,099 --> 00:54:22,130
device opportunity was there but I will

00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:28,359
look into the playbook any other

00:54:22,130 --> 00:54:30,760
questions who wants to go to Luna Park

00:54:28,359 --> 00:54:35,210
sorry was there a final question there

00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:36,710
all right well if anybody really if

00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:39,200
anybody really actually is interested in

00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:41,900
going to Luna Park will definitely kind

00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:43,880
of arrange something will I'll talk to

00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,930
UM to the guys there and see if we can

00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,730
actually get something organized

00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:51,440
four layer this weekend I'm sure they'll

00:54:46,730 --> 00:54:53,030
be I'm happy to have us all right well

00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,260
that pretty much wraps us up we've got

00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:57,170
about two minutes left unless there's

00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:59,290
any final questions okay great thanks

00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:59,290
guys

00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,220
