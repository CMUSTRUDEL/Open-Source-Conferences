Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Patch Review
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	In this session, we'll look at the process of patch review from start to finish, discussing strategies to maximize learning opportunities, touching on why some patches are harder to review than others, and helping attendees gain confidence in promoting issues from "Needs Review" to "RTBC" (or providing appropriate feedback on patches not yet ready for consumption).

Each patch represents a personal investment by the developer. It takes time to consider a problem, craft a solution, roll the patch, and upload it to an issue queue. All too often, some of these patches slip through the cracks and go unreviewed for months or even years.

Even though it may fix bugs, improve the UI, or add better documentation, each patch must be thoroughly reviewed before it can be commited. An imperfect patch, which may not be ready to commit yet, still represents an opportunity to educate contributors about coding style, core gates, and/or the process itself.

This session is intended for developers, module maintainers, and project managers with a programming background who want to learn to write reviews for patches, new project applications, and/or custom code.

alright everyone just want to welcome

00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:08,700

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,100
of exciting but probably not going to

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,500

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,869
so i'm not actually working for ocular

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:10,350
yeah but we put it on the flight anyway

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:13,140
because its way yeah it's it's a very

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:17,460
awesome thing but big the tall guy with

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,530
spiky hair that's my boss now so um

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,330
before we like you know really get into

00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,820
details about patch review we were kind

00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:27,540
of wondering if how many people have

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:32,310
actually done a like submitted a patch

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:37,590
on drupal.org yeah yeah okay so so um

00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:39,630
has anyone applied patches yeah is there

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:45,030
anybody here who doesn't even know what

00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:46,799
a patch is anyone right on okay so but

00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,740
essentially you know we know a patches

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,340
is a file that tells us which lines to

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,020
remove and which lines to take out right

00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:57,119
and why do we need patches well patches

00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,790
are how improvements are made so soon

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,200
this will have recognized this

00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:05,520
particular animation thing so what

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:08,280
happens is um some user says oh my god I

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,289
have this really horrible problem and um

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,300
and you know I'm it makes me unhappy

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,700
it's a

00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:18,290
they go to the issue queue and they file

00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:20,960
a bug report which you know is awesome

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,430
and very helpful but then Paula the

00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:24,290
programmer comes along and says oh my

00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,850
god I have this problem search is the

00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:29,900
issue queue because that's what Paula

00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:33,740
does and says oh hey look there's a bug

00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:38,420
report hmm I'll try to fix this since

00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:41,360
it's not fixed yet uploads a patch marks

00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:44,500
the issue as Annie's review and then

00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,390
along comes Rachel the reviewer right

00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,640
now those of you who are familiar with

00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,310
this this particular section of the

00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,780
slide from from web chicks presentation

00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:57,010
she used to beat at sea on the tester

00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,010
you can't see it at the bottom here but

00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:06,830
so Rachel the reviewer comes along and

00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:08,000
says oh my word what what yeah i'll just

00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,520
post some feedback and let everybody

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,310
know that this is confusing and doesn't

00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:15,320
work so paulo comes back and says all

00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:18,410
rights thnx here's you know here's

00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:21,200
another trial I'm try again um this poor

00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:25,100
soul wendy is still on you know windows

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,930
XP and so she has to post in and says

00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,910
you know what this breaks everything in

00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:34,550
I 6 because you know everything does

00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:38,380
also mind your spelling marks the issue

00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:41,650
again as needs work so who comes back

00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:47,420
Paulo the programmer and says all right

00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:51,170
try this which levira comes in has a

00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:53,690
look much better Marcy shoes reviewed

00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:55,430
and tested and then there's a magic

00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:59,180
thing that happens or someone comes in

00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:02,480
and actually hopefully commits the code

00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:03,920
that was in the patch so uh what kinds

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,390
of patch reviews do we do in Drupal

00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,510
before things go in court is anybody

00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:10,459
have ideas on this anyone that is the

00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:14,030
first first thing that reviews the the

00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:15,769
code the patches that's the bot the test

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:17,540
spot the automated testing bot comes in

00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:19,250
and then there's a peer co review that's

00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,470
great you know Rachel the reviewer she

00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,870
comes in she reviews the code and says

00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,590
you know and that's kind of what this

00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,960
session is about

00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:29,210
but I just like that was a spoiler so

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,510
don't ignore what I just said and so

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:36,820
Rachel of you reviews for accessibility

00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:40,970
for performance security usability and

00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:42,680
so on and then of course the whoever's

00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:46,070
going to do the committing does another

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,900
review toward the end but not all of

00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,030
these are important right now all we're

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,490
going to talk about is of course pure

00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:56,210
code review so why do we have your view

00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:57,919
code we're good code because we need to

00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:00,770
make sure that some coding standards are

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,960
followed we want to know that that

00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:06,340
people who are submitting patches and

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,290
people who are reviewing patches can can

00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,450
submit good patches in the future too

00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,340
right that's a good thing so it's an

00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,840
education and mentoring opportunity and

00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:17,780
then we also want to make sure that we

00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,690
have a quality and product the coding

00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:23,510
standards that we review for be security

00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:27,500
maintainability and documentation among

00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:28,970
other things and then also again

00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,990
education we want to mentor the next

00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:31,340
generation we want to make sure the

00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,169
pollo the programmer can upload good

00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,700
patches so we have good code and we'll

00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:37,490
make sure that Rachel the reviewer can

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,919
learn a bunch of stuff too because it's

00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:42,560
it's a very good learning opportunity

00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:46,669
for that and also we want to make sure

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,340
the Drupal still rocks right so what's

00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:54,680
important you have to like if I like

00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:56,419
keep going where you're gonna exactly

00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:03,470
that works okay so what's important when

00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:05,000
reviewing um sorry um the most important

00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,130
thing this is my opinion and obviously

00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,800
they're going to be people who disagree

00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:12,380
but but is something that just coined as

00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,240
full-frontal nicety that with you it was

00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:17,570
I think was actually Angie said it first

00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,950
but it's right it's for thing um so we

00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:21,550
want to make sure that in the issue

00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:25,060
queue that we are that we're encouraging

00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:27,830
especially new developers but also even

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:30,220
even old developers well when I say old

00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:32,330
I mean not I'm always so very

00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:34,310
experienced developers exactly what I'm

00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:37,390
sure that we're encouraging mature

00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:40,450
experienced developers um and

00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:42,910
and and when and also the new developers

00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,990
we want to support improvement and and

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:48,010
we want to make sure that we ask

00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:49,660
questions if we have them and I'm

00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:51,490
actually just going to sort of jump in

00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:53,920
here and say that I really think this is

00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,000
the singly most important part of a

00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,490
patch review because this is your

00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,570
opportunity to reach out to someone this

00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:00,670
might be the first time they've ever

00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,140
submitted a patch it's your chance to

00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,610
build a relationship with someone if

00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,690
they have a bad experience the first

00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,520
time they're not going to come back if

00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:08,200
you're rude it's like why would why

00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,060
would I waste my time doing this but if

00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,380
you're positive then then they learn

00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,180
something from you you can learn

00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:15,190
something from them and you've gotten to

00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,570
a point where it's it's a positive

00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,220
experience and civil come back and

00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:21,070
submit another patch in the future so

00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:24,400
absolutely which is why when we when I

00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:25,930
talk about an encouragement when we talk

00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,860
about encouragement some of the

00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:29,710
important things we need to acknowledge

00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:31,120
that that the coder who has submitted a

00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,100
patch has put some effort into this

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,230
right they had to think about the

00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:38,440
problem they had to define it they had

00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:40,180
to consider a solution they had to solve

00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:42,970
the problem and then they also had to

00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:45,550
upload a patch it's so much easier for

00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,740
people just to fix it in in my

00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:50,890
environment and move along right so

00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:54,520
people have made a lot of effort to in

00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:55,780
order when they when they upload a patch

00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:59,830
there's a lot of time and effort that

00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:01,810
goes into that and emotion so so we need

00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:03,460
to make sure that we are being we're

00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:05,920
acknowledging their effort we're showing

00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,990
gratitude for their effort so even if it

00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:09,820
is not code that we want to have in

00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:12,640
Drupal we want to take the opportunity

00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:14,920
to acknowledge that there that what

00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,780
they're doing is you know effort on

00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,880
their part and be happy that they've

00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:20,500
done it and then if it's not something

00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,660
that we want in Drupal then we want to

00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,370
support improve improvement we want to

00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,250
give them pointers on what we need to

00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:29,440
what we need from them next time right

00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,600
so the next time they find a problem or

00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,700
the next time they upload a new patch

00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,650
right because remember that Paula had to

00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,350
upload three patches in that that

00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:40,720
initial issue to before she got

00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:42,280
something that was committed right so we

00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,410
need to we need to be specific about

00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:47,020
what changes to make and we need to

00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:49,810
provide links if if there are them to

00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,860
documentation that shows you know why we

00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:53,850
do what we do

00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:56,050
and what the good things are about it

00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,300
and with regard to providing

00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,070
documentation that's something you might

00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:03,070
not think about but that's really

00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:04,720
important for that is so once upon a

00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,070
time I was reviewing this really cool

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,370
patch that someone in this room

00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:11,769
submitted and um he had gotten a review

00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:13,690
from someone else who told him to do the

00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:15,370
wrong thing and so there was a

00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,779
back-and-forth with two different people

00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:19,089
who were speaking authoritative Lee in

00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:20,470
this issue one of them telling him to do

00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:21,550
the right thing and another person

00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:23,440
telling him do the wrong thing and

00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,790
that's got to be really frustrating now

00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,320
if either of us is the first point of

00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:28,720
taking the time to look up the

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,370
documentation and say oh right here it

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,050
says this and then put that link in the

00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:33,790
issue that solves the question you know

00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:35,380
there's no doubt in anyone's mind in the

00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:37,660
future and that also gets people

00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,829
thinking about okay well I can look on

00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,269
this page in the handbook and future

00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:41,829
with I if I need to make a coding

00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:44,500
standards change if I need to know more

00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:46,269
about how to write queries properly that

00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,410
gets them in the mode of looking in the

00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:49,300
issue when they're creating patches in

00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:51,160
the future so it's a chance for you to

00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:56,140
help programmers program for Drupal

00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:58,870
better oh sorry she's oh and shoot I'm

00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:00,100
not wearing shoes sir okay so um again

00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:01,870
be specific provide links to

00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,490
documentation when you can and and

00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:06,430
support improvement in any other way

00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:08,709
that you can on IRC you can you can give

00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:11,529
pointers even sometimes right sometimes

00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:14,649
even just asking questions is supporting

00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:15,910
improvement right because what you what

00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:18,310
you do when you ask a question is you

00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:20,110
make that person think about you know

00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,850
the reasons for things that maybe aren't

00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,949
the way that you want them to or even

00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:29,649
the reasons for things that are awesome

00:10:23,949 --> 00:10:31,420
about their patch right so do everything

00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:34,089
you can in and think about the patch

00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:42,610
review as an opportunity to educate

00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:47,350
again so I think this is good place to

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:48,970
go okay okay so um so one of the things

00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:52,930
that we review for yeah it is a brand

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:54,899
new psychic sparkling new for Jasper for

00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:57,220
Down Under anyway so one of the things

00:10:54,899 --> 00:11:00,100
one of the first things we look for of

00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:01,540
course the folk final nicety is the most

00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,770
important but one of the things that we

00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,529
look for when we're actually looking at

00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,529
the patch

00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:09,170
is does the patch actually you know work

00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:11,029
does it do what it's supposed to do now

00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,199
obviously the bot techs for that but

00:11:11,029 --> 00:11:14,439
there are other things that we need to

00:11:12,199 --> 00:11:19,069
check for you know does it fix the issue

00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:21,740
um it doesn't um fixing it you and not

00:11:19,069 --> 00:11:25,160
fix other issues or not break other

00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:29,660
things so are we staying true to scope a

00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:31,100
lot of times a patch will have will you

00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,160
know it will fix something and then

00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:36,139
maybe an editor will automatically

00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,339
change white spaces or something strange

00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:40,759
like that which is completely out of

00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:42,589
scope even if it's wrong and white

00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:44,329
spaces may be a bad example because but

00:11:42,589 --> 00:11:46,100
it's actually a good example that's why

00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:49,009
we have white space standards is because

00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:50,870
when white space it adds noise to the

00:11:49,009 --> 00:11:52,970
patch and it's it's very frustrating for

00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:54,199
you as a patch reviewer it's very

00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:55,999
frustrating for the core committer when

00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:57,559
there's all these extra lines that have

00:11:55,999 --> 00:11:59,300
nothing to do with the change they're

00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:00,949
trying to review in the patch so that's

00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,300
actually why we have coding standards to

00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:04,550
make sure that simple things like that

00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,949
are always consistent so they don't add

00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:09,470
extra stuff that's not relevant in scope

00:12:06,949 --> 00:12:10,490
absolutely and we again want to make

00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,329
sure that if we don't introduce your

00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,350
aggressions we don't want to make sure

00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:16,100
we want to make sure that the patch

00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:19,519
doesn't break other things we also check

00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:21,230
to make sure the patch makes sense is is

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:26,029
it readable do I understand what's going

00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:29,569
on do I understand do I understand like

00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:31,339
the rationale behind what's going on are

00:12:29,569 --> 00:12:33,949
there enough comments so is it

00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:35,750
documented well enough that I that even

00:12:33,949 --> 00:12:37,610
if a person is not familiar with the

00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:39,589
attitude when they come in they read the

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:42,290
code directly because I mean when you go

00:12:39,589 --> 00:12:43,610
and look at the code you're not you know

00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:45,769
there's not an issue number next to

00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,029
every line on the code right so if

00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:48,649
you're not familiar with the issue does

00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:49,939
the code make sense can you understand

00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:54,589
it are there enough comments to do that

00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:57,319
and also I this is a little bit

00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:59,629
dangerous but is there a better way can

00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:01,790
we can we do this more elegantly can we

00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:06,079
can we do it with fewer lines of code

00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:08,360
and still be readable can we do it just

00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,399
better in any way and we we use other

00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,790
api's instead of creating new custom

00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:16,250
code yes things like that yeah so so we

00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:17,180
want to you know kind of look and think

00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,910
about

00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:23,930
is there a better way to to solve this

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:25,610
problem but we again I we have to keep

00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:27,020
in mind that when we're we're we're

00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:28,910
saying that there's a better way if we

00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,950
do find a better way that we that we are

00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,540
also supporting improvement and not

00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,580
telling a person this is just wrong

00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,200
right this is your approach is horrible

00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:42,230
or something like that which actually

00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:43,610
happens and so so we want to take that

00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:46,010
sighs we should look like as there be

00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,690
dragons you had that in it went away

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,760
sorry or you can just get a picture of

00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,990
the dragon but and this is actually

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,270
something to keep in mind if you think

00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:56,330
there's a better way pose it as a

00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:59,270
suggestion I think maybe not this is

00:13:56,330 --> 00:14:00,860
wrong do this and yeah exactly exactly

00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:02,990
have you thought of doing it this way

00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,000
and that way that also gives you an

00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:07,040
opportunity to find out maybe you're

00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,930
better way isn't better or maybe there's

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,160
a third person as someone who has more

00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:13,220
experience you can give you was it

00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,690
Justin on it so so I'm going to talk a

00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,940
little bit about something that really

00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:19,310
sets core apart from the contribs space

00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,830
in terms of like the patch submission

00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:24,020
process which is the core gates so this

00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:25,960
is these are five gates there's the

00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,220
usability gate accessibility

00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,770
documentation performance and testing

00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:32,690
and each is sort of a checklist of the

00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:35,000
minimum standards we have for Corey each

00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:37,430
of these specific areas they were first

00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,410
introduced at drupalcon chicago by

00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,240
dreese so about two years ago now and

00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:43,220
that was also right at the beginning of

00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,360
the Drupal 8 development cycle so i

00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,950
would say that they've actually had a

00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:47,440
pretty profound impact on the way that

00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,730
your polite development is happened um

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,410
they've increased our velocity and

00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,570
they've made it so that we could scale

00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,970
to a lot more contributors and right now

00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:57,410
so drupal 7 had a lot more core

00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,850
contributors than triple six I think we

00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,560
end up with like a thousand people at

00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,020
the end of the release cycle Drupal 8

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,280
has already like past that so and you

00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,870
know it's still it's not going to be

00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:10,580
released for you know eight months a

00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:11,780
year so we wouldn't be able to keep

00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,080
growing the number of contributors

00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:17,750
without having these sets of things um

00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,760
so um oh and to get the specifics this

00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,820
URL at the bottom of the screen not too

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,070
hard to remember drupal.org / core dash

00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:26,570
gates I definitely recommend reading

00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,400
this page it will have specific

00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:30,410
instructions in each of these specific

00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,950
areas about the things you really should

00:15:30,410 --> 00:15:32,330
know about the

00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:35,060
things that you as a reviewer can check

00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:37,670
on to make the patch review process more

00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:41,630
distributed and to make Drupal's quality

00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:43,220
higher how it used to work is that so

00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:44,660
there was like the usability team and

00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:47,450
the accessibility team and they were

00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:50,390
they were the only ones who really like

00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:52,100
took responsibility for it and the gates

00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:53,540
distribute that responsibility out to

00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,970
all the other developers and they also

00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:57,740
they also make it to like you know maybe

00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:59,360
we don't need to focus on these really

00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:00,380
really nitpicky things let's let's focus

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:07,370
first on the things that are most

00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:08,780
important to make or better yeah but

00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:11,150
okay so thank you that that is what I

00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:12,260
was going to do next um so the first

00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,580
gate that we have up here is the

00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,410
documentation gate and this is something

00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,060
that a lot of programmers in particular

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,890
tend to overlook but it's also very

00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,030
important and if you've worked in if

00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,070
you've worked the number of other

00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:23,300
developers you know it's important and a

00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,590
Drupal you're working with thousands and

00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:27,320
thousands of other developers so it's

00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:28,550
even more important um the first thing

00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,830
out there you might not be familiar with

00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:32,240
is on issue summaries for corey's use

00:16:30,830 --> 00:16:33,590
some of the points on the slide are

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,570
things that you put in the code base in

00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,340
the patch itself and other things are

00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:39,020
things that go on drupal.org and what

00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:41,090
the issue summary is is the initial post

00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:43,010
when you first create a Drupal issue is

00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:45,260
actually editable now so you can edit it

00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:47,180
like a wiki page and keep it updated so

00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:48,890
it always reflects what's currently

00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,990
going on in the issue someone posts a

00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:53,140
new patch there's this problem with it

00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,070
you put that in the summary someone

00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,530
looks the patch and says you know

00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:59,420
actually there's this really really bad

00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,770
bug that we need to solve first you put

00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,690
that in the summer and say look at this

00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:06,110
other issue first and postpone the

00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:08,480
second issue and it's something this is

00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,829
actually how i learned core is by

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,329
writing issue summaries for issue so

00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:13,970
it's actually a really really great way

00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:15,140
to increase your own like do your own

00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,670
professional development increase your

00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:18,470
own skill set and at the same time

00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,360
you're providing a service to everyone

00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:22,400
else because if you take the time to

00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:25,070
fill out the issue somewhere and keep it

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,870
up-to-date you've just saved every other

00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:29,390
person whoever looks at that issue all

00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:31,010
the time that you took so it's it's

00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:33,560
really important and it is actually

00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:36,260
required for issues like a core

00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:38,390
maintainer can at any time say okay this

00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,650
issue is just too complicated I need

00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,880
someone to write an issue summary for

00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:41,480
this issue before I will commit this

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,520
patch

00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,559
and but we do recommend it for pretty

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,799
much any issue especially any issue that

00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:50,510
becomes longer complicated so try it

00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,010
today go to an issue and click the Edit

00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:55,669
tab and there's instructions there it's

00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:57,890
great um the second point up here the

00:17:55,669 --> 00:18:02,000
second part of the documentation gate is

00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:03,530
the encode API documentation so um this

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,760
includes that the the documentation

00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:07,160
blocks that are at the top of every

00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,110
function every class every constant and

00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,910
there's a set of standards for them that

00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:12,140
really there's this huge document it's

00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:14,809
one of the oldest nodes on drupal.org

00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,150
it's 135 for if you haven't if you're

00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:18,320
not familiar with that document um

00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:19,700
you'll look at it and then you wish you

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,980
weren't familiar attack youment it's

00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,480
very long it's very specific but what

00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:26,059
the core gates page does is it

00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,530
summarizes the bare minimum things that

00:18:26,059 --> 00:18:29,299
we have to have in the patch in order

00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:30,350
for it to be accepted so that's a really

00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:32,419
great place to start if you want to

00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:34,490
learn how to document code this is used

00:18:32,419 --> 00:18:36,500
on API dr. blood org it's used by

00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:37,940
people's IDs to describe what what

00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,030
parameters are available for functions

00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,530
and so forth on another part of the code

00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:45,590
base that's used in both those places

00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:49,309
well its use on on AP alligator Borg is

00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:50,900
the module got a PHP file now and this

00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:54,830
is the first example of something that's

00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:57,380
not relevant in every case you only need

00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:58,520
to make a change to the modules ID ID at

00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,010
PHP for a module when there's a change

00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,150
to the hook so if we add a new hook if

00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,040
we remove a hook we change its

00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:06,380
parameters then that needs to be changed

00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,320
in that file an API detrol that org uses

00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,790
that to document with the hook is and

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,260
the core gates page actually has an

00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:14,450
entire column that specifies

00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,700
specifically when is this necessary one

00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:18,230
you need to learn about it so bookmark

00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:20,630
that page put it on your put it on your

00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:24,320
dashboard or something on the fourth

00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:25,910
change updating the hook that help again

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,350
this is only relevant when you need to

00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:30,169
like when you add a new module it needs

00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:32,720
a help hook so that isn't coming to play

00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:34,100
too often the last thing up here and

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,240
this is something that's again new and

00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,940
the Drupal 8 cycle is change

00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:40,190
notifications every time we make an a an

00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,169
API change in the core code base like we

00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:44,780
remove a function we rename a function

00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:46,669
we add a new API we create one of these

00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:49,010
change notifications that are listed on

00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:52,429
that this URL here drupal.org / list

00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:53,840
dash changes / dribble that lists every

00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:55,070
single thing that's been changed in

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,200
pupil 8

00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:58,490
in the past two years so this the goal

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,019
of this is to make it easier for people

00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,309
one there when they need to upgrade

00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:03,080
their contributed modules in their

00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:06,139
custom code on their on their personal

00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:07,490
sites or their company sites it actually

00:20:06,139 --> 00:20:08,899
helps them go through and figure out

00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:12,309
exactly what they need to change to go

00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:15,649
to the next version second gate

00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:18,529
performance for the poor man's gate is

00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:23,539
not what you think it is so be sure to

00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:25,630
read the page for this so take an

00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:27,440
example the second point up your caches

00:20:25,630 --> 00:20:29,570
contrary to what you may think caches

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,120
are bad that what the gate says for

00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,980
caches is only add a cash when you need

00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:36,110
it because cache invalidation is a

00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:38,419
really complicated problem caches make

00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:40,820
the developer experience more difficult

00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:43,159
so an example a patch that i'm going to

00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:46,279
show you in a little bit um this really

00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:49,309
big patch this one thing in the patch

00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:52,730
made the drupal.org front page 15 times

00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:54,710
slower we added cashing in that case but

00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,909
in most cases if you don't already know

00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:58,370
that there's a performance problem you

00:20:55,909 --> 00:21:00,529
don't add that and so there's a bunch of

00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:01,970
specific areas where you look for it the

00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:03,679
performance gate isn't about saying no

00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,840
we don't make triple slow or it's about

00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:07,730
let's document where the performance

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:09,649
regressions are so that later in the

00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:10,700
release cycle we can find a consistent

00:21:09,649 --> 00:21:12,529
way to fix them because premature

00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:19,100
optimization is is bad in the

00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:22,100
performance world um premature

00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:24,559
optimization is really bad and and the

00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,929
the key there is make sure that you have

00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,789
that you either profile at yourself or

00:21:26,929 --> 00:21:30,620
you have someone do that for you and

00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:32,269
don't guess do I say I think this will

00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:33,409
make it slower because marks on a bomb

00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:35,690
will come in here and he will he will

00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:37,309
shake you and re-educate you so if you

00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:38,899
if you weren't actually presenting on

00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:40,700
this right now he'd be in here shaking

00:21:38,899 --> 00:21:47,029
ready just because you were thinking

00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:49,610
about it right um next gate is the

00:21:47,029 --> 00:21:51,830
accessibility gate um accessibility

00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:54,740
issues in Drupal are bucks if someone

00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:56,179
can't use Drupal it's a bug um and the

00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,190
accessibility gate is really clearly

00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:59,870
documented additionally all of these

00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:02,570
most of these things up here have tools

00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:03,440
that you can use to test them so you

00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,820
don't need to know anything about

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,139
accessibility go read this page you'll

00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,960
learn something about accessibility that

00:22:06,139 --> 00:22:11,440
you can then take and you

00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:15,010
on your own sites and then the usability

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,420
gate is a bit more vaguely documented

00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:19,300
because usability it turns out is hard

00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:22,060
it's hard to make sites eat who would

00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:25,990
have guessed the most important things

00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:27,190
for usability changes is like when

00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:29,230
something changes the user interface

00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,820
acknowledge that it has an impact on

00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:33,340
usability or it may have an impact and

00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,710
usability um so you tag the issue with

00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:37,270
usability and that gives people from the

00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:40,600
usability team an opportunity to look at

00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:42,130
it give us feedback and you should

00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,750
follow patterns that are already in core

00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:45,220
like maybe you want to invent a really

00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,510
cool new interface but if you are

00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,390
inventing a really cool new interface

00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:50,950
that needs to be documented in if it's

00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:52,420
the only thing like it in core that

00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:54,400
makes core harder because people don't

00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:56,410
have to learn two different patterns for

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,820
how to navigate the site and then

00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:59,560
finally this the simple part to

00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,150
understand these ability gate is when

00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,460
you change the user interface provide a

00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:04,510
screenshot show it looks like before

00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,710
showed it looks like after and then

00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:09,760
anyone can look at the issue and

00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:11,950
evaluate the change all right so this is

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,060
a last gate fifth gate and this is

00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:17,590
probably the most important get and it's

00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:18,910
also my favorite um testing game so I've

00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:21,370
notes over here I wanted to make sure i

00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:23,320
didn't miss things um I would say of

00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:25,060
these five areas this is the part that

00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:28,630
is accelerated core development the most

00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:30,730
um and it's also a really great way to

00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:33,100
get started as a core developer my first

00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:34,480
patch was an automated test and i highly

00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:37,270
recommend that everyone in this room go

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,910
to Lee's Lee Rollins automated testing

00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:41,580
session it's tomorrow at 1pm I did not

00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:43,810
show a room it is in but it's called

00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:46,360
show me the tests and then there's a

00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:48,040
subtitle that's less clever um the go to

00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:51,310
that session the very clever it's just

00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:53,470
longer okay yeah I didn't I didn't

00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:54,820
remember it so it was less memorable but

00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,990
it's a really good session I definitely

00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:58,150
recommend checking that out you will

00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:59,920
learn a lot that you can take if you're

00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:01,630
into student review reviewing tests you

00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:04,830
there's some fundamentals from testing

00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:07,180
that you want to learn first um but

00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:10,930
coogi room thank you Thank You Shannon

00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:16,890
hmm and that's where we are so it's easy

00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:16,890
to remember so no this is Bronte

00:24:17,150 --> 00:24:23,550
so first thing you have to do is check

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,760
the test coverage and make sure the test

00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:30,510
pass we have a 100-percent test past

00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:33,630
policy in core i7 your jobs um what this

00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:36,810
means is that we do not put we do not

00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:39,480
commit any patches to core that makes a

00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:41,070
test suite not pass anymore and once in

00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,840
a while something slips by that causes

00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:45,180
intermittent failures or two patches

00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,260
that change similar things happen the

00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,910
same time and that's like an

00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:51,270
all-hands-on-deck situation because it's

00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:53,550
extremely disruptive so you as a

00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:55,080
reviewer don't need to run the test

00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,460
because the bot does that for you so

00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:59,040
keep in mind all you have to do is look

00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,870
and say hey is it pink is it green if

00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,000
it's green it passed that's taken care

00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:06,210
of however the trickier part is checking

00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:07,860
the test coverage so it could be that

00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:09,780
like test spots not magical right if

00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:13,470
there isn't already a test in the

00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:15,960
codebase that says make sure this thing

00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:17,310
happens when you click here then if that

00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,540
thing doesn't happen when you click

00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:21,390
there you won't know when the patch will

00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:22,470
still be green so as a reviewer you

00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:24,090
should check and make sure that whatever

00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:26,160
the past changes already has coverage

00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:28,830
also make sure that the person who

00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:31,530
creates the patch isn't deleting a test

00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:33,840
I've had the experience a few times

00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:37,860
where someone had a test that was

00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,910
failing didn't get rid of that and I

00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,860
mean you know because they didn't

00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:42,240
understand what was going on there was

00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,400
problem with the test or like they

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,260
changed the test to assert a different

00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,140
result and it's like well we kind of put

00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:50,490
that there for a reason so if you see a

00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:53,820
little minus sign in front of a test

00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:56,550
line stop and read the issue make sure

00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:58,080
you understand why it's being changed

00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:59,880
and ask the person for feedback because

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,690
always always something to look at very

00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:07,410
carefully and finally um not finally add

00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:10,320
new tests for new features and for bugs

00:26:07,410 --> 00:26:11,820
upload a test case that fails sounds

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,190
doesn't really make sense you want the

00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,620
test to fail the idea is that when

00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:18,090
there's a bug in core core tests I have

00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:20,130
a hundred percent test pass policy

00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:21,450
there's a discrepancy there because

00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:23,940
there's a bug so something should be

00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:25,830
failing so the first thing that someone

00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,080
should do is create a patch that only

00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:30,090
has the test in it so when they upload

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,419
that patch to the issue that fails and

00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,919
it will

00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:34,350
show you exactly why it failed and

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,779
hopefully explain here's this bug so

00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:38,700
then the person takes that patch the

00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:40,679
test only patch combines it with a bug

00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,749
fix and then that second patch attach

00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:45,119
the issue will pass demonstrating that

00:26:42,749 --> 00:26:47,039
the fix that they have actually resolves

00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:49,109
the bug and the test that they have

00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,639
actually provides coverage for it so

00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:51,779
this is it's something that's difficult

00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:53,909
for people to get used to but it's

00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:56,100
actually if I don't see a test when we

00:26:53,909 --> 00:26:58,859
patch and a combined patch I can't

00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,419
review it's like you know please you

00:26:58,859 --> 00:27:02,039
know do this and then I send them a

00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:04,109
screenshot of the pink stripe followed

00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:05,190
by the green stripe which is my favorite

00:27:04,109 --> 00:27:08,249
thing in the world because it means that

00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:09,929
they understood the core gate um provide

00:27:08,249 --> 00:27:11,789
a test module not everything can be

00:27:09,929 --> 00:27:14,070
tested with just within a test sometimes

00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:16,109
you detest implementation of something

00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:17,700
if you add a new API there needs to be

00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:20,070
something in core that uses that API to

00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,590
provide coverage for it manually test

00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:24,330
not everything in Drupal's testable the

00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:26,369
Installer right now can't have automated

00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:28,619
tests on JavaScript there's some work

00:27:26,369 --> 00:27:30,840
being done to add automated testing for

00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:33,119
JavaScript but it's not possible in core

00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,220
right now so if you have something that

00:27:33,119 --> 00:27:36,809
makes user interface changes changes the

00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,940
Installer make sure to test that

00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:40,320
manually and provide screenshots when

00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,399
it's a front-end change and what happens

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:46,889
before and then what happens after and

00:27:43,399 --> 00:27:48,239
then um finally I haven't here oh this

00:27:46,889 --> 00:27:49,679
is something that's not actually on the

00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:51,179
core gates page but it's something we've

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,489
been discussing with the core my dinners

00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:55,220
and with um what's-his-name nod

00:27:53,489 --> 00:27:58,499
underscore he's new i think seems a

00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:59,940
older or Theodore he's he's the

00:27:58,499 --> 00:28:01,919
javascript maintainer for core in Drupal

00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,980
8 and so we've sort of agreed

00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:06,779
tentatively that until we have automated

00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:08,519
JavaScript testing we want to document

00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:10,259
the manual testing steps that need to

00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:12,179
happen so if there's a javascript bug

00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:14,429
here's how you test to reproduce that

00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:17,100
bug and so in the time being that gives

00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:18,269
us like a template for the autumn a test

00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,859
that we will write in the future when

00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:23,070
that's festival so it's on the page yet

00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:25,169
probably will be soon and that's um

00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:29,909
again go to this session really it's

00:28:25,169 --> 00:28:32,519
it's the coolest thing ever it's only so

00:28:29,909 --> 00:28:34,139
um now just to recap a little bit things

00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:40,950
that we look for full frontal nice a day

00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:42,720
we look for I'm sorry yeah whether it

00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:43,660
does it actually work is it well

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,370
documented

00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:48,070
look for the gates we also want to look

00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:50,050
at coding style now we touched on this a

00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:54,580
little bit before the coding style

00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:56,470
things like the two spaces that you know

00:28:54,580 --> 00:29:03,010
there's a period at the end of sentences

00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:06,640
that exactly these kinds of things we we

00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:09,130
followed the pair coding standards in in

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,700
general that's and and then we can you

00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:17,320
can also find the the documentation on

00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:19,450
our doxygen which is the excusing the

00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:22,590
adoption code oxygen coding style

00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:25,750
doxygen we use to generate the

00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:27,970
documentation that you see on API

00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:31,450
drupal.org so it's a number that ever

00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:33,790
thought it is 135 for org slash known /

00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:35,440
154 right and you can find all of that

00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:37,390
information there so when we're

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,020
reviewing a patch we are reviewing for

00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:45,790
these things as well now some tools that

00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:47,890
you can use to to review patches I I

00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:49,480
think maybe my favorite is dreaded ER

00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,530
and we're going to we're going to talk

00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:54,400
about that a little bit more you can

00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:56,080
also use your your IDE PHP lint which is

00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:58,980
when you type into your command line you

00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,010
type PHP L and the file name and it will

00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:05,230
just test to make sure that there are no

00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:07,420
syntax error syntax errors exactly I'm

00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:08,830
notorious at life I'll be like oh I'm

00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:11,290
going to fix this and I'll accidentally

00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:13,540
type a comma sort of semi colon and so

00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:16,630
I've learned the hard way to type PHP

00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:18,490
gels on my code base before I upload

00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:21,550
that patch because I look like an idiot

00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:23,470
right yeah and I look like someone who

00:30:21,550 --> 00:30:24,940
should not be working on the kinds of

00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:27,160
problems i'm working on because i don't

00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,280
know that line the PhD and in semicolons

00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:32,440
she really doesn't look like that ever

00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:34,450
maybe not but when when i upload patches

00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,880
like that i feel like that right i think

00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:40,540
that all of us recognize but you know

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:43,000
let's yeah yeah ok so which goes back to

00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:47,800
always encourage and you know ok so

00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,870
anyway um so PHP lint and then there's

00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:52,720
also a tool called JJ eslint for

00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:53,440
javascript and CSS lint and you can find

00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,149
those on the way

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,279
been there there are tools that you can

00:30:55,149 --> 00:31:03,399
just feed the code through and see if it

00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:06,100
works ok there was a clean up I'm not

00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:08,169
sure that everything works ingeus lenten

00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:11,230
see assessment but just make sure that

00:31:08,169 --> 00:31:19,659
none of things do to you there were

00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:21,970
there were issues ok it did everyone

00:31:19,659 --> 00:31:24,340
hear that jeaious lint complains about a

00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:28,090
semicolon with durable behaviors it's

00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:31,059
just it exists and then the coder module

00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:32,799
which will you know review your code for

00:31:31,059 --> 00:31:35,919
coding standards and a lot of other

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,480
awesomeness code sniffer and the grammar

00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,629
parser module are some other tools that

00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:43,480
you can use when you are reviewing

00:31:39,629 --> 00:31:48,039
patches and and need like maybe more

00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:50,110
information on on the patch itself and

00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:52,509
one thing that that I would point out

00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:54,490
about the coding standards is that don't

00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:55,870
sweat it and if you see someone else

00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:57,970
grow up there whitespace don't be a jerk

00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:59,950
about it because you know it's it's

00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:01,149
something that ideally a machine should

00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,200
be able to fix these problems for you

00:32:01,149 --> 00:32:04,210
and that's something we're working on

00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,070
adding quartered set coding standards

00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:07,509
testing on the bots and so forth all of

00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:08,919
those tools or something that eventually

00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:10,899
should be condensed into one thing on

00:32:08,919 --> 00:32:13,200
Drupal the dog that just takes care of

00:32:10,899 --> 00:32:15,610
it for you and says fix this and that so

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,490
it's way less important than everything

00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:20,799
we've talked about so far it makes it

00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:22,750
difficult to read someone's patch if

00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,850
they have errors but at the same time

00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:26,500
it's not their goal it's not to have

00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:31,899
perfectly formatted code there go to us

00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:35,769
to fix a problem no it's yours oh that's

00:32:31,899 --> 00:32:37,809
right ha sorry um so so those are things

00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:40,779
what we're looking for when we are we're

00:32:37,809 --> 00:32:42,820
more reviewing a patch what does that

00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:45,759
what does that translate into as far as

00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:48,639
the the review workflow but let's start

00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:51,070
before we actually start reviewing the

00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:52,929
patch and and that sort of thing we

00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:55,090
should we should maybe talk about a few

00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:59,919
little hints the first thing you can't

00:32:55,090 --> 00:33:02,500
actually unreadable you're going to

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:05,799
review a patch sometimes it makes sense

00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,429
to not read the issue and just read the

00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:08,950
patch

00:33:06,429 --> 00:33:10,840
and follow the workflow and then go back

00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:15,039
and read the issue to see if it makes

00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:17,190
sense with the actual complaint or the

00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:21,759
the bug report and those sorts of things

00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:28,179
also a perfect is the enemy of good and

00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:30,070
done sometimes so if if we go in there

00:33:28,179 --> 00:33:32,950
and we say you know this patch doesn't

00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:34,600
have the right spacing and and we and we

00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:36,220
go in and we nitpick things and then

00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:39,789
eventually what happens is people just

00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:43,749
abandon patches right they I've done it

00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:46,210
I'm sorry but I have and we we can't

00:33:43,749 --> 00:33:48,490
expect like complete perfection in fact

00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:53,860
there's someone in the room who has an

00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:55,659
extra ddoddo user who instead of

00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:59,559
requiring people to make their patches

00:33:55,659 --> 00:34:02,350
perfect we'll go in and fix the silly

00:33:59,559 --> 00:34:04,779
little things and then upload a new

00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:06,009
patch which I'm nothing you can do and

00:34:04,779 --> 00:34:08,710
you don't need to have a separate user

00:34:06,009 --> 00:34:10,030
account for it it doesn't it your yes

00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,079
right and actually and that's what

00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:14,349
that's actually a legitimate

00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:15,909
contribution to the issue but someone in

00:34:14,349 --> 00:34:18,399
the room went in the room a little bit

00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:20,799
embarrassed by having more commit

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,450
mentions than anyone else for cleaning

00:34:20,799 --> 00:34:24,309
up spelling and stuff so didn't want

00:34:22,450 --> 00:34:26,349
that to happen right yeah someone in the

00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:28,540
room does that and and so that one would

00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:30,280
be no commit credit if you havin to see

00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:32,079
that what that is is that's just a silly

00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,909
a little cleanup and don't even worry

00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,629
about it that someone shouldn't actually

00:34:33,909 --> 00:34:39,490
worried about it because it's a relevant

00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:43,000
helpfulness that someone has like two

00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:52,089
thirds of Tim's credits now right ok so

00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:53,859
anyway and also anyway so and then to

00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:56,200
remember also remember that everyone is

00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:58,859
different that we when we are going

00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:03,069
through and when just as demonstrating a

00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:05,440
patch review and and how'd redditor

00:35:03,069 --> 00:35:08,020
works and those sorts of things when

00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,730
after you've reviewed a few patches what

00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:11,380
will happen is you will you will get

00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:13,690
your own process it will be different

00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:15,760
and it won't be this exactly the same

00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:16,990
we're trying to provide you with the

00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,430
tools and the

00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:20,890
and some kind of an idea of what to look

00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:25,390
for but you should get you know hone

00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:27,010
your own process all right so now what

00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:29,170
I'm going to do is I'm going to demo a

00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:31,060
tool called redditor um written by a

00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:32,500
dribble computer name son you've

00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:34,470
probably seen his name before especially

00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:37,330
if you contribute patches of Drupal um

00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:38,619
he's tall he's German and he's very cool

00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:40,810
and he wrote this amazing JavaScript

00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:43,450
utility that basically it's like brush

00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:45,369
is to Drupal except for Jubal org so it

00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:46,690
takes Drupal at org and adds all kinds

00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:48,369
of functionality to it and the major

00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:51,210
functionality that most people use is

00:35:48,369 --> 00:35:54,790
this little in browser editing tool

00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:57,520
called called redditor on drupal.org /

00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:59,020
project / redditor and i'm so i'm gonna

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,420
do is i'm going to demo a patch review

00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,920
using that tool or at least I'm not the

00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,220
whole patch review process but sort of

00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:08,920
what I do on the patch that I'm using

00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:11,800
incidentally is a the largest patch I

00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:14,230
reviewed in my career it's 400 k um it

00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:17,950
converted the block system in Drupal 8

00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:19,930
to use plugins it's the biggest patch in

00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:22,090
the world and it was epic and epic

00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:24,430
process so and I spent a month of my

00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:26,230
life reading this so this by the way is

00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:27,700
an example of why patches need to stay

00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:30,250
within a certain scope because if you

00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:31,840
end up with a 400 k patch not many

00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,340
people are crazy enough to spend a month

00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,960
of their life keeping and going back and

00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:36,760
reviewing it section by section anyway

00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,470
it was a very important change though

00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,090
it's fundamental for the blocks and

00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:41,530
layouts initiative the goal which is

00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:44,770
eventually maybe not in this release

00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:47,619
cycle but in Drupal 9 or infant rib and

00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:49,570
so forth to make it so that core can do

00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:52,200
what panels does but better essentially

00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:54,340
so I'm going to switch now to our

00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:58,119
prearranged little so here's an example

00:36:54,340 --> 00:37:03,880
oh how do I make it show me this the up

00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:08,050
coming up Thanks oh oh aha okay good

00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:11,920
there we go oh yeah can you switch it to

00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:12,820
mirror because I can yeah we didn't

00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,570
rehearse this part of the presentation

00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:23,760
in case you didn't notice so System

00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:23,760
Preferences display yeah yeah sorry

00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:41,250
hi there we go yay ok and that's big not

00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:43,470
helping ok yeah I'm gonna press the

00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:45,180
little button sorry that's enough it up

00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:54,690
it's different it's on the other side

00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:58,190
now go yay I can use a mac okay so this

00:37:54,690 --> 00:38:01,380
is one of my 18 bazillion in five

00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:02,670
comments posted on this issue not even

00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:06,900
looking at the right one anymore Simon

00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:08,579
hit enter um so this is one part of the

00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:12,059
Pat reviewed I did is review this new

00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:13,650
custom block module Drupal 8 custom

00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:15,420
blocks that you create yourself are a

00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:18,690
separate module from blocks that are

00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:20,130
added from other modules so this is an

00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:22,710
example of what a review post looks like

00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:24,329
um and I'm getting I'm getting a little

00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:26,460
silly in this post because I've been

00:38:24,329 --> 00:38:28,680
reviewing it for days and so but these

00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:30,319
it allows you to paste these little code

00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,220
snippets with a comment about each one

00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:34,740
so i'm going to show you what redditor

00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:36,569
actually looks like um here up a little

00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:38,780
bit earlier in the issue Tim Plunkett

00:38:36,569 --> 00:38:41,099
rerolled the blocks patch here and

00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:42,390
dreddit er it's just a browser script

00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:43,650
that you install gives me this little

00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:48,089
blue review button here so I click this

00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:50,430
and it opens this handy little browser

00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:52,619
this patch is 400 k I mentioned that

00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:53,960
already right I if I try to scroll and

00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:55,530
find things it's not going to happen

00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:57,869
fortunately on the left hand side

00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:59,430
there's a little browser here that shows

00:38:57,869 --> 00:39:01,619
me all the different functions and files

00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:03,839
that are changed it's amazing it also

00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:09,990
shows you the diff stacked on this patch

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:14,339
changed 146 files 5137 new lines 3456

00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:15,690
deleted lights so it's a lot so I'm

00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:17,430
going to scroll through the in this side

00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:20,490
browser here to the custom block module

00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:23,849
so it's under modules / blog / custom

00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:25,049
look here we go found it this the

00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:26,849
previous one yeah okay so I'm just gonna

00:39:25,049 --> 00:39:29,220
go here one of the first files in the

00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:32,190
custom block module and so what I what I

00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:34,619
did is I just basically read through the

00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:35,910
module and inspected all the different

00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:38,190
lines in the patch and look for things

00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:40,230
that looked out of place

00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:43,050
you can see that it shows inserted lines

00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:44,490
in blue deleted lines in red comments

00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,990
are green so that you can scan initially

00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:48,060
and see what's documentation versus

00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:49,170
functional code and what you can do is

00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:52,560
you go through and if you see something

00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:54,840
that seems out of place like can't think

00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,700
of an example right now but say that I

00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,260
there was a problem with like this class

00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,210
name this class name is not specific

00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,650
enough where it's confusing I double

00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:05,000
click on the line and it opens up this

00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:08,390
little box on the side i would say i

00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,390
would click

00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:21,249
can type on this laptop so I would just

00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,359
put in a comment say oh this isn't

00:40:21,249 --> 00:40:23,619
really a standard class in this

00:40:22,359 --> 00:40:26,369
situation and then I would insert a

00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:28,630
documentation link here click Save and

00:40:26,369 --> 00:40:30,670
then I would click paste and that

00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:33,400
actually inserts in the new comment on

00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:35,709
the issue five years from now because

00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:39,880
the wired internet is broken and it's

00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:42,849
very slow well we'll pretend that you

00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:46,420
now see the markup oh yeah that's going

00:40:42,849 --> 00:40:49,029
to be so anyways it paid it pastes what

00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:50,410
makes this now I'll actually edit the

00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:51,999
comment and show you wait do you have

00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:54,130
editing permissions on you no you do not

00:40:51,999 --> 00:40:56,950
okay I can't do that either um no it's

00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:58,690
okay i forgive you um but yeah it just

00:40:56,950 --> 00:41:00,489
inserts markup for code tags and then

00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:03,489
your comments are after them so that

00:41:00,489 --> 00:41:05,289
it's a really convenient tool and um it

00:41:03,489 --> 00:41:06,729
you know I just what I do is I start

00:41:05,289 --> 00:41:08,259
from the bottom of the patch and read up

00:41:06,729 --> 00:41:10,150
and then i might navigate around through

00:41:08,259 --> 00:41:11,680
that browser what that does is it helps

00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:14,799
it so that it makes it so that I'm not

00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,450
just like reading a story it helps me

00:41:14,799 --> 00:41:18,999
see things that don't make sense and I

00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:22,269
read every single line starting from the

00:41:18,999 --> 00:41:23,319
bottom and going up so that's how I go

00:41:22,269 --> 00:41:24,940
through reviewing patches out i'll make

00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:26,259
note of coding standards violations i'll

00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,809
make note of things that are just like

00:41:26,259 --> 00:41:32,019
that's really strange so shredder it's a

00:41:28,809 --> 00:41:34,479
great tool but you know i mean i don't

00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:36,999
know if anyone i know of one person who

00:41:34,479 --> 00:41:39,459
does not use redditor in reviews a ton

00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:42,869
of patches on but the majority of people

00:41:39,459 --> 00:41:42,869
who work on the cork you used roediger &

00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:56,349
oh that we're out of order we talked

00:41:54,970 --> 00:42:02,010
about scope you know what scope is right

00:41:56,349 --> 00:42:02,010
I put where else with me all right

00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:24,950
oh sweet okay so you know to to review a

00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:26,930
little bit of what just went on there so

00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:28,970
that we can kind of get bullet points on

00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:31,490
it the first thing that we that we do

00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:33,380
when we're when we open up redditors we

00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:37,369
look for the most well we we scroll down

00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:38,540
the issue right I didn't tell you there

00:42:37,369 --> 00:42:40,099
was an injured if so when you saw that

00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:42,290
patch there was the patch the green side

00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:45,530
there was another file after that which

00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:46,970
Tim uploaded the eye patch that only

00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:49,160
showed the difference between his patch

00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:50,630
and the previous one on the issue so

00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,820
that's actually if you remove that

00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:54,740
reviewed the patch previously start with

00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,060
that because it takes out all the noise

00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,680
and says the only things that have

00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:01,160
changed since the last time I put time

00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,560
into this are these two lines so so so

00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:04,880
we look for the most recent patch and we

00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,800
do that by scrolling all the way to the

00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,349
bottom of the issue in fact in the issue

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,490
that she reviewed you can scroll all the

00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:12,079
way to the bottom but then you have to

00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:13,310
scroll a little ways back up because

00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,470
there are so many comments long

00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:17,060
follow-up issues to actually get to the

00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:18,020
most recent patch but what we want to do

00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:20,540
is we want to look for the most recent

00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:22,790
patch and pop up and rubbed redditor on

00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:25,160
that one general provides you a handy

00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:26,900
little link to do them and then well

00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,869
while we're there we're going to note if

00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,980
there are any tests only patches or

00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:33,980
introduced as we talked about before

00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:37,550
where we want to make sure that a a

00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:39,619
tests only patch fails and then and we

00:43:37,550 --> 00:43:41,540
need to make sure again as she was

00:43:39,619 --> 00:43:43,550
saying about the inner tips that if

00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:45,859
something has changed then we only have

00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:47,960
to review part of it we pop it open an

00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:50,720
IND redditor we can notice the diff

00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:53,119
stats and the modified files which as

00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:56,480
you saw when she was demonstrating those

00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:58,520
that they were there we want to see

00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,640
which functions are changed oh wait I'm

00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:03,109
in the wrong there we go and and then we

00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:10,400
also would like to check and ensure that

00:44:03,109 --> 00:44:12,260
there are tests then then now we've

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,650
scrolled down the diff now we're going

00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:17,810
to go back up we check the API

00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:20,420
documentation if there's anything that

00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:25,130
confuses this when we're going up yeah

00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:26,839
okay what oh I'm sorry and we note any

00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:27,589
kind of code style issues as we talked

00:44:26,839 --> 00:44:29,630
about for the

00:44:27,589 --> 00:44:32,359
any unclear comments and any other

00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:34,940
oddities about the patch and then for

00:44:32,359 --> 00:44:38,269
each hunk we say okay does this function

00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:39,859
make sense does this big part of change

00:44:38,269 --> 00:44:42,769
make any sense so that you know I hope

00:44:39,859 --> 00:44:44,900
may have you know several lines or you

00:44:42,769 --> 00:44:47,839
know only one or two lines but does this

00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:49,430
make sense isn't it scope is it is it

00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:55,999
documented as we're reading back down

00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:58,609
and and also a this is regular in

00:44:55,999 --> 00:45:00,859
addition to dread or sometimes we also

00:44:58,609 --> 00:45:02,390
need to use it in the to actually apply

00:45:00,859 --> 00:45:04,940
the patch and review it in the IDE

00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:06,799
because what we need but I need and I

00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:10,549
think I probably need it more often than

00:45:06,799 --> 00:45:12,769
then just us or maybe not but or your or

00:45:10,549 --> 00:45:14,630
your editor but because what I need to

00:45:12,769 --> 00:45:17,119
do is I need to see the code in context

00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:19,700
I have to see you know okay you've

00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:21,619
changed this but what else was there you

00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:24,619
know what was there before and and it

00:45:21,619 --> 00:45:27,380
gives me handy color coding which as you

00:45:24,619 --> 00:45:31,339
know person who likes colors that's very

00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:33,769
cool pretty colors and and in the idea I

00:45:31,339 --> 00:45:39,430
had stepped debugging for free well for

00:45:33,769 --> 00:45:43,700
the price of the editors there is that

00:45:39,430 --> 00:45:49,609
so yeah it does it does that sum it up

00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:51,170
for everyone are there any questions so

00:45:49,609 --> 00:45:52,670
that was that was one of the points of

00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:54,229
that guy I actually the majority of

00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:56,239
patches that I review I do not apply and

00:45:54,229 --> 00:45:59,239
test manually or I will do it once

00:45:56,239 --> 00:46:00,559
because once there's a test written for

00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:02,569
that the test tells me what's supposed

00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:03,979
to happen on that giant blocks patch I

00:46:02,569 --> 00:46:05,569
tested the heck out of that manual I

00:46:03,979 --> 00:46:06,859
spent so much time went back and forth

00:46:05,569 --> 00:46:08,660
and then I have this huge comment long

00:46:06,859 --> 00:46:10,910
with like this is broken and this is

00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:14,420
broken and this is broken but for small

00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:15,739
changes or for changes that um that

00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:17,660
don't directly affect the fun and I

00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:19,640
don't test it manually there are other

00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:21,170
people can do that like we actually have

00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,809
this this core mentoring initiative that

00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:26,359
we that anri and I do um sort of

00:46:23,809 --> 00:46:27,890
distributes the workload so I have a lot

00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:29,150
of experience in the core code base I

00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:30,259
can just read code and say this is

00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:32,089
what's going to happen this is related

00:46:30,259 --> 00:46:33,589
to that and then people out that do it

00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:36,289
their way better than me to that can

00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:37,849
just like read it and they like they

00:46:36,289 --> 00:46:39,769
actually cute Drupal in their brains I

00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:41,230
swear it's amazing or Daniel Vayner the

00:46:39,769 --> 00:46:43,460
views call maintainer

00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:44,690
unbelievable I swear he has all five

00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:49,279
hundred files that are in views in his

00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:51,470
head um but what I know I there's an

00:46:49,279 --> 00:46:52,789
opportunity when a patch does make a

00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:54,259
change that needs to be tested manually

00:46:52,789 --> 00:46:55,549
someone else can do that all they have

00:46:54,259 --> 00:46:57,470
to be able to do is apply the patch and

00:46:55,549 --> 00:46:59,059
understand what the issues about so we

00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:00,499
try to break up the responsibility for

00:46:59,059 --> 00:47:02,059
it so that that gives them an

00:47:00,499 --> 00:47:04,400
opportunity to participate in the

00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:07,430
process and it saves me time so i can go

00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:08,630
on and renew other patch but you do want

00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:10,130
to test it manually at least once or

00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:11,869
make sure that someone else on the issue

00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:13,789
has if it's a collaborative effort right

00:47:11,869 --> 00:47:16,579
you're not responsible for everything

00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:18,470
you're just helping review the patch and

00:47:16,579 --> 00:47:19,730
then it goes to the committer too and if

00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:21,769
you get Angie as your committers she'll

00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:22,910
test the patch manually to you should I

00:47:21,769 --> 00:47:27,200
mean you should test it before she does

00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:29,390
but and I actually I do like to at least

00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:32,390
test the patch once myself manually test

00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:34,670
it because it also gives me again that

00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:36,170
context that I was that I was talking

00:47:34,670 --> 00:47:38,089
about before where I want to see where

00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:41,089
it is in the code but I also want to see

00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:44,990
where it is in the UI and and how and

00:47:41,089 --> 00:47:48,859
within the behavior of the other side or

00:47:44,990 --> 00:47:52,150
the yeah anyway you get what I mean any

00:47:48,859 --> 00:47:52,150
more questions doing

00:47:58,290 --> 00:48:04,390
absolutely yeah and we and we talked

00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:05,680
about that briefly earlier to where I

00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:07,480
was saying that a lot of times

00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,849
especially new contributors where

00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:14,380
someone will come in and be discouraging

00:48:09,849 --> 00:48:16,960
and or not provide very much guidance on

00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:18,700
how to how to fix it or how to make it

00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,250
better and so then you know things just

00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:23,380
they just go and now it's getting to me

00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:32,020
back at all it's different it is very

00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:35,500
discouraging but it never goes anywhere

00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:37,240
right right that's there there are

00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:39,160
things you can do about it there are

00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,359
things yeah absolutely there there are

00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:41,859
things you can do and this is an

00:48:40,359 --> 00:48:43,869
excellent session to have attended

00:48:41,859 --> 00:48:46,720
because one of the things that that I

00:48:43,869 --> 00:48:48,910
would encourage you to do is do a patch

00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:51,690
review exchange so find someone else

00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:54,160
that's working in in core or in the

00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:56,859
contributing for and say i'll review

00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:58,990
your module if you are you mine so that

00:48:56,859 --> 00:49:01,000
then we have you know someone who is

00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:05,950
reviewing and then also we're working

00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:08,349
with with core mentoring to try to try

00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:10,599
to alleviate some of that problem and

00:49:08,349 --> 00:49:15,099
obviously the more drupal grows the

00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:17,680
harder that gets oh right yeah i guess

00:49:15,099 --> 00:49:20,650
the big difference about core is that um

00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,150
in and the reason i like working in core

00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:25,359
is in contribs are my only do that one

00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:27,970
person if they're not available um you

00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:29,560
know what can you do in kaura there's it

00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:30,880
the patch might sit it needs are you for

00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,349
a long time but once it gets to our TV

00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,540
see a core committer is going to look at

00:49:32,349 --> 00:49:36,130
it so that that's when the reasons I i

00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,930
prefer working in corn general that's

00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:39,280
one reason like contraband jewels are

00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:41,710
not very well maintained anymore so I'm

00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,630
that person for a module you can find on

00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:47,170
microblog profile that a lot of sites

00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:49,270
use oops um but another thing to keep in

00:49:47,170 --> 00:49:51,160
mind is that we're starting to try to

00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:52,599
solve the problem but there's still a

00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:55,089
lot of a lot of patches up so they just

00:49:52,599 --> 00:49:56,349
sit the first thing to do all those

00:49:55,089 --> 00:49:58,570
gates that we mentioned make sure your

00:49:56,349 --> 00:50:00,220
patch meets those gates log onto IRC

00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:02,859
join the drupal contribute channel if

00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:04,810
you're not in there use it anytime

00:50:02,859 --> 00:50:06,640
you're trying to contribute something

00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:08,170
whether it's documentation whether it's

00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,330
a contributed module whether it's a fix

00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:11,680
for core you can ask the question

00:50:10,330 --> 00:50:13,900
and you get to talk to all the smart

00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,060
people like Angie's in that web chick

00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:18,250
isn't that channel all the time I mean

00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:19,480
she lives on IRC I'm on pretty much

00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:21,040
constantly although not during the

00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,780
conference andrea is on a ton of the

00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,670
time so you get a chance to talk to

00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:27,100
people who have a lot of experience talk

00:50:24,670 --> 00:50:28,960
to the core maintain errs and like find

00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:31,480
out okay so i have this patch that makes

00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,580
changes to the entity system who's a

00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:34,870
good person to talk to about that you

00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:37,060
might start by looking into maintainers

00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:38,440
out text and say no fog owes the

00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:40,990
maintainer for that subsystem I'll try

00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:43,150
to ask him he's never on IRC you don't

00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:45,130
know how to contact him you log on log

00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:46,660
in IRC and say oh hey someone know a lot

00:50:45,130 --> 00:50:48,760
about the empty sim and say hey talk to

00:50:46,660 --> 00:50:49,840
her dear there do knows a lot about the

00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,580
entity system he's going to be a call

00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,660
maintain or two and so then you get that

00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:54,460
information about who to contact

00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:56,200
specifically that might give you

00:50:54,460 --> 00:51:00,250
feedback because it's their little sub

00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:01,720
domain of core also another very key

00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:03,460
thing to getting your patch reviewed is

00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:08,290
to make sure that the issue summary is

00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:11,050
up to date and well n verbose you use

00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:14,110
your most verbose mode on the issue some

00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:16,450
bro well okay you're almost most prepend

00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:18,400
on who you are I didn't give really

00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:21,460
verbose sometimes sorry but anyway um

00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:24,160
but you but if the if the issue summary

00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:26,230
is not clear or doesn't make any sense

00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:28,390
or any of those things or not inherent

00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:30,520
you would have fun it reflects the patch

00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:32,110
as of October that doesn't help me if

00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:34,090
you've changed since max right and and

00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:36,850
what what then what ends up happening is

00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:38,350
I go in and I I scan through the issue

00:51:36,850 --> 00:51:40,420
some here and like wait I don't

00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:44,110
understand and then I get distracted and

00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:45,820
this is who I am I'm I'm you know jump

00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:47,650
around so but if it makes sense and I

00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:49,990
can I can kind of get in the zone and I

00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:51,520
can I can do a review but if it if it's

00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:53,950
something that I have to work at in

00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:58,600
order to understand what's going on then

00:51:53,950 --> 00:52:00,730
I will I'm sorry it is what it is I'll

00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:04,600
get distracted and I will move along and

00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:10,710
and it may be days weeks never before

00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:10,710
you back to I'm sorry

00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:17,240
exactly yeah and I love comments like

00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:18,650
that because it's you know I I could

00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:22,910
spend a bunch of my time doing research

00:52:18,650 --> 00:52:24,320
and that's actually a way if it's not a

00:52:22,910 --> 00:52:26,300
patch that you're working on but that

00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:27,850
you're interested in and the person who

00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:31,100
originally posted the patch is missing

00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:32,630
then you if you do take the time to do

00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:34,160
the research and write that summary that

00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:35,450
makes easier even though the person who

00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,220
originally wrote the patch is abandoned

00:52:35,450 --> 00:52:39,410
it it makes it easier for the patch to

00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:40,850
get in because then yeah someone else

00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:42,740
can look at it and all of a sudden

00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:44,240
people say oh hey I have this problem

00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:45,230
too and now I actually understand that

00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:50,030
this is the thing that's supposed to fix

00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:51,890
it and and you can also try to take

00:52:50,030 --> 00:52:55,010
advantage of this but you can also ping

00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:56,480
Jess or I in an IRC and will tell you

00:52:55,010 --> 00:52:58,850
what to do next like we have this

00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:00,500
workflow in our minds of like this is

00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:02,360
just what i would do if i had that

00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:05,270
difficulty getting our exactly and and

00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:07,100
we can also throw new contributors at it

00:53:05,270 --> 00:53:09,230
sometimes if it's something that that

00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:11,690
makes sense to have a new contributor

00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:15,050
you know fix the issue summary or review

00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:16,790
or any of those kinds of things yes

00:53:15,050 --> 00:53:20,540
absolutely make lots of friends

00:53:16,790 --> 00:53:23,150
occasions great segue probably go to the

00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:25,520
slide right yes okay at the end of the

00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:26,660
time for a session now I'm but I'll hang

00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:27,890
around a little bit afterwards if you

00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:29,270
want to come and ask questions we have a

00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:31,520
break afterwards so if anyone has any

00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:34,010
other more specific questions with so

00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:37,280
yeah so some things that we can do next

00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:40,400
is definitely come on Saturday for our

00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:43,640
code sprints they will have to start at

00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:46,280
9am a DS gonna be here and she's going

00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:48,350
to do some awesome a community tools

00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:50,300
workshop which will be from 9am until

00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:54,050
everybody is amazing and awesome with

00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:57,290
their their setup or 1pm whichever comes

00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:58,690
first yeah okay and then we'll be doing

00:53:57,290 --> 00:54:01,970
the mentor a sprint all day I'll be

00:53:58,690 --> 00:54:05,750
handling that and there will also be a

00:54:01,970 --> 00:54:06,710
big hit sprint in that the upstairs I

00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,720
don't actually know where they're going

00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:11,450
to be I keep saying upstairs because the

00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:12,830
past two events had downstairs once was

00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:14,240
where the the core mentoring sprint

00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:17,050
wasn't upstairs was where the in a

00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,740
different room or Prince yeah yeah um

00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:21,290
yeah

00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:22,520
if I thought so did we explain I don't

00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:25,220
think that what the core mentoring

00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:29,690
sprint is is so yeah we didn't say that

00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:31,190
um basically you come and we explain a

00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:33,410
little bit about the arc or mentoring

00:54:31,190 --> 00:54:35,480
initiative and say hey we have all these

00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:37,220
tasks that need to be done in the cork

00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,930
you want to give it a shot and then you

00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:40,190
work with someone else and we'll help

00:54:38,930 --> 00:54:41,210
you through the process of working on a

00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:43,310
passion if you want to do this for a

00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:44,840
pass for you that's awesome we can help

00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:46,040
you mentor you through like oh this is

00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:48,740
what i would do to review the patch or

00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,930
say you know what I wouldn't start with

00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:52,610
that one like that actually can be a

00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:54,050
really helpful thing because when you're

00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:56,000
first getting involved you don't know

00:54:54,050 --> 00:54:57,470
what's difficult and scary versus what's

00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,780
straightforward and someone can give you

00:54:57,470 --> 00:55:01,640
that advice and then that that also so

00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:03,260
what that sprint came out of is actually

00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:05,210
I do this core mentoring thing in IRC

00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:07,460
andrea is one of the facilitators for it

00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:10,780
I'm a facilitator for we have about

00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:12,530
eight people and twice a week I have

00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:14,540
actually there's there's three different

00:55:12,530 --> 00:55:15,740
times a week on the second time is for

00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:18,200
wind sprints which andrea leads by

00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:20,210
herself but in in this time zone in

00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:23,210
sydney it's 1 p.m. on tuesday and i'm

00:55:20,210 --> 00:55:25,580
lee rowland is he he lives here in

00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:27,230
australia so he's a mentor on so he's

00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:29,540
not like falling asleep because it's

00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:31,340
late at night for him and then 930 p.m.

00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:33,020
on friday you'd get Andrea and she would

00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:38,390
have just woken up because we live in

00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:40,550
the States um I that's what your little

00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:41,660
thing he said but if she's not there at

00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:43,070
nine thirty she'll be there I mean

00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:44,930
she'll be there for two two-hour block

00:55:43,070 --> 00:55:47,780
so she'll be there even if that's not

00:55:44,930 --> 00:55:49,190
exactly when it starts um yeah and we do

00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:50,990
the same so it's the same thing but over

00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:53,390
IRC you calm you say hey I want to do

00:55:50,990 --> 00:55:54,740
core mentoring we give you a task you

00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:55,910
try it you can ask us questions were

00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:57,920
there for the whole two hours and then

00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:59,119
we'll try to give you feedback on it and

00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,950
there's a website we used a truck at

00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:03,680
school and then like I said anytime

00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:07,400
drupal dash contribute on IRC that

00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:08,510
channel is the place to go and the

00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,330
quarters launched here though there were

00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:14,080
not that many people here now but yes if

00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:17,080
more people that that's probably what

00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:17,080
excellent

00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:25,920
and conferences are great chance to meet

00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:30,810
people who have ideas yeah that's fine

00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:32,310
we're done are we done alright so anyone

00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:34,410
else have questions we should be just

00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:36,510
like what Uncle Mike yeah we should

00:56:34,410 --> 00:56:40,280
probably let people not feel bad for

00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:40,280
leaving because it is snack time yeah

00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:49,260
the Penguins are Andrea's obsessive and

00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:51,660
she wanted to have three by three and we

00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:54,420
only had eight thank yous I mean I

00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:58,200
killed the joke I'm sorry we could think

00:56:54,420 --> 00:57:00,120
of dozens of people who put anything but

00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:01,440
but it would be like a collage of names

00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:07,590
overlapping and you won't be able to eat

00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:09,060
anything that would have yeah I I got to

00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:13,770
pet a koala that was like the highlight

00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:15,960
of my trip aside from this right right

00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:21,360
