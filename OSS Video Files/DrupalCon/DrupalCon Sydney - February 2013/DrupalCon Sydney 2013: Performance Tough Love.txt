Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Performance Tough Love
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	As a performance engineer, I get asked a lot questions about general Drupal performance issues. About 90% of the time they make no sense and I end up having to ask my own questions to figure out what the real problem is, which is usually much simpler than the original question implied.

This session will be mostly Q & A. You'll ask me questions about your performance issues and I'll either answer them or berate you for asking the wrong question. Either way, I will do my best to leave you with with actionable information on how to improve the performance of your site. Also, if you can get XHProf files to me beforehand or a sanitized copy of your site, I'll gladly go over them during the session.

If you're a developer who has used a profiler before, but didn't quite know what to do with the results, or if you did make changes based on what you saw and it didn't have the impact you had hoped, this session is for you. Even if you've never used a profiler before, this will be a helpful introduction.
