Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Building an awesome e-commerce store in 25 minutes
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	BigCommerce, Shopify and Etsy make it really easy for you to get a really nice, functioning e-commerce system out of the box in 5 minutes, without lifting a finger. And they look sexy.

Did you know that you can do that with Drupal? Yes - you can make a Drupal store look sexy.

In this session we'll look at how you can build a sexy, awesome, amazingly cool, friendly, extensible and customisable store in 25 minutes. Yes. It will look cool. You can sell stuff on it and people might even buy it.

We'll be working through the basics of getting Drupal Commerce Kickstart 2.0 up and running, customising it for Australia and implementing the basic things you want to get up and running selling your products.

so the best thing about this is that

00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:05,759
that's the extent of the inter

00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:08,519
introduction so now that the title have

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,620
suggested the title of today's talk is

00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,960
building an awesome ecommerce site in 25

00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,570
minutes and the tagline is actually

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,869
really important but looks good so some

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,850
of you may have been at my presentation

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:22,439
at Drupal down under last year where we

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,570
did a very very similar thing we built

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,310
it we built an e-commerce website in 25

00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,050
minutes and one of the things that I'd

00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:30,630
say about it is that it looked pretty

00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,399
ugly by the end it was functional it was

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,559
serviceable but it didn't have much of

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,149
an aesthetic appeal and one of the big

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,420
things we're going to look at today is

00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:42,120
how we create a site that not just does

00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,489
a good job but actually gives the users

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,980
a decent hour user experience at the end

00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,800
and appears attractive at least in my

00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,719
opinion with minimal effort now one of

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:54,390
the big things there's a 25 minute time

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,940
limit 25 minutes is a bit of a challenge

00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,280
we'll see how we go we're running the

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,410
demo locally so hopefully the interwebs

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:05,220
won't slow us down but you know we'll

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,689
see how we go a little bit about me my

00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,210
name is Andrew I'm the managing director

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,710
of real world technology solutions real

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,260
world technology solutions is a voice

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,810
data and communications company we

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,210
provide Internet access services content

00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,830
hosting network consulting and

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,229
engineering very much down the technical

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:25,110
end of the world and we also do lots of

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:27,000
our application integration for our

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:30,240
customers so integrating ecommerce

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,189
websites with business process and sites

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,509
that offer more business function than

00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,100
just being something that exists on the

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:36,840
web I'm married I have two beautiful

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,060
kids who you can see in that photo there

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,320
one of whom has really started to talk

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,170
and the other one who just learned to

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,600
sit up last week so I'm that's a little

00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,890
bit about me um so to start with I

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,170
thought it would be good to have a bit

00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:51,360
of a look at what actually makes a good

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,850
ecommerce site and I guess there are

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,310
three things which drive ecommerce site

00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:58,200
development and e-commerce site

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,210
effectiveness when it comes to an actual

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,969
deliverable product the first one is

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,649
aesthetic so how the site looks and how

00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,119
the site feels is really really

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,950
important if you have an ugly sight

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:09,899
people are less likely to buy from you

00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,629
it's relatively straightforward the

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,610
second thing is customer experience so

00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:15,530
the experience

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,810
of your customers interacting with the

00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,060
store is very important one of the

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,610
things is that they say that for every

00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,350
click someone has to make to get from an

00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:26,510
initial looking at a product through to

00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:29,960
the checkout you lose fifty percent of

00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:31,040
your traffic so if it takes you 20

00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,200
clicks to get to the end of your

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,690
checkout process by the time of it you

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,370
start with 100 viewers you've left with

00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:40,100
one person that completes your check out

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:42,560
so things like what the customer

00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,090
engagement process is what the process

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,280
from viewing the product right through

00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:48,440
to check out is very important to making

00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,600
sure that your store is successful and

00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,030
speaking of success the other thing you

00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,920
care about is conversion rate it's great

00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:57,230
to run an e-commerce site that attracts

00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,270
10 million viewers but if only two

00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,650
people buy your product you're not going

00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,790
to stay in business very long and you're

00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,770
not going to be able to afford the

00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:06,950
hosting to run the side let alone be

00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:08,570
able to keep your business afloat so the

00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:11,000
next question is what actually drives

00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:13,280
people to convert to their sales what

00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,550
actually gets them to the end so the

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,190
first thing is a which is going to come

00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:21,350
up is a nice of shopping experience so

00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:24,019
people want to have a smooth seamless

00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:25,640
shopping experience quality of customer

00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:27,290
service and how you as a business

00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,600
interact with them is also really

00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:31,430
important and unfortunately the best

00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,620
e-commerce website in the world isn't

00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:35,180
going to solve that problem for you so

00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,190
things like how you respond to your

00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:38,720
customers there is an element of what

00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:40,549
information you make available to them

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,350
do you publish a phone number are you

00:03:40,549 --> 00:03:44,660
accessible by email how long do you take

00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:46,519
to respond to our questions when people

00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,290
ask you they're not so things that an

00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:49,850
e-commerce site is going to solve for

00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:51,170
you but they're things that a business

00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,840
model that's going to build a successful

00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:55,280
e-commerce site needs to think about the

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,040
last thing that's really effective is

00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,230
peer pressure now my wife o is obviously

00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,180
my wife and we have two kids and she's

00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:04,970
part of a mother's group on Facebook and

00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,250
we were discussing our yesterday how she

00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,959
goes about buying online and I'm pretty

00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,820
sure she spends about two and a half

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,980
thousand dollars per month online I'm

00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:14,570
she may choose to correct me on that at

00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,600
a later stage when she hears this talk

00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:20,329
but she's not here right now and the

00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,859
main reason why she gets to buy all of

00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:23,900
the things that she buys is because

00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:25,789
mothers in her mother's group discuss

00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,480
where to go and buy them and you can get

00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:29,160
this oh and I bought this baby cow

00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,520
and it's really awesome oh and this

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,340
stroller looks really good and so the

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,440
communal aspect of purchasing is very

00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:39,540
very important and is a very very big

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,930
driver for people purchasing things

00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:46,020
online so I'm a company called comscore

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,940
did a survey at the start of 2012 about

00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,220
what actually makes a successful website

00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,290
and you can see up there one of those

00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,820
classical business four quadrant graphs

00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:56,130
showing you how important different

00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,710
things are you can see ease of checkout

00:04:56,130 --> 00:05:00,510
is very much up there in the in the high

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:02,790
importance and also gives customers

00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:04,770
great high satisfaction but then you've

00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,890
got things like ease of making returns

00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:10,080
and exchanges which is not something

00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:12,570
that you know is considered particularly

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,950
a satisfaction thing but still has a

00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,960
really really high importance so if you

00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,880
don't have that your customers are less

00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,460
likely to come to your site and buy

00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,800
their now why do I show you these things

00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,210
I'll show you these things because each

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,710
of these factors which you can see in

00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,830
the listing you can kind of see a score

00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:30,450
that they rated those things sort of how

00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,030
important people found them as a

00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:34,290
percentage value and those things are

00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:36,270
important because when you choose an

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,160
ecommerce package and an e-commerce

00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,750
environment to work in you need

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,060
something that's going to facilitate

00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:44,670
your business operation to be able to do

00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,260
these things as easily as possible so if

00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:48,020
your ecommerce platform makes it really

00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:49,920
hard to handle returns and exchanges

00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,720
then that's going to become a

00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:53,910
frustration for you and for your users

00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,950
if your ecommerce platform has a very

00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,870
complicated checkout process it's going

00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,970
to be a big frustration point for you

00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:01,980
and your users if you don't have the

00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:04,110
option to choose our shipping options

00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:06,210
that becomes a big problem and all of

00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,830
these lead to a reduced conversion late

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:09,510
right which lead to reduced

00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:12,330
profitability for your business which is

00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:13,940
a bad thing so the next thing to think

00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:16,350
about is where are people actually

00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,990
interacting with websites these days and

00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:20,880
particular ecommerce sites go back to

00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,740
2000 it's the boom of the dot-com era

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,480
people are starting to get internet in

00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,900
their homes and people are all buying

00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:30,390
things on their PCs but what's happened

00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:32,550
over the last two years is that sales

00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,470
have increasingly moved to mobile and

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:36,510
that's as a result of things like the

00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,400
success of the ipad and android tablets

00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,920
but also the increased adoption of

00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,450
smartphones so people that

00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,160
the end of two thousand eleven nine

00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:46,200
percent of the e-commerce transactions

00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,880
were made from a mobile device which I

00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,860
find completely staggering thinking

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,720
about it I wouldn't expect that someone

00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:53,100
would sit there on their mobile browse

00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,780
the website and go I'm going to buy that

00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,850
and go through the checkout process

00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,170
beginning to end but then I think about

00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:59,880
my own behavior and I walk into

00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,410
Woolworths and I pull up my mobile phone

00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,880
and I open the Woolworths up and I say

00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,650
i'm looking for milk and then it says

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,110
it's in Aisle seven and all of a sudden

00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:09,150
i realize that i'm interacting with the

00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,130
businesses that I deal with increasingly

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,540
via my mobile device and realize that

00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:15,270
the rest of the world is probably doing

00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,310
that too so all of these things are

00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,690
factors you need to consider in an

00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:21,210
e-commerce platform for your online

00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:23,250
store so I guess this begs the question

00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,450
what are your options what can you do

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,190
out there if you want to get up and

00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:28,290
running really easily and really quickly

00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:30,600
well the first thing first one that I I

00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:33,270
see that I come across all the time is a

00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,890
platform called bigcommerce BigCommerce

00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:36,510
is very very simple you can see their

00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:39,030
website there you can very quickly type

00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:40,650
in your store name your name an email

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,020
address and a password and be up and

00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,540
running on a website five minutes they

00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:48,960
say put your products in be ready to go

00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:50,960
fantastic exciting the next one we come

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,400
across is a platform called Shopify

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,160
Shopify very simple shopping experience

00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,380
again very very easy to get going all of

00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,110
these sites you pay a nominal monthly

00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:04,140
fee to gain access to and when you do

00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,490
that you can put your products in you've

00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:07,200
got a very simple checkout process

00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:08,580
people can start buying stuff from you

00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,230
it's all pretty straightforward you've

00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,970
got community-driven sites like Etsy

00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,560
where you can get online and you can

00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,600
sell all your home wares and jewelry

00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,100
that you've made and that the cupcake

00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,490
that you design last week that you want

00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:22,590
everyone to buy these are out-of-the-box

00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,810
solutions which work really really well

00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,400
they're really simple to build and

00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,860
deploy and they actually look pretty

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,910
good so when it comes down to choosing

00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:31,170
what your site is going to look like

00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:32,930
that they make it really easy to have a

00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:35,310
really good looking really easy website

00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:37,290
but there are some disadvantages of

00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:39,690
using a platform like that they're very

00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:41,820
difficult to customize so if you want to

00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:43,620
do something that's outside the box you

00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,810
need to integrate with with another

00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,390
business system you decide you want to

00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,800
have lots of content on your site that

00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:52,110
you want people to be able to view an

00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,060
access that isn't just a store they're

00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,720
not really designed for that speaking

00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,699
from an Australian

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,740
in context they're mostly designed for

00:08:56,699 --> 00:09:00,779
us and europe and so that's not a

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,370
particularly ideal scenario if you want

00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:05,100
to start up an australian online store

00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,569
and they're difficult to integrate with

00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,060
back office processes so if you've got

00:09:06,569 --> 00:09:11,009
things like you're using my OB or zero

00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,870
or QuickBooks or something like that as

00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:14,459
your accounting system it's difficult to

00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,290
get that information across if you have

00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:18,209
an erp process which you need these

00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,680
stores too heavily integrate with

00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:22,310
there's a lot of work which you need to

00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,800
do to be able to get them to that point

00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:28,110
so I guess the question is what is the

00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,029
solution well dress touched on it in his

00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:31,819
keynote this morning he pointed out that

00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:35,040
Drupal sites are all about content

00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:36,990
community and increasingly Commerce and

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,730
he identified that as one of the big

00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:41,370
things that Drupal 8 is looking to

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:44,040
address and i think that drupal today

00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:47,819
starts to have some decent solutions to

00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,230
this problem so what are they well the

00:09:47,819 --> 00:09:51,209
first one is something called uber cart

00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,550
if you ever built an online store for

00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:55,949
drupal 6 you probably built a teen

00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,810
ubercart it's not a bad ecommerce

00:09:55,949 --> 00:09:59,759
platform but it's pretty ugly they were

00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:01,350
the best screenshots I could find and I

00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:02,819
had to put them like rotate them so that

00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:06,629
they would look kind of more funky and

00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:08,879
awesome but all uber cart stores look

00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:11,339
like that they might have an ugly yellow

00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:14,129
background they might have bright green

00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:15,809
text but that's essentially the look and

00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:17,939
feel that your customers get they don't

00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:20,850
feel nice they don't feel easy to

00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:22,290
interact with one of the things that I

00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:24,540
keep coming across is this product

00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:26,189
called Drupal ecommerce I'd love to show

00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,870
you a screenshot of this but I couldn't

00:10:26,189 --> 00:10:30,480
get it to install and the website's down

00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:32,699
it does have a Drupal 7 version maybe

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,269
it's good I don't know there are it's

00:10:32,699 --> 00:10:37,559
been developed largely in Australia so

00:10:35,269 --> 00:10:39,899
maybe some of the people behind it here

00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:42,480
this week and you can find them and have

00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:43,889
a chat to them about it but we're going

00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,029
to talk about something called drupal

00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:49,980
commerce now drupal commerce is a set is

00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:52,649
basically a rewrite of an e-commerce

00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,809
platform specifically for drupal 7 it's

00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:56,910
built on drupal 7 core technologies

00:10:54,809 --> 00:10:58,829
things like entities it's got high

00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,300
dependency on things like views so

00:10:58,829 --> 00:11:02,399
everything is built in that way it's

00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,220
from a site building perspective if

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,259
you've built a drupal site it's not too

00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,040
difficult to get into drupal commerce

00:11:07,259 --> 00:11:09,420
and

00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,220
get up and running pretty quickly and

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:13,800
last year we built a drupal commerce

00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:16,320
store that looked largely like this this

00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:19,589
is a sample screenshot from la la botte

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:22,589
so one of our BOTS demos of Drupal

00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:23,820
commerce um but it's pretty ugly that

00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:26,670
sort of my feeling it looks like a

00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,500
Drupal 7 default install there's nothing

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,720
pretty there's nothing exciting about it

00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,160
and I'd be pretty embarrassed if I

00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,660
showed that to my customers as an

00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:38,160
example of what a drupal commerce site

00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:40,199
can do unfortunately the people behind

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,779
drupal commerce saw that this was a

00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:45,180
problem and thought what can we do to

00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:46,589
get around this and so they put together

00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:48,180
something called commerce kickstart and

00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:51,089
in fact that's how that site came about

00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,529
but they recently revamped it into

00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:55,889
something called commerce kickstart to

00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:57,959
and most of what we do today is going to

00:11:55,889 --> 00:12:00,120
be built on that concept so this is a

00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:03,209
commerce kickstart to out of the box

00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:05,610
store with australian chosen as the

00:12:03,209 --> 00:12:07,610
default now it's still not right you can

00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:10,199
see things like the currency is wrong

00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:12,209
it's selling t-shirts that's great but

00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:13,649
my business sells mugs and so it's not

00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:14,490
really going to be appropriate so what

00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,690
we're going to do is we get we're going

00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:17,670
to change some things we're going to

00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:22,260
work with a commerce kickstart base

00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:25,139
theme and we're going to turn it into a

00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:26,160
mug store and hopefully by the end of 25

00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:29,160
minutes we'll have a site that looks

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,139
exactly like this and if you go to make

00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:34,709
me a mug please calm you can see that as

00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:36,750
a real site now so let's build it how

00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:37,920
are we going to build it we're going to

00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:39,389
start with something called commerce

00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,310
kickstart which you can find a

00:12:39,389 --> 00:12:43,800
drupal.org / project / commerce

00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:44,790
underscore kickstart the first thing I'm

00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,069
going to say is if you're going to build

00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:51,300
a commerce site and you have never used

00:12:47,069 --> 00:12:53,519
commerce before only start here do not

00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,380
go to the Commerce project and download

00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,720
it do not try and build it yourself you

00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:00,089
will waste hours and hours and hours of

00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,110
endless frustration when you go but I

00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:02,250
don't know how to do this I don't know

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,189
how to get there blah blah blah blah

00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,990
blah start here it makes it simple and

00:13:05,189 --> 00:13:08,880
easy even if you think you're going to

00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,949
change your store down the track start

00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,079
here don't go anywhere else it's got

00:13:10,949 --> 00:13:15,300
everything in it the theme for commerce

00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:16,410
kickstart is built on the omega theme so

00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,569
if you want to change the way that it

00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:20,040
looks and feels and your designers want

00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:21,660
to work in a responsive environment

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,760
amiga is not a bad place to

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:24,980
start and commerce kickstart has all of

00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:28,800
the bits and pieces you need in there

00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:30,210
but again this is a US Europe centric

00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,520
solution unfortunately it's not

00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:33,600
particularly friendly to Australia so

00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,800
the next step that we're going to do is

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,090
it going to add Commerce Australia

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,190
Commerce Australia is a really really

00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:40,500
simple module there are two components

00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:42,030
they've got a GST rule set and they fix

00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:44,580
up prices so they actually look like

00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:46,020
Australian prices we're going to play a

00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:49,230
little bit with commerce custom order

00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:52,830
status my company used to run a computer

00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:54,630
hardware online store we sold lots of

00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,400
bits and pieces to people all around

00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,530
Australia lots of people bought from us

00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,820
and very quickly we discovered that we

00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,950
needed to be able to tell our customers

00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,510
things like we've got your order packed

00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:05,280
and it's ready to go and they need to be

00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:08,550
able to log in and see that we've got

00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:10,140
your order has shipped and it's gone and

00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:13,200
here's the tracking details and bits and

00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:15,450
pieces commerce custom order status lets

00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,590
us build extra status information into

00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:18,270
an order like your items are on

00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,380
backorder blah blah blah blah blah blah

00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:20,460
so we're going to play a little bit with

00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,440
that so that you can get a bit of back

00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,480
office integration and improve the

00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,100
experience and all being well we're

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,860
going to do real live payments with

00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:31,290
commerce secure pee-yew now I'm secure

00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:33,380
pay is a merchant company they are owned

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:35,490
by australia post as far as i'm aware

00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:37,080
they've got integration with all the

00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,610
banks so if you've already got an if

00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,290
possible your customers have an F post

00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:41,880
terminal with their bank they can apply

00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:43,710
for an online merchant facility with

00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,840
their bank and very easily and simply

00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:47,010
connected up to secure pay you can do

00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:49,380
the same thing with other services like

00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:51,060
a way or PayPal or bits and pieces like

00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,050
that but this is pretty easy to get up

00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,770
and running and will show you exactly

00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:58,950
what that looks like so without much

00:14:55,770 --> 00:15:00,270
further ado this is the live site you

00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:03,180
can see it's got a nice slideshow

00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:04,770
rotation thing happening and what I'm

00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,200
actually going to do at this point is

00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,910
get adventurous and try and merge my

00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:12,560
display so that I'm not working over

00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:16,880
there and over here arrangement and

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,880
mirror displays let's see what happens

00:15:18,699 --> 00:15:24,679
this is highly technical and the next

00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:27,949
thing we're going to do here i am so

00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:31,459
that's not too bad and will come into

00:15:27,949 --> 00:15:33,470
safari so you can see we've got a nice

00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:35,059
slider here i'll just show you a couple

00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:37,699
of quick features around i can click on

00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:39,019
these different things and it changes so

00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:40,489
we've got some slides there we've got

00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:42,860
some product call out boxes here which

00:15:40,489 --> 00:15:46,309
we haven't changed from the defaults i'm

00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:50,029
pretty sure this store has some there we

00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:53,360
go Thank You Drupal so let's go back to

00:15:50,029 --> 00:15:54,709
management that's going to be awesome I

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,059
would show you manage my orders but

00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:57,170
that's not going to work we're not going

00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:57,949
to work on the production site and

00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,929
stayed what we're going to do is we're

00:15:57,949 --> 00:16:02,869
going to work on a local version here so

00:15:59,929 --> 00:16:04,879
on my computer i'm hosting dev make me a

00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:07,399
mug please calm it's a really really

00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:09,559
exciting website don't go there and

00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,720
let's get started ok what i've done here

00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:14,480
is i've downloaded the commerce

00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,639
kickstart package already and it lives

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,869
on my lovely vm server over here and

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,179
it's telling me that i have a file

00:16:17,869 --> 00:16:23,329
permissions issue so excuse the fact

00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:24,860
that you know i'm just about to do

00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:27,139
something really nasty and dirty but

00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,149
it's going to solve the problem if you

00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:31,249
use a web host that uses cpanel or

00:16:29,149 --> 00:16:33,170
something like that most of these things

00:16:31,249 --> 00:16:35,420
get taken care off for you without too

00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:38,540
much trouble we're going to put in some

00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:40,399
database database details really really

00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,679
complicated we're going to hit save and

00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,509
continue and once again we discover that

00:16:42,679 --> 00:16:50,749
my database passwords wrong that's a bit

00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:57,439
of a problem live demos grant all

00:16:50,749 --> 00:17:02,679
privileges on Emmy make mean dot star to

00:16:57,439 --> 00:17:09,130
meme identified by password semicolon

00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:10,939
let's see how that goes password really

00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:13,279
that's because that's not what the

00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:15,919
database is called show database how

00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:23,340
about we just do create database mean

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:26,470
there we go yeah I'll get there thanks

00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:32,560
this is really annoying okay drop

00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:35,740
database test create database test that

00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:37,720
our base test I could also use PHP my

00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:47,200
admin which is installed on this dev

00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:49,750
environment well okay presh up and we

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,310
hit install so so far we are three

00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:52,690
minutes into our install process and

00:17:51,310 --> 00:18:05,440
it's taken that long because of my in

00:17:52,690 --> 00:18:07,300
competence wait for a little while so

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,800
these are all of the reasons why use

00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,180
commerce kickstart you saw that it

00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,590
installed a lot of modules you didn't

00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:14,290
see what most of them were called and

00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:17,680
those modules make comic commerce

00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:20,230
kickstart make commerce work for you so

00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:25,210
this website is called make me our mug

00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:28,090
please ! webmaster @ make me a mug

00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:30,580
please calm we're going to leave the

00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:32,590
credentials at defaults we're going to

00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:35,170
go where in Australia and we're in

00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:41,620
Sydney believe it or not I'm going to

00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:42,700
hit save and continue and we now at the

00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,530
point where we're going to choose some

00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:46,120
defaults so we're going to go Australia

00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,530
we're going to install the demo store I

00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,030
think that's a great place to start

00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,070
particularly if you've never built an

00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:52,750
e-commerce store before gives you some

00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:54,460
sample products and sample content to

00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,990
work with and it's actually pretty easy

00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,940
to customize stuff from that so we're

00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:59,200
going to start there we don't really

00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,430
care about translation because all of

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,350
our customers are in Australia and I

00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:04,390
don't speak any other languages we're

00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,760
going to put our tax rate into Australia

00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:09,070
and we're not going to care about sample

00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,840
tax rate so you can use one of the US or

00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,550
European defaults to be really nice if

00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,710
there was an Australian default in there

00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:16,750
maybe someone can contribute a patch for

00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,710
that down the track we hit create and

00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,260
finish and then we just wait a little

00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:23,010
bit longer coming up to five minutes so

00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,010
we've got 20 minutes left

00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:29,959
my sense of time is elastic too so if

00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:31,009
you had a look and you went all it's

00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:39,440
actually only been three and a half

00:19:31,009 --> 00:19:41,209
minutes we'll see how we go so it's

00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,639
activating all the demo content to do

00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:44,779
the different bits and pieces now some

00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:46,489
of the things is that there are some

00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:48,799
demo features of bits and pieces in the

00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:50,509
site which are defined in code as part

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,190
of the commerce kickstart package that

00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:54,349
does make it a little bit easy a little

00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,700
bit difficult to change things but you

00:19:54,349 --> 00:19:57,320
can turn them off and add them back in

00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,369
and bits and pieces I'll show you what

00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,779
some of those things are I won't

00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:04,929
necessarily show you today how to get

00:19:59,779 --> 00:20:09,169
around that but we'll sort of get there

00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:11,179
and we're importing the content now need

00:20:09,169 --> 00:20:12,679
a faster laptop I think I said this last

00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:14,779
year and then I brought a faster laptop

00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:18,109
and now I think I need a faster one

00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:21,709
again unfortunately apple doesn't make

00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:30,440
them faster than this at the moment 10

00:20:21,709 --> 00:20:31,759
of 21 need some get a very very very but

00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,839
so the question was what do you get if

00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:34,669
you install it without the sample

00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:37,159
content yet all of the modules installed

00:20:34,669 --> 00:20:39,139
you get a basic framework but you don't

00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:40,969
get things like menus in there you don't

00:20:39,139 --> 00:20:42,859
get your default product content types

00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:44,779
in there you don't get your default

00:20:42,859 --> 00:20:46,099
products so even if you're going to

00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:47,809
install it without the sample content

00:20:46,099 --> 00:20:50,089
what you should do is install another

00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:53,209
install with the sample content to see

00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:54,559
how they suggest you do stuff because if

00:20:53,209 --> 00:20:57,639
you don't do it that way you'll go how

00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:00,469
do I do that and just get very confused

00:20:57,639 --> 00:21:02,749
so the biggest thing about this is is

00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:10,009
copy learn by copying what someone else

00:21:02,749 --> 00:21:12,709
does and we're almost there who we're at

00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:14,629
our site and as soon as we get into our

00:21:12,709 --> 00:21:16,489
first install of commerce the first

00:21:14,629 --> 00:21:18,739
thing that happens is that we get left

00:21:16,489 --> 00:21:20,539
with a getting started screen so now

00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:22,099
this getting started screen includes

00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:25,219
some lovely videos about how to do

00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:26,599
different things it has a user guide so

00:21:25,219 --> 00:21:28,669
that you can work out how to get up and

00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:31,159
running so if I miss something or say

00:21:28,669 --> 00:21:32,450
something wrong or you just want to do

00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:34,459
something we don't show you how to do

00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:37,309
today you can install commerce kickstart

00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:39,440
and follow the help it's great there's

00:21:37,309 --> 00:21:41,360
some extra services you can buy

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,710
never used them maybe they're good you

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,269
can tell me once you've used it and

00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:46,580
there's some quick links to do some

00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:49,940
basic things so pretty much we're done

00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:53,049
so that was seven minutes and I'm going

00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:56,179
to quit Dropbox in just a minute and

00:21:53,049 --> 00:21:59,149
we'll go from there so that's pretty

00:21:56,179 --> 00:22:01,070
straightforward now unfortunately we're

00:21:59,149 --> 00:22:03,620
not quite done though you can see our

00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:05,750
currency settings are wrong we don't

00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,370
really have any understanding of GST or

00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:10,309
different bits and pieces so we still

00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:12,950
need to do a little bit more now I have

00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:15,409
pre downloaded into my drupal install a

00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:19,519
couple of modules the first one which I

00:22:15,409 --> 00:22:21,919
downloaded was the commerce Australia

00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:24,649
module so this has the Commerce

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,990
Australian currency display and also has

00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:29,629
the GST module so we're just going to

00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:31,460
save those turn them on and what that

00:22:29,629 --> 00:22:33,559
does is that gives us tax rules for GST

00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:36,169
so that when i go to buy something it

00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:38,659
knows whether or not a GST it knows that

00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:40,460
GST and australia is ten percent and it

00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:42,379
knows that GST doesn't apply when you

00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,759
ship stuff outside of australia which is

00:22:42,379 --> 00:22:46,009
really important because if your website

00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:48,350
sells things outside of australia it

00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:50,690
actually has to distinguish between the

00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,860
price of what you're going to sell so

00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:54,350
those are modules have now been

00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,840
installed and we'll just close that and

00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:59,179
this is where having a 1024 x 768 screen

00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:01,730
isn't great for Drupal anymore so now if

00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:03,320
we come back to our homepage commerce

00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,490
kickstart you can see our price currency

00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,370
that's the first thing you notice is

00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:09,649
updated so we're now saying dollar

00:23:07,370 --> 00:23:13,220
naught point 99 instead of not point 99

00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:14,570
aud the next thing we're going to do is

00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,710
we're going to change the logo of the

00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:17,350
site so we're going to go to site

00:23:15,710 --> 00:23:19,460
settings we're going to go to appearance

00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:24,230
we're going to change the theme settings

00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:26,509
and we're going to no longer use the

00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:30,649
default logo we're going to upload a

00:23:26,509 --> 00:23:37,279
custom logo and our store we're going to

00:23:30,649 --> 00:23:39,679
save the configuration there we go ok

00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:40,879
most of the way there the next thing

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,340
that we're going to do is we're going to

00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:45,049
change the slider so you can see here

00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:47,120
it's great if we're selling t-shirts we

00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:48,379
don't sell t-shirts we sell some mugs so

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,450
we're going to go to content we're going

00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:53,330
to add content we're going to go to

00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:55,400
slideshow we're going to

00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:57,290
choose a file first because I can't

00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,960
remember what's in that and so we're

00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:02,930
going to do your logo here and we're

00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:06,130
going to call it your logo here now if

00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:09,530
you have a look have I got open up in

00:24:06,130 --> 00:24:11,690
chrome you can see when you have a look

00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:14,840
here it's got add your own custom logo

00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:16,280
so from a commerce kickstart perspective

00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:19,580
if you're happy to go with this default

00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,650
thing this is what's called the headline

00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:23,360
and this is what's called the tagline

00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:25,940
it's a bit confusing given the fields

00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:29,990
are out of order but we're going to say

00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:32,270
custom logo and here make your own ok

00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:35,510
and now and we can put a link to some

00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:40,280
content here so we'll make it our custom

00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:42,950
dustrial logos i'm going to hit save ok

00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:45,350
let's put some content in but for

00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:48,740
actually interestingness we go back to

00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:50,930
the homepage and we can see now that has

00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:53,030
appeared as the first and primary slider

00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:55,580
on our homepage and we've got that there

00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:57,440
now we actually need to do a little bit

00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,210
more than that because we don't want the

00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,470
other content that's now so we'll just

00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:06,740
come in here and we'll delete those

00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:08,090
things bulk operations delete content if

00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,890
at any point anyone has a question about

00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,780
what I'm doing please stop me and ask

00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:15,830
and we're just going to confirm what we

00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:18,260
don't need those anymore and very

00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,910
quickly and you can see it's updated the

00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,160
other arrows on the side aren't there

00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:25,250
anymore so very very simple very easy to

00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:27,500
get in there and change we're going to

00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:28,700
add a couple more slideshow items and

00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:31,400
then we'll get to the fun stuff of

00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:37,960
adding products so choose file we're

00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:44,840
going to go coffee your way your coffee

00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:47,150
your way now your coffee your way we're

00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:51,970
going to save that and then we're going

00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:54,830
to content add content slide show and

00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:57,560
this is going to be whatever the last

00:25:54,830 --> 00:26:00,110
one ears which is save twenty five

00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:04,130
percent on shipping save twenty five

00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:05,389
percent on shipping big orders big

00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:09,049
discounts

00:26:05,389 --> 00:26:13,459
when you order big because that's great

00:26:09,049 --> 00:26:15,200
marketing right now I didn't put links

00:26:13,459 --> 00:26:18,259
on those last two things so when you

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:20,029
come back here and now you can see save

00:26:18,259 --> 00:26:21,529
up to twenty-five percent of and you can

00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:23,149
see you know that's that's a bit of a

00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:25,700
problem but someone can go in and fix

00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:29,749
that a bit later I don't have a link

00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:31,579
here but I do have a link here because i

00:26:29,749 --> 00:26:33,709
didn't put in a link you can also see

00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:35,959
that our clean urls haven't enabled on

00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:37,700
my install for some reason I don't know

00:26:35,959 --> 00:26:41,479
why that is someone can fix that on my

00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:43,579
computer later next thing that we're

00:26:41,479 --> 00:26:47,119
going to do we're going to change the

00:26:43,579 --> 00:26:49,639
menu so in my store we sell mugs we

00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:52,609
don't sell things to carry or to geek

00:26:49,639 --> 00:26:55,969
out or to wear so how about we start by

00:26:52,609 --> 00:26:58,519
removing all of the sample products so

00:26:55,969 --> 00:27:03,159
we'll come in here and we'll just delete

00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:06,649
them and i'm going to say confirm

00:27:03,159 --> 00:27:08,029
because we don't really care the next

00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:10,519
thing we'll do is we'll modify this menu

00:27:08,029 --> 00:27:12,499
so that we have less stuff in it but you

00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:14,629
can just as easily modify the menu so

00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:17,299
that you have your own categories and

00:27:14,629 --> 00:27:20,089
content so we're going to go to site

00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:24,200
settings structure we're going to click

00:27:20,089 --> 00:27:26,119
on menus and we're going to modify think

00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,009
it's the main menu yes here we are okay

00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:29,659
we don't care about to carry we don't

00:27:28,009 --> 00:27:34,029
care to geek out and we don't care about

00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:36,289
to wear and we save configuration okay

00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:37,609
we've now got to store that starts to

00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:40,459
look like the kind of thing that we want

00:27:37,609 --> 00:27:44,239
now we sell two kinds of mugs in my

00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:46,700
store I because that's all we have time

00:27:44,239 --> 00:27:47,929
to do in 25 minutes so we're going to go

00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,190
products we're going to add a new

00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:51,619
product we're going to call it a drink

00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:55,759
product and we're going to call it a tea

00:27:51,619 --> 00:28:01,219
cup this is a tea cup it's pretty cool

00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:03,649
and it is a red tea cup and it is

00:28:01,219 --> 00:28:06,320
fifteen dollars and it's including GST

00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:10,249
and we're going to put in an image of

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:14,690
the cup which we're going to go here red

00:28:10,249 --> 00:28:16,639
cup where are you red mug surely I have

00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:17,690
a red cup i had a red cup once upon a

00:28:16,639 --> 00:28:24,289
time

00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:27,860
um maybe downloads there we go there's

00:28:24,289 --> 00:28:29,659
my red cup upload and I'm going to save

00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:32,480
that variation but actually sell

00:28:29,659 --> 00:28:34,549
multiple kinds of mugs so I'm going to

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,590
add a new variation I also sell a blue

00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:39,200
one which is also fifteen dollars

00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:41,899
including GST and I'm going to choose a

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,840
file and we're going to come back over

00:28:41,899 --> 00:28:51,649
here to mug stock and we're going to

00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:54,799
grab a blue blue blue blue Cup blue Cup

00:28:51,649 --> 00:28:57,230
there we go we're going to save that

00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:59,299
variation now we're going to choose a

00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:01,490
collection to drink with we're going to

00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:02,690
choose a category coffee mugs I'm going

00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,970
to say it's unisex and we don't really

00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:08,179
care about brand now those things are

00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:09,409
just fields which correlate to going to

00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:11,679
be a little bit Drupal technical for

00:29:09,409 --> 00:29:14,570
half a second but correlate to the views

00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,909
which display stuff here so when I click

00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:18,440
on to drink with I get a coffee mugs

00:29:16,909 --> 00:29:20,389
category which looks something like this

00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,580
and it's now got my tea cup which is

00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:25,159
available in two colors red and blue

00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:27,500
when I click on my teacup you can see

00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:30,080
the red one I select the blue one and it

00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:33,259
updates and changes so very easy to do

00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:35,330
custom product commerce options and I

00:29:33,259 --> 00:29:37,700
can order two of those and I can add it

00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:39,950
to my cart you can see it's pretty

00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,210
nicely added it to my cart and I can go

00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:42,860
straight to the checkout now with the

00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:44,299
right product image or i can continue

00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,220
shopping and i can buy the red one and

00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:48,799
i'll buy four of the red one i'm going

00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:50,929
to add it to my cart and that's

00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,669
fantastic I'll just continue shopping

00:29:50,929 --> 00:29:58,429
and I really like this so I'm going to

00:29:52,669 --> 00:30:01,690
tweet about this and say tea cups really

00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:05,570
awesome and we're going to go hash

00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:07,129
drupalcon and tweet and everyone's going

00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,539
to go what on earth because that URL

00:30:07,129 --> 00:30:10,879
doesn't exist in the real world but

00:30:08,539 --> 00:30:12,830
that's okay but you can now see that

00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:15,070
that's publicly recommended by Andrew

00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:18,710
Yeager and I think if I reload this page

00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:20,450
not has an updated properly commerce

00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:22,370
kickstart also supports social

00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:24,320
integration so if you want people to

00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:25,700
login to your website using their

00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:27,529
Facebook credentials or their Twitter

00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,389
credentials you need to go to Facebook's

00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:31,580
website or Twitter's website and get our

00:30:29,389 --> 00:30:33,230
application authentication tokens

00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,970
work really well in a kind of sand box

00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:36,530
testing environment like this but it

00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:39,500
means that when people need to log in to

00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:40,490
update their usernames or passwords you

00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,810
want to store their shipping information

00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:44,150
in bits and pieces they don't need their

00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:46,310
own account which increases people's

00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:48,140
like ease of them accessing your website

00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:49,880
but then also increase your so increases

00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,380
your social connectiveness so i hope

00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,220
what you're starting to see is that a

00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,810
lot of the things that we're talking

00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,640
about is how people interact with other

00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,740
people how people interact with the

00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,240
store and how you as a store builder can

00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,400
start to get in and do things pretty

00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:04,280
quickly let's just talk for a second

00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,920
about a check out here so we're going to

00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,360
my check out we've got a teacup blue and

00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,910

00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:12,590
that product code for me and a red tea

00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:15,200
cup you can go in the back end and

00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:16,640
adjust those if you've got is PN's or no

00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,070
bar codes or something you want on your

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,350
products it's got the GST amount eight

00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:23,030
dollars 16 which is right $90 order

00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:25,760
we're going to go to the checkout and

00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:28,760
we're going to choose some shipping

00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:32,710

which passes some validation and there

00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,630
we go I've got an order and I can view

00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,760
my order okay so this is what I is an

00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:03,500
end user would see on the site for my

00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,590
order it's got some order history so

00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:07,970
people can see what's going on I because

00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:09,830
i'm an admin on the site at the moment i

00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:11,630
can log in and update some information

00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:13,040
about where the orders up to but i can

00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:15,110
see lots of little bits of information

00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,460
in there okay basic functioning

00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:17,540
e-commerce store we've still got a

00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:19,850
couple of things to do to make it

00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:21,770
worthwhile so the first thing is we need

00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:23,960
to take people's money really so what

00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:27,260
we're going to do is we're going to open

00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:28,250
up our store settings and in fact we

00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:30,680
going to go to our site settings i'm

00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:32,420
going to turn on the secure pay model so

00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,970
if i come in here and I search for

00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:37,490
secure pay which I've already downloaded

00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:40,720
I'll just turn it on and I'm going to

00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:40,720
hit save down here

00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:48,639
wait a couple seconds for that to finish

00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:54,159
okay and then we're going to go to store

00:32:48,639 --> 00:32:56,169
settings payment methods we've got to

00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,000
set some things for the secure pee-pee I

00:32:56,169 --> 00:32:59,950
to work properly so currently we've got

00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,970
the kickstart example payment module we

00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,309
got to disable that because we don't

00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:04,870
want to take payment that way anymore

00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:06,340
but we'd like to take payment via the

00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:07,720
secure pay credit card model which

00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:09,789
module we're going to enable that we're

00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,649
going to confirm that we're going to

00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:13,360
come in here we're just going to set the

00:33:11,649 --> 00:33:15,639
settings so that it can do its basic

00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,129
things so we can set some events that

00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:19,720
affect how it works and whether or not

00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:21,460
this payment module would be available

00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,669
that's pretty complicated and we're not

00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:27,070
going to go into that today but where is

00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:38,080
the settings that I need I need to get

00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:39,429
to what it was there here we go this is

00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,470
what we need so we need a merchant ID

00:33:39,429 --> 00:33:44,799
and a password to get in there and put

00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:46,870
these in so in my case I'm just going to

00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:50,500
quickly grab the sample merchant ID and

00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:53,110
password and we're going to use that one

00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:55,360
there and we're going to put that there

00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:56,950
and we're going to grab that one there

00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,509
and we're going to paste that we're in

00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,950
australian dollars and because this is

00:33:58,509 --> 00:34:02,679
just a test account we do that and we're

00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:04,840
gonna hit save okay we've now got live

00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:06,070
credit card processing well semi live

00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,059
because I can't use a real credit card

00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:09,460
number and I can't take someone's

00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:11,200
payment but you know you get the idea so

00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,210
that's done and then the last thing

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,980
which we need to do to sort of make this

00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:16,990
functional is what I talked about

00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,550
earlier about having status messages for

00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:22,300
orders so we're just going to jump into

00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:24,700
modules and we're going to go to status

00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:26,589
that's probably out there we go commerce

00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:28,359
custom order status which is the module

00:34:26,589 --> 00:34:31,260
which I'd already downloaded and we're

00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:31,260
just going to enable that

00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:40,089
okay store settings pretty sure it's

00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,770
under order settings you can see here

00:34:40,089 --> 00:34:43,929
now we can see all of our order statuses

00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:46,119
in there and we can add a new one so if

00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:48,909
I want to do something like preparing

00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:51,220
shipment and this happens while your

00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:53,169
order is pending before completed and

00:34:51,220 --> 00:35:00,970
we're just going to enable that and save

00:34:53,169 --> 00:35:02,500
it and preparing shipment save okay so

00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:05,020
what that means now is that when I come

00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,580
into this order here I didn't have

00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:09,460
preparing shipment in here before but I

00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:10,780
do now and I can save that okay now if

00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:12,430
you want to do something like trigger an

00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,570
email to go to your customers whenever

00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:16,990
you put their order into preparing

00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:19,150
shipment status you can use what's

00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:21,550
called rules within drupal commerce to

00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:23,440
trigger actions on the basis of that so

00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:25,270
you can write a rule which says when an

00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,050
order is changed to preparing shipment

00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:31,420
status send an email or post to twitter

00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:33,160
or any of the other things that there

00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:35,140
are rules modules out there to allow you

00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,119
to do and there's some really really

00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,560
really good videos on how to manage

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:42,400
those things and make those changes

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:44,200
which you can find under the help with

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,849
in commerce kickstart which you can just

00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,230
get access to their and we'll talk a

00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:49,060
little bit more about some other places

00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:50,320
you can go for help down the track so

00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:51,970
just to prove that that actually did

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,339
work in that I can now buy something

00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:55,450
with my art credit card we are jumping

00:35:54,339 --> 00:35:57,160
here we're going to go to drink with

00:35:55,450 --> 00:36:00,369
we're going to grab this will buy a

00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:02,830
thousand of these i'm going to add it to

00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:04,560
my cart and i'm going to go to straight

00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:09,190
to the check out this time around and

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:11,140
check out okay quantities right you can

00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:13,480
see the GST is all right you know it

00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:16,690
saved my address from last time because

00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,250
my accounts logged in and i can ship it

00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:19,839
to a different address or the same as my

00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:21,700
billing address continue the next step

00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:25,810
exactly what we've seen before we've got

00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:31,990
some shipping options and will pop in a

00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:37,050
card number now this is really going to

00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:37,050
send off to the to the

00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,420
secure pay gateway and ask them to

00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:48,820
authorize the card and that's a magic

00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:53,830
test card number that they provide what

00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:59,440
did I do wrong this time 44 4 4 3 3 3 3

00:36:53,830 --> 00:37:03,280
2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 continue to the

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:07,060
next step we go checkouts complete give

00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,220
you my order and payments being taken

00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:11,260
and everything else like that so pretty

00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:13,300
much that's very very simply everything

00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:14,890
you can do with BigCommerce that's

00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:17,260
useful and everything you can do with

00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:19,030
Shopify that's really useful to get you

00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:22,900
up and running in an e-commerce store in

00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:28,030
well under 25 minutes so that's the

00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:30,160
start of what I wanted to show you and

00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:34,600
which is going to turn off mirroring

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,490
again and we do that under arrangement

00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:40,750
don't we this is all very technical for

00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:44,110
me go beautiful and now we come back

00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:47,260
here and we go oh that's the other

00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:49,230
important thing to show okay one of the

00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:54,160
things i mentioned earlier on was mobile

00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:57,430
now because commerce kickstart is built

00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,650
on a responsive omega theme if I grab my

00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:02,560
iphone and I go to this website it

00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:05,320
actually readjusts all of the content

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:08,230
and all of the layouts to be appropriate

00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:12,100
for mobile and I can come in here and I

00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:17,020
can under here I can go to to drink with

00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:19,360
and I get a sensible product layout and

00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:22,540
there's my teacup and I can click on

00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:24,550
that I can come in here and there's the

00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:26,590
red one I can actually get the blue one

00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,150
and it changes and updates and notice

00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:29,320
that it didn't while the page refresh

00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:30,430
that didn't send me to a different spot

00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,920
in the page and now I've got the blue

00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:35,680
tea cup and I can buy it all from my

00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:38,980
iphone from here but what if I was using

00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:41,490
an iPad well fortunately here's one I

00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:41,490
prepared earlier

00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:49,269
which is not going to fit so we might

00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:56,410
just rotate that rotate right you know

00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:58,269
it's better just Safari yeah so here the

00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:00,519
website I prepared earlier you can see

00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:02,739
it's rearranged the content to be

00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:05,170
appropriate for an iPad and look pretty

00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:07,209
good so mobile integration straight out

00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:09,190
of the box no effort from me I've got a

00:39:07,209 --> 00:39:11,529
functioning working mobile site straight

00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:13,059
to market in less than 25 minutes I had

00:39:11,529 --> 00:39:14,680
product images ready I had some other

00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:16,329
content prepared but I haven't done

00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:19,900
anything particularly special to get up

00:39:16,329 --> 00:39:23,619
and running to do that so the questions

00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:24,880
from here are what else is cool so what

00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:26,529
else might I want to do in my e-commerce

00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,239
store that I haven't shown you right now

00:39:26,529 --> 00:39:31,719
well the first one is shipping with

00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:33,459
Australia Post so i can use some drupal

00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:35,349
commerce modules which are available to

00:39:33,459 --> 00:39:37,779
put in product weights and product sizes

00:39:35,349 --> 00:39:39,789
and then there's a sample sandbox

00:39:37,779 --> 00:39:41,259
project which you can get hopefully it

00:39:39,789 --> 00:39:43,660
will be released soon as a full project

00:39:41,259 --> 00:39:46,749
for your Australia Post shipping and it

00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:49,119
with an Australia Post shipping API key

00:39:46,749 --> 00:39:50,799
will let you ask Australia Post how much

00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,390
will it cost to send this item via

00:39:50,799 --> 00:39:54,130
express post a regular post or

00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:56,380
international post anywhere in the world

00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:59,529
so you can have real live up to date

00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:01,059
shipping figures on your website you

00:39:59,529 --> 00:40:02,199
might decide you want to do something a

00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:03,999
little bit different or a little bit

00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:06,699
special and there's some web form

00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:08,920
integration available for our Drupal

00:40:06,699 --> 00:40:10,089
commerce now what this might mean is

00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,229
that you have our forum where you

00:40:10,089 --> 00:40:13,209
collect a lot of information about

00:40:11,229 --> 00:40:15,279
someone and as part of that form you

00:40:13,209 --> 00:40:17,019
want them to choose which color t-shirt

00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:19,660
you want them to buy or something like

00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:25,059
that web form integration allows you to

00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:26,440
include products into your web form so

00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:28,329
that as part of the form that they fill

00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,739
out they can say i want this product or

00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:30,999
that product or different bits and

00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:32,410
pieces like that and then when they

00:40:30,999 --> 00:40:34,329
submit the form those things get added

00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:35,859
to their cart and then you can redirect

00:40:34,329 --> 00:40:38,079
them through to a check out using rules

00:40:35,859 --> 00:40:39,789
in standard ways with web form which is

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:43,390
pretty nice and pretty pretty smooth and

00:40:39,789 --> 00:40:44,949
the last one is one of the things we

00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:46,809
might want to do on our online store

00:40:44,949 --> 00:40:48,219
that sells mugs is to custom print some

00:40:46,809 --> 00:40:50,319
logos on them or to give the opportunity

00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:52,059
for someone to write some text like

00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:54,759
daddy's the best or something like that

00:40:52,059 --> 00:40:57,070
on their cup and commerce custom product

00:40:54,759 --> 00:40:58,990
which is over here actually

00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:01,600
lets you do that very easily you can

00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:03,580
turn this module on and this lets you

00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:06,510
add some functionality and some features

00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:09,520
to the to the Commerce products websites

00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:10,660
and to the Comets products are bits and

00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,370
pieces so that when someone adds it to

00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:14,380
their cart you can ask them for some

00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:16,270
additional information like what do you

00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:17,920
want to print on your cup or bits and

00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:20,910
pieces like that that gets saved with

00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,020
the order which you can then go and find

00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:24,940
so one of the questions that people

00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:27,670
often ask is I've got started with

00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:29,470
Drupal commerce and I'm stuck where can

00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:30,760
you go for help well the first thing is

00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,800
that there's a help link in the toolbar

00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:34,150
which we showed you before the next

00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:37,270
place you can go is to drupal commerce

00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:39,460
org drupal commerce org has hundreds

00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:41,380
well not quite but many many videos that

00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:43,330
show you how to do basic tasks like if

00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:44,830
you wanted to do commerce customizable

00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:46,600
products how would you do that you can

00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:47,650
go to that website and there's a video

00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,960
there which takes you step-by-step

00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:51,640
through how to turn that feature on if

00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,380
you want to play with discount rules so

00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,610
you want to offer someone a twenty-five

00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:56,350
percent discount when they buy a

00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:57,910
thousand items there's a video there

00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:59,290
that takes you step-by-step through all

00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:01,210
of the steps you need to go through to

00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:03,670
be able to do that very easy to follow

00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:05,290
very easy to do each videos only five or

00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:06,910
ten minutes so it doesn't take you that

00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:08,860
long to get through and it's a really

00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:10,960
really great resource the videos are

00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:13,660
also available on vimeo and they put

00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,390
together by commerce guys who are their

00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:18,160
company who are behind our most of the

00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:19,840
drupal commerce development they've put

00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,910
huge amounts of resources and energy

00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:25,440
into putting that together you can jump

00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:28,600
onto IRC to the drupal commerce channel

00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:31,930
unfortunately that's largely a us-based

00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:33,190
and european based community so if you

00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:35,230
happen to get there during Australian

00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:38,140
business hours not many people are there

00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:40,030
to offer you help I think that's a real

00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:42,010
drawback and I'd love to see more

00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:43,810
Australian development companies and

00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:46,420
site builders that are actually using

00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:48,340
our commerce as part of their businesses

00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:49,630
get on board with the project so that

00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:51,760
we've actually got an Australian

00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:53,830
presence and an Australian live

00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,960
interaction interactive response

00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:57,460
community and there are a number of

00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:59,020
Australian companies we can help you out

00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:00,220
on a reality loop does a lot of

00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:03,010
development and I'm sure there's lots of

00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:04,390
other companies around here which I do

00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:05,800
work with Drupal commerce that would be

00:43:04,390 --> 00:43:07,690
happy to help you out with custom

00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:10,030
modules or integration or even just

00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:10,900
helping you conceptualize what your

00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:12,160
Drupal commerce

00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:37,150
platform needs to look like if you're

00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:38,380
going to grow yep okay of which I take

00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:40,390
it you were one who I've not actually

00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:44,829
met you face to face yet that's exciting

00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:46,690
and scary Oh so does anyone have any

00:43:44,829 --> 00:43:58,420
questions we're at that point in the

00:43:46,690 --> 00:44:00,339
world yes yep so yeah so we haven't done

00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:02,859
anything with stock management in the

00:44:00,339 --> 00:44:04,930
demo that we did there I guess the

00:44:02,859 --> 00:44:06,339
approach which we've taken our in the

00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:08,890
basic standard store is that you have

00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:11,049
limitless stock and you'll manage stock

00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:13,930
management in another process there are

00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:16,869
modules are available for commerce that

00:44:13,930 --> 00:44:18,220
do very basic stock management so you

00:44:16,869 --> 00:44:19,839
can put in a number of items you have on

00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:22,119
hand and when someone buys it it D

00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:23,650
comments it and you can have some rules

00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:26,829
which say when the items out of stock

00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:28,359
don't sell it so that's the basic stuff

00:44:26,829 --> 00:44:29,559
which you get out of the out of the box

00:44:28,359 --> 00:44:31,480
when it comes to things like

00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:32,859
backordering my understanding is that at

00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:35,200
the moment it's a little bit more

00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:38,349
complicated what I'd like to see happen

00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:42,190
down the track is some more back office

00:44:38,349 --> 00:44:43,660
integration things being built so I'm my

00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:45,880
company's just switched accounting

00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:47,920
platforms to a platform called 0 which

00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,630
is a web-based interactive online

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,150
accounting platform it's really really

00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:53,529
easy to use and very simple and there

00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:56,049
are plugins for that that do really

00:44:53,529 --> 00:44:57,460
advanced stock management so i can put

00:44:56,049 --> 00:44:58,960
in there i can manage where my orders

00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:00,849
are going manager purchase orders out to

00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,500
suppliers track serial numbers of items

00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:04,480
and all those sorts of things which

00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:06,789
become important as you start to move

00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:09,640
larger quantities of things and I'd like

00:45:06,789 --> 00:45:11,740
to see someone say hey that's a really

00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:13,240
important problem to solve let's take

00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:15,010
some of these already web service

00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,599
enabled platforms which are out there

00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:18,700
that are really good stock management

00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:20,079
tools and manage serial number tracking

00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:22,180
and bits and pieces and build some

00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,460
plumbing to join them together much like

00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:25,810
I'd like to see someone say hey

00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,490
zero is a really great accounting

00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:29,200
package and more and more businesses in

00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:31,060
australia and new zealand in the US are

00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,130
starting to use it so let's actually

00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:36,250
build a web services layer which takes

00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:38,890
your drupal commerce order once i hit

00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:40,270
complete on it and then fire it straight

00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:42,160
off to zero so that when i go to zero

00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:43,990
the invoice is in there or even better

00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,599
when I get to the end of the checkout

00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:48,700
process and I hit confirm it bumps off

00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:51,040
20 puts the order straight in there

00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:52,720
ready to go applies the payment so my

00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:54,580
accounts people have less work to do and

00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,800
all of my accounting and invoicing

00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:57,760
systems are all linked up smoothly there

00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,710
are a couple of things you need to think

00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,690
about their so accounting packages

00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:03,280
generally need to know things like bank

00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:04,869
accounts that money needs to come in and

00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:07,180
out of and out of which you need to add

00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:08,890
that functionality into our Drupal

00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:10,359
commerce to track that and I'm kind of

00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:11,680
getting nods from John over there

00:46:10,359 --> 00:46:18,250
suggesting that there might be something

00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:20,470
like this on the way okay sweet I went

00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:22,690
looking for it to show it today and I

00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:37,270
couldn't find it so that's really

00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:39,369
exciting to hear so yes yep so yep it's

00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:41,470
not something I've personally done but

00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:43,270
there are some really really good drupal

00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:46,150
commerce sites out there that are doing

00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:47,770
pretty much that out of drupal commerce

00:46:46,150 --> 00:46:49,330
where there are multiple front ends

00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:51,609
different stores different personalities

00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:53,050
with same content back end having said

00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:56,200
that it wouldn't be that hard to do

00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:57,849
drupal already has many many exciting

00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,380
mechanisms for allowing you to have

00:46:57,849 --> 00:47:01,390
different content displayed to different

00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:03,160
users under different domains and bits

00:47:01,390 --> 00:47:05,140
and pieces like that and because Drupal

00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,820
commerce uses all of the normal Drupal

00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:08,650
building blocks anything you would

00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:11,200
normally do to enable a multi-site

00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:13,660
multi-domain kind of environment within

00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:15,520
a single drupal install you can then

00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:17,800
apply that same logic and bits and

00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,540
pieces to drupal commerce and get the

00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,320
benefits of having a single back office

00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,320
management system

00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:37,420
yeah yep one of the things that I

00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,980
haven't really shown you that is

00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:40,960
actually worth having a bit of a look at

00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:42,670
is what the back office process looks a

00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,230
bit like because if you're going to be a

00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:47,050
store owner and you want to manage your

00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:49,060
orders here in here I can see what all

00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:53,230
of my orders look like I can very

00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:54,819
quickly edit this order you can see I've

00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:56,619
got my blue one it's still in the

00:47:54,819 --> 00:47:58,119
shopping cart state so haven't actually

00:47:56,619 --> 00:47:59,140
got through and completed it so I can

00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:01,240
see it so if you want to do something

00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:02,619
like cart recovery you've got users who

00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,849
have logged in to your site got partway

00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:06,220
through the checkout process and you

00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:07,720
want to contact them to say hey you

00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:10,359
never finish to check out did you

00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:12,520
actually forget to do it or you know did

00:48:10,359 --> 00:48:14,410
you hate our products did we where we

00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:15,970
too expensive whatever else like that if

00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:17,500
they've logged into the site you can get

00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:18,940
their contact details and send them

00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:23,140
emails and bits and pieces and know that

00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:24,400
we can filter this list by status so if

00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:27,670
I just want to see the things that are

00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:29,950
preparing shipment I can get a error

00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:32,589
because I believe I don't have clean

00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:34,060
urls enabled and I think that's what's

00:48:32,589 --> 00:48:36,369
going on there and I'm going to end up

00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:40,569
in an infinite loop here so we're just

00:48:36,369 --> 00:48:43,420
going to close that might just force

00:48:40,569 --> 00:48:46,780
quit safari and I can't open Safari

00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:48,970
again so we'll just come over here to

00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:53,589
chrome and if we go to the production

00:48:48,970 --> 00:49:00,280
site oh that's my iPad quit where is

00:48:53,589 --> 00:49:02,849
Chrome it's here coming here where we

00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,849
have production

00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:12,369
this one doesn't actually use the

00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:16,060
password admin just in case you were

00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:22,180
wondering um and I can go into orders

00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:26,020
here and yeah that's an interesting

00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:27,280
problem someone else can work out what's

00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,720
going on there at a later stage we'll

00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,580
get that fixed but you can see orders

00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,230
and bits and pieces and filter by

00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:33,580
statuses in a range of things I'm quite

00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:35,430
not quite sure why it's not working at

00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:40,000
the moment but we'll work on that later

00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:41,320
and you can mass update product statuses

00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,940
and shipments if you got a lot of things

00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,740
you want to ship together you can grab

00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:46,750
all of that and go and you can get quite

00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:49,480
sophisticated shipping and tracking

00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:59,470
information tag back in to the back into

00:49:49,480 --> 00:50:01,570
the site and the engine yes yes yep so

00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:03,930
I'm if you've got an existing site that

00:50:01,570 --> 00:50:06,490
you want to commerce enable

00:50:03,930 --> 00:50:08,530
unfortunately you really have to add the

00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:11,440
modules yourself and do some of the base

00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:13,839
integration so I'm to kind of give you a

00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:16,180
high-level idea when you work with

00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:17,830
commerce that the fundamental thing you

00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:20,619
have is you've got a distinction between

00:50:17,830 --> 00:50:22,660
your products which you sell and the way

00:50:20,619 --> 00:50:24,130
that your products are displayed so what

00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:26,589
you do is you create a product type and

00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:28,300
your product types have all of the

00:50:26,589 --> 00:50:30,760
information about those products so that

00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:34,540
might be the size the color what brand

00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:38,260
it is all those sorts of things you then

00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:40,270
have a product display node which groups

00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:42,190
multiple of those products together and

00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:43,660
there's some glue in the standard

00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:45,910
commerce install which makes that a

00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:48,190
little bit easier to kind of get up and

00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:50,140
running and then basically you treat it

00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:52,599
like any other content type with in

00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:55,119
Drupal so it's not that hard and my talk

00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:57,250
last year goes over a lot of how you do

00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:59,170
that by hand and how you build your

00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:01,839
custom product types and how you build

00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:03,430
your custom product know displays to

00:51:01,839 --> 00:51:06,400
display some of that information so

00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:07,690
courage you to look at that and then you

00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,849
can just add it onto an existing Drupal

00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:11,849
site any other questions

00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:16,200
fantastic well if you've got if you do

00:51:14,850 --> 00:51:18,110
think of anything you'd like to ask you

00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:21,480
can catch me on twitter at Andrew Yeager

00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:25,290
you can also leave some comments and

00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:27,180
feedback on the 2013 drupal.org website

00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:31,220
under this session and I'd love to hear

00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:31,220
