Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Building for a Post-Mobile World
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	It's the question everyone's asking these days: Is your site mobile friendly?

The dramatic growth of tablets and smartphones -- the rise of "mobile" -- has forced many of us to rethink our approaches to web design, site building, and content strategy. That kind of transformation isn't new, though, and the disruption we're dealing with won't end when we've launched our next responsive design refresh. How can we prepare for the future without driving ourselves crazy (or exploding our budgets)?

In this session we'll look at the evolution of digital content, the lessons that previous generations of designers and developers have learned, and how they apply to today's landscape. We'll see what other forward-thinking organizations are doing to future proof their content and prepare for a crazy multi-device world. And finally, we'll look at how Drupal's tools can help make the process simpler.

hi technically were 15 seconds early but

00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,420
I think we're probably safe kicking off

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,490
now welcome to building for a post

00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,059
mobile world it's not as quite as

00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:17,880
apocalyptic as it sounds from the title

00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:21,840
but a lot of this session is about the

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,660
concept that the transition to mobile is

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,340
no longer some sort of future event that

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,099
we are thinking about or some sort of

00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,630
you know wacky world that gets written

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,000
about in Wired magazine or something

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:36,809
like that it's here and if we are

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,489
building a mobile site today we by the

00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:40,260
time it launches we're going to be

00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,210
facing new sets of problems that are

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,680
emerging on the horizon already so

00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,920
thinking about what the world looks like

00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,590
after mobile is no longer some crazy

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,840
shiny new thing but just multi device

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:56,550
usage is just a reality is what this is

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,289
all about so I'll do a quick

00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:01,980
introduction before we before I kick

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:05,610
things off I'm eaten on Twitter and

00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:07,830
drupal.org and all sorts of places I'm

00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,210
with a company called la la botte I've

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:11,810
been with them for about seven years

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:15,659
doing drupal stuff pretty heavily and

00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:19,049
we're a company that does like strategy

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:21,390
and planning work design work full

00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:24,659
Drupal site build outs and we also do

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:27,150
teaching and training stuff both for you

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,710
know large clients and for you know

00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,170
individuals and groups and stuff like

00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,509
that we've been again doing it for quite

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,640
a while it's we start measuring things

00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,579
not in years but in what Drupal versions

00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:43,670
we were using when we started so Drupal

00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:46,470
4.5 represent anybody anybody force yes

00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:50,490
now we've got images what else do we

00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:52,290
need but yeah we work with a fairly

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,350
large number of different clients

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:58,710
ranging from tiny ones to two big ones

00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:02,009
media publishing education you know

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:04,380
small startups and well this is sort of

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,140
the the braggy big wall of logos but the

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,580
the idea behind it is that in the work

00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,619
that we're doing with them we end up

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,150
seeing a lot of these same patterns in

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,380
terms of the problems they're

00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,520
experiencing with

00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:19,440
and especially as they have to deal with

00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,240
the proliferation of devices the

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,440
transition to mobile it's not so much

00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,880
that mobile phones are changing

00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,410
everything it's that they break all of

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,760
our existing sites and it terrifies us

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:32,760
all I'm going to attempt to ratchet up

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,830
that terrified sensation for a little

00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,770
bit and what I like to call the shock

00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:40,410
and awe portion of the presentation you

00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,970
might want to leave now if you are just

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,530
building sort of web app like

00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:46,170
functionality stuff it's not

00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,820
particularly content focused but maybe

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,400
using Drupal behind the scenes or

00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:51,720
whatever that's awesome but there

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,790
probably will not be a whole lot

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,460
interesting to hear this is primarily

00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:59,130
about sites that are heavily content

00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,600
oriented and need to maintain and keep

00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,730
their content updated and are trying to

00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,760
deal with mobile and multi-device world

00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,890
if you are Karen McGrane or someone who

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,340
basically goes around talking about

00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:13,110
structured content and content reuse

00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:15,240
24-7 you will probably also not find

00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:18,000
anything new in here but you're you know

00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,160
feel free to stick around and heckle and

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,780
if you terrify easily it might be best

00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,430
just to step out of the room for like

00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,590
maybe the first third and have a friend

00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,860
give you spoilers because there will be

00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,990
terrifying statistics otherwise stick

00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,760
around and if you want to heckle me feel

00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:39,810
free to tweet with the hashtag post

00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:42,810
mobile that's it so change how many

00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:45,360
people here have been hearing about the

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:50,010
fact that mobile is important for a

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:52,080
while okay cool that's good though

00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,670
that's those are good things how many

00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,310
people here are working for

00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:59,250
organizations that haven't in fact built

00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:01,290
a mobile site despite talk about mobile

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:03,630
being important okay so there's a few

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:05,130
hands but you know that's good it feels

00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:07,230
like one of the common myths still

00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,300
floating around is that mobile is some

00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:11,670
sort of thing that will be happening off

00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,220
in the future still like you know oh

00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,140
it's like taxes you know I'll eventually

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,690
have to take care of that but for now

00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:23,190
it's not a problem it's terrible

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:24,990
financial advice the idea that a shift

00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,200
to mobile is something that lies off in

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,950
the future rather than right

00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:33,550
now is just flat-out untrue it's a myth

00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:37,650
and it's dangerous if we hold that oh

00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:37,650
there's there's already someone heckling

00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:45,100
45% mobile uses someone in the back of

00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,720
the room just this is the opposite of

00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:49,440
heckling this is giving even better

00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,320
statistics than the one I have

00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,900
forty-five percent of the traffic to one

00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,190
of the attendees sites come from mobile

00:04:55,900 --> 00:05:00,790
users according to their google

00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:02,890
analytics stuff that's fantastic and you

00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:05,350
may be saying oh well but not my site

00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:08,590
you know not most people site that's

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,240
exceptional just as a little bit of

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,610
background eighty-eight percent of

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,430
people globally have a mobile device

00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:18,180
well no way I'm sorry in the US and it

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:23,530
mostly averages out to the first world

00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:27,790
in Australia there are roughly 1.3

00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:29,760
mobile devices for every person i was

00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:33,150
impressed when I looked that up that I

00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:38,320
kudos to all of you you're really just

00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:40,870
just wow mobile forty five percent of

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,090
those people use their mobile device to

00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:45,280
access the web that's a ridiculously

00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:48,310
high number when you consider the fact

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,590
that only a few years ago the idea of a

00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:52,720
mobile phone that could actually look at

00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:55,300
websites without exploding in flames was

00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:58,030
a new and radical idea so that uptake is

00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,310
really really coming on fast even more

00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:03,850
interesting seventeen percent of those

00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:06,940
people are mobile only users literally

00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:09,490
the primary device they use to look at

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,770
the web web sites government service

00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,380
websites everything is their mobile

00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:17,170
device and that also spikes when you

00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:20,860
look at specific demographics like you

00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:23,200
know anybody under 20 a lot of minority

00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,910
groups inside of the US I'm not sure I

00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,440
was trying to dig up some details here

00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,360
in Australia but I couldn't find any

00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:30,460
more detailed breakdowns but there's a

00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,580
lot of interesting stuff about specific

00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:36,130
countries you know demographics and age

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,350
groups that are even higher of using

00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:43,120
only mobile devices to

00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:45,040
to see the web I I don't know how to put

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,430
it any clearer those numbers are going

00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,260
up not down and especially for

00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,390
government agencies educational

00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,770
institutions anyone who cares about the

00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:55,810
fact that someone could actually be

00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,030
locked out of the content they're

00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,620
publishing the fact that that rising

00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:02,470
number of people use mobile primarily

00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:04,780
means that you can't simply assume that

00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:06,730
it's some sort of convenience or some

00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,020
sort of adjunct you know that it's

00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:10,300
something that you have to account for

00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:12,490
and have to consider and also

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,560
interesting is the fact that ninety

00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:18,130
percent of those people who use the

00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:21,100
mobile web split their tasks and split

00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,270
their usage over multiple devices now

00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,490
that goes a little at odds with the

00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,930
mobile only use but the idea is that

00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:29,440
even people who are using multi to

00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:33,700
multiple devices are using many of them

00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:37,660
together and that kicks the kicks the

00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:40,120
still ladder props it destroys one of

00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:43,510
the other common myths that there are

00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:47,050
somehow special tasks that people do

00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:48,640
when they're mobile inge or that the

00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,930
mobile phones well that's what people

00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,940
use when they're running through the

00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:53,320
airport you know when they really want

00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:55,720
to read something they use their

00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,700
computer or they want to do real work oh

00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,480
that's you know they use other things

00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:03,910
mobile phones are what they use in some

00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,770
sort of magical mobile context that will

00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,780
you know just push off and this is the

00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,060
kind of thinking that leads a lot to

00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:12,940
having a mobile site that is like the

00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:14,740
ten percent of the most popular pages on

00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,360
our website we'll just trim those down

00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,850
and format them for mobile and stick

00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,980
them there well that doesn't really bear

00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:24,040
out google actually did some really

00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,560
interesting research last year a study

00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:29,860
with about 1,500 participants which is a

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,860
pretty solid sample group of the people

00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:35,080
who use mobile devices ninety percent

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:37,450
use multiple devices to accomplish a

00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:40,000
given task seventy-seven percent of

00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:42,010
people watched TV while using a mobile

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,360
device which means that they work in

00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:45,130
fact running through an airport they

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,470
were sitting on their couch or perhaps

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:50,050
in the living room doing something and

00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:51,310
also doing something at the same time on

00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,820
their mobile device they could have been

00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:53,110
looking up in

00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:55,930
formation about the show they were

00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:57,670
watching being distracted whatever but

00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:59,560
it was a multi-device usage pattern and

00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,020
there's even more interesting stuff

00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,030
sixty percent of those people started

00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:06,070
shopping on their phone they looked

00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:09,220
something up they found a product and

00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:11,410
then they continued the same task by

00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,240
going to their PC and purchasing that

00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:15,130
product that they found twenty-five

00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,440
percent of people searched for something

00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:20,020
on their pee on their desktop PC and

00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,970
followed up later by going and reading

00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,140
the same article when they had five

00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:26,380
minutes and they were just wandering

00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:29,470
around fifteen percent of people planned

00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:30,730
trips on a tablet when you know flipping

00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,440
through looking at pictures you know

00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:36,070
trying to find flights and then later

00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:38,500
booked on a PC you know there's a long

00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,930
long article but a research paper that

00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:44,110
Google put out about all of this data

00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:47,440
but the long and short of it is there

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:50,410
aren't any kind of special tasks that

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,200
people do on mobile there's just tasks

00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:55,420
that people happen to be doing on mobile

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,610
because that's the device they have and

00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:59,380
then when you count for tablets that

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,660
even muddies the water even more you

00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:04,180
know is a tablet a mobile device or is

00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,010
it a like a a living room device who

00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,630
knows we'll call it mobile now because

00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:11,200
it's just easier but that's another

00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:15,070
question we'll talk about later another

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:17,320
issue that it's really troubling I'll

00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:20,440
say is the fact that with the

00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:22,900
proliferation of devices responsive

00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,250
design is getting over text how many

00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,950
people here have been hearing a lot

00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:29,740
about responsive design okay I want to

00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:31,870
go on record and say it's good do not

00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,810
misunderstand what I'm about to say I'm

00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:37,900
not knocking responsive design the

00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:39,760
problem is is if we assume that simply

00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,010
putting like a responsive theme on a

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:44,530
Drupal website or doing a responsive

00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:46,780
visual design is going to solve all of

00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:50,020
our content problems we're putting way

00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:54,640
too much weight on what amounts to a set

00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:57,520
of useful CSS techniques this is a loop

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,230
w he's a consultant and designer and he

00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:01,270
does a lot of blogging on mobile issues

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:04,630
he and a couple of other friends got

00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:08,220
together and they pooled all of their

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:11,800
cases and stacked them in a giant

00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:15,160
horrifying display of just how many

00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,530
screen sizes are out in the wild right

00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:20,190
now it's funny and it's like oh they're

00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:22,930
geeks but think about just how many

00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:24,940
different screen sizes are represented

00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:27,340
in that one photograph of what happened

00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:30,370
when a dozen nerds emptied their pockets

00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:33,370
and their laptop bags that's an example

00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:36,700
of what responsive web design is being

00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:39,310
asked to deal with at this point it's a

00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,890
very very useful tool for ensuring that

00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,690
your site doesn't just explode in flames

00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:46,540
when somebody is using a larger or a

00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:49,330
smaller device but the proliferation of

00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:51,430
view ports and devices is really really

00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:53,320
a big challenge and we can't simply

00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,880
assume that responsive techniques and

00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,190
media queries are going to be able to

00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:59,800
continually scale to handle all of those

00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:03,160
things for us so that's another one to

00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,140
talk back who here has worked with

00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:07,210
someone who said oh no no no we've got a

00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:12,790
mobile strategy we're gonna make some

00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:15,240
apps okay yeah and you know I'm again I

00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:18,280
don't want to knock apps I have roughly

00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:21,010
895 of them installed on my phone I use

00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:22,870
them a lot they're great the problem is

00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:24,850
when we start to think you know same as

00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,950
with the responsive design issue that it

00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:28,990
is some sort of like magic sauce that we

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,750
can just spread on our website and on

00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:35,320
our content and that will BAM solve

00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,640
mobile problems an interesting thing is

00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,280
there's a lot of statistics coming out

00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,530
about how much time people spend in apps

00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:43,480
but it turns out about seventy five or

00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:47,680
seventy percent of the time people spend

00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:50,140
in apps is either playing games or using

00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,760
an existing social networking site which

00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,880
means there isn't just some sort of like

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,850
mother lode promised land of like user

00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:00,880
attention sitting out there that if you

00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:02,950
make an appt BAM you're you know there's

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,540
it's it's gold rush time you will be

00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:08,170
able to get it get people's attention

00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:11,230
and they'll use it there are 400,000

00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:15,900
apps in the Apple in the iTunes App

00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:17,769
Store with zero downloads just you know

00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,899
yeah this is this isn't

00:13:17,769 --> 00:13:22,989
the fun part the happy part is coming

00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:25,389
later I promise and to go along with

00:13:22,989 --> 00:13:28,809
that the average development cost for a

00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:30,939
feature-rich app like you know magazines

00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:32,589
or you know an organization trying to

00:13:30,939 --> 00:13:35,739
publish their content in you know a

00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:37,720
reusable way runs from about 30,000 to

00:13:35,739 --> 00:13:39,100
150 thousand dollars the development

00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:42,850
costs and maintenance costs for the app

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:45,040
itself and that means that if someone is

00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:46,869
thinking that just putting out an app is

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,329
just going to solve bunch of problems by

00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:51,970
virtue of now we have an app there's

00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:53,829
real costs associated with that and not

00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:56,949
just upfront one of the biggest

00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:59,079
challenges is that apps require content

00:13:56,949 --> 00:14:01,839
to unless you're just making like Angry

00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:04,149
Birds or something like that you're

00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,799
going to need to maintain the content

00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:07,839
that will be displayed in that app and

00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:09,699
unless you're planning up front it's

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,129
very easy to get into a situation where

00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:13,929
you've now developed to forked versions

00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:16,269
of your content one that you're

00:14:13,929 --> 00:14:19,269
publishing on the website and one that

00:14:16,269 --> 00:14:21,249
you're publishing for your app now you

00:14:19,269 --> 00:14:22,779
know we're mostly Drupal people in this

00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:25,660
room I'm guessing and you see no no no

00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:27,910
no no never never never do that no we

00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:31,929
can just put nodes into things we that's

00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:34,240
not a problem but I've also seen a lot

00:14:31,929 --> 00:14:36,579
of sites that have different pools of

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,160
content on the site one intended for

00:14:36,579 --> 00:14:42,129
mobile one intended for the website and

00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:45,429
editors have to maintain both of those

00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:47,529
in parallel that's content forking you

00:14:45,429 --> 00:14:49,720
now have two separate independent pools

00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:51,699
of content often with duplicates that

00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,459
you need to keep track of and maintained

00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:57,189
and the time investment for the actual

00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:59,980
content editors to do that is it free

00:14:57,189 --> 00:15:01,869
either that's an ongoing cost so that's

00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:03,939
definitely an important consideration

00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:06,129
and that applies to making a dedicated

00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:07,569
mobile website you know the will just

00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:09,399
take the ten percent of the really

00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:11,470
important pages and make a website out

00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,480
of it too anytime you're making your

00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:16,389
carving off some sort of special thing

00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:19,509
just for mobile you have to acknowledge

00:15:16,389 --> 00:15:21,910
that that's at the very least likely if

00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:27,339
you don't plan to prevent it it will

00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:29,949
happen just via inertia and the one that

00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:30,750
the one that's really sobering is that

00:15:29,949 --> 00:15:32,880
these new

00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:36,180
pushing channels new places where our

00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:38,640
content shows up or new places where

00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,560
people want to go and get the content

00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,360
that we're working with as individuals

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,340
and his organization's those just keep

00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:48,060
coming and people just keep coming up

00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:50,730
with crazy weird ways of tying into

00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:54,960
content that's out there this is I am

00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:57,630
not kidding this is the BMW I Drive I

00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,870
believe it is a car with Twitter and

00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:02,820
Facebook you're all thinking someone's

00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:05,640
going to die this is just this is a

00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,740
terrible idea and I would agree but lo

00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,570
and behold it's out there and they've

00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:13,980
been working on tools that allow you to

00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:16,170
put rich content into an automobile this

00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,180
is the refrigerator that I believe

00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:21,420
samsung introduces every year the

00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:23,850
internet refrigerator it's a great idea

00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:26,150
you know okay i can put recipes on there

00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:30,150
but it's also just got a web browser and

00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:31,740
social media and recipe reviews if

00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:33,600
you're doing any of those kinds of

00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,730
things with con you know with content

00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,250
well here's a channel where people may

00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:42,030
actually expect to be able to look at

00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:45,420
that stuff this is drupal.org on my xbox

00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:47,490
in my living room if you thought if you

00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:50,580
thought transitioning your design to be

00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:53,490
touch-friendly was a pain friendly with

00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:58,380
dual analog stick controllers is even

00:16:53,490 --> 00:17:02,040
more annoying for rollover menus and you

00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:03,870
know they okay so Microsoft rolled out

00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:07,560
Internet Explorer to everybody who owns

00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:09,839
an xbox that's fantastic but why do I

00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,569
care you know what what are the odds of

00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:16,380
that actually being used 40 million

00:17:12,569 --> 00:17:19,470
people have paid subscriptions to xbox

00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:21,270
live globally right now in the US we've

00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:24,900
got a bunch of different cable providers

00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:26,790
for cable television Xbox Live has twice

00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,230
as many as one of the largest cable

00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,510
providers in the country and the

00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:33,240
PlayStation Network has twice as many as

00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:35,490
xbox live those are people with web

00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,380
browsers who have those things in their

00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:39,060
living rooms and some of them are

00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:43,350
actually starting to use them to surf

00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:44,140
the web like it or not this is out there

00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,690
and

00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:48,610
all of these different channels are only

00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:50,980
coming faster and faster people are

00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:53,050
finding newer and crazier things to jam

00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,540
web browsers into people are coming up

00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:57,760
with new devices little weird glowing

00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,680
blobs that sit on a nightstand and can

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,770
receive pings from Twitter and like

00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:05,080
start blinking if you know no seriously

00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:07,060
I think someone was showing me that my

00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,070
boss Jeff Robbins at lolla bot he loves

00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,990
try keeping track of those things he has

00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:13,150
several little weird glowing blobs that

00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:15,370
can receive pings from Twitter loves

00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:17,650
that stuff and they are part of the

00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:19,750
ecosystem that we have out there now yes

00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:21,640
press releases are not likely to show up

00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:24,850
on the glowing blob on the nightstand

00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:26,860
but at some point almost all of the

00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:30,190
content that we have if someone actually

00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:32,370
cares about it which hopefully we're

00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:35,050
making content that people care about

00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:38,290
they're going to want access to it on

00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:39,850
another device Karen McGrane in a recent

00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:41,200
article on a list apart I think put it

00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:44,530
really well she said that people don't

00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:47,140
want different content or less content

00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:49,810
or content that's been tailored for the

00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:52,210
device that you're on they want the same

00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:54,370
stuff presented in a way that they can

00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:57,130
find it and navigate it with the device

00:18:54,370 --> 00:19:00,370
that they're using but they imagine it

00:18:57,130 --> 00:19:02,350
as a window onto a thing that they want

00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:05,440
access to not a separate little

00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:08,560
container full of its own content you

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,900
know if you have if you've got two

00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:12,610
separate websites one that's for mobile

00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,350
with a little pool of content over here

00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:16,210
and one that's on desktop the minute

00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,730
somebody decides oh well I want to go

00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:21,130
and read that article over oh well the

00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:23,830
URLs are different or oh this one all

00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:25,870
the URLs start with M so I'll go to my

00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:29,170
desktop machine I've got this nice

00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:30,940
little pillar of content striped down

00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:34,990
the middle of the screen nobody likes

00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:36,610
that for better or worse the content

00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:38,650
that you create the content that you

00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:40,660
build and publish has to be able to

00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:43,270
adapt to these changing and emerging

00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:46,210
channels that was the shock and awe

00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:47,860
portion this was the the bitter pill if

00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:50,140
you did if you've just been thinking

00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:53,310
okay we finally got the site to look

00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:57,420
okay on an iPhone woohoo yeah there's

00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:59,790
there is a lot coming the good news

00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:02,220
fantastic news is that there are

00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:04,760
actually solutions to this problem this

00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,780
is not just you know this is not about

00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,880
congratulations our new product can

00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:13,260
reformat your web site for mobile or

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,660
something like that the White House in

00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:17,820
the u.s. drees actually mentioned a

00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,850
couple of a couple of initiatives that

00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,900
the White House has been doing in

00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:24,780
actually making a pretty heavy use of

00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:26,700
Drupal one of the interesting things

00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:28,710
that they've done is put a really heavy

00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,320
emphasis over the last several years on

00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:34,830
making sure that government data is

00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:37,470
accessible and and open to people who

00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:39,870
want access to it rather than focusing

00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:42,240
on trying to throw up a new website that

00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:44,220
presents a particular chunk of

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,100
information in a form that's going to

00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:48,810
get stale after two years just figure

00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:51,540
out how to make that make information

00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:53,550
open an accessible first and then figure

00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,860
out how to present it after that hurdle

00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:57,840
has been crossed they actually released

00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,490
a digital government blueprint late last

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,080
year and they said that rather than

00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:03,570
thinking primarily about final

00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:06,060
presentation they want to emphasize an

00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:07,620
information centric approach that just

00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:10,320
you know focus on getting the content

00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:12,750
right make it available and deal with

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,340
the rest as an adjunct to that and

00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:17,510
that's a really important philosophical

00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:19,890
shift for those of us who came from like

00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:21,960
publishing or a marketing background I

00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:24,080
did my time in the marketing minds

00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,700
before I started working you know in

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,010
technology and you know that was all

00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:30,660
about you made static files you made

00:21:29,010 --> 00:21:32,430
brochures you made these things there

00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:35,010
were artifacts of a bunch of decisions

00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:37,170
and you know written you know written

00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,310
pieces and it stayed where it was and

00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,380
that's that's not the way things are

00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:43,500
working anymore so the question is is

00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:45,930
how do we actually do that what are the

00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:48,960
actual concrete steps that organizations

00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:50,880
are taking to try to achieve that end of

00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,490
making their stuff available and then

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:56,010
dealing with presentation later the

00:21:53,490 --> 00:22:00,590
first and biggest challenge the thing

00:21:56,010 --> 00:22:00,590
that has to be a baseline priority is

00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:06,240
prioritizing the idea of cross channel

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,590
reuse and what that means is when we

00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,390
look at all of the different weight

00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:13,150
places where our content may need to

00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:15,820
here in whatever form we need to make

00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:18,760
sure that we're trying to reuse the same

00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:20,830
underlying piece of content on all of

00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,480
those channels rather than creating a

00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:26,560
different one for each one of those

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:29,080
channels so I have a fun little icon

00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:31,210
based illustration of this this is a

00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:34,720
vault it contains all of your awesome

00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:36,100
ideas those are all of the places where

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,310
you want it to go or at least three

00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:42,180
representative ones print mobile desktop

00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:44,260
stuff like that a lot of organizations

00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:46,420
very quickly get into this situation

00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:48,220
they've got their ideas and they've got

00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,290
people working on writing different

00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:52,180
chunks of content for each one of those

00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:54,760
different channels it gets turned into

00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:56,650
concrete documents maybe if you've been

00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:58,690
in publishing you probably have watched

00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:01,000
the scenario where there's a print CMS

00:22:58,690 --> 00:23:03,250
for the magazine and there's a digital

00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,230
CMS for the website and then there's

00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,450
some sort of horrible monstrosity that

00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:09,490
someone hand coded over a long weekend

00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:11,350
to drive the mobile web site but all of

00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:13,420
those are just separate things that

00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:15,880
people have to put content into they may

00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:17,370
be reusing content but they're copying

00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,020
and pasting from one to another

00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:21,610
essentially creating parallel documents

00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:23,710
that have to be maintained independently

00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:26,080
now some organizations try to solve this

00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:28,240
by saying excellent we will just tell

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,680
one person they have to do all of it we

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,540
will just add new steps to their

00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:35,110
workflow for each channel we want to

00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:38,140
publish to for some values of works that

00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:40,960
works but the problem is is you're

00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:42,880
basically trading how much gets done for

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,040
how many channels it gets done on you

00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,140
know a person who's being told to do all

00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,960
of that stuff they're not going to be

00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:51,520
doing as much the throughput of all of

00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,260
your content and your publishing and the

00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:55,420
work that you can do drops dramatically

00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:58,360
as editors have to deal with that and

00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,920
every new crazy thing that gets hot and

00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:02,050
everyone says oh well we've got to have

00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:03,880
a social strategy or we've got to have a

00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:05,980
whatsit strategy or whatever that

00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,690
becomes another one of those channels

00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,730
that those overworked writers and

00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:12,490
publishers and editors have to deal with

00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:15,970
and that's not cool this is what we want

00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:17,860
to get to a workflow where every one of

00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:20,110
those channels that we're publishing to

00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:23,350
is a different permutation of that

00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:23,950
underlying piece of content now this is

00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,139
probably

00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:28,389
really radical if you're used to working

00:24:26,139 --> 00:24:30,460
with Drupal the concept of nodes and you

00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:32,860
know you know we even have things like

00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:35,409
you know build modes for nodes where you

00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:37,320
can say oh I've got the teaser primary

00:24:35,409 --> 00:24:39,820
view of the content and stuff like that

00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:42,700
we're already doing a lot of those

00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:44,799
things but it's still important that we

00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,750
remember the high-level issue here is we

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,090
need to prioritize that principle of

00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,860
reusing the same underlying piece of

00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:52,510
content across all of our channels as

00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,980
much as possible because that's the only

00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:58,210
way to deal with this multi-device

00:24:53,980 --> 00:25:00,490
proliferation a really cool example of

00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:03,309
an organization that's doing this in the

00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:06,460
u.s. is NPR National Public Radio is

00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:08,710
anybody heard of cope there okay yeah a

00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:10,889
couple hands going up it's like the the

00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:14,350
granddaddy of all structured content

00:25:10,889 --> 00:25:17,110
case studies it stands for create once

00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:18,909
published everywhere and it's sort of

00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:24,429
the internal system that they've built

00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:27,039
to accomplish those reuse goals this is

00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:28,690
an example of an NPR story on their

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,669
desktop website it's about some

00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:33,159
teenagers who figured out how to like do

00:25:30,669 --> 00:25:36,130
printable solar panels using like maker

00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:38,409
tools awesome this is the mobile version

00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:40,419
it's a responsive site so you know you

00:25:38,409 --> 00:25:42,179
pull it on a mobile browser and it's

00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:44,620
cool it just adjusts the layout

00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:47,080
appropriately that's their actual iphone

00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:48,519
app it's the same story in their iphone

00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,990
app you can see at the bottom they've

00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:52,149
actual got actually got playback

00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:53,679
controls because this is an interview so

00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:56,679
you can play back the audio they're

00:25:53,679 --> 00:26:00,279
using all the native app e features that

00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:03,340
they can but it's the same article this

00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:04,480
is the android app same thing you can

00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,010
see that there's some different design

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,600
to choose decisions that have happened

00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:09,460
there they're using the native android

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,950
like navigation buttons instead of the

00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:15,220
iphone standard you know row of various

00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:18,159
clickable bits at the bottom but same

00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:20,559
content here is a partner website

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:23,380
minnesota public radio it's sort of a

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:25,360
sister station to the NPR website but

00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:27,880
they pick up and syndicate stories from

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,490
NPR here's the same story being

00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:32,679
displayed on their website this is a

00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:36,020
microsite they have for the particular

00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:39,350
show on NPR that carried that are

00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:41,660
lo and behold same thing being used on

00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:43,970
that website this is their YouTube

00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:46,220
channel they push the video of it to

00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:48,980
youtube and have the same basic

00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:51,710
description this is what happens when I

00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:54,200
paste a link to it into a Facebook post

00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:56,600
it automatically pulls in a preview

00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,730
image a short tailored chunk of text

00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,320
that describes the article in the number

00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:03,020
of characters that facebook says they

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:05,360
have to use to describe that all of

00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:07,490
these things are just different views on

00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,640
the same underlying chunk of content

00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:13,520
that NPR maintains and publishes

00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:15,770
internally it's a single resource in

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,080
there CMS they're not using Drupal it's

00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:21,740
all homegrown but the principle is one

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,020
that we can still leverage ourselves but

00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:27,110
how do they do that at that sounds

00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:29,450
tricky the way they accomplish it is

00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:31,730
actual meaningful structure and how

00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:33,740
they've modeled their content and this

00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:35,600
is where I sort of you know mention the

00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:38,120
idea of things like build modes and

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:40,160
content types and you know fields we're

00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,620
used to describing a lot of our website

00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,470
content in those terms but there's an

00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:47,570
important distinction in using those

00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:50,720
things simply to model a particular

00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:54,050
design that we were handed or we came up

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,810
with and using those tools in Drupal to

00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:59,090
model the underlying meaning of a piece

00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:01,370
of content in a way that we know is

00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:03,620
going to be used to remix and reshuffle

00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:06,230
individual elements to come up with a

00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:09,800
particular appropriate way of presenting

00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:12,290
it rather than okay scrap it and let's

00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,370
rebuild that for a new design I think I

00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:15,070
like to think of it as sort of the

00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:17,930
difference between a jigsaw puzzle and

00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:20,450
ten gram puzzles has anybody ever played

00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:22,340
around with tangram puzzles it's it's

00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:25,130
basically just like little triangles and

00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:27,230
squares the whole idea is that you can

00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:30,050
technically make anything out of it

00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:32,000
whereas a jigsaw puzzle well it's a

00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:33,590
particular picture and it's broken up

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,970
into little pieces but if you try to

00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:37,780
assemble anything other than that

00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:40,580
picture you're sort of out of luck

00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:42,080
example would be a key cat we're

00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:44,960
internet people so we got to have a cat

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,550
in the presentation somehow but you can

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,070
also turn it into a rabbit if you want

00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:49,850
to and there's all kinds of examples of

00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,590
people doing

00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,630
graham art I like to think of it as a

00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:56,780
useful analogy for how structured

00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:58,580
content can be used if we break things

00:28:56,780 --> 00:29:01,309
down into pieces that we know are going

00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:04,340
to be used to in various kinds of

00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:06,590
remixes of our content we think about it

00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:09,919
differently than just stuff that needs

00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:12,530
to go over here in this design or things

00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,059
we will need in a call-out block if

00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:15,740
we're thinking about them as structural

00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:17,960
elements rather than presentational

00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:22,549
elements we get that remix and

00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:24,590
capability this is a little nerdy but

00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:28,100
this is the actual underlying structure

00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:31,400
of what NPR stores in one of their cope

00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:33,890
articles they've got the high level

00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:35,630
structure for what things that they care

00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:39,470
about what things their system models

00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:41,809
the story like a an article or story is

00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:43,880
for them the single most important piece

00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:45,350
of content they have they also model

00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,880
something called a program which is like

00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:48,080
a show that they're running that may

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,330
have lots of different stories

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,530
associated with it or a series if

00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,090
they're doing a bunch of different

00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:56,030
stories that sort of build on each other

00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:57,860
and they also have blogs but those are

00:29:56,030 --> 00:30:00,350
just things that they use to group

00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:01,850
stories that's really their key asset

00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:04,070
and they have a bunch of different

00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:06,400
fields that they've modeled on that and

00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:08,919
I won't drill into all of the details

00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:12,110
but some interesting examples are

00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:13,909
subtitle title and short title they've

00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:17,000
got three different kinds of title

00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:18,980
broken out not because one is displayed

00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,820
on mobile we had one client who actually

00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:25,010
had title iPhone title web title and RSS

00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,840
title broken out in their content but

00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:28,640
the problem is is well what happens when

00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:32,270
you add yet one more channel are you

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,190
going to add another title NPR as it has

00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:36,409
tackled this by saying we want a title

00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:38,210
subtitle and a short title we're going

00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:40,070
to write one for devices they have a

00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:41,750
very very tight constraint on how much

00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:43,280
they can display and we may want to use

00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:45,320
it there but we're not going to talk

00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,780
about which device or what presentation

00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,400
style we're going to talk about what

00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:50,840
we're putting in it and what it means

00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:53,120
and how it relates to this to this

00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:57,110
particular story they've got teasers

00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:58,850
mini teasers the Facebook preview text

00:30:57,110 --> 00:31:01,340
that you saw when I pasted that in there

00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,899
that was the mini teaser that's what

00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:05,419
they expose via Facebook

00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:08,690
Open Graph tags they show the full

00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:11,299
teaser when you look at you know an

00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:13,219
article in a listing on their webpage so

00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:14,869
if you look through there's a whole

00:31:13,219 --> 00:31:16,700
bunch of stuff in here thumbnail

00:31:14,869 --> 00:31:18,950
published date stuff like that they also

00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:21,950
have more complex elements like audio

00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:24,259
that can contain a number showing how

00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:26,690
many seconds long the audio is a link to

00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:29,239
the mp3 a description of the audio file

00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:31,700
itself they've got images they've got

00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:34,159
pull quotes the pull quote can contain

00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:37,190
attribution for who said it stuff like

00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:38,839
that but these aren't I mean this isn't

00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:40,669
some sort of magic template for what you

00:31:38,839 --> 00:31:42,549
should go on model on your site but then

00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:45,739
are an example of how a particular

00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:48,589
organization looked at one of the key

00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:52,700
content types they built and said what's

00:31:48,589 --> 00:31:55,789
really in this what's the stuff in this

00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:57,440
chunk of content that matters and how

00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:59,869
can we start carving out little

00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,349
meaningful bits of it in a way that will

00:31:59,869 --> 00:32:09,529
allow us to effectively remix a given

00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:11,179
story for different purposes oh man

00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:13,279
there was a cute little animation that

00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:15,499
was supposed to come after that we'll

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,479
just see so you've got structured

00:32:15,499 --> 00:32:19,639
content you've got all of these

00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:21,589
different ways of displaying stuff you

00:32:19,639 --> 00:32:24,049
can at least theoretically accomplish

00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:25,729
but the additional challenge is okay

00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:27,409
well we've got a CMS that can store all

00:32:25,729 --> 00:32:29,599
these things we've you know gone into a

00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:32,299
back room argued for two weeks we've got

00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:34,399
structured content now and we want to

00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:36,409
reuse everything but how do we actually

00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:40,519
get it to all of those different things

00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:43,489
in a way that doesn't end up cloning and

00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:45,139
forking all of our content anyways and

00:32:43,489 --> 00:32:49,399
that's where the concept of decoupled

00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:50,749
delivery comes in this this idea goes by

00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:52,669
a lot of different names some people

00:32:50,749 --> 00:32:55,339
call it web services some people call it

00:32:52,669 --> 00:32:58,009
api's some people call it feed you know

00:32:55,339 --> 00:33:00,669
we want to give feeds to our partners or

00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:02,809
whatever but the whole idea is that the

00:33:00,669 --> 00:33:05,479
management and the creation and the

00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:08,960
organization of your content shouldn't

00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:11,599
be inherently tied to how you're

00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,079
presenting it now we use Drupal which is

00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:16,460
about as coupled as it gets in terms of

00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:18,260
managing the content and dis

00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:19,940
playing the content but still well a

00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:21,710
little later we'll talk about some of

00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:24,200
the ways that we can still leverage this

00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:27,320
effectively but the idea of decoupling

00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,600
our delivery from our management means

00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:31,520
that when we start building things on

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,290
the edges like a new app that displays

00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,450
our content or whatever we're not

00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:37,910
retooling the underlying foundation of

00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:40,510
our site building something cool on the

00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:43,640
edge that can consume that content and

00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:45,710
NPR you know still rolling with this

00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:49,670
example all of that structured content

00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:52,610
that they've got is exposed at API NPR

00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:53,960
org if you go to that site you can

00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:56,120
create an account you can get yourself

00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:58,070
an API key for free just like you know

00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:00,440
being a Twitter developer or something

00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:03,490
like that and then you can just go to

00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:06,800
API to NPR org and start writing queries

00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:08,810
against all of NPR's content you can say

00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:12,860
i would like field i would like the

00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:14,960
title and teaser fields in nrml format

00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:17,030
which is just a particular xml format

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,460
they use sometimes you can also say I

00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:22,250
want it in Jason or I wanted an atom or

00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:24,380
I want again just flat HT I wanted in

00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:26,090
pre formatted HTML you can ask for it in

00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:29,180
a bunch of different ways and I want

00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:33,640
article ID whatever that's actually a

00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:36,610
real article and what you get back is

00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:39,290
structured HTML that particular query is

00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:42,350
this is actually the result that you get

00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:43,820
back from NP from NPR's API and you can

00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:45,740
see it's a lot of the same stuff that we

00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:49,010
were talking about it's got you know

00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:51,620
different links the the full link of the

00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:53,450
native story on npr's website if someone

00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:55,700
just wanted to click and go to it the

00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:58,040
api link if you just want to say oh well

00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:00,620
what's the link that i could then check

00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:02,300
to get all of the data associated with

00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,670
this you can do a bunch of stuff it's

00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,770
got the title the long teaser the mini

00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:08,750
teaser because that's what we asked for

00:35:06,770 --> 00:35:11,750
you could ask for all of the fields you

00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:13,430
could ask for articles between one date

00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:17,570
and another date instead of requesting

00:35:13,430 --> 00:35:21,920
one by ID number the whole idea is that

00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:24,620
they've untethered having content from

00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,140
displaying content by putting this API

00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:29,570
as a middle layer and all of these

00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:31,850
different examples are pulling

00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:33,680
that same API they're just writing

00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:35,780
queries sometimes they're cashing the

00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,310
results they may save them locally on

00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:39,380
the iPhone app so that you can actually

00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:42,140
read them after you you know when you're

00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:46,040
offline or something but that concept of

00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:49,130
using those that API as their gateway

00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:51,470
between stuff we need you stuff we're

00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:53,270
experimenting with you know the iphone

00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:56,330
app the new website that we just

00:35:53,270 --> 00:36:00,410
launched and their core content is a

00:35:56,330 --> 00:36:01,940
really huge thing for them so what's the

00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:03,740
payoff you know they invested a lot of

00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:06,170
time and energy in building this system

00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:09,560
they you know they've they've clearly

00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:13,250
put a lot of person hours into building

00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:16,940
and maintaining it and for them it

00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:19,160
really has paid off well they recently

00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:21,200
did an interview with I think it was

00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:23,300
Mashable where they were talking about

00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:26,450
some of the end results and for them in

00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:29,150
in like one year following rolling out

00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:31,550
the API they were able to double their

00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:33,470
audience because it gave them the

00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:34,910
flexibility to work with advertisers and

00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:37,070
other traffic you know traffic

00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:38,900
generating partners in much more

00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:43,070
flexible ways they were able to launch

00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:45,500
11 new products that used NPR content

00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:47,060
like you know apps and you know widgets

00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:49,130
for other people's websites and stuff

00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:52,970
like that and they did a full site

00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:56,540
redesign in 12 months with a very small

00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:58,100
constrained dev team and having that API

00:36:56,540 --> 00:37:01,280
was the only thing that allowed them to

00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:03,890
do that it allowed them to build on top

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,140
of a known system for pulling what they

00:37:03,890 --> 00:37:08,480
wanted and what they cared about remix

00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:10,280
in it as needed in a design that they

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,380
could come up with without having to

00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,810
worry about re-architecting all the

00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:17,440
underpinnings of it every time they had

00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:24,010
a new endpoint they needed to work with

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:27,320
so the takeaway is a structured content

00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:29,530
be reusing that structured those

00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:33,160
structured content assets and see

00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:36,440
exposing them in some way so that

00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:38,720
another tool out there can consume that

00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:41,780
content and utilize it without you

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,400
having to rebuild your core system those

00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:45,740
three principles together

00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:47,539
are really really key to dealing with

00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:52,520
this whole like multi-device explosion

00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:54,049
thing so that's it's a it's an icon of a

00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,279
happy bouncing baby he's going to

00:37:54,049 --> 00:38:00,250
explain how we're going to do this with

00:37:55,279 --> 00:38:04,490
Drupal so some of you may be excited

00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:06,710
others may be thinking this sounds like

00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:08,150
a monstrous amount of work and this

00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:10,970
sounds like I'm going to have to write

00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:14,329
views handler plugins and learn how to

00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:15,740
do things with XML and JSON maybe I'll

00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:20,059
have to learn how to configure rules

00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:22,339
module who knows the good news is

00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:25,099
actually that Drupal is pretty well

00:38:22,339 --> 00:38:26,720
positioned to do a lot of this stuff you

00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:28,369
know I mentioned earlier that our

00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:29,809
community is actually pretty used to

00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:33,020
dealing with things like structured

00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:37,069
content and is familiar with the concept

00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:39,230
of a core thing being displayed in lots

00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:41,119
of different ways in different contexts

00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:43,279
and a lot of the tools that we've

00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,250
accumulated over the years are actually

00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:49,160
really well suited to this approach

00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:52,279
we're just not all used to using them in

00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,049
that particular way and that's the shift

00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:57,440
that we need to start getting used to if

00:38:54,049 --> 00:38:59,210
we want to leverage this stuff so the

00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:01,069
first really important principle for

00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:03,770
doing this in Drupal is when we're

00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:06,140
modeling things like content types

00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:08,660
fields relationships between content

00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:10,940
types we need to make sure that as much

00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:14,210
as humanly possible we're modeling the

00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:16,220
meaning of the content what's in it and

00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:18,230
what it's used for and why it's

00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:21,200
important to the organization not just

00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:22,520
the appearance that we're envisioning in

00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,910
the design that we're currently

00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:27,710
implementing you know Photoshop driven

00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:29,690
content modeling tends to go off the

00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:31,880
rails pretty quickly when you get a

00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:36,380
different Photoshop file six months

00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:39,049
later anybody who's done like database

00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:42,770
modeling or was involved in like the

00:39:39,049 --> 00:39:45,619
semantic markup Wars or has been

00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:47,690
cornered in a bar by Morton at any point

00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:49,910
is probably familiar familiar with some

00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:52,789
of these basic concepts of like modeling

00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:55,309
semantic structure in HTML rather than

00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:57,319
modeling the appearance and using CSS to

00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:59,269
style it database administrator

00:39:57,319 --> 00:40:02,239
talk about you know how do you model

00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:04,279
core business objects and you know treat

00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:06,380
the data model rather than just fire

00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:08,359
hosing stuff into a giant table these

00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:10,789
are all concepts that you know different

00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:12,920
disciplines have used and I think we can

00:40:10,789 --> 00:40:14,239
start leveraging a lot of that of a lot

00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,420
of that learning when we talk about

00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:21,079
working with our content types another

00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:23,930
useful tool is thinking through how a

00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:27,349
design or how a plan for a website is

00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:29,449
going to be filtering sorting searching

00:40:27,349 --> 00:40:31,969
through how do we envision a user going

00:40:29,449 --> 00:40:33,890
through the website and locating the

00:40:31,969 --> 00:40:35,749
stuff that they care about if there's a

00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:38,690
web if there's a page that we say oh

00:40:35,749 --> 00:40:41,660
well this page will contain all of the

00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:45,380
news articles by a given users friends

00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:47,569
that are you know involving subjects

00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:49,430
that they care about okay well that's

00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:51,319
you know I think there's probably four

00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:54,859
people in the room going oh no no that's

00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:57,380
going to be three weeks but from a

00:40:54,859 --> 00:40:59,329
Content modeling perspective we can

00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:01,849
immediately learn things that we're

00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:04,099
going to need in our content model we're

00:41:01,849 --> 00:41:05,509
going to need authorship because things

00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:07,279
by a person's friend implies that

00:41:05,509 --> 00:41:09,170
there's an author we get that for free

00:41:07,279 --> 00:41:10,880
in Drupal but that's something that you

00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:13,039
know is being modeled we're going to

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,930
need things like what topics duper's

00:41:13,039 --> 00:41:17,180
does someone care about well that means

00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:19,430
we need to attach topics to a given

00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:21,440
piece of content you know those are

00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:24,199
things that we can start extrapolating

00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,549
from the views that we have and the

00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:27,829
listings that we have and how we

00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:29,839
envision people getting at stuff use

00:41:27,829 --> 00:41:31,579
those things to discover what the

00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:34,069
content model needs to bring to the

00:41:31,579 --> 00:41:37,160
table before we even talk about you know

00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:39,170
how we're going to skin it build modes

00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,099
again are a useful starting point when

00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:42,140
we're thinking about different ways

00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:43,640
something could be presented if we look

00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:45,079
at a Content model that we've got you

00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,180
know the fields and structure of a

00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:49,459
content type and we think huh how many

00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:53,180
interesting and useful build modes could

00:41:49,459 --> 00:41:55,369
I make out of this in Drupal to present

00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:57,349
this content in a nice way it's still

00:41:55,369 --> 00:41:59,150
very HTML centric because it's you know

00:41:57,349 --> 00:42:01,160
we're spitting out web pages but those

00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:03,229
build modes can be really really useful

00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,089
and we also use them for things like the

00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:07,130
search indexes and the RSS feeds and

00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:09,499
stuff like that another one is if you

00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:11,180
see recurring mark up all over the place

00:42:09,499 --> 00:42:13,940
in body feel

00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:16,520
holds like here's the giant chunk of

00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:18,680
stuff we always paste in when we need to

00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:21,829
do a pull quote or when we need to put

00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:24,760
the photo in a given article those are

00:42:21,829 --> 00:42:27,260
often indicators that there is something

00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,940
structural that we're always doing with

00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,770
the given type of content that it might

00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:32,869
make sense to split out into a given

00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:35,869
field because there's recurring meaning

00:42:32,869 --> 00:42:37,400
there that if the design changes well

00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:39,800
god help you because now you've got

00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:42,500
eight thousand articles that all have

00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:44,450
heavily design-oriented markups splatted

00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:47,809
into a body field and it's a lot easier

00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:49,420
to redo the template for a field than it

00:42:47,809 --> 00:42:52,280
is to go through and search and replace

00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:55,010
hand marked up HTML inside of a body

00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,720
field that's I don't think that should

00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:58,670
be news to anybody who's been working

00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:00,079
with Drupal but you know it's it's an

00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:02,390
important thing to keep to keep an eye

00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:04,490
open for and yes this is also where the

00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:08,599
pre-scheduled tickets sold in advance

00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:10,700
rant about WYSIWYG editors comes in one

00:43:08,599 --> 00:43:14,089
of the biggest problems is that WYSIWYG

00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:16,579
editors no not all WYSIWYG editors not

00:43:14,089 --> 00:43:21,230
always a week editing but at least most

00:43:16,579 --> 00:43:25,760
use of a WYSIWYG editor when it's not

00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:29,329
carefully controlled leads to design

00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:32,420
being jammed into a chunk of content

00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:35,030
body content and that's bad because with

00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:39,410
any kind of multi-channel publishing the

00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:41,660
what you see part is not going to be

00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:44,930
consistent and reliable from one device

00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:46,790
to another the what you see is going to

00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:50,180
be radically different on a tiny screen

00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:52,220
or a black-and-white Kindle or anyone of

00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:54,829
any one number of the different channels

00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:57,710
that we can push stuff out to so if you

00:43:54,829 --> 00:44:00,170
put a giant table in the middle of a

00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:03,020
node body using a WYSIWYG editor well

00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:05,450
that's problematic because that table is

00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:08,030
not going to look good on anything other

00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:10,970
than a machine with the monitor at least

00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:13,250
this wide and you know sometimes that's

00:44:10,970 --> 00:44:14,839
unescapable but the advantage of WYSIWYG

00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:17,240
editors the what you see is what you get

00:44:14,839 --> 00:44:18,890
breaks down when you're going to be

00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:22,130
pushing out to a bunch of channels and

00:44:18,890 --> 00:44:24,660
that's problematic I like to call it the

00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:26,309
the problem of Dreamweaver fields

00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:28,559
basically the you know this is the body

00:44:26,309 --> 00:44:30,030
field and we've enabled every possible

00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:31,799
button on the WYSIWYG editor because

00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:33,900
someone just said I need to do this

00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:37,470
crazy thing and paste my microsoft word

00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:40,049
document in there just let me okay great

00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:43,170
this is the Dreamweaver field you can go

00:44:40,049 --> 00:44:45,740
use it problem is is that kills reuse

00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:49,920
content built in that way is

00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:51,270
fundamentally unruh mixable you can't

00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,450
leverage it in the ways that we've been

00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:57,420
talking about sometimes it's absolutely

00:44:54,450 --> 00:44:59,609
necessary but if it is understand and

00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:01,049
acknowledge that those chunks aren't

00:44:59,609 --> 00:45:02,609
going to be something that you can

00:45:01,049 --> 00:45:06,299
really effectively leverage using any of

00:45:02,609 --> 00:45:08,849
these approaches my my usual preference

00:45:06,299 --> 00:45:10,619
is like to if someone needs WYSIWYG

00:45:08,849 --> 00:45:12,720
editing and wants it make sure that

00:45:10,619 --> 00:45:15,569
there's that it's stripped down and only

00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:19,319
allows really basic HTML formatting you

00:45:15,569 --> 00:45:22,680
know let them do headings basic styling

00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:24,329
emphasis strong or bold tags links

00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,609
things like that you know the stuff

00:45:24,329 --> 00:45:27,990
that's basic and structural but make

00:45:26,609 --> 00:45:30,089
sure you haven't left like you know

00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:33,059
table editing and the ability to paste

00:45:30,089 --> 00:45:36,510
random CSS and things like that in you

00:45:33,059 --> 00:45:38,819
know that that kills any kind of remix

00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:41,369
in ability because you end up drifting

00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:44,339
towards structure being jammed in as

00:45:41,369 --> 00:45:45,720
design oriented HTML we've also found it

00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:47,460
really useful a lot of the WYSIWYG

00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,349
editors that are out there allow you to

00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:50,849
build custom plugins you know you can

00:45:49,349 --> 00:45:52,950
add your own little button to that

00:45:50,849 --> 00:45:55,829
WYSIWYG editor with some code that lets

00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:57,839
you insert canned markup if you want to

00:45:55,829 --> 00:45:59,549
if you still need people to be able to

00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:03,660
insert stuff using the WYSIWYG editor

00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:06,180
wrap it in a plug-in for tiny MCE or ck

00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:09,240
editor that lets people click I want the

00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:11,490
calculator widget there if you need that

00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:17,490
instead of just copying pasting a giant

00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:18,420
slab of HTML so in addition and this is

00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:20,039
something that you're probably going to

00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:22,589
be hearing a lot of during the content

00:46:20,039 --> 00:46:25,559
authoring track I I sort of buried the

00:46:22,589 --> 00:46:28,910
lead here but um support content editors

00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:32,160
not just emotionally but also with tools

00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:34,619
I like to say that they're the most

00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:37,460
important users of any website that's

00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:40,700
content oriented even more so than any

00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:43,130
visitor because if content editors stop

00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:45,170
working with content and publishing it

00:46:43,130 --> 00:46:48,490
and updating it and maintaining it the

00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:51,050
reason the visitors come starts rotting

00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:54,200
that content is no longer being updated

00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:56,780
no longer being published and you're out

00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:58,790
cold anything that supports the work

00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:00,859
that they do and smooths the work that

00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:03,500
they do and ensures that they can focus

00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:07,190
on doing what they need to be doing not

00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:11,119
necessarily say trying to do design and

00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:12,740
layout in a WYSIWYG editor is useful one

00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:15,260
thing that we found useful is trying to

00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:17,660
make sure that we identify tasks for the

00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:20,780
content editors things that they do on a

00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:23,119
recurring basis not just individual

00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:25,220
forms that as developers were used to

00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:28,220
you know customizing and building the

00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:30,530
node form is definitely right for

00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:31,700
tweaking and smoothing and improving and

00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:33,410
a lot of work has gone into that in

00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:35,660
Drupal 8 but it's also important to keep

00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:37,369
in mind in a large web site that's been

00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:40,430
heavily customized and has all kinds of

00:47:37,369 --> 00:47:43,339
crazy stuff going on creating a node is

00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:44,660
rarely a standalone operation often they

00:47:43,339 --> 00:47:47,240
have to connect it to other things

00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:48,800
schedule stuff you know work with

00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,820
somebody else to make sure it goes into

00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,380
the right places on the site

00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:54,200
understanding that that is a

00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:56,990
comprehensive task and a workflow for

00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,700
them not just a forum that lets them

00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:00,680
insert things into the database is

00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:02,630
really important and figuring out ways

00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,730
to simplify things like managing

00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:06,920
relationships between nodes and editing

00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:08,359
metadata can also really help those

00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:09,830
modules out there that can do things

00:48:08,359 --> 00:48:11,900
like pre populating keywords

00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:13,760
automatically on nodes by you know

00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:15,880
scanning the content and stuff like that

00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,599
those are really helpful sometimes

00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:20,330
accounting for things like you know

00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:23,900
multi-step processes the editors have to

00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:26,270
go through those are traditionally

00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:28,580
painful things we've had huge wins just

00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:30,080
by having quick dashboards that we threw

00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:33,050
together with views for editors that

00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:35,359
just said what content have you edited

00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:39,140
in the past month that is not yet

00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:42,260
published just show that in a view in

00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:45,020
the administrative section and they were

00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:47,690
overjoyed because that's a that's part

00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:49,130
of a workflow and out-of-the-box Drupal

00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:50,900
doesn't do that I'm not saying we should

00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:53,930
can we should have that

00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:55,309
page in Drupal but look for those kinds

00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,720
of opportunities because often from a

00:48:55,309 --> 00:48:59,510
deaf perspective it's easy to whip that

00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:03,529
up but it's hard to do work without it

00:48:59,510 --> 00:49:04,910
there for an editor and also tailoring

00:49:03,529 --> 00:49:06,410
and refining these kinds of things

00:49:04,910 --> 00:49:09,140
iteratively if you're someone who

00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:11,450
actually works in an organization over

00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:13,670
the long haul not just doing like you

00:49:11,450 --> 00:49:16,450
know consulting or site builds you have

00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:18,589
a lot of opportunities for evolving and

00:49:16,450 --> 00:49:21,559
iterating these tools that the editors

00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:23,089
have to use on an ongoing basis there's

00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:25,130
a lot of value for that you don't have

00:49:23,089 --> 00:49:28,130
to somehow come up with the magic

00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:30,140
awesome el grande editorial workflow

00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:33,319
tool of doom and just you know throw it

00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:37,240
over the wall and say jara you can do no

00:49:33,319 --> 00:49:40,880
guest small wins it works it makes sense

00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:47,869
the third principle is exposing and

00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:51,289
using data feeds api's don't have to be

00:49:47,869 --> 00:49:54,529
super wacky and crazy and complicated if

00:49:51,289 --> 00:49:56,450
you have public information or public

00:49:54,529 --> 00:49:58,789
articles or stories that you want to

00:49:56,450 --> 00:50:01,220
publish and make available for reuse you

00:49:58,789 --> 00:50:02,900
don't have to bend over backwards and do

00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:05,119
lots of crazy stuff it can be as simple

00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:08,240
as using a tool like the views RSS

00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:09,890
module to customize exactly what fields

00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,049
show up in the RSS feed and add

00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:15,109
additional things like media RSS feeds

00:50:12,049 --> 00:50:17,779
or geotagged stuff to your RSS that's

00:50:15,109 --> 00:50:19,849
going out that can be reused and remixed

00:50:17,779 --> 00:50:21,829
in useful ways there's also a great

00:50:19,849 --> 00:50:24,680
module called views data source they'll

00:50:21,829 --> 00:50:26,569
let you expose XML or JSON or atom feeds

00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:28,970
that you can customize every little

00:50:26,569 --> 00:50:31,670
chunk of data that goes out in that view

00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:35,359
feed just like it you know just like NPR

00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:36,859
has done well perhaps not just like that

00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:39,230
there might be a little bit of custom

00:50:36,859 --> 00:50:41,450
code to do that level of stuff but still

00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:43,309
you can get a lot of stuff in in place

00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:45,049
just by throwing together useful views

00:50:43,309 --> 00:50:47,390
and if you've ever built a view with

00:50:45,049 --> 00:50:49,400
exposed filters or you can have filters

00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:52,309
and sorts and stuff like that that come

00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:54,319
in in the URL you've got something very

00:50:52,309 --> 00:50:56,900
close to the kind of API endpoint that

00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:58,880
NPR exposes their content with you can

00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:01,069
use vuze to views to build simple

00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,230
content API s and if you want to go

00:51:01,069 --> 00:51:04,420
further there's tools like the services

00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:06,640
module and the

00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:08,890
content API module that was built on top

00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,720
of services they're great examples you

00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:13,420
can even publish content to your website

00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:16,090
with those tools so you could have an

00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:17,890
iphone app that lets you post and manage

00:51:16,090 --> 00:51:20,320
articles using something like the

00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:22,540
services module more complex to set up

00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:24,970
but there's already underlying tools to

00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:28,450
help support that you can also consume

00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:30,040
that data not only on crazy iphone apps

00:51:28,450 --> 00:51:32,890
and stuff like that but in your own

00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:35,020
website you can use the feeds module to

00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:36,910
pull in those data feeds if you've got

00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:39,880
several sites that need to share content

00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:42,130
set up a feed on one of them import it

00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:44,950
into the others and now you have a

00:51:42,130 --> 00:51:47,980
content API may not be as fancy as npr's

00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:50,140
but you know it can get the job done and

00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:51,850
also you can simplify certain scaling

00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:53,950
and performance issues by exposing

00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:56,800
cashable content feeds and using

00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:59,200
client-side script to consume data from

00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,660
them and expose things like widgets of

00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:03,910
content of widgets of new stories and

00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:05,680
stuff like that in JavaScript on look on

00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:07,990
the client side of your own Drupal site

00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:10,360
you can consume that sites feeds if you

00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:12,970
want to go super crazy lots of

00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,710
possibilities the idea is expose

00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:16,420
lightweight feeds that doesn't have to

00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:18,010
be a huge engineering task you can just

00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:20,440
do it with views and then start

00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:23,530
utilizing them get used to that idea and

00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:24,970
you are I would probably say like you

00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:26,770
know let's say seventy-five percent of

00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:30,100
the way to having a useful

00:52:26,770 --> 00:52:31,540
multi-platform content ryu strategy but

00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:35,260
that's something to put on the year-end

00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:37,510
report Drupal 8 also has a lot of really

00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:39,430
cool stuff coming down the pipe what the

00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:41,680
web services initiative the ability to

00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:45,550
expose Jason feeds you won't even need

00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,930
to have extra modules other than core to

00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:50,080
do that kind of stuff in Drupal 8

00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:51,190
there's a lot of potential for it a lot

00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,420
of people are going to be talking about

00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:54,690
that this week you know here at

00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:58,960
drupalcon too so pay attention to them

00:52:54,690 --> 00:53:01,030
but all of those things you know if you

00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:03,430
want to start dealing with these ideas

00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:07,630
in Drupal the principles to remember

00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:09,220
that design neutral content models you

00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:12,370
know you've building content types that

00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:14,110
don't assume that a particular visual

00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:16,990
design is the only thing they're going

00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:19,270
to be used for is a critical first part

00:53:16,990 --> 00:53:21,550
exposing structured data feeds so you

00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:23,680
can reuse that structured content in

00:53:21,550 --> 00:53:25,570
cool ways when you want to and then

00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,550
building good editorial tools to support

00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:29,500
the people who will actually be creating

00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:31,450
and managing that content because

00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:34,090
structured content also implies lots

00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:35,619
fields sometimes and figuring out how to

00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:37,180
smooth out the experience of you know

00:53:35,619 --> 00:53:41,710
editing and maintaining and working with

00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:43,630
that content is important so building

00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:46,510
for a post mobile you twirled what's the

00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:49,660
what's the high-level stuff one reuse

00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:52,030
your content the same piece of content

00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:54,040
rather than little forked off clones of

00:53:52,030 --> 00:53:55,450
it going in different directions that

00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:57,880
will dramatically simplify the

00:53:55,450 --> 00:54:00,430
management and maintenance work that is

00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:03,490
where a lot of real long tail costs for

00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:05,290
maintaining content comes from put the

00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:07,630
purpose and structure of your content

00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:08,860
before the visual appearance when you're

00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:11,590
thinking about how to model it with

00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:13,900
content types and fields Taylor you're

00:54:11,590 --> 00:54:16,119
editing workflow wherever possible the

00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:19,270
Drupal node forum is you know it's not a

00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:22,060
scary monster but it's generic it's not

00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:24,220
in any way informed by the nature of the

00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:27,100
work that people working on your website

00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:28,990
need to do and there's great tools to

00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:31,650
build custom workflows around that take

00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:35,760
advantage of them and then exposed feeds

00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:38,700
with best structured data to simplify

00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:42,040
experimentation reduce the cost of

00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:44,710
coming up with a crazy experiment for

00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:46,630
Android and stuff like that I think one

00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:48,850
of the interesting examples and PR

00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:52,660
mentioned was they now have a wordpress

00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:55,330
plugin that uses the NPR API to auto

00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:58,330
publish stories from particular shows on

00:54:55,330 --> 00:55:01,420
any wordpress sites for NPR affiliates

00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:03,520
there is also an NPR drupal module that

00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:04,990
does the same thing if you're setting up

00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:07,180
a website and you want to syndicate

00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:10,000
content you can pull in all of those

00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:11,980
discrete fields as a drupal content type

00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,010
display them however you want because

00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:17,109
that NPR api can be tied into all kinds

00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:19,480
of things they didn't have to rebuild

00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:21,670
all their infrastructure in order to

00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:24,100
build that little experimental thing on

00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:26,200
the edge and reducing the cost of those

00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:28,810
experiments means that you have a lot

00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,920
more slack when dealing with new and

00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:32,319
crazy stuff

00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,540
it emerges in the world mobile or you

00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:37,630
know I don't know I've all implanted

00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:39,910
browsing technology whatever people come

00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:42,040
up with if you can experiment on the

00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:44,859
edges while your underlying structure

00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:47,890
stays consistent and reusable you've

00:55:44,859 --> 00:55:51,160
made a huge win it's really really good

00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:54,460
to do I don't know I'm just repeating

00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:56,109
myself good stuff if you're looking for

00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:57,549
some additional reading there's through

00:55:56,109 --> 00:55:59,799
really great books i can highly

00:55:57,549 --> 00:56:02,710
recommend content strategy for mobile by

00:55:59,799 --> 00:56:05,589
Karen McGrane it's sort of a it's a

00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:07,750
great book to hand to like you know your

00:56:05,589 --> 00:56:09,400
your VP if they're trying to say I don't

00:56:07,750 --> 00:56:12,220
know why we need this week we got on

00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:14,109
we've got a mobile site I feel like I

00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:16,420
should like be wearing a newsie cap or

00:56:14,109 --> 00:56:18,250
something when I use that voice but it's

00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:20,290
a really good high level overview about

00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:21,640
the whys of some of the structured

00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:24,280
content stuff that we've been talking

00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:27,460
about the book content everywhere by

00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:29,710
Sarah oh wow i'm going to miss pronounce

00:56:27,460 --> 00:56:32,349
her name her name is sarah and it's an

00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:33,940
awesome book i pronounced it correctly

00:56:32,349 --> 00:56:37,089
on the podcast and that was the last

00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:39,099
time i think but it's it drills a little

00:56:37,089 --> 00:56:40,809
deeper into some case studies and some

00:56:39,099 --> 00:56:42,339
good examples of how different

00:56:40,809 --> 00:56:44,500
businesses have tried to break down

00:56:42,339 --> 00:56:47,260
their content that way there's also API

00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:49,780
as a strategy guide it's an o'reilly

00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:51,430
book about some of the challenges and

00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:54,760
issues to deal with when exposing

00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:56,980
content api's for services and any kind

00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:58,569
of api it's you know by a couple of

00:56:56,980 --> 00:57:00,609
people who have actually done that on a

00:56:58,569 --> 00:57:03,549
lot of large organizations it's great

00:57:00,609 --> 00:57:05,410
stuff there's also a bunch of links I'm

00:57:03,549 --> 00:57:07,150
not gonna bother reading through the

00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:12,220
links but if you want to copy these

00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:14,380
slides go to lbc m / post mobile or go

00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:16,020
to the drupalcon website and i believe

00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:19,720
these slides should be uploaded now I

00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:22,059
believe we've got four minutes maybe

00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:26,730
four and a half we'll see if there's any

00:57:22,059 --> 00:57:26,730
questions go for it yes

00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:35,150
that's a great question is it's because

00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:37,369
Drupal is so coupled and has HTML

00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:40,070
publishing baked in its you know what it

00:57:37,369 --> 00:57:43,340
does out of the box do people get misled

00:57:40,070 --> 00:57:46,550
about what the nature of Drupal system

00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:48,050
is I think I don't think they're misled

00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:51,080
so much because for a long time the

00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:52,070
Drupal has been a web publishing CMS and

00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:56,300
there's a lot of other tools out there

00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:58,790
like that um I think it's almost by by

00:57:56,300 --> 00:58:00,680
happy accident that we're so well

00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:02,869
positioned for this structured content

00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:05,570
shift you know if you go back to like

00:58:02,869 --> 00:58:08,630
tools like flexi node and heck the node

00:58:05,570 --> 00:58:10,010
system itself you know the Drupal

00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:12,590
community has been thinking about

00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:14,630
content in a lot of these ways and we're

00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:17,119
now starting to mature into a place

00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:19,640
where we can actually leverage that

00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:21,790
effectively it still takes work because

00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:24,680
you can easily build a highly coupled

00:58:21,790 --> 00:58:27,070
non-reusable Drupal site if you know you

00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:29,990
aren't thinking about what you're doing

00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:31,520
but I do think that that's not something

00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:33,290
that's obvious to people who haven't the

00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:38,890
neck deep in structured content for a

00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:38,890
while the other questions yes

00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:04,410
yes okay the question was do we have any

00:59:02,430 --> 00:59:06,180
success stories for how Drupal has

00:59:04,410 --> 00:59:09,060
served as the backend CMS while other

00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:12,270
systems served as the front end in that

00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:15,510
sort of decoupled approach I know this

00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:17,340
sounds like a cop-out but the one most

00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:20,010
recent success story I can think of is

00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:22,230
totally nd8 at the moment and I can't

00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:29,130
actually say what it was but I will say

00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:32,400
it was a very large a very large sports

00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:35,820
thing that needed to deliver lots of

00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:37,680
content to lots of devices and they

00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:39,960
wanted to do this neo this sort of like

00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:42,330
multi-channel approach and Drupal is

00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:43,920
being used on the backend for all the

00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:45,750
content management stuff they're using

00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:48,000
another provider to do video streaming

00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:50,730
but Drupal is the hub that organizes

00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:54,060
everything but even the desktop and

00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:57,510
mobile websites aren't being generated

00:59:54,060 --> 00:59:59,880
by drupal their HTML j/s they're

00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:03,030
basically a lightweight web app using

00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:05,970
you know basic you know you know CSS and

01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:09,240
html5 and JavaScript frameworks but it

01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:10,860
pulls from Drupal so it's an example of

01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:12,840
that ma'am I gotta figure out when we

01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:15,740
can talk about that but it's it's cool

01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,740
yes

01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:31,329
oh that's yes the the yes that's an

01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:33,309
excellent point there there's another

01:00:31,329 --> 01:00:36,220
project we worked on the Martha Stewart

01:00:33,309 --> 01:00:39,250
Living website which is ginormous and

01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:42,940
extremely pastel-colored and it

01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:45,640
basically they have two sites all their

01:00:42,940 --> 01:00:48,039
user generated content commenting rating

01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:50,170
stuff you know building your own recipe

01:00:48,039 --> 01:00:53,470
book stuff like that and their primary

01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:56,049
editorial content server and they weave

01:00:53,470 --> 01:00:58,119
those things together when they actually

01:00:56,049 --> 01:01:00,490
put out their website all of the

01:00:58,119 --> 01:01:04,089
user-generated content is a Drupal site

01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:06,430
but a different Drupal site is pulling

01:01:04,089 --> 01:01:08,619
it in via content feeds to actually

01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:10,270
display for them it's a safety and

01:01:08,619 --> 01:01:12,339
security issue they never have to worry

01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:14,470
about users ever touching their

01:01:12,339 --> 01:01:17,650
editorial server but they're using it

01:01:14,470 --> 01:01:19,960
basically like build your own Disqus

01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:21,940
commenting server in Drupal you know and

01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:23,500
i think that's that's you know one

01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:25,480
example there's a lot of different ways

01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:28,359
to slice and dice it but you know once

01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:30,160
you've made that shift to putting your

01:01:28,359 --> 01:01:32,430
content out there in a number of

01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:34,510
reusable forms you have a lot of

01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:37,539
opportunities to experiment with those

01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:39,010
kinds of things that it's startling you

01:01:37,539 --> 01:01:41,260
start seeing it everywhere it's like you

01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:44,380
know you now have a shiny new hammer and

01:01:41,260 --> 01:01:47,710
there are so many nails I think we're

01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:48,940
flat out of time so I think we got to

01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:51,400
close this up but I'm going to be

01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:54,130
wandering around and and if anybody

01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:56,920
wants to ask or chat or talk about you

01:01:54,130 --> 01:01:58,630
know cool cool examples of these kinds

01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:00,369
of techniques that'd be great and feel

01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:03,210
free to take a pony from the back table

01:02:00,369 --> 01:02:03,210
