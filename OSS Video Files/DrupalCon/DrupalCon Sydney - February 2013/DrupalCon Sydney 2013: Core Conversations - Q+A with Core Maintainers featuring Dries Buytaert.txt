yeah good afternoon everybody so

00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:10,099
originally this was going to be a Q&A

00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:17,179
with me but we've expanded the scope and

00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:17,179
so I have some fng here with a yeah

00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:24,000
angie's a coca meter on Drupal 7 and

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:28,109
Drupal 8 we have Jess Mirabeau it's

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,199
pronounced Jesse's working on the views

00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:34,980
initiative we have Shannon Shannon is a

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,800
project manager she's been helping she's

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,280
been helping to coordinate all of the

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:45,780
Drupal 8 initiatives we have John Albin

00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:49,079
John is responsible for responsible for

00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:54,690
the Drupal 8 mobile initiative we have

00:00:49,079 --> 00:01:00,780
gap or all the way from Europe and gob

00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:09,270
or what's the time Gobber it's very good

00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:11,310
it's 547 547 did I tell you that to be a

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,630
core initiative lead you need to have

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:17,430
some you know real sense of commitment

00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:22,710
but gabbar works on the multilingual

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:29,460
stuff in Drupal 8 we have Greg Greg

00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:31,470
Dunlap and Greg is working on the

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:39,619
configuration management stuff then we

00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:44,700
have you guys and we have Chris Chris

00:01:39,619 --> 00:01:46,880
Vander water it's actually a Dutch last

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,070
name so I need to like work on my

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,729
mispronunciation say it actually proper

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:56,460
English chris is responsible for the

00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:58,950
blocks initiative and also for the

00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,439
plug-in stuff and then last but not

00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:04,350
least we have the almighty Larry

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:07,280
Garfield's all the way from Chicago I

00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,280
think

00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:15,200
and Larry is responsible for what was

00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,380
whiskey and so that includes symphony

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,370
but also the web services things and

00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:24,980
stuff like that so what we were going to

00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:26,480
do is just basically not present

00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:29,060
anything but just going to open the

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,820
floor for Q&A and so we can you no

00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:35,320
answer your questions before we do so

00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:37,700
just like to talk for like one minute

00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,130
about already presented sort of an

00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:43,160
update on the on the work that we're

00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:46,700
doing I just wanted to sort of share my

00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:49,040
feelings a little bit and you know

00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,930
overall I feel very excited about Drupal

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,959
8 I think we've we've added some really

00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:55,760
amazing features and i truly root truly

00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,950
believe that Drupal 8 will be a

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,070
game-changer for many for many reasons i

00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:03,050
think we've added great new features for

00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,070
almost every target audience like we

00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:06,080
have some great new things for

00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:07,760
developers with symphony and some of

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,320
some of the architectural changes we

00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:13,100
have some great things for site builders

00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,810
with views in core and in some of the

00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,880
other things we've done and we've also

00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:20,150
added some really really cool

00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,890
improvements for sort of end users

00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,739
people that you know actually write

00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:27,200
content and manage content in Drupal

00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:29,780
things with you know some of the spark

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,459
stuff and some of the user experience

00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,130
improvement so overall I feel really

00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:36,560
good about all of the new features that

00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,060
we've added at the same time we have a

00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,580
lot of work left to be done there's a

00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:44,180
lot of things that we've started that we

00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:46,100
need to you know really polish like some

00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,650
of the api's and we've definitely

00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:53,180
introduced some complexity that we need

00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:57,620
to you know try to remove or streamline

00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:59,870
so it's easier to do develop for so that

00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,820
that's kind of how I feel and you know

00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,709
that happens to be in line with I think

00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:06,790
the face that were at in the development

00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:09,709
cycle you know we're about to start the

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,480
goat well provide to hit the feature

00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:13,190
free state meaning we're going to switch

00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:15,800
to polish instead of adding new features

00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:17,690
so we have you know I would say we have

00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,950
at least six months or almost six months

00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:28,440
of polish time

00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:30,990
um there's mush it's okay I can second

00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:34,110
I'm gonna move the microwave so that's

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:37,310
all I was gonna say anyway so um we're

00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:41,300
just gonna do questions any questions

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:41,300
there has to be some questions

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,389
you

00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:09,710
it's a great question I could answer it

00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:14,050
but like to offer the mic through anyone

00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:14,050
that wants to answer or mark even

00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:45,990
okay I don't know Larry you ever do you

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:48,440
have an opinion I think a lot of things

00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:52,349
are they never had indian about anything

00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:54,090
nope and actually want to correct you on

00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:56,819
one thing trees I'm actually in Miami at

00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:58,770
the moment at a different conference so

00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:05,819
I'm kind of double dipping conferences

00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:10,849
at the moment awesome the exact hear the

00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:13,560
question yeah so I think as Mark said

00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:16,130
number of languages is not itself a

00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:21,800
metric of difficulty of learning and

00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:27,780
rupal is still a PHP framework but in

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:30,389
Drupal 7 we were using approaches and

00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:32,099
techniques and concepts that no one

00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:37,409
would be exposed to another using Drupal

00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:40,800
in Drupal aids we are not entirely but

00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:43,590
largely switching over to techniques and

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,180
concepts and styles that people are more

00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:47,400
likely to have been exposed to so

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:49,069
someone fresh out of college is going to

00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:53,250
have an easier time understanding

00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:55,139
objects and you know an observer pattern

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,120
they're going to understand render API

00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:59,099
no one is going to understand drapey

00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,330
render API who hasn't worked with it

00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:04,139
because there's nothing else like it out

00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:06,090
there whereas from a learnability

00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:11,419
perspective a lot of the new stuff in

00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:14,940
the coral system in whiskey in Scotch is

00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:17,639
mundane from a larger software

00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,870
standpoint if I heard mark correctly

00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:21,990
it's kind of hard in the back of the

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:24,389
room you're saying it's it's not a

00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:26,310
question of oo is harder than procedural

00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:28,020
as much as it is make sure that the

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,690
stuff you're doing makes sense in

00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:32,700
context and is consistent and clean and

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:35,760
I think I see him nodding I agree

00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:38,070
entirely and a lot of what we're going

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,010
to be doing over the next you know four

00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:44,039
or five six months is now that we've got

00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:45,899
all these new tools in place let's flush

00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:49,260
them out take them third logical

00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:50,790
conclusion and you know clean up a lot

00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,250
of the fact that we do have two systems

00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,930
inside each other right now and

00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:57,800
cleaning that up is going to be a major

00:08:53,930 --> 00:09:00,080
task for the next couple of months yeah

00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,850
I think actually when we get right down

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,460
to it the learnability of Drupal 8 will

00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:09,140
be better than google 7 spectively

00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:10,880
documented correctly yeah if if I could

00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,480
jump in on that for just a second I

00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:15,320
think like I don't know how much of

00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:17,510
digging through the code you've done

00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,540
thus far but you know in terms of the Oh

00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:22,670
components that sit there there's been a

00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:26,300
very high level of documentation going

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:28,280
on in the vast majority of patches you

00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:30,170
know it's not uncommon for me to open up

00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,680
a patch in a section that I know nothing

00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:35,780
about and not have any problems with

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,660
just reading it these days and a lot of

00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:41,360
that stuff is oh oh and you know full

00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:45,410
disclosure I wasn't doing PHP oo until

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:48,590
like November of 2011 so and that was

00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:50,630
writing the plug-in system so yeah I

00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:53,360
mean there's there are a lot of us

00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:56,750
myself especially who have come along

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,660
and are doing Oh for the first time here

00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,970
in Drupal 8 and I'm very happy with it

00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:05,030
being primarily a procedural programmer

00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:07,850
before this so and if I could address

00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:09,890
annotations Lee I'd encourage you to

00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:14,120
really give it a try before you asked me

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:21,500
to remove it I also that's another thing

00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:24,260
that's not a note about annotations I

00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:26,330
think annotations by themselves are a

00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:28,910
very defensible thing I think they're

00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:31,220
there can be a big DX win the way we're

00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:33,560
using them is crazy though and i think

00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,360
the what you saw i agree with what you

00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,550
saw it almost looks like i mean when it

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,420
starts to look like code okay

00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:43,990
annotations are so and it the concept of

00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,850
annotations is a way to add metadata to

00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:48,470
classes or functions in PHP it's a

00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:52,550
supported feature in languages like Java

00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:54,830
and similar thing in Python PHP gets

00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:57,200
around it by using like if you see like

00:10:54,830 --> 00:11:00,350
the @ / am in like a doc block it's

00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,270
basically custom at things right and you

00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:05,300
can say like like PHP and it uses these

00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,050
and so you can have a method on a class

00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,410
that's like

00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:11,089
at test and then PHP parses those

00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:12,500
because parsing nose is parsing the doc

00:11:11,089 --> 00:11:14,480
block is actually a supported thing in

00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,709
the language so that's not too much of a

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,779
hack but then you have to look through

00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:19,190
that doc block get all those and figure

00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:20,899
out which ones are annotations and then

00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:23,450
apply that metadata so it's like a way

00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:26,470
to to add some sort of discoverability

00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:28,790
to your existing classes and functions

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,750
some people think I mean I really just

00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:31,040
have the opinion that like this is a

00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,990
total hack we shouldn't do it because

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,000
you're parsing comments who cares

00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:37,250
doesn't matter PHP is an incredibly

00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,519
inflexible language we need to take the

00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:42,680
expressiveness we can get but when it

00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:44,300
starts looking like code I agree that's

00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,930
crazy and we need to maybe re-evaluate

00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,910
how we're using them yeah and just to

00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:52,190
like to like throw out an official

00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,839
position on that I'm not opposed to

00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:55,870
rethinking exactly how we're using them

00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,010
but I am opposed to removing it

00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,899
currently it's basically just like

00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:02,870
anything you would have ever done in an

00:11:59,899 --> 00:12:04,790
info hook but it's singular for an

00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:08,180
individual implementation and it's

00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,440
sitting in a class I will say that I

00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,110
think that there are definitely

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,850
trade-offs in Drupal 8 I think that some

00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,410
things that they're hopefully fewer

00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,940
Drupal isms although we've introduced a

00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:18,350
few additional gerbil isms and Drupal 8

00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:20,029
but we're hopefully moving in the

00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,370
direction of reducing things that are

00:12:20,029 --> 00:12:24,170
specific to Drupal overall in the case

00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,300
of annotation specifically and also for

00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,950
the DX in general one thing that drew

00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:31,899
blade is doing that's really positive is

00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:34,339
that um we use our patterns consistently

00:12:31,899 --> 00:12:36,200
maybe we need to reduce the number of

00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:38,240
new patterns we've introduced our sort

00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,010
of streamline it but when you learn

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,500
something you are learning it for all of

00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:45,589
core when you look at an annotation on a

00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:47,089
view plug-in like you view if you have a

00:12:45,589 --> 00:12:48,740
views handler that the annotation there

00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:50,480
you can you read that you learn that

00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:54,290
pattern and then you'll see that same

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,209
pattern on on on an entity type so the

00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,220
info hooker the entity type the info

00:12:56,209 --> 00:13:00,110
hook for for the view plugin is the same

00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:01,520
thing it's there the annotation and

00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:03,620
there's a lot of instances of that where

00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,110
where it may be that we're introducing

00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,579
new patterns that people have to learn

00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,870
but at least they're used more

00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:10,730
consistently throughout the codebase

00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,740
probably than in previous versions of

00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:14,779
gerbil and like Mark pointed out this is

00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:16,250
I mean we are just getting to the point

00:13:14,779 --> 00:13:18,100
where we're going to stop focusing on

00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:19,660
adding new features to core and instead

00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,250
we're really trying to improve the

00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:23,170
developer experience clean up

00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:25,690
performance do refactoring and so that

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:27,790
if you if thats concern you have you

00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:28,899
know common the course uq and try to

00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,589
help out with those issues because

00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:32,019
that's something we're going to be

00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:35,199
starting to do um you know within the

00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:38,589
next couple weeks so uh yeah drupal.org

00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:40,449
/ community dash initiatives / drupal

00:13:38,589 --> 00:13:42,610
dash core on that's for the core

00:13:40,449 --> 00:13:44,620
initiatives that has sort of bi weekly

00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:47,550
updates and issues you can work on and

00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:52,300
stuff so if you're concerned about that

00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:54,459
check out the page I'd like to quickly

00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:55,899
echo that as well um this is probably

00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:57,880
you know a good time if you're

00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:59,110
interested in core development to like

00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,790
you know sort of start dabbling with

00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,550
Drupal 8 maybe if you have some

00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:06,730
contributed modules I know it's early

00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:09,220
and things may change during the you

00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,980
know during the polish face if you will

00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,449
but we very much hope to get people to

00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,310
upgrade their modules and to give us

00:14:13,449 --> 00:14:17,589
feedback on what you like what you don't

00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:19,810
like in terms of api's and we will still

00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:23,170
make changes to our AP ice at this stage

00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:25,569
so it's a good time to do give us that

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,880
feedback and and suggest alternative

00:14:25,569 --> 00:14:35,709
approaches that are less complex or more

00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:40,420
into any other questions Jonathan so I

00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:42,819
know we're compiling PHP and putting

00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:45,639
that in the files directory and if

00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:50,410
you've got a if you've got a multi-head

00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:52,180
set up with lots of Apache servers then

00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:55,839
you have to share your files directory

00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:57,639
and if you're running PHP from an NFS

00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,750
share and it's not going to be a

00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:00,750
performance problem

00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:09,770
um good question um you probably don't

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,210
have to have a shared file system I you

00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:14,030
know every head could have his own copy

00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:15,350
probably armed that actually adds a

00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:19,130
little bit more overhead because you

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:22,160
have to compile it for every you know

00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:23,480
webnode but I don't know I think it

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,670
depends on how it is used in our

00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:33,470
frequently it is invalidated and I'm

00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:35,330
mercury Oh for every okay so yeah gets

00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:43,510
ah but you know people don't enable

00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:46,040
marches all the time in production okay

00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:48,020
so a question from Twitter are you

00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:50,560
worried about how fast major version

00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:53,510
releases affect the enterprise community

00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,100
yes since they're the almost always the

00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:57,290
slowest to adopt and that's if you have

00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:00,740
questions you can ask them via hashtag

00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:07,370
io heckle nice work and that is a

00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:09,290
question from Dominic sin 10 jello I'd

00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:11,300
like to answer that question I think

00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:16,910
anybody who thinks the core release

00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:19,460
cycle is too fast is insane we have a

00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:21,260
three-year release cycle in modern in

00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:24,290
modern development times that's like a

00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:26,150
decade or 20 years it's crazy we need to

00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:27,560
be releasing faster not slower and

00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:30,080
actually depends on what you talked in

00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,120
my opinion so like a gyno agree and I

00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:36,260
disagree like if you talk to the actual

00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:38,630
users of Drupal some of them are afraid

00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,000
of 32 year release cycles they don't

00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:43,970
like to have those fast cycles but then

00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,040
if you talk to developers they

00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:47,240
definitely like short cycles because I

00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:52,510
want to use the latest and the greatest

00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:56,890
so um yes nobody has to upgrade either

00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:59,980
right it's a tough it's a tough question

00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:02,360
part of the challenge here is at

00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:06,189
Drupal's release cycle to break more

00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:09,079
than any other product if you look at

00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:12,020
you know a linux distribution or

00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:15,980
WordPress or Joomla or symphony or cake

00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:18,770
or Ruby on Rails their version

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,510
version API breakage even if they have

00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:23,000
it is substantially less than ours

00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:26,959
whereas we basically release a brand new

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,870
platform every three years we used to

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:34,120
release a reasonable upgraded with some

00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:37,610
API breaks every couple of months then

00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,740
sometime around rupal 6 well first was

00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:42,919
Drupal 4.7 with form API where we

00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:45,530
changed everything and then after Drupal

00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:47,570
6 people seven became a massive

00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:49,549
game-changing release Drupal 8 is a

00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:52,070
massive game-changing release those take

00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:53,390
three years and break a lot of api's and

00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:56,809
we can argue whether those are necessary

00:17:53,390 --> 00:18:04,429
or not I think they are but we may want

00:17:56,809 --> 00:18:07,520
to ask the question you know doing good

00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:12,610
question while we're waiting on two

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,610
halves ourselves to break fewer api's

00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:21,320
hotel why we have more fitting to

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,640
release it one of the nice things about

00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,850
a lot of the changes that are happening

00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:27,890
in Drupal 8 now is because because we've

00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,870
decoupled so much stuff and we've made

00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:32,390
it so much more modular it'll actually

00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:35,059
be a lot easier to make to make changes

00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:38,570
that are less invasive going forward

00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:41,000
from here and to do and to build

00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:43,190
backwards compatibility on top of it

00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,960
when we want to which i think is really

00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,059
important to having a faster release

00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,429
cycle because esther e says a lot of

00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:51,260
people are scared of fast release cycles

00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:53,419
because because of the changes in the

00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:56,870
upgrades that they have to perform but

00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:59,330
but I I still think I for a lot of

00:18:56,870 --> 00:19:01,010
reasons and not just for new developers

00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:03,049
stuff like that but I also think that in

00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:04,640
terms of our core community we put a lot

00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:06,950
of pressure on ourselves in each release

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,799
because we only release every three

00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:12,200
years and so there's a lot of pressure

00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:14,630
to get stuff done exactly right and

00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:16,460
that's where a lot of our that's where a

00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:19,250
lot of our conflict and the issues and

00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:21,140
stuff like that comes from as well so

00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,400
it's not just it doesn't you know there

00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,900
are a lot of there are a lot of things

00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,919
in terms of our culture and how we work

00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,990
together and all that stuff that are

00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:28,760
influenced by release cycles yeah I

00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,539
think that that's a really really valid

00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,889
point because

00:19:29,539 --> 00:19:32,659
mean there's an awful lot of conflict

00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:34,249
that I think wouldn't happen if we knew

00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:36,710
that in six months we could change it if

00:19:34,249 --> 00:19:38,899
we were wrong can I make a quick comment

00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:40,669
on that too because it sounds like this

00:19:38,899 --> 00:19:42,679
person is worried about like Enterprise

00:19:40,669 --> 00:19:44,690
Community lagging behind when we have a

00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:46,279
release because it's too soon and I

00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:48,950
think there's a lot of different

00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:51,440
stakeholders that are impacted and

00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:53,269
interested in these releases and you

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,429
can't make everyone happy that's number

00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:57,049
one like the Drupal shop owners want

00:19:55,429 --> 00:19:58,489
something that they can build off of for

00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:00,259
a few years and not have to completely

00:19:58,489 --> 00:20:02,690
retrain their entire team and do all

00:20:00,259 --> 00:20:04,909
this other stuff Enterprise communities

00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:06,950
want something stable but developers and

00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:08,629
end-users we want functionality and we

00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,369
want improvements and we want things to

00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:14,210
advance so there's no way that you're

00:20:10,369 --> 00:20:15,859
going to satisfy everyone unless really

00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:18,259
the community makes an effort to make

00:20:15,859 --> 00:20:19,849
the upgrade path and the and the path to

00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:21,529
improvement a lot better and that means

00:20:19,849 --> 00:20:23,239
Drupal ladders that means documentation

00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:24,889
that means people really getting more

00:20:23,239 --> 00:20:27,109
involved in the training aspect of

00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:30,710
things which will make advancement a lot

00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:33,529
easier to do if we all can do it in a

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:36,169
faster more easier less oh my god I have

00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:38,269
to relearn Drupal kind of way so I think

00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:39,440
if this is going to be successful and

00:20:38,269 --> 00:20:41,690
we're going to have faster release

00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,149
cycles that don't piss everyone off and

00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:45,919
make it really really hard we have to

00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:48,710
really focus on the training development

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,899
and you know moving forward into the

00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:53,119
next phase aspect of this community

00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:55,899
which i think is sorely lacking so

00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,899
that's my comment

00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:12,400
so

00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:26,080
well I've already started to look at

00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:28,179
some other and I think there's a couple

00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,620
of interesting you know ways to do it I

00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:30,909
think the right time to have that

00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:33,690
conversation is when we're about to

00:21:30,909 --> 00:21:36,669
start to Drupal 9 development cycle I

00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:39,789
just I mean I don't wanna like basically

00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:41,980
have that conversation now because you

00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:45,130
have to be really focused on on Drupal 8

00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:46,750
in my opinion but all I what I do want

00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,480
to say that I'm open to making changes

00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:51,850
and I'd like to organize like you know a

00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:55,330
big discussion with all of the

00:21:51,850 --> 00:22:00,059
stakeholders and see what tree

00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:00,059
trade-offs are willing to make so mark

00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:07,440
I think one thing we can do in the group

00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:10,500
late cycle and a big part of this is

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,200
deprecating instead of breaking and so

00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,720
if we're changing an API and Drupal 8 we

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,370
say we may move some procedural function

00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,920
or procedure functions functionality to

00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:21,720
a class we can keep the function and

00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:24,600
have it passed through to the new API

00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,820
and market is deprecated and so none of

00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,930
course should use it we solve all the

00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:30,180
functionality there but we don't

00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,680
immediately break contributed and I

00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:37,320
think the more we do that the easier

00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:41,220
will be to have nature upgrades good

00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:42,720
point all right so let's see if there's

00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,640
some other questions because we can talk

00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,250
about this for an hour I just want to

00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:54,600
make sure we were able to to cover a few

00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:57,240
different things mari so um considering

00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,880
the the volume of the the changes that

00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:02,850
have been made oh that's being made to

00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:06,270
Drupal 8 for example using core you know

00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:09,840
I'm thrilled to have it in core but

00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:11,490
considering the amount of translation

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:15,060
that needs to be done I'm quite

00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:18,720
concerned that the the timing of string

00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:20,640
freeze on if we don't have it early

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,050
enough I mean it's it's difficult but if

00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,350
you don't have it early enough the

00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:29,040
chances are many languages wouldn't be

00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:31,020
ready for the for the stable you know

00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,660
for the initial release and I'm just

00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:40,020
wondering if there's any strategy your

00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:42,710
work around for that all right anyone

00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,710
has a good answer

00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:53,429
it pretends to be frozen that sounds

00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:56,130
like a question for a gap or gabbert did

00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:58,530
you hear the question no I didn't hear

00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:02,460
you some more i'll try to summarize a

00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:05,280
question I'm so more he was asking well

00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:08,130
Maury expressed a concern about the the

00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:10,710
timing of the string freeze and he's

00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:12,799
worried that there's not enough time for

00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:14,880
people to translate Drupal 8

00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,250
specifically because we've added so many

00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:21,510
things to Drupal 8 like views which is

00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:23,160
adding a lot of strings and so he's

00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:27,299
worried about the timing of the of the

00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:29,520
string freeze and yeah so so I think

00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:33,540
there's there's two things that help

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:36,240
with that first is anytime there's a

00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:39,630
tagged release of job late even if it's

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:42,120
just like some kind of beta or health or

00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:43,980
something then it will be available on

00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:46,919
localized ripples in our quality right

00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:49,290
away so it can be started to be

00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:51,390
translated it's not necessarily frozen

00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:55,320
drinks but people can start translating

00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:58,350
stuff and the second is localized stupid

00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:00,419
ark is built to share translations

00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:02,370
between projects so all the translations

00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:04,980
from views will automatically be

00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:07,880
applicable to Drupal 8 and people will

00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:10,380
not need to manually copy them over so

00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,380
whatever is already translated will be

00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:17,390
there right away and it will speed up

00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,390
the process of translating replayed the

00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:26,360
help all right other questions I need

00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,360
Twitter questions

00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:38,950
trying to find a good one here yeah when

00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:40,840
not written by Dave yeah he's got a lot

00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:41,980
of good questions how about this what's

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,020
one thing that you didn't get to do in

00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:48,100
d8 that you want to do in d 9 and that's

00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:52,450
from Dave Hall interesting is in David

00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:55,510
room Darius who wants to go first um so

00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:57,280
one of the things that we aren't doing

00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:59,980
in Drupal 8 that I'd like to do in

00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:03,850
Drupal 9 Wow to be honest haven't really

00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:07,419
thought about drupal dying yet but I

00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:11,080
feel like I mean it right now it looks

00:26:07,419 --> 00:26:14,980
like one we won't be able to do all of

00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:17,770
the symphonic vacation that we may have

00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:20,380
hoped to do and that we may end up with

00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:24,309
a Drupal 8 which is mostly converted but

00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:26,020
not fully converted similarly around the

00:26:24,309 --> 00:26:28,120
altering experience stuff that we're

00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,679
doing it you know I think we have a much

00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,630
bigger vision of things that we could do

00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,970
like for example one of the things which

00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:36,340
we we've prototyped designed and

00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:38,169
prototypes actually is like a responsive

00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,419
layout builder I'm not sure if you guys

00:26:38,169 --> 00:26:44,160
have seen that but it effectively allows

00:26:40,419 --> 00:26:46,960
people to build responsive layouts

00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:49,750
without having to be you know a designer

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,730
without having to write CSS and I

00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:54,280
haven't seen anything like that in any

00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:55,840
other platform and I think it would have

00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:59,679
been something I would allow this to

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:01,929
leapfrog the competition but it doesn't

00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:05,559
look like we will be able to get it done

00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:07,360
and so but just two examples but I think

00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:10,960
what it comes down to I guess it's like

00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,880
it's a list of things versus like one

00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:15,790
big thing I don't know if you guys have

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,929
any to build on what dress was just

00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:18,669
saying the responsive layout builder is

00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:21,280
a big thing that I really wish we could

00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:23,530
have gotten into core but you know that

00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,880
we have some interdependencies on

00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:27,130
different initiatives and the blocks and

00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,950
layouts initiative work that happens and

00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:32,020
and we just I don't think we're gonna

00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:33,190
have enough time to get it done but i'm

00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,890
still very hopeful it'll be part of

00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:39,730
contribs i do feel like that would be

00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:41,840
really useful for people who are non

00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:44,120
designers to build layouts

00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,230
there's also a possibility of those are

00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:48,620
familiar with the responsive images

00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:50,929
problem we could make a solution that

00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:52,610
auto configured responsive images as

00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:54,500
long as grupal knows about the layouts

00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:56,270
and where the breakpoints are all that

00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,650
could be Auto configured and responsive

00:27:56,270 --> 00:27:59,900
images are very difficult to configure

00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:01,640
right now and the only way you could

00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:05,240
solve it is with a responsive layout

00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:06,620
builder I'll be really quick I know

00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,450
everyone has other important things to

00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:11,450
say but one of my own personal wishes

00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:13,010
for Drupal 9 is actually more funding so

00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,559
that it's not just a like volunteer

00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:18,440
driven effort but people actually have

00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:20,110
time and resources to invest on a

00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:23,210
regular basis I think that that would

00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:25,730
really really revolutionize this entire

00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:28,309
release process because you wouldn't be

00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:29,990
you know basically saying please x

00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:31,850
person put your entire life on hold

00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:34,340
don't have a personal life so that you

00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:36,470
can do this bit because you're blocking

00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:38,770
20 other things and that would be

00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,770
awesome

00:28:47,149 --> 00:28:52,339
I guess over the the last year or so

00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:55,159
we've seen some interesting crowd

00:28:52,339 --> 00:28:57,019
funding models especially for

00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:00,229
independent game development things like

00:28:57,019 --> 00:29:03,589
Kickstarter the Drupal community because

00:29:00,229 --> 00:29:05,539
it's so large and global if someone had

00:29:03,589 --> 00:29:10,609
a Kickstarter campaign for example to

00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:12,799
put fusing call you know how much money

00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:15,549
would have been raised I mean it's I

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:18,589
actually I actually can address this

00:29:15,549 --> 00:29:20,210
first of all you can't um it's very

00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:21,859
difficult to do a project like that on

00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:24,979
Kickstarter I do a lot of fundraising

00:29:21,859 --> 00:29:26,749
for my initiative and part of part of

00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:29,210
Kickstarter is that you actually have to

00:29:26,749 --> 00:29:31,190
deliver something and you have to do it

00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,899
in a specific time period so it's not

00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:34,129
really appropriate for us to do stuff on

00:29:32,899 --> 00:29:36,109
Kickstarter and there's every

00:29:34,129 --> 00:29:38,779
possibility that our that our thing

00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:42,289
would be cancelled however I will say

00:29:38,779 --> 00:29:44,629
that fusing core did put up a a chip in

00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:46,940
I mean just can address this more and

00:29:44,629 --> 00:29:49,879
they did raise some money I did the same

00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:52,279
thing for CM I it was a very very small

00:29:49,879 --> 00:29:55,849
fraction of what I needed and in

00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:57,739
historically those those crowdfunding

00:29:55,849 --> 00:30:01,279
efforts while they may not have the

00:29:57,739 --> 00:30:03,019
inherent marketing that starter has just

00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:07,339
because of their name I'm have all

00:30:03,019 --> 00:30:10,639
fallen vastly short and and historically

00:30:07,339 --> 00:30:12,649
i mean we that that has not been a very

00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:15,979
positive model for us from the funding

00:30:12,649 --> 00:30:17,599
perspective i can talk more to about how

00:30:15,979 --> 00:30:20,869
views and core was funded just briefly

00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:22,249
um we put up a chip and we raised about

00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:25,129
thirteen thousand dollars which is an

00:30:22,249 --> 00:30:26,719
amazing sound of sum of money on some

00:30:25,129 --> 00:30:29,210
part of that went to funding sprints and

00:30:26,719 --> 00:30:33,379
so forth some part of that one to fund

00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:35,839
part of my time but the rest of what

00:30:33,379 --> 00:30:37,339
made use possible and probably a much

00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:40,309
bigger chunk of the total amount of

00:30:37,339 --> 00:30:42,049
money came from individual companies

00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:43,940
sponsoring developers we have four

00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:47,389
people on the team myself Tim Plunkett

00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:49,190
damian lee and daniel veiner and um the

00:30:47,389 --> 00:30:50,809
other three people not me work for

00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:53,059
drupal shops i refresh our

00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:56,450
thought too yay um i started aqua next

00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:59,590
month anyway um so so Tim day me and

00:30:56,450 --> 00:31:01,570
Daniel all had part of their time funded

00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:03,010
from the shop that they were friend like

00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:05,169
a significant portion we're talking like

00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,730
forty to fifty percent of their time was

00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:08,919
contributed by that organization which

00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:10,510
is amazing that some zip tech new

00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:12,909
digital partnership and aired fish by

00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:18,309
the way so those guys made using quite

00:31:12,909 --> 00:31:19,809
possible and then on my time so the

00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:22,059
first third of my time was funded by the

00:31:19,809 --> 00:31:23,710
chip in ah quia fun to the next two

00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:25,600
months and then I have a third sponsor

00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:27,039
that I they still haven't let me tell

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,370
people who they are but I do have a

00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:32,230
third large open source company that's

00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:35,529
sponsoring my time up through febuary

00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:36,880
18th so that that model has worked very

00:31:35,529 --> 00:31:38,409
well from use we were able to do a heck

00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,620
of a lot in a very short amount of time

00:31:38,409 --> 00:31:43,960
and so it I mean it's definitely not

00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:47,409
possible for every shot that yet there's

00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:49,450
like a certain minimum size to make such

00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:51,909
a huge financial commitment but i think

00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:53,370
that committing a developer regularly is

00:31:51,909 --> 00:31:55,779
one of the biggest things any

00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:59,919
organization can do for for funny

00:31:55,779 --> 00:32:02,169
initiative so yeah if i could hop in on

00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:04,059
that for just a second i mean like

00:32:02,169 --> 00:32:07,539
commerce guys donated a ridiculous

00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:09,490
amount of my time to to the box

00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:11,110
initiative I mean there have literally

00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:14,919
been weeks where I've had 40 hours a

00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:17,740
week to work on it especially coming up

00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:25,090
to and shortly after like Munich and

00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:27,039
things like that so yeah but you know

00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:29,890
this is this is exact same sort of stuff

00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,539
that was happening in views like just

00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:33,250
was just talking about and when when a

00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:35,380
company steps up and actually puts one

00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:37,120
of their developers out there to do it

00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:39,460
you know that's when when things really

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,130
start happening unless you know you can

00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:44,770
go and you can fundraise like like greg

00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:47,409
did if i could go back to the question

00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:48,789
that was originally asked for a second

00:32:47,409 --> 00:32:51,190
here instead of jumping off on

00:32:48,789 --> 00:32:53,320
fundraising for a minute because that's

00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:55,299
more of a retrospective like what would

00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,740
we do different going forward sort of

00:32:55,299 --> 00:32:58,659
good before you start before you start

00:32:56,740 --> 00:33:02,409
can I pimp the mutt the people who gave

00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:04,179
me money not totally this is like the

00:33:02,409 --> 00:33:06,130
time to do that right there were there

00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:08,200
were six there were six companies that

00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:13,179
donated five thousand dollars or more to

00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:13,810
cmi they were aquia riot gangs Dennis

00:33:13,179 --> 00:33:17,130
publishing

00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:23,530
in the UK bluehost web-enabled and

00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:25,600
Pantheon systems so I got so I got to

00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:27,520
work i have to work full-time on cmi for

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,300
seven months because of that which was

00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:33,370
amazing but it was a freaking amazing

00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:34,840
I'll Jamie just to comment just a tag on

00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:36,880
on what people said you know like I

00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,800
interview a lot of people and there is a

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,500
certain set of people that just come

00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:43,390
into the interview process and they say

00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:45,910
I'm interested in working for you but I

00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:50,350
like to work this many hours a week on

00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:52,030
on Drupal and you know it may be worth

00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:54,970
trying with some companies i think some

00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:56,980
companies are actually very open to it

00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:59,290
if ya if you actually ask for it and the

00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:00,730
right time to ask for it could be during

00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:05,050
the interview process to be honest

00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:07,480
because so just that dip i guess for

00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:11,050
developers and the other thing I'll say

00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,730
is that most web development companies

00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:15,430
most professional services companies

00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:18,580
their employees have a little bit of

00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:21,040
bench time like it's rare that you have

00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:23,980
a hundred percent or more utilization in

00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,120
your company and so what what happens

00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:28,330
with the bench time I don't know but

00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,890
it's usually you know some companies

00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:34,780
give the bench time back to the

00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:36,400
community so to speak so another thing

00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,860
that some companies do is actually add a

00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:43,510
little extra charge through their

00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:45,610
invoices and that extra money is used to

00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:47,080
effectively have their developers can

00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:49,240
contribute that some of the things that

00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,800
they've developed for the customers and

00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,390
sometimes it's a line item on the

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,780
invoice and if the customer doesn't want

00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:58,150
it it's taken off of you know of the of

00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:00,070
the proposal but often i think if you

00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:02,080
explain the values of open source if you

00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:05,530
explain the values of contributing back

00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:07,690
to the project you know a lot of

00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:09,880
customers to get it so that's another

00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:13,200
way to make sure you have time to do to

00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,200
give back so

00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:19,890
Chris yeah so I just wanted to hop on

00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:21,589
the on the responsive layout builder

00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:24,210
train here for a moment I mean that's

00:35:21,589 --> 00:35:26,789
should be obviously my one big regret

00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:29,339
here we just we didn't have the

00:35:26,789 --> 00:35:31,289
bandwidth to get that far although I'm

00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:33,359
hoping to be able to demo here in the

00:35:31,289 --> 00:35:35,970
next two weeks that Sam and I have

00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:38,579
basically gotten to everything but that

00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:41,150
which that in and of itself is a really

00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:43,289
huge topic the everything that goes with

00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:45,240
really putting that layout builder in

00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:47,039
the right place and putting all the

00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,720
infrastructure around it to make it work

00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:52,039
appropriately from a user interface

00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:55,619
perspective but I think you know looking

00:35:52,039 --> 00:36:00,269
forward we have to figure out how to get

00:35:55,619 --> 00:36:03,599
that in contribs quickly as possible

00:36:00,269 --> 00:36:05,099
during the 8x psych mine because we've

00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,420
worked very hard to get all of the

00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:09,869
underlying architecture to make

00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:12,299
something like that possible layouts

00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:13,680
like I mean in the previous session I

00:36:12,299 --> 00:36:15,900
talked about this but you know we got

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,960
blocks in we got layouts in we've got

00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:23,249
displays in I'm hoping to have context

00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:27,210
and conditions in before before next

00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:29,430
week is out so you know there's like all

00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:31,499
the groundwork is laid it's a matter of

00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:33,210
putting together a user interface that

00:36:31,499 --> 00:36:35,609
we can all agree on and I spent an awful

00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:38,160
lot of time during during this cycle

00:36:35,609 --> 00:36:39,930
actually discussing user interface with

00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,720
a number of people especially boy on

00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:44,880
summers and it's a really really dense

00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:47,009
topic when it comes to what it is that

00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:50,960
the blocks and layouts initiative was

00:36:47,009 --> 00:36:53,819
trying to do and there aren't any really

00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,619
fantastic answers in there but when it

00:36:53,819 --> 00:36:57,900
comes to really like laying out the page

00:36:55,619 --> 00:37:00,690
and putting blocks in it the concept of

00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,039
the the layout builder the responsive

00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:04,470
layout builder is a really really good

00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:07,890
one and we we need to chase that and get

00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:09,900
it available as quickly as possible all

00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:11,670
right so we'll take another question in

00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:14,069
a second but let me quickly bounced back

00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:15,420
the question to you guys I mean having

00:37:14,069 --> 00:37:18,289
looked at Drupal 8 is there anything

00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:23,230
that you guys think is is really missing

00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:25,670
anything that comes to mind yeah

00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:27,860
um the one thing that I'd really like to

00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:31,220
see in the next major release of Drupal

00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:33,500
in Drupal 9 that we always say we want

00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,820
to do and nothing is what I had activity

00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,860
Ronnie get is some better tools for data

00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:40,340
migration into our core on this would

00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:41,930
make upgrading easier um since since you

00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:43,970
know the upgrading a Drupal site often

00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:45,770
involves three architecting anyway um it

00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:47,600
would also allow people to migrate from

00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:48,860
other solutions to Drupal things like

00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,450
that that's something that I think that

00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:52,490
would be really big one for Drupal it's

00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:54,320
one of the things that people you know

00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:55,520
are concerned about most often when we

00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,810
do surveys about triple so that's

00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:07,850
something I personally would would like

00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:09,710
to see 49 I'm just going to say that i'd

00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:11,840
like to see better media management and

00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:13,610
Drupal 8 would be really good and

00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,810
integrated as part of the content

00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:16,670
authoring would be a really great

00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:18,230
addition to that to be able to manage

00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:21,160
really images videos all that kind of

00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:21,160
stuff then

00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:41,350
oh what a surprise marks on a bomb has

00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:43,540
an opinion well I was just going to say

00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:46,000
that uh it would be nice to have phpunit

00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:47,620
for unit tested because surely Greg your

00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:54,190
classes are not actually unit tested are

00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:56,260
they you probably need bootstrapping

00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:59,560
common da-dink those aren't unit tests

00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:01,180
come on mark and I were actually talking

00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,560
about whether or not we'd be able to do

00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:06,460
some of that in eight just a little bit

00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:19,210
ago by the way so is can we we should

00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:27,880
finish okay anyone else have a question

00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:30,460
over here just do it to the the layout I

00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:33,880
guess it will take the smallest bit for

00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:36,250
basic website bill views already there

00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:44,800
and with the week is coming in but I

00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:46,900
think but I guess what's really missing

00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,400
just to complete this bundles web forms

00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:53,290
so i guess when we're going to have web

00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:55,030
forms inside the drupal then i guess for

00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:57,700
a basic website is not going to be neat

00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:59,350
for module extension from beginning so i

00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,810
guess it would make add optional drupal

00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:04,260
way faster than we saw the option of

00:40:01,810 --> 00:40:04,260
drupal sir

00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:13,759
I just wanted to ask cuz I haven't kept

00:40:12,229 --> 00:40:15,680
up with what's happening in sparkin that

00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:18,549
I've been doing accessibility testing

00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,839
with my what is happening with that like

00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:22,969
withdrew I'm sorry can you talk into the

00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:26,420
micro site directly we can't hear you at

00:40:22,969 --> 00:40:27,619
all sorry I'm just um I haven't kept up

00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:29,390
I've been doing some accessibility

00:40:27,619 --> 00:40:30,589
testing etc but I haven't really kept up

00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:35,239
with what was happening on the spark

00:40:30,589 --> 00:40:37,009
side is is are we going to have inline

00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:42,009
editing in Drupal 8 or what's happening

00:40:37,009 --> 00:40:42,009
there just just for a small update sorry

00:40:47,469 --> 00:40:52,489
yeah so uh spark is an initiative to put

00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:54,709
a bunch of authoring experience

00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:56,930
improvements we started prototyping in

00:40:54,709 --> 00:40:58,819
Drupal 7 just before Munich and then

00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:02,359
after staff term edik we started putting

00:40:58,819 --> 00:41:05,089
those into core and so yeah we we

00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:06,680
managed to get the responsive toolbar so

00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:09,890
in Drupal 7 when you look at your

00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:11,569
toolbar on an iphone and a responsive

00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:13,519
theme it takes up roughly like three

00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:14,930
quarters of your you know available

00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:17,029
screen size because it's just you know

00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:19,519
like this the news tool bar is really

00:41:17,029 --> 00:41:20,869
great um it can seamlessly switch back

00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,729
and forth between horizontal and

00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:25,190
vertical orientation based on the width

00:41:22,729 --> 00:41:26,719
of the screen it also has icons so when

00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:28,099
you scroll down to a small enough screen

00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:31,039
size as it just shows the icons and

00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:33,140
hides the text it's also we worked with

00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:34,819
Everett zoo felt that the he was the

00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:37,249
former accessibility maintainer he's a

00:41:34,819 --> 00:41:39,319
actual blind to triple user and a

00:41:37,249 --> 00:41:42,410
developer we worked with him on it and

00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:44,630
at drupalcamp Toronto in November and he

00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:47,630
said that this this toolbar was the

00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:50,059
single best implementation of an

00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:52,009
accessible like drawer based toolbar

00:41:50,059 --> 00:41:54,949
that he had ever witnessed so basically

00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:56,329
from now on when he is people are asking

00:41:54,949 --> 00:41:57,709
him questions about how to make these

00:41:56,329 --> 00:41:59,719
types of things accessible he's going to

00:41:57,709 --> 00:42:01,789
be like download Drupal 8 because we got

00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:03,890
it figured out and Jesse Beach has been

00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:07,329
instrumental and getting that whole

00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:07,329
stuff that she basic yeah

00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:13,680
yeah I know but gia supposed spark in

00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:15,810
general so and then in place editing is

00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,730
a second feature that we added that is

00:42:15,810 --> 00:42:20,130
also fully accessible it's keyboard

00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:21,660
accessible and we added Aria you know

00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:23,400
live region type of things he'll explain

00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:26,880
where you are on the page relative so it

00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:29,099
says editable title editable this and

00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:30,450
it's it's very like very svelte in the

00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:32,280
stream lines and stuff like that and and

00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:34,079
I think people have a hard time with

00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,220
with accessibility that sometimes

00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,630
because they try and just make it see

00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:39,180
when you click in the page instantly

00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:41,099
it's editable but people get annoyed is

00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:42,660
held by that so we have a little flag at

00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:45,119
the top that's just toggle on or off

00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:46,410
edit mode and so that's how we manage to

00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:49,829
make that accessible so that's done

00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:51,390
wysiwyg is done we did a bunch of work

00:42:49,829 --> 00:42:53,250
just generally with the mobile and

00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:55,230
layout initiatives to try and push those

00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:57,599
forward we didn't unfortunately get to

00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:59,160
the big responsive layout UI and the

00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,540
nice drag and drop blocks try that we

00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,000
were hoping to get to we had to kind of

00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:04,829
pivot there but yeah we're trying to

00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,030
we're really trying to push hard on the

00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:08,250
authoring experience in Drupal because

00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:11,640
it's it's a huge it's it's a place where

00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:14,040
you know like people will try Drupal for

00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,240
you know a second and say this is awful

00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:16,890
and then they'll leave and then they'll

00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,540
go use WordPress or something that's

00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:20,160
really nice and easy to use right of the

00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:22,140
box and they'll use that for a couple

00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,359
years till they hit some wall because

00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:26,430
like I can't do this one thing I guess

00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:27,810
I'll go back to Drupal now and then then

00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:29,160
they find Drupal again and they love it

00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:30,720
because they figure out it's so flexible

00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,670
and awesome and you know I'm kind of

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,990
like wouldn't it be great if people

00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:35,640
could just have that impression of

00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:37,500
Drupal right away and so instead of

00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,849
having to leave Drupal and go do some

00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,430
other framework that's not as powerful

00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:42,780
they just see it and they fall in love

00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:44,220
with the user interface as much as they

00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:47,010
fall in love with the code and so that's

00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:49,790
what we're trying to do in spark so yeah

00:43:47,010 --> 00:43:49,790
that's the update

00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:02,589
yep so um yeah that was great so you

00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:04,180
know aqua is always c funding like all

00:44:02,589 --> 00:44:05,530
of us to work on this and then we the

00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:07,000
team has been very focused on Drupal 8

00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:09,220
and so we let the Drupal 7 stuff just

00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,839
kind of you know because we had very

00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:12,190
limited time to try and get your plate

00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:14,079
in order and so it was just kind of

00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:16,510
stagnant and hanging there and radio

00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:17,650
france actually um approached us and

00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:19,089
said you know we love what you're doing

00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:20,950
with spark this authoring experience has

00:44:19,089 --> 00:44:23,950
really improved we need it today and so

00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:25,569
they actually funded a nod theodore be a

00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:27,160
dolla who's the javascript maintainer

00:44:25,569 --> 00:44:29,770
and someone who's been involved in spark

00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:31,569
for a long time and they funded him to

00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:33,099
actually crank on the inline editing and

00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:35,200
WYSIWYG capabilities in the Drupal 7

00:44:33,099 --> 00:44:36,970
version so now you can download the the

00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,040
inline editing and the WYSIWYG

00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:41,650
functionality from spark and Drupal 7

00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:43,119
use it today and it's just as good as

00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,559
the one in Drupal 8 and hopefully we'll

00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,640
continue to get better and if you're

00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:48,460
interested in funding further

00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:49,839
development on Drupal 7 drees posted a

00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:51,430
link to his contact form in his blog

00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:54,280
post apparently he wants you to talk to

00:44:51,430 --> 00:45:05,650
him so gay thank you and can we hear for

00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:08,230
Radio France wait Kim I bring Mike thank

00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:10,839
you um one of the really exciting things

00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:12,579
I think is all the composer's support

00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:14,859
like basically pulling in all these

00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:17,079
external libraries and I'm just

00:45:14,859 --> 00:45:19,420
wondering if there's how this is going

00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:21,339
to affect like contrib development so

00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:22,960
you know obviously there's a lot of

00:45:21,339 --> 00:45:25,450
contra duels that integrate with

00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,869
external api's and libraries and yeah

00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:30,760
just how how weather is going to be

00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:36,750
support for hooking into that kind of

00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:39,790
global composer thing a great question

00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:43,299
stating that with symphony and the

00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:45,190
composer stuff specifically right in

00:45:43,299 --> 00:45:47,740
core this question is how is that going

00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:49,510
to affect contribute module development

00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:53,349
and how will be how will we deal with

00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:56,079
those things in country that rather

00:45:53,349 --> 00:46:00,540
simply composer effects marginal

00:45:56,079 --> 00:46:04,599
developments let the question yes okay

00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:08,109
so it depends on the module really four

00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:11,140
modules that dealt with the core routing

00:46:08,109 --> 00:46:15,330
pipeline to in some form

00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:18,090
that API has changed considerably and

00:46:15,330 --> 00:46:21,130
you have more power than you're used to

00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:23,530
the API is very different so that will

00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:28,180
be a non-trivial czesc a non-trivial

00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:29,230
task to pour that module however you

00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:31,930
should be able to do it in a way that

00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:35,890
lets you vet and test your code a lot

00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:37,360
better because because the way things

00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:40,150
are broken up and because it's all done

00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:42,610
using injected 00 you should be able to

00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:46,870
do actual real unit tests on your

00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:47,920
modules now a lot of them which is

00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:49,690
something that previously just

00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,600
physically wasn't possible to do so that

00:46:49,690 --> 00:46:58,450
should actually help for other parts of

00:46:52,600 --> 00:47:02,950
the systems say I maintain a text filter

00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:05,230
module um Cymphonique has pretty much no

00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:08,550
impact on that whatsoever that API has

00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:11,350
been ported over to plugins which is

00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:15,520
separate and chris's cheering that and i

00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:17,650
am too because you know core used to

00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,810
have about eight or nine different ways

00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:22,450
that you could extend things and provide

00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:25,420
new implementations of things and now

00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:26,590
with plugins and core once we're done

00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:30,790
converting things there should be only

00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:35,730
one so i think there will be a little

00:47:30,790 --> 00:47:41,350
upset a large hump bit over for contribs

00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:43,450
but once you get over that hump be it

00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:45,670
should be a lot easier to learn the

00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:48,790
whole system then have to learn each

00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:49,900
individual piece hey Larry um I think I

00:47:48,790 --> 00:47:51,460
think ken was actually asking a

00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,290
different question which was like will

00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:55,210
composer have any effect on like say the

00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:57,220
way distributions are packaged or is

00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:59,380
that kind of more what you were or

00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:00,640
pulling in external libraries that can

00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:02,350
be used with the modules to say the

00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,240
feeds module could automatically grab

00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:07,530
simplepie or something like that okay

00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,530
entirely different question you're right

00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:17,410
the composer it's not gonna have as big

00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:20,440
an impact as I wish it would because at

00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:23,260
least as of today we are not actually

00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:25,860
using composer for core aside from a way

00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:30,430
to keep things updated easily

00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:33,640
there is a rush plugin for composer that

00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:37,410
you can use now in Drupal 7 as well that

00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:39,880
lets you download additional libraries

00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:41,710
through drush so if your module depends

00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,330
on a drug library against an inch on

00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:45,550
your module depends on a third-party

00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:47,620
library you can specify that but the

00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:49,330
composer got Jason file and use this

00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:53,700
dress command to download everything and

00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:56,740
set it up that works now in Drupal 7 I

00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:58,240
would really like it if we switched over

00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,680
to do the saying you know what we're not

00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:02,470
going to put anything any of these

00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,150
third-party libraries in repository

00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:08,230
everything's going to be composer you

00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:10,990
want new libraries fighting modules are

00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:12,370
defined with composer files I don't know

00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:16,840
that that's going to happen there is an

00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:19,680
open issue right now to use composer

00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:21,730
Jason files for module dependencies um

00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:27,010
you've got about a week to get a DNA I

00:49:21,730 --> 00:49:31,620
think so I'm not hopeful for that which

00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:34,780
is unfortunate Tim you mean 10 days

00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:37,660
we've got 10 days to get that in so um

00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:39,310
yeah I I don't really have hope for that

00:49:37,660 --> 00:49:41,110
at the moment but if that's your thing

00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,850
and you can drive home next 10 days I

00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:45,130
will love you for it that's a really

00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:49,990
good segue to this question there's a

00:49:45,130 --> 00:49:51,490
question from Cathy SCT um yeah it's

00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:54,010
probably our last question but it's a

00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:58,020
really good one what do you need during

00:49:54,010 --> 00:50:00,610
the next two weeks dunt dunt done oh

00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:02,320
yeah that's the man meat can we address

00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:03,730
that in just a second because I really

00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:06,160
wanted to tack on to what Larry was

00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:09,940
saying before we run down that last

00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:12,280
question rabbit trail okay quickly all

00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:13,420
right 30 seconds the plugin system was

00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:15,280
designed said that it could have been

00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:17,710
included via composer and we would still

00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:20,200
really not very much like to see it done

00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:23,920
that way those of us who developed the

00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:27,130
plug-in system but that being said if

00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:29,800
you use a plug-in based approach we're

00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:32,290
working to get the annotated discovery

00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:33,490
mechanism pushed up into the component

00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:37,090
portion that we want to see out and

00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:38,619
composer so ultimately if you use a

00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:40,299
plug-in based approach

00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:42,369
it's at least a little bit more within

00:50:40,299 --> 00:50:45,430
grasp I I don't know that it's

00:50:42,369 --> 00:50:46,539
necessarily feasible yet but I think the

00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:48,460
general point of what I'm trying to say

00:50:46,539 --> 00:50:50,319
is we're sort of moving that direction

00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:53,460
whether it ever actually manifests or

00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:53,460
not is completely up for debate

00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:04,230
little previous question I guess which

00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:05,820
was why do you need help with in the

00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:07,530
next 10 days and I guess we go around

00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:09,120
quickly from initiative Lee to

00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:12,210
initiative lead and maybe mention the

00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:16,290
one thing or the one do things that you

00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:19,140
need help with um so we always need

00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:20,280
JavaScript developers to help improve

00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:24,060
the JavaScript this interpolate

00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:28,380
additionally we need people to clean up

00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:30,450
drupal cores CSS to make it leaner less

00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:32,580
used less specificity therefore we're

00:51:30,450 --> 00:51:34,200
gonna have smaller download sizes for

00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:39,720
all of the themes that we build for all

00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:43,830
of our client sites does someone else

00:51:39,720 --> 00:51:46,950
want to go well jess looks at her q me

00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:49,920
oh god uh what do i need in the next two

00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:52,920
weeks I need people to check back to the

00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:56,280
drupal initiatives date update page a

00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:58,650
lot and come to the sprint on Saturday

00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:01,020
even if you're not in Sydney please

00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:05,160
please please join us there's a lot of

00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:07,080
good to be done so come do stuff we'll

00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:10,950
send you in the right direction just get

00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:12,360
involved all right so I I just needed to

00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:15,840
check on the status of an issue because

00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:17,640
I've been here in Australia for like a

00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:20,300
week now and it's been wonderful and I

00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:22,470
haven't looked at google.org at all so

00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:25,650
uses in really good shape for future

00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:27,360
freeze um we have like one fairly small

00:52:25,650 --> 00:52:31,860
feature but that would would be good too

00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:34,260
for a lot of it you so the our last

00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:36,210
feature here it that we were going to

00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:38,190
try to get is to add an HTTP response

00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:42,690
code area handler so you could make a

00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:45,090
view or turn of 403 or a 404 or whatever

00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:46,290
and right now it had one of the points

00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:48,090
of feedback we got was right now it has

00:52:46,290 --> 00:52:49,740
the list of every single response code

00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:52,500
possible so you probably don't want I'm

00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:54,690
a teapot not in that list on so that but

00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:57,540
that's like the last the last feature

00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:58,890
that's view specific there were a few

00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:00,510
things from other initiatives we were

00:52:58,890 --> 00:53:02,190
hoping happen but most of our work now

00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:04,230
is going to be integrating with Cory

00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:06,300
api's converting views like I said um

00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:09,480
the really big thing I would say to help

00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:11,130
with is we need help getting core and

00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:13,380
ish the core issue counts down to our

00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:15,810
issue thresholds because those block

00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:18,060
features from being added so we have we

00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:19,860
have ten days left for our cute little

00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:24,480
feature for views that would be very

00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:27,390
useful I think for for a lot of sites so

00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:30,420
right now there's a nineteen critical

00:53:27,390 --> 00:53:33,150
bugs 25 critical tasks 108 major tasks

00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:35,280
104 major bugs all of those things that

00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:36,990
are over 100 for the majors and 15 for

00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,970
the criticals block views from adding

00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:41,190
our last nice feature block any other

00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:42,870
feature from being added so that's what

00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:45,060
I would ask everyone to help work on I

00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:46,770
need people to come to the sprint

00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:49,470
tomorrow which is saturday and not

00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:52,410
friday and and people who are you know

00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:54,600
watching this remotely help work on

00:53:52,410 --> 00:53:56,580
those issues do whatever you can to help

00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:58,830
us get those issues back down thrushes

00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:02,250
so that our technical debt is reasonable

00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:06,570
to add these new features in that's the

00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:10,590
cross olive core so just took mine

00:54:06,570 --> 00:54:12,180
please help us fix bugs i also i haven't

00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:13,440
been in the spark you very much for the

00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:16,470
same reason i've been enjoying myself

00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:19,020
not being on drupal at work but um spark

00:54:16,470 --> 00:54:21,090
we're currently undergoing this project

00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:23,040
to unify in place editing because right

00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:25,200
now we have like contextual links we

00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,150
have local task we have edit blah blah

00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,040
blah blah blah it's kind of a mess so we

00:54:27,150 --> 00:54:30,450
have an issue which i can get the URL

00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:33,120
and well i'll have it at the sprint

00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:35,580
tomorrow an issue where we're trying to

00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:37,200
sort of streamline all of that so taking

00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:39,480
the overlay from taking over everything

00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,490
and instead only firing it on contextual

00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:43,580
links where it makes sense to have like

00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:45,690
the extra sort of background there

00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:47,850
minimizing the look of it so it's not so

00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:49,470
overwhelming minimizing the form so when

00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:51,240
you click into contextual links to say i

00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:52,830
want to configure the block title you

00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:55,320
only see the block title in the form and

00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:58,680
not the whole thing that's undergoing

00:54:55,320 --> 00:55:00,420
usability sort of it's in a place with

00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,280
the usability team it'd be great to have

00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:03,540
some people in there commenting on the

00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,340
usability especially if you are like a

00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:07,140
Content author or this kind of a site

00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:09,270
builder type of person so we actually

00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:10,620
needs help from non-technical people to

00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:11,940
kind of give opinions on this stuff

00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:13,470
because we're sort of at a deadlock in

00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:15,390
terms of like what we believe in what

00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:18,180
the UX team or people in the US team

00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:20,970
believe on that otherwise spark just

00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:22,530
generally needs help from javascript

00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:24,450
people a lot of front-end stuff lots of

00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:25,980
stuff to do there helping out with twig

00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:26,850
would actually be great that's going to

00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:28,080
be a huge

00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:30,180
component to helping front-end

00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:32,100
developers you know we can definitely

00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:33,690
find you stuff to do but we have a tag

00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:35,270
in the issue called spark so you just

00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:40,890
look at that list and sort it by

00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:44,760
priority that's that's our hit list the

00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:47,280
rest team has one more feature that will

00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:49,500
be really nice to get in right now we

00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,020
depend on drupal's usual authentication

00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:53,690
the cookie based authentication for your

00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:57,480
rest request and it will be nice to get

00:55:53,690 --> 00:56:01,050
basic or digest authentication in so

00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:02,760
that you could make a authentication

00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:11,610
request at the same time as the your

00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:13,650
rest request yeah so we actually have

00:56:11,610 --> 00:56:16,650
the whole website fried the initiative

00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:18,960
duplicate multilingual duck or and we

00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:21,960
have a folk we have a focus issues tab

00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:24,630
on the site you go there a list visually

00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:28,050
all the issues that are neat review or

00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:30,660
needs patch or are to be committed etc

00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:32,430
and those are the focus issues that we

00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:34,350
want to work on in the upcoming two

00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:37,890
weeks and it's always up to date in life

00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:42,290
so you can check that out and see very

00:56:37,890 --> 00:56:48,540
visually what we need help I that's it

00:56:42,290 --> 00:56:50,910
Chris um so I am working very hard to

00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:54,440
get context plugins in and I think

00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:56,700
that's likely to happen tomorrow my big

00:56:54,440 --> 00:57:00,150
outstanding thing that just has to go in

00:56:56,700 --> 00:57:03,200
before the 18th is conditions and I've

00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:06,750
got the API pretty well in order and I'm

00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:09,630
working to file some user interface

00:57:06,750 --> 00:57:11,640
follow-ups to that but if people could

00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:19,620
just kind of hop in on the condition

00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:22,490
stuff that's node 1743 686 make sure I

00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:26,190
don't transpose those numbers so yeah

00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:29,580
that would be hey Chris um if you could

00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:31,350
like message me the two issues for the

00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:32,910
context plugin one in the condition plug

00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:34,980
in 1 i'll try to get people to look at

00:57:32,910 --> 00:57:37,350
them at the sprint tomorrow suddenly

00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:38,550
tell an i cannot hear you i'll tell you

00:57:37,350 --> 00:57:52,800
later

00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:54,510
okay great um Greg nan lari um I mean

00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:56,880
for the next ten days I'm in pretty good

00:57:54,510 --> 00:58:03,830
shape for feature fries I think people

00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:06,780
should help Chris Chris gabor and Chris

00:58:03,830 --> 00:58:08,490
with their stuff because they have a lot

00:58:06,780 --> 00:58:10,110
more stuff for feature freeze than I do

00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:12,600
but going forward I'm going to need

00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:14,550
after that there's still a lot of

00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:19,230
conversion of Drupal core it happen to

00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:21,180
see mi we just added a new multilingual

00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:22,920
metadata system to see mi and we're

00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:24,780
going to have to add that all four core

00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:29,130
and write it also that I'm going to need

00:58:24,780 --> 00:58:31,920
a lot of help with that and if you want

00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:33,720
to get involved in the issue queue the

00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:38,100
tag that we use for issues is

00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:40,830
configuration space system and of and

00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:42,000
you know if you're and if you're and if

00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:43,530
you're scared about getting involved

00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,150
with core you should go to jess's core

00:58:43,530 --> 00:58:50,520
mentoring hours twice a week because

00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:52,740
they're awesome thank you for that

00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:56,400
beautiful segue we're also holding on a

00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:58,650
training tomorrow for to teach people

00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:01,170
who have never maybe never contributed

00:58:58,650 --> 00:59:02,610
drupal before how to get set up with the

00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:04,140
Drupal development environment how to

00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:05,570
use the various tools the community has

00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:07,320
like the issues and so forth and

00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:09,690
concurrently with that we're also

00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:11,400
holding a core mentoring sprint so

00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:13,110
there's we have there's actually three

00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:14,970
separate things going on tomorrow in

00:59:13,110 --> 00:59:16,830
these in these two rooms and this core

00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:18,960
mentoring sprint what it is is we we

00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:23,160
find current real tasks in the cork you

00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:25,980
and we say okay this this critical issue

00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:27,210
here is 100 comments long and the issue

00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:29,670
summary doesn't really describe what's

00:59:27,210 --> 00:59:32,160
going on so what you can do is read that

00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:34,440
whole issue take an hour or two read the

00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:35,970
whole issue do some research understand

00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:38,190
the problem and then write a good clear

00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:41,940
issue summary on things like writing

00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:43,770
tests for some of these bugs so we can

00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:45,780
actually help you find something to work

00:59:43,770 --> 00:59:47,370
on and not just like say oh this is your

00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:48,390
job go work on it but they'll be mentors

00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:50,790
there who will help you through the

00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:51,930
process so yeah if you want to get

00:59:50,790 --> 00:59:54,420
involved tomorrow

00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:55,890
come here on we will meet for the core

00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:58,830
mentoring sprint meeting in this this

00:59:55,890 --> 01:00:01,080
very room on tomorrow and then we'll be

00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:05,190
going over next door to the Centennial

01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:09,240
room for the larger sprint ah 9am thank

01:00:05,190 --> 01:00:11,010
you one one quick thing to add on that

01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:12,870
like one of the things we like to do is

01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:14,250
you like to commit patches from people

01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:17,100
that have never contributed to core

01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:20,850
unlike make it you know make it make it

01:00:17,100 --> 01:00:23,070
at first tomorrow so yes it is our

01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:28,890
favorite will commit your patches live

01:00:23,070 --> 01:00:31,200
on stage so all right Larry you have

01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:36,210
anything that you need the most help

01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:39,030
with yeah there's still a number of open

01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:41,910
issues for whiskey this point not all

01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:46,730
them are features but I think the two

01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:49,710
biggest feature related pieces are the

01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:52,310
entity reference handling for the rest

01:00:49,710 --> 01:00:56,400
module which i think is kind of critical

01:00:52,310 --> 01:00:58,230
and yeah I said Lynn's got a pretty good

01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,850
layout of what the problem space there

01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:02,820
is and the kind of help she needs it's

01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:04,290
not code helped the moment it's design

01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:08,570
help figure out okay what is the right

01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:13,590
way forward here and the other major

01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:16,790
feature related piece is getting us to

01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:21,810
the point that we can be doing partial

01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:26,750
page rendering and http-based caching

01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:29,130
that's huge if we can pull it off and

01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:31,740
really really disappointing if we can't

01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:33,270
because that's a lot what the tunnel

01:01:31,740 --> 01:01:36,630
rebuilds is building building towards

01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:38,190
that and it's in sight but still you

01:01:36,630 --> 01:01:43,680
know so close yet so far so that's

01:01:38,190 --> 01:01:48,600
really a big area of focus once we pass

01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:50,270
the featured dublin as Greg said there's

01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:52,260
still a lot of conversion work to do

01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:54,570
once we see where the dust settles and

01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:57,360
what's the equivalent of a page call

01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:59,430
back is in the new model between whiskey

01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:01,260
and we're going to need an army of

01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:04,710
people to convert all the old page

01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:06,990
callbacks to that new system

01:02:04,710 --> 01:02:08,520
and we want to be able to get that done

01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:13,170
so we can take out the old routing

01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:15,089
system and you know it eliminate that

01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:17,430
duplication so that's something to need

01:02:15,089 --> 01:02:20,369
a lot of people working on it and it's

01:02:17,430 --> 01:02:22,800
also a great way to get your practice in

01:02:20,369 --> 01:02:26,130
for Drupal 8 and reporting compare

01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:29,190
models to it i think i'd like to have

01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:32,670
offended their first as it's nearly time

01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:34,470
to port drupal to Drupal 8 and that is

01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:35,880
phase one for making you know for

01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:41,070
getting yourself up speed on the api's

01:02:35,880 --> 01:02:43,020
and for I getting your controls ready so

01:02:41,070 --> 01:02:45,570
that's that's can be the next big step

01:02:43,020 --> 01:02:47,700
is trying to crowd source that process

01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:49,680
of portage will call to Drupal 8 that

01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:52,830
we've got all these new systems in place

01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:54,180
all right Thank You Larry so um we're

01:02:52,830 --> 01:02:56,430
out of time but as you can see we need a

01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:58,790
lot of help don't be afraid to get

01:02:56,430 --> 01:03:01,859
involved we can help you get involved I

01:02:58,790 --> 01:03:05,520
promise you you'll love it most of the

01:03:01,859 --> 01:03:08,480
time it's actually a very fun thing to

01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:10,950
do so before we wrap up but I'd like to

01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:12,270
give a big thank you and hopefully a

01:03:10,950 --> 01:03:15,080
round of applause for all of the people

01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:15,080
here up front because

01:03:21,799 --> 01:03:27,679
they're um they're making huge

01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:30,319
sacrifices to make this happen like

01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:31,880
they're giving up nights weekends time

01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:34,279
away from friends and family and

01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:37,309
significant others do to really build

01:03:34,279 --> 01:03:40,400
Drupal 8 which in all of you all of us

01:03:37,309 --> 01:03:41,809
and many more benefit from so if you're

01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,269
at the code spring tomorrow bring them

01:03:41,809 --> 01:03:46,069
some ice cream milkshakes whatever it

01:03:44,269 --> 01:03:47,929
takes to keep them going because the

01:03:46,069 --> 01:03:50,539
next 10 days are probably going to be a

01:03:47,929 --> 01:03:58,459
little crazy for for some of the people

01:03:50,539 --> 01:04:01,670
