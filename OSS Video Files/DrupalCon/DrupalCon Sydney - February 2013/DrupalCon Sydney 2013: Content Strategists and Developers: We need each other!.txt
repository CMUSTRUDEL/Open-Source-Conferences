Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Content Strategists and Developers: We need each other!
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	Traditionally, "content people" and developers have had little contact during a web project. They certainly haven't been seen as close collaborators.

But with the rise of content strategy as a discipline, and increasing awareness in the web industry that sites live or die by their content, that's starting to change.

In this session, a content strategist and a Drupal developer talk about how they work together to improve the author experience, establish better content workflows, and enable the creation of well-structured, adaptable content.
