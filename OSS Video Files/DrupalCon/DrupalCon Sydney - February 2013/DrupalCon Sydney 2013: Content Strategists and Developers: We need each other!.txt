Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Content Strategists and Developers: We need each other!
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	Traditionally, "content people" and developers have had little contact during a web project. They certainly haven't been seen as close collaborators.

But with the rise of content strategy as a discipline, and increasing awareness in the web industry that sites live or die by their content, that's starting to change.

In this session, a content strategist and a Drupal developer talk about how they work together to improve the author experience, establish better content workflows, and enable the creation of well-structured, adaptable content.

I feel a little bit silly giving a sort

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:06,299
of a formal presentation to a group of

00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,599
this size so what I'll do is I'll I'll

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:12,360
just run through the slides please feel

00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:16,560
free to interrupt me with read sort of

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:19,410
questions as we go and we'll also be

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,930
taking questions at the end this you'll

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,269
see there's two people's names on the

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,800
title there I'm Angus Gordon this is

00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:31,349
ricky boko this is very much a

00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:32,910
collaborative presentation in terms of

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:36,450
what it comes out of it comes out of our

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,730
work together but Ricky isn't so much

00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:40,829
into the the public speaking stuff so

00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:42,750
I'm basically going to be doing that the

00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:46,620
presentation by Ricky will be available

00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:49,410
to take questions at the end so just a

00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:52,460
little bit about us we both work for

00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:56,940
wave web communications in Melbourne

00:00:52,460 --> 00:01:01,949
we've is a small web agency in Melbourne

00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:05,189
is basically five of us and we do a lot

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:06,990
of I guess typical things that that web

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:09,780
agencies do in terms of designing and

00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:11,880
developing websites but we've also

00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,100
always had a very strong emphasis on

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,409
content and that probably started out

00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,509
Morris content writing or copywriting so

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,189
that was just a service that we used to

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,290
offer to our clients if you need a

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:24,750
website then we can write the content

00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,080
for you as well but I guess as a

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,960
client's got bigger and we started

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,360
dealing with sort of larger more complex

00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:35,579
organizations we started to realize that

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,159
just offering to write content for them

00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:40,650
wasn't really enough and what they

00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,979
really needed was help producing better

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:46,110
more effective web content themselves

00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:48,960
and that's really where content strategy

00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:52,680
came into things so content strategy

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,540
which as I'm sure you will know has been

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,820
a bit of a superbug buzzword in the web

00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,500
industry for the last few years and has

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,079
really become an important part of what

00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:03,180
we do and clients range from pretty

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,140
small clients a lot of e-commerce kind

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,929
of startups to fairly large

00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:12,260
not-for-profit organizations and about

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,800
ninety percent of the websites we build

00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,720
in

00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:21,630
in Drupal so we're very much a drupal a

00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:24,630
drupal based business my role in the

00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:27,260
agency I now call myself a Content

00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:29,550
strategist but my background is in

00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:31,920
writing and editing and the humanities

00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:34,170
so I'm not a techie at all I'm not going

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,580
to be if you have take you sort of

00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,770
development questions which is going to

00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,560
be the person to answer them Ricky is a

00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:43,950
developer Ricky actually comes from a

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,390
visual design background but over the

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:49,350
years she has more or less taught

00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:56,760
herself drupal so she's now our Drupal

00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:58,230
guru so this talk is about how how

00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,480
content strategists can work together

00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:05,160
with developers to create better

00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:07,440
websites so it really comes out of I

00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,390
guess what's changing content over the

00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,840
last few years what's changed in the web

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:15,600
over the last few years when you know

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,710
content you might not think the content

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,120
and development have a lot to do with

00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,590
each other but when we start talking

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,020
about things like structured content

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:25,440
things like reusing content or building

00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,880
content API is then content people and

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,800
development people really need to start

00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,850
talking to each other because they are

00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:33,420
going to have a really fundamental

00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:35,760
impact on on each other's jobs and on

00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,280
the ability of websites to really do

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,110
what what we want them to do just a bit

00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:43,860
of a caveat about those those terms

00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,660
content strategists and developers when

00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,640
I'm talking about content strategists I

00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,620
don't necessarily mean people who have

00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:51,209
the job title of content strategist

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,610
because there aren't really that many of

00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:55,080
them yet I'm really talking about people

00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,360
who work with content as part of their

00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,510
jobs and who think about web content

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,880
from a strategic point of view and their

00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,100
job title could be copyright or it could

00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,270
be technical writer web editor they

00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:08,970
could be internal people within

00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:12,900
organizations who have responsibility

00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,519
for web content so so really anybody who

00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,830
spends a lot of their life working with

00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,060
content a lot of what I say from a

00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:20,340
content strategy point of view will

00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,169
hopefully apply to them similarly with

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,900
developers I'm not necessarily talking

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:26,400
about how hardcore programmers I'm

00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,620
talking about people who make

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,669
websites so in the case of Drupal it's

00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,040
people who know it know their way around

00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:33,630
a Drupal installation and can add

00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,449
modules and configure things and that

00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:37,860
kind of thing so you might call them in

00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:40,110
your organization they might be called

00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:43,560
her and I could take to a site builder

00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:45,150
or a integrator or something like that

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,759
but that's what I'm talking about when I

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,530
when I talk about developers so can I

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,259
just get a bit of a sense in the room

00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:54,270
how many people here have dealing with

00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:58,590
web content as a really important part

00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:00,449
of their jobs right after this and how

00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,100
many people and you can put up your hand

00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:04,620
twice how many people would consider

00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,760
themselves to be developers or people

00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:11,220
who are involved in the technical

00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:13,260
aspects of making websites no Jeff and

00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,449
you know just just Sarah I guess I hope

00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:18,449
epic case hear of somebody who who does

00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:19,919
both so he might be able to give us some

00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:23,870
insights about how the two parts of his

00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,870
brain I'm communicate with each other

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,930
great so so r about half and half which

00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:32,610
is which is which is interesting so yet

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,680
so the perspective this comes from is

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:38,639
obviously from people who were together

00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:41,070
in a small agency but the points I'm

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,210
going to make a fairly general I'm

00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:45,300
really going to be talking about

00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:48,539
principles more than you know concrete

00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,610
suggestions so hopefully some at least

00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:55,949
some of what I say we'll we'll all sort

00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:58,740
of give you some ideas okay now i am

00:05:55,949 --> 00:06:00,240
going to just briefly at the start give

00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,710
a bit of an introduction to content

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,620
strategy i realize a lot of you will

00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:09,060
already know this stuff backwards so I

00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:10,409
will be brief but just for those of you

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,650
can't really familiar with the field of

00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:15,360
content strategy the probably the most

00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:17,370
famous definition of what content

00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,740
strategy is comes from Christina

00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,389
Halverson this was from a book called

00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,460
content strategy for the web which is

00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:26,909
kind of become more as more or less the

00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:29,280
Bible of content strategy and Christina

00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:31,169
writes that content strategy plans for

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,440
the creation publication and governance

00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:36,270
of useful usable content so I'm just

00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,650
going to go through that definition and

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,050
pick

00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,120
some of the important words so content

00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:43,130
strategy plans really what content

00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,340
strategy is fundamentally about is

00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:49,550
saying content is as important to a

00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:51,830
successful website as design or

00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:53,419
functionality so therefore we should be

00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:55,460
as careful and is rigorous about

00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:56,919
planning for content as we as we are

00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:00,350
about planning for those other things

00:06:56,919 --> 00:07:04,490
contention just be something that we ask

00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:06,350
the client for at the last minute it

00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,240
plans for the creation of contents

00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:11,690
that's about how content gets from

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:14,690
people's heads to some kind of readable

00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:17,479
form it plans for the publication of

00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,820
content so how does content get from its

00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:23,810
whatever form it's written in sort of

00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:25,729
onto the website and it plans for the

00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,919
governance of content so governance is

00:07:25,729 --> 00:07:30,169
really about who makes decisions within

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,780
an organization about content and what

00:07:30,169 --> 00:07:34,970
happens your content once it's on the

00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,740
website when does it get reviewed when

00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:40,970
does it get deleted or does it just stay

00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:44,570
there forever okay so creation

00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:46,699
publication and governance and we're

00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:50,090
talking about useful and usable content

00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:52,940
so i guess if if content strategy has a

00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:55,580
has a philosophy it's that content

00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,870
should always serve a purpose and most

00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:59,030
fundamentally it should serve a purpose

00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:01,400
for the user it should be helping the

00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,780
user to complete a task or giving the

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,460
use of some information that they need

00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:09,590
and then finally this word content it's

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,060
easy to assume that when we're talking

00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:15,050
about web content we're talking about

00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:17,060
words and you know because a lot of

00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,710
content strategists come from a sort of

00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:21,199
an editorial background or a writing

00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:24,710
background in real life that's often the

00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,349
case but but really we should be

00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:29,510
thinking about content as everything on

00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:31,580
a website that carries informational

00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,620
meaning so that obviously can be words

00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:37,870
but it can also be pictures it can be

00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:41,659
video it can be it can be audio okay um

00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:43,250
now yeah when when we give that

00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:45,170
definition of content strategy it just

00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,730
it just sounds really kind of

00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,230
highfalutin and and and really

00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:49,000
impressive we're just sitting around

00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,680
planning

00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,250
for how to just create awesome web

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:56,200
content and you know it's called content

00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,150
strategy which sounds like something

00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,130
that's some that you know something

00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:02,350
that's that's that's very sort of a high

00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,420
level in practice what content

00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,400
strategists do day to day at least if I

00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:09,130
many anything to go by isn't as

00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:12,040
glamorous as or left we tend to spend a

00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:14,140
lot of time sifting through massive

00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:16,000
spreadsheets doing things like content

00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,400
audits and essentially sort of wrangling

00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,920
content working out who owns which piece

00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,750
of content you know what needs to be not

00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:27,250
needs to be changed what needs to be

00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:29,710
deleted chasing up content that's late

00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:32,500
or like all that kind of thing so don't

00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:34,240
be misled by the word strategy content

00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,330
street content strategies as much about

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,230
really content tactics as it is about

00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:43,030
strategy in that in the sort of

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:44,560
highfalutin sense of the word okay so I

00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:46,000
just want to talk about some of that

00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,510
some of the problems that content

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,290
strategy consult somebody either either

00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:55,270
engage a Content strategist or you're

00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:58,030
going back on a content strategy process

00:09:55,270 --> 00:10:02,470
for their website this is from a website

00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:04,360
owners point of view okay our old

00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:07,480
website content is a mess we don't want

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:09,610
that to happen again content strategy

00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,350
really commonly comes out of a bad

00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:16,960
experience in the past with web content

00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:18,760
ah look I'm actually not sure I just I

00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,810
just found the picture i believe it is

00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:26,080
though yeah so people put yet people

00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:27,280
peep yeah especially big organizations

00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,360
and you've all seen and they end up with

00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,980
these websites that are just a

00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,380
hodgepodge of content you can't find

00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:37,300
anything half of the contents out of

00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:39,670
date you know their their tone invoice

00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,870
is completely inconsistent you end up

00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:42,370
having to ring them because you can't

00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:44,260
find what you need on the website so

00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,730
that's a really common kind of problem

00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,650
that people recognize you know

00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:50,500
organizations are stupid they recognize

00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:52,750
they have these problems and it's one of

00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:56,170
the drivers for them to start on a

00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:58,150
content strategy process another one

00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:59,650
that's becoming increasingly common we

00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:02,460
need to create one piece of content that

00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:05,610
works in several different places

00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:07,230
oh this is you know I'm not going to

00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,120
talk too much about this because James

00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:11,520
already covered it pretty thoroughly in

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,080
his talk today but one of the main

00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,790
drivers for content strategy is the

00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,190
recognition that our older legacy

00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:20,160
website content doesn't adapt well to a

00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:23,040
multi-device well we've got desktop

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:25,710
sites we've got life ipad apps mobile

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,960
websites you know services like

00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:30,990
Instapaper and then we've got you know

00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,700
the future with content appearing in our

00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:36,120
cars and on our fridges and on that TV

00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:39,330
isn't all the rest of it so when

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:40,320
organizations realize they need to get

00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,600
their content out to different places

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,380
that can be a really common driver for

00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,610
starting on content strategy another

00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,260
really big one we knew that we need our

00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,110
content to be smart and this is one it's

00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:54,300
very relevant to developers as well if

00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,560
an organization wants to build something

00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,990
that uses their content in an

00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,720
intelligent way like a comparison tool

00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:03,420
or a calculator or anything that really

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,910
treats content as data they need to have

00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,560
that content in a form that allows them

00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:10,940
to do that and a sort of a

00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:14,760
machine-readable intelligent consistent

00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:16,770
format and so it's our content strategy

00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:20,220
process can be about getting content

00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:22,560
from a big blob of undifferentiated text

00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:25,710
into an intelligent kind of structure

00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:30,480
that can then be manipulated in in smart

00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:34,050
ways okay another really common one we

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,750
hide our CMS okay this is one called the

00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:40,650
Ektron CMS 300 I don't know if anyone's

00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:42,360
ever is there but you know we it's

00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:44,610
obviously a horrible-looking interface

00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,680
but we recognize that that and we've

00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:52,140
already talked today about how Drupal is

00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:55,620
not exempt from this either and yeah

00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:57,030
yeah I'm just yeah I'm just looking at

00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:59,550
that that brilliant toolbar and of

00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:00,690
course anybody anybody who uses this CMS

00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,040
would have been instructed that they're

00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,620
not allowed to use at least two-thirds

00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,250
of the buttons on there too haha

00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:09,450
especially the one for changing your

00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:12,390
font no no they've never touch this so

00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:14,880
yes it's so bad you know the better bad

00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:15,430
author experience is a really common

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,080
reason

00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,610
websites have bad end up with bad

00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:22,000
content or with content that never gets

00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:23,020
updated and one of the things you know

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,550
we've heard about some of the

00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,460
improvements that are go to come in

00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:28,690
Triple H and if you're at one of the

00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,100
talks this morning you know some of

00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:32,560
those improvements are already available

00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:36,520
by our modules in in Drupal 7 which is

00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,620
fantastic but you know content strategy

00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:41,860
also has a role to play in improving the

00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:43,120
author experience because because you

00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,980
can't really improve the author

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,630
experience until you really understand

00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,360
the problems that authors have so a

00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:52,089
Content strategist can be Earl ously

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,160
eyes on between the authors and and the

00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:56,649
developers somebody who learns a lot

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,200
about what what the day-to-day life of

00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:01,209
the other CMS author is like I mean and

00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,830
you can then ensure that the developers

00:14:01,209 --> 00:14:05,020
are solving real problems rather than

00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:10,330
solving problems that may not actually

00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:14,380
exist okay and and finally I've got a

00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:16,000
big list of big list of things so and

00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,700
just reminder we going through reasons

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,020
why content strategy or sort of problems

00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,540
that content road you can solve for

00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:24,550
organizations so we need content that

00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,190
reads like it was written by a human

00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:30,070
being and for human beings but it also

00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:32,860
has to reflect our brand and convince

00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:35,890
people to buy our stuff and help them

00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:38,560
use our website and be accessible to

00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:41,670
people using assistive devices and be

00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,779
optimized for search engines so

00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:45,670
organizations tend to have a huge big

00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:47,620
list of conflicting priorities for their

00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:49,390
content and one of the roles of a

00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,430
Content strategist is to sort of sift

00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:53,410
very calmly through those priorities and

00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:56,200
work out how to balance them rather than

00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,130
letting the marketing department you

00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,600
know just make the decision that

00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,800
everything's got to be about SEO and

00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,900
that we're going to add all that we're

00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:04,000
going to just passed a huge pop ups of

00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:06,310
everything and and so on and so forth so

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,050
it's about recognizing content has to

00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:10,150
serve a number of different roles and

00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:15,190
working at the best way to balance that

00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:16,480
wants those roles okay and then some

00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,670
common problems that the content

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,810
strategy consulting make websites so

00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:21,550
there are actually problems that

00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:24,700
developers come across that the content

00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:26,410
strategy can help with as well we hate

00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:28,720
copying and pasting from word documents

00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:29,279
okay there's absolutely no reason why we

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,110
should

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,420
we'll be in this day and age had a

00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:35,670
content creation workflow where people

00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:41,430
create content in the least web friendly

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:42,810
format possible so yet so it's like so

00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:44,670
one of the things content strategy and

00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:46,709
does is work on workflow how content

00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:50,610
gets created what form it gets kind of

00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:51,930
handed over and migrated in we could do

00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,610
much more with this content if it was

00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:56,819
better structured so if you have an

00:15:53,610 --> 00:16:01,319
ambition to create the you know the

00:15:56,819 --> 00:16:03,540
awesome dashboard of amazingness but you

00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:05,550
need you need better structured sort of

00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,559
content and data to do that our content

00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:11,519
strategists can help to actually extract

00:16:07,559 --> 00:16:13,230
that from your content authors this is a

00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:15,509
big one content delays are holding up

00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:17,249
our projects for your hand up if this is

00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:19,769
a problem you that are encountered yeah

00:16:17,249 --> 00:16:21,300
so I most pretty much everybody who's

00:16:19,769 --> 00:16:22,290
ever built a website will have this

00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:25,410
problem when you've got this beautiful

00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,610
website all ready to launch the only

00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:28,889
problem is it's all filled with lorem

00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:32,759
ipsum text and you're waiting on the

00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:34,050
client to deliver the content so but I

00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,920
thinking about content right from the

00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:41,430
beginning content strategy really really

00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,629
helps you to avoid that problem and then

00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:44,550
finally we want to be able to show this

00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:49,709
site off not just now but in six months

00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:52,050
time so we we you know you hear a lot in

00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:54,420
this industry you often hear the

00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:58,170
sentence you know I call this quite

00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:59,790
ruined our website we can't enter this

00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:01,800
for an award because the tire just

00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:04,110
ripped just stack up all this horrible

00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:07,380
content in the wrong places and it just

00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:09,780
looks like well you know that's not

00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,929
necessarily the clients fault the

00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:15,089
problem is we design websites almost as

00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:16,949
a static sort of object that is launched

00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:18,059
on a specific day and we don't think

00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:20,669
about what's going to happen the day

00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:22,350
after we don't think about how the

00:17:20,669 --> 00:17:24,120
content is going to need to change and

00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:27,209
grow and have some of its going to need

00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:29,130
to to be deleted as as the clients

00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:31,710
business changes so that's one of the

00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:33,510
things that's really important that you

00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:36,510
know content strategy really really can

00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:39,090
help with it's just an example of a side

00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,840
that we built about four years ago

00:17:39,090 --> 00:17:45,340
that's that's still kind of

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:47,710
looks like a if I say so myself okay so

00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:50,289
that's my sort of whistle stop tour of

00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,909
content strategy I now want to talk

00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:55,080
about some examples where you can really

00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:58,690
see a fruitful collaboration between

00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:01,630
content strategists and developers or

00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:03,760
people who build websites the first two

00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:05,350
are going to be big kind of famous

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,669
examples the third one is going to be a

00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:11,230
smaller more small-scale example so the

00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:15,909
first website I want to talk about is is

00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:19,779
guru K people familiar with this website

00:18:15,909 --> 00:18:21,970
yeah yeah few nods yet gab dot uk' I

00:18:19,779 --> 00:18:24,309
think I think this is probably a second

00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:26,289
most amazing website in the world after

00:18:24,309 --> 00:18:28,809
Wikipedia just just from a Content point

00:18:26,289 --> 00:18:30,070
of view if you don't know if you haven't

00:18:28,809 --> 00:18:33,070
maybe you haven't looked at the site

00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:35,620
what it basically is is a site that it

00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:38,080
within the UK replaces every single

00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,970
public facing government website so if

00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,909
you want to get any kind of government

00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:45,220
related information in the UK there's

00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:46,690
now one website for you to go to unlike

00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,130
you know for example Australia where if

00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:50,320
you want tax information you go to the

00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:52,029
8000 if you want benefits information

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,210
you go to Centrelink and so on and so

00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:56,980
forth everything's on one website now

00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:58,809
it's a very impressive website from a

00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:02,710
sort of design and development point of

00:18:58,809 --> 00:19:04,210
view it's very minimal because it's

00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:06,309
about information it is very text

00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:08,110
centric but it's very beautifully laid

00:19:06,309 --> 00:19:10,029
out there's a very clear information

00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:11,710
hierarchy so you can really see they

00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:13,179
thought about user needs because on

00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,799
virtually any page you land on you'll

00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:16,630
see that the most prominent information

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:22,149
is the information that somebody's most

00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:24,010
likely to want it's responsive obviously

00:19:22,149 --> 00:19:28,690
and we've heard about this sort of that

00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:30,159
the from Jeff the mobile only uses it's

00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:31,360
obviously important government website

00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:34,240
these days needs to work on mobile

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:37,120
devices it's very fast loading you know

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:41,399
obviously handles a very vast amount of

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:43,270
data but it does it without

00:19:41,399 --> 00:19:45,010
behind-the-scenes very sort of quietly

00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:49,899
and from the users point of view it just

00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:51,580
works but but but sort of at least is

00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:53,280
impressive as the design and development

00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:57,000
of the site is the

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:59,100
content on the site what got you K has

00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,840
done is basically taken every piece of

00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:03,420
information from every other government

00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:06,780
website and rear is much in plain

00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:08,790
English in a consistent sort of voice in

00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:12,270
tone and in a well-structured kind of

00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:14,360
way so that things like related pieces

00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:17,580
of content can be and can be displayed

00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:19,380
so it's just a massive you know this is

00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:20,880
why I say it's one of the most amazing

00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,050
websites in the world because if you can

00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,940
just if you've ever worked on a

00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:25,830
government project you can just imagine

00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,050
the meet the endless meeting is that

00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,340
must have happened the endless approval

00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:31,590
process is that must have happened to

00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,060
get all this content through but imagine

00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:36,330
if they'd rolled out this very

00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:38,550
impressive design and they decided look

00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,540
it's too hard to change all this content

00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:41,100
we're just going to roll it out with

00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:44,370
legacy content from the existing

00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,500
government websites to illustrate what I

00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:50,070
mean here's a comparison between a very

00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:51,540
similar page from WK and one from the

00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,310
Australian Tax Office they're both

00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:57,560
they're both pages about sort of taxes

00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:59,490
on on company cars and you can see that

00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,650
essentially you know you would have had

00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:03,360
a had to cut out find find ways of

00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:06,720
cutting out a lot of content from that a

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,810
Geo page 2 to get it onto the gutter you

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,630
k site but really the point i want to

00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:15,300
make about this these these pages is

00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:17,130
that you know people often people often

00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,660
talk as if that's an easy process that I

00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:20,400
you know you should cut your content by

00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:22,590
half and then cut it by half again as if

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,690
that's an easy thing to do and it's true

00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:26,250
that sometimes there's a bureaucratic

00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,600
language and throat clearing and all

00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,570
those kinds of things that you can cut

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:32,400
out but sometimes it's actually about

00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:33,870
making hard decisions about information

00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,490
you're going to leave out so for

00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:38,580
instance on that ato page there's

00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:41,870
there's there's one section that that

00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:44,010
talks about the definition of a car so

00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:45,600
so you know obviously this is very

00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,460
important if you know you're driving

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,490
something with four wheels home from

00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,810
work but you're not sure if it's a car

00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:54,800
maybe you know maybe it's for people who

00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:57,090
drive ice cream vans I don't know and

00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:58,680
then there's another section that's

00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:00,390
about a special rule for emergency

00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,980
service cars okay so people who drive

00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:05,760
their fire engines or their police cars

00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:06,669
home from work now that information

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,139
isn't totally

00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:09,909
it's relevant to somebody you know you

00:22:08,139 --> 00:22:11,259
could easily construct a user Pierce

00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:12,999
owner of the person who drives an ice

00:22:11,259 --> 00:22:17,019
cream truck home from work and needs to

00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:19,629
know the definition of the car but in

00:22:17,019 --> 00:22:21,519
creating that that big of a high content

00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:24,039
somebody's somebody's actually made a

00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:26,590
decision no look at these these are

00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:29,320
really edge cases we don't having this

00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:31,480
much content on the site uses that maybe

00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:34,359
to somebody is distracting from the

00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,429
overall you know it's it's so irrelevant

00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:37,809
to the majority of users that you know

00:22:36,429 --> 00:22:39,580
we can pretty much assume that most of

00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:42,639
our users know if what they're driving

00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:44,379
is a car or not so those are those are

00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:47,169
sort of hard decisions and content

00:22:44,379 --> 00:22:48,970
strategy a common strategy process or

00:22:47,169 --> 00:22:52,659
content strategists can really help to

00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:54,399
make those decisions okay so that's got

00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:57,369
UK go and check it out if you if you

00:22:54,399 --> 00:22:58,570
haven't already the second side I want

00:22:57,369 --> 00:23:01,779
to talk about it might be a bit of a

00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:03,460
surprise and that's facebook I want to

00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:05,220
talk about Facebook because I was

00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,960
surprised myself when I learned that

00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:09,789
Facebook actually has a team of content

00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,789
strategists i have about age hold them

00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:14,769
at last count and when I heard that I

00:23:12,789 --> 00:23:16,509
thought well that's you know what do

00:23:14,769 --> 00:23:18,210
they actually do because facebook is all

00:23:16,509 --> 00:23:20,590
about user-generated content and

00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:22,989
nobody's giving me a strategy for my

00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:26,200
status updates so what what exactly what

00:23:22,989 --> 00:23:27,639
a Content strategist do at Facebook it

00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:30,460
turns out that what they do is that they

00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:33,190
actually work on the content that frames

00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:36,220
the user-generated content on Facebook

00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:38,859
so I've just got a an excerpt from an

00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:41,710
interview with one of the Facebook

00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:45,580
content strategist some a lady called

00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:46,779
Tiffany Jones Brown I'll just I'll just

00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,970
read that out because it might be a bit

00:23:46,779 --> 00:23:51,009
hard for you see so for example whenever

00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:52,720
we create a new feature like music we

00:23:51,009 --> 00:23:54,129
spend a lot of time perfecting the

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,619
stories that are produced when you use

00:23:54,129 --> 00:23:58,629
it we have to ask ourselves things like

00:23:56,619 --> 00:24:00,669
this when someone opts in to your music

00:23:58,629 --> 00:24:02,889
product and listens to a song do we

00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:04,989
publish a story about it if so what kind

00:24:02,889 --> 00:24:07,179
and how is the story written is its

00:24:04,989 --> 00:24:09,489
Tiffany James Brown listen to an album

00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:12,159
Tiffany Jones ground listen to the akan

00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:14,859
on rdio Tiffany Jones Brown listen to

00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,629
best poutine by Buick on rdio which of

00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:18,639
these pieces of data are linked later

00:24:16,629 --> 00:24:20,200
the legs go where does this story up

00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:22,029
here what happens

00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,159
and somebody likes the story can they

00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:26,200
comment on it can they share it do I get

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,779
notified about that if I'm listening on

00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,760
rdio and my friend doesn't have I do how

00:24:28,779 --> 00:24:32,470
come and listen to and these are all

00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,919
content strategy questions about framing

00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:37,630
and dealing with user-generated content

00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:41,139
and just it I mean that might sound like

00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:43,570
a lot of fairly fairly sort of trivial

00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:46,059
decisions about you know just just just

00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:48,940
about words but in fact words matter

00:24:46,059 --> 00:24:50,830
very very deeply on facebook on the

00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:53,019
kinds of interactions that people have

00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:55,570
on facebook and so just to give you an

00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:58,090
example you probably remember a few

00:24:55,570 --> 00:25:01,269
years ago when these sort of business

00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:03,250
pages were first introduced on facebook

00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:04,659
the action that a user could take to

00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:06,460
indicate that they like to the page was

00:25:04,659 --> 00:25:07,840
actually to become a fan everyone

00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:11,519
remember that you should have fan used

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:16,630
to be a fan of American Express or

00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:18,779
whoever Julia Gillard or whoever and for

00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:22,630
various reasons a couple of years into

00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:24,010
into these pages existing Facebook made

00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:26,200
the decision and it was a content

00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:29,260
strategy decision to change that

00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,909
phrasing to just the word like so now

00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:33,730
you don't become a fan of a page you

00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:36,039
just like the page and in fact we did

00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:37,899
some work recently for an organization

00:25:36,039 --> 00:25:40,960
that is like as a partner of Facebook

00:25:37,899 --> 00:25:42,909
and as part of that we were given very

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,679
strict instructions by Facebook that

00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:47,260
we're not even allowed to use the word

00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:49,510
fan anymore it's a it's of the voting

00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:55,149
word at facebook I mean everything has

00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:57,789
to be about like and one of the things

00:25:55,149 --> 00:25:59,080
that allows Facebook to do is to

00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:01,769
actually make state you know when you

00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,600
like some when you when you like a page

00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:06,850
it actually gives Facebook the power to

00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:08,710
publish the fact that you like that page

00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:13,360
and like is such an innocuous little

00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:15,730
verb that that there's actually kind of

00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,070
a slippage that takes place where where

00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:20,889
where your Facebook just just just makes

00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:23,889
these statements that that you'd like

00:26:20,889 --> 00:26:26,200
something and it almost it basically

00:26:23,889 --> 00:26:29,019
becomes an implied endorsement of that

00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,940
product or that or that company so just

00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:32,290
an example here is one of my friends who

00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:35,380
has liked the America

00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:37,480
Express page I now see an ad on facebook

00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:39,340
saying this person likes American

00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:42,600
Express Australia it's almost as if

00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:44,950
their volunteer like endorsing that page

00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:49,030
now I person I think this is completely

00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:50,680
evil but nobody ever said content

00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:52,660
strategy couldn't be used for evil side

00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,640
so it's a it's just an example of how

00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:57,520
words you know these these little

00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:00,130
changes in words actually allow facebook

00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:02,010
to roll out this this kind of you know

00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:07,060
the various but very clever

00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:09,490
functionality okay the final example i

00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,570
want to give is just our own website and

00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:13,420
i'm just giving this example because

00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:15,070
it's a very small site in a lot of ways

00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:17,620
of very modest site we don't have an app

00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:20,440
we don't have a you know we don't have

00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:22,510
an API or anything like that but the

00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:25,090
content strategies still played into the

00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:26,440
process of us building this site when we

00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:28,930
sort of redesigned our side a couple of

00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:30,790
years ago what we did was we sat down we

00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:32,440
thought about the various types of

00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,720
content that we need to produce as a web

00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:37,330
agency so things like descriptions of

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,030
services case studies our portfolio

00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:41,350
pieces and so on and so forth and we

00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,970
really did a bit of a Content modeling

00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:45,880
exercise where we thought about the

00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:50,770
structure of each of those pieces how

00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:52,840
they and how we could actually make the

00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:54,670
make the process of creating new content

00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:57,280
easier so that because you know one of

00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:59,020
the challenges that we had that I'm sure

00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,370
lots of you are familiar with this is

00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,980
keeping the slide up to date you know

00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:04,600
all our portfolio pieces of the projects

00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:07,180
we did two years ago that kind of thing

00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,320
so Hilary make is easier and what we did

00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:11,830
was we basically came up with a

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:15,250
structure using using content types in

00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:16,870
in Drupal that basically just said

00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:20,350
here's some very simple elements that we

00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:22,540
need for every portfolio portfolio piece

00:28:20,350 --> 00:28:24,160
here's a check box or that you can

00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:26,200
series the check boxes that you can

00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,690
check to say which projects are sort of

00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:31,540
related to this one he's a bit of a

00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:33,040
taxonomy about services bang we can

00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:36,370
publish that we can publish the piece

00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:37,810
it's all very simple and because we've

00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:40,930
written some rules about how its kind of

00:28:37,810 --> 00:28:42,520
structured it's very consistent in terms

00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:46,030
of the way it appears on the site and

00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:46,290
the way it's um so I saw its you know it

00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,200
makes

00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:50,460
I've easier for the designers as well

00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:52,700
and so that's just it just a very small

00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:55,230
example but I just you know I wanted to

00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:57,960
give a smaller example because it can

00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:59,220
often seem like the only examples people

00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,940
give the content strategy of these

00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:04,800
massive websites but a Content you know

00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,560
some level content strategy is is

00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:14,460
definitely applicable to any size of the

00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:17,370
site okay so okay so so this talks about

00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:19,490
collaboration so I guess that for the

00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:21,750
final section of the talk I just want to

00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:25,110
to go through some of the things that

00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:26,700
content strategists would like from my

00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:28,680
point of view from from developers and

00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,540
then some of the things that developers

00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:33,960
would like from from contents traders or

00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:36,270
content people so so here are some of

00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:39,060
the things that that I believe content

00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:41,760
strategists would would would like to

00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:44,730
say to developers and we're talking

00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:47,100
about Drupal developers specifically so

00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:50,570
talk to us about how Drupal can help us

00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:53,820
create well-structured reusable content

00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:55,440
now there are certainly some people in

00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:58,620
the content strategy community who are

00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,470
very very up on CMS's and who we all

00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:03,930
know who you know who were already know

00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:06,300
all this stuff backwards but people like

00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:08,130
me who come out more from a sort of

00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:10,590
humanities background and a writing and

00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:12,480
editing backgrounds well often what just

00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:16,200
won't be aware of what's available in

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,670
the CMS so one of the things that you

00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,380
can do if you're working with content

00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:21,690
people is just sit down with them and

00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:23,910
talk about look in Drupal we'd have

00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:26,670
these things called content types we can

00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:28,620
create whatever fields we like so you

00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:29,730
know you don't have to your content

00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,620
doesn't have to conform to a certain

00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:33,150
structure we can create new structures

00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:36,750
for your content or we have these things

00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:40,860
called taxonomy is which allow us to you

00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:42,540
know classify content etc etc and you

00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,520
know and then obviously you can talk

00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:47,790
about all all the modules all the kinds

00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:50,760
of things we've heard about today about

00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:53,700
you know how we can make content authors

00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,680
lives lives easier so my first piece of

00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,780
my first sort of requests to developers

00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,169
is to if you're working with content

00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:59,759
people

00:30:58,169 --> 00:31:05,220
talk to them about the capabilities of

00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:06,539
Drupal as a as a CMS the second thing I

00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,879
want to say is to understand that one of

00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:11,070
our roles as content people is to be an

00:31:08,879 --> 00:31:13,999
advocate for users and that that

00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:19,289
includes both end users and CMS admins

00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:21,659
so you know I often feel as if I'm just

00:31:19,289 --> 00:31:25,529
constantly bringing up usability

00:31:21,659 --> 00:31:26,879
problems with with Ricky and poor Ricky

00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:31,649
probably feels like she's playing

00:31:26,879 --> 00:31:33,450
whack-a-mole with me but and I guess I

00:31:31,649 --> 00:31:35,399
guess the thing that's important for the

00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:38,369
developers to understand is that we're

00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:40,109
not doing that to be annoying we're

00:31:38,369 --> 00:31:42,480
doing that because we really do try to

00:31:40,109 --> 00:31:46,710
see everything from from the users point

00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:48,450
of view third thing I want to say is if

00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:52,200
you can see an easier or cheaper way of

00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:55,109
doing something say so so i know that i

00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:57,389
tend to hand over to Ricky is enormously

00:31:55,109 --> 00:31:59,820
complex diagrams and ricky bahl cap will

00:31:57,389 --> 00:32:01,440
come back to me and say look you've got

00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:03,779
four content types here they could

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,970
actually all be combined into one and it

00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:09,269
would be much simpler so don't assume

00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:11,309
that because we we make at me right hand

00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:16,529
something over to you you can't improve

00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:17,820
on what we've what we've suggested and

00:32:16,529 --> 00:32:22,409
then finally tell us tell us when we're

00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:25,019
dreaming so if you've been to not only

00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:26,730
Jeff's talk today but almost any talk

00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:30,869
about content strategy within the last

00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:35,909
year or so you will have heard reference

00:32:30,869 --> 00:32:40,289
made to this are this model which is the

00:32:35,909 --> 00:32:42,590
the National Public Radio cope system

00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:44,489
which is which is a content API that was

00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:47,340
that's essentially been built by

00:32:44,489 --> 00:32:48,869
national public radio in the US it's

00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:52,259
called cope which is short for create

00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:54,179
once publish everywhere and the reason

00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:55,350
this keeps coming up in content strictly

00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:58,950
talks is because it's an absolutely

00:32:55,350 --> 00:33:00,629
awesome example of how you know

00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:02,789
structured content can allow an

00:33:00,629 --> 00:33:04,769
organization to be incredibly flexible

00:33:02,789 --> 00:33:07,440
in the way it publishes its content so

00:33:04,769 --> 00:33:10,349
this is a system that allows one piece

00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:12,090
of content to be sort of sliced and

00:33:10,349 --> 00:33:15,230
diced and reused

00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:19,049
across a vast array of websites apps

00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:20,789
platforms and so on and so forth so if

00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:22,470
you're a developer and you work with

00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:25,230
content people you're likely at some

00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:29,460
stage to hear your content person say I

00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:32,309
want one of those build me an API and

00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:36,659
its really I think your roles one of

00:33:32,309 --> 00:33:38,760
your roses the developer is to say you

00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:40,830
know calm down this is this is a

00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:44,600
ten-thousand-dollar project for a local

00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:46,980
florist they don't necessarily need this

00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:49,740
on the other hand there are some tools

00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:51,659
in Drupal that we can use to do you know

00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:55,679
I guess less complex versions of this

00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:57,390
and but but yeah so so so now one of the

00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,100
things that I guess it's Ricky's role in

00:33:57,390 --> 00:34:01,169
I repeat is one of Ricky's roles in our

00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:03,210
organization is to work out what's

00:34:01,169 --> 00:34:06,210
actually possible within within the

00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:08,909
budgetary constraints of other project

00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:11,429
whereas as a content person I tend to

00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:14,639
just dream up really big ideas and just

00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:16,889
expect them to heaven so so that's one

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,220
thing that developers I just need to be

00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:21,300
prepared to do when you have wide-eyed

00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:25,020
content people coming to you with your

00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:27,089
quests okay and then finally for

00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:29,790
developers I've got a bit of homework a

00:34:27,089 --> 00:34:31,379
couple of books to read they're both

00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:33,440
published by a book apart and they're

00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:35,580
actually both available as a as a set

00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,950
and they're very short so you can

00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:39,750
probably read them both in a day the

00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,250
first ones erin has signs the elements

00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:44,460
of content strategy which is just a very

00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:46,409
good primer on you know what content

00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,839
strategy is and what content strategists

00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:51,149
do and the second one is Karen more

00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:55,409
grains content strategy for mobile which

00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:57,540
is which is a really good read for all

00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:59,369
kinds of situations not it's not just

00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,710
relevant to mobile that's really it's

00:34:59,369 --> 00:35:04,140
really about how the mobile revolution

00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:07,410
has changed the way we think of that

00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:09,000
content second thing I'm going to

00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:11,640
suggest and not just because Jeff is

00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,030
here is to subscribe to Jeff Eaton's

00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:18,030
podcast insert content here I actually

00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:20,310
think it's sort of the best content

00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:22,589
strategy podcast that's out there and

00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:24,480
I'll be asleep for a run but Drupal

00:35:22,589 --> 00:35:25,500
people is particularly particularly

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:27,470
relevant to this coming from

00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,000
come from within the Drupal community I

00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:32,790
mean you could also give our blog I look

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,160
from time to time and if more people

00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:36,360
read it I like we might be inspired to

00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:40,440
actually update it a bit more often

00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:42,270
sorry so yeah that's that's what I'd

00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:46,170
suggest the developers who want to know

00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:47,700
a bit more about content strategy ok so

00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:51,150
now I'm going to put the shoe on the

00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:53,460
other foot and talk about what

00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:55,140
developers would like from content

00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,730
people or from content strategists

00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:58,530
obviously I'm not a developer so I'm

00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:00,480
relying a lot on what Ricky's sort of

00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:01,770
said to me over the years and those of

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:04,650
you who are developers will probably has

00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:08,460
had things to add as well but here are a

00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:11,720
few are a few suggestions and so give us

00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:15,600
clear well labeled and consistent

00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:17,910
documentation so if you want us to build

00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:21,150
something you need to be pretty specific

00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:22,860
about what you want one of the things

00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:25,770
that was a bit of a breakthrough for me

00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:27,060
with documentation was that it can it

00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:28,950
has to be clear but it doesn't

00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:32,100
necessarily have to be written in

00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:34,650
developer ease or in highly technical

00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:36,780
language and it's absolutely fine to

00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,460
hand over a piece of documentation that

00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:42,420
just states in plain language what you

00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:45,210
want what you want a system to do or a

00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:48,140
website to do it doesn't have to be

00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:50,340
written in some abstruse kind of

00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:51,570
developer friendly sort of language and

00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:54,300
it's probably better if it isn't if

00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:56,040
you're if you're not an expert in in

00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:58,290
that kind of language site so just a

00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:01,560
couple of examples is that's a bit of a

00:36:58,290 --> 00:37:04,980
a Content model and sketch and and a

00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:07,140
wireframe and I guess yet a point with

00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:09,240
others is that the labeling labeling

00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:11,300
sort of very consistent throughout and

00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:16,800
I've made sure that everything is very

00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:18,570
very sort of clear arm ok embrace and

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,770
enforce constraints this is really one

00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:22,890
of my favorite pieces of advice for

00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:24,450
writers and for content people in

00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:27,150
general there's nothing wrong with

00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:29,790
giving writers constraints Shakespeare

00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:32,820
managed to write about 150 yards sonnets

00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:35,250
each of which was exactly 14 lines long

00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:38,100
with ten syllables per line with a

00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:38,970
stress on every second seal also so you

00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,400
know constraint

00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:45,090
aren't bad for writers that can actually

00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:48,840
help produce special writing one of my

00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:53,610
favorite examples for the web is to make

00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:57,750
your page summaries or your teasers 155

00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:59,280
characters I find that 155 characters is

00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:01,520
almost the perfect length for writing a

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,540
single sentence summary of a page that

00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,190
conveys the main idea of the page

00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:07,290
without any without any fluff or

00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:09,300
unnecessary content the other thing

00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:11,100
that's great about 155 characters is

00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:15,060
that you can then reuse that summary as

00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:17,190
a meta description and you'll find that

00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:21,390
Google will publish publish it without

00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:23,640
without rampaging it so so um so yeah

00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:25,050
155 characters obviously if you wanted

00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:28,740
to use it as a tweet as well you could

00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:30,510
make go 140 but but but yeah those are

00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:33,240
those kinds of constraints I don't think

00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:39,680
we should be scared to to really enforce

00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:46,110
them with without content authors yeah

00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:50,520
that's yeah yeah yeah yeah great yeah

00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:53,010
thanks tree um so yeah constraints and

00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:57,300
obviously constraints avoid the horrors

00:38:53,010 --> 00:39:00,560
of truncated content so if I have one

00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:04,020
mission in life it's to read the web of

00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:06,390
dot dot dot at the end of a piece of

00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:08,520
content this is this is a just a site

00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:10,590
that it's a site that we're actually

00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:12,030
ready redesigning for a client but the

00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:12,990
design robbers who decided okay we're

00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:15,030
going to have this little space for

00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:16,920
testimonials we're going to ask the

00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:18,810
client for testimonials the client

00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:21,840
provides testimonials for about you know

00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:23,250
I'm 500 words long each oh okay well

00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,170
that's not going to they're not going to

00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:26,730
fit in that space so we're just going to

00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:30,390
truncate them it's an absolutely

00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:33,390
horrible armed solution so so by

00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:34,680
enforcing constraints by saying by all

00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:36,360
means have your long testimony on a

00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:39,530
separate page but we also need a version

00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:45,720
that's this long to fit in this space

00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:47,820
you avoid that problem okay um fine and

00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,320
and just to remind we talking about

00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:51,390
things that developers would like to

00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,480
tell content people understand that your

00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,160
big ideas aren't as

00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,800
for us to implement as they offer you to

00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,109
dream up just because we say we want the

00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,280
native dashboard of Awesomeness doesn't

00:39:59,109 --> 00:40:05,050
necessarily mean it's going to happen

00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:10,060
overnight oh yeah ideas tape take time

00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:12,460
to implement and finally help the client

00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:15,340
supply content in an HTML friendly

00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:17,650
format and Microsoft Word is not an HTML

00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:19,210
friendly format now there are not a

00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:21,010
number of tools out there that are

00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:24,640
helping people to do this has anybody

00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:26,380
else use gather content yeah we really

00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,270
like it it's it's a it's a relatively

00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:30,570
new it's a web app so it's something you

00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:32,500
know software-as-a-service kind of

00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:34,090
system similar to something like base

00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:38,140
care but it's actually for collecting

00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:39,760
web content it's relatively new so

00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,740
they're still ironing out some bugs but

00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:44,380
we found it really useful it allows you

00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:46,540
to obviously structure it's almost like

00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:48,970
a mini mini little CMS that allows you

00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:50,740
to structure a project as the website

00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:52,119
will be structured and what's really

00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,530
great about it is it also allows you to

00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:57,010
structure the individual pieces of

00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:59,020
content so individual pages so you don't

00:40:57,010 --> 00:41:00,850
have to you're not asking for just

00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,859
you're not just giving people a big

00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:04,060
blank box where they put the body of the

00:41:02,859 --> 00:41:05,350
content you're actually asked you can

00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:08,530
ask them for each individual component

00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:09,550
that you want for each each page and the

00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:11,380
other thing that's great about it is

00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:15,270
that it produces if you hit the source

00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:18,520
button it will spit out really nice well

00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:21,040
well marked I page HTML they're also

00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,810
working apparently on a an integration

00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,490
with Drupal which or later migrated

00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:28,180
directly from the other content to

00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:30,190
dribble so I'd recommend that you check

00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:34,350
that one out but yet most important

00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:38,500
thing is to encourage your content such

00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:40,780
your content people to try to introduce

00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:43,240
work flow where content doesn't arrive

00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:45,670
in in Microsoft Word because that's just

00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,440
it's just nasty and there's no reason

00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:51,190
why we should be still be still be doing

00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:55,570
that okay and a bit of homework for

00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:57,550
content people learn our channel I think

00:41:55,570 --> 00:42:00,670
I think if you're writing content for

00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:03,970
the web and these days that pretty much

00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:05,550
means if you're writing content you

00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:08,280
really should be learning

00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:11,310
less the basics of HTML I'm probably

00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,840
preaching to the choir here but and so

00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:14,820
it's amazing how many content authors

00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:20,970
are still scared to hit that new source

00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:22,890
button in the CMS and and really you

00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:25,860
know with with with HTML being the way

00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:28,200
that or the you know the principles of

00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:29,580
HTML and the principles of markup are

00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:33,120
really the way that all content is going

00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:35,460
to be structured you know eep even even

00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:39,360
the ePub format for e-books is based on

00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:41,820
HTML and the more so you know the reason

00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:44,370
why I say this is that a Content

00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:46,440
somebody who's who's updating the

00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:48,840
content on a website should at least be

00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:50,760
able to go in and fix a display a

00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,680
problem with a link or something like

00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,870
that that can't be fixed in the WYSIWYG

00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:57,120
editor they should at least be able to

00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:58,950
look at a piece of markup and understand

00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,120
what it what it means and they should

00:42:58,950 --> 00:43:05,540
understand the relationship between

00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:07,890
things like headings as a tag and and

00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:10,320
you know what what a heading means sort

00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:11,880
of semantically but then what what a

00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:15,660
hitting you know how having sort of

00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:18,480
appears on on a page so I would you know

00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:20,700
if I had my way I would force all

00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,400
writers to to learn HTML to me as as

00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:24,960
fundamental as knowing how to type and

00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,350
then once you've done that I think a bit

00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,700
of basic CSS helps as well that just

00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:32,220
helps and I'm not saying writers should

00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:35,460
be right should be constructing you know

00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:38,010
vast complex style sheets but you should

00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:40,380
let us know how CSS works and you should

00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:43,140
be able to understand how a style sheet

00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:44,820
changes the way that elements that are

00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:48,780
marked I've in a certain way will appear

00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:50,520
on a page and yeah I'll just listed code

00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:52,890
Academy there that's so just a site

00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:55,230
where you get a fairly fun way you can

00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:57,990
do sort of free tutorials on things like

00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:59,700
HTML and CSS n and more advanced kinds

00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:01,200
of coding as well so if you have any

00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,210
content authors in your life it would

00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:05,340
like to learn HTML and you don't want to

00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:08,220
teach them yourself I am just direct

00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:09,690
them to code Academy and the second

00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:10,920
thing that I think sorry the last thing

00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,510
that I think content people should be

00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,550
doing is learning more about their own

00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:16,290
CMS's and obviously this is something

00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:19,410
that we're all already doing by being at

00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:22,200
this conference but we're moving into a

00:44:19,410 --> 00:44:24,270
all we're thought where you know content

00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,579
and technology are sort of moving closer

00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:28,730
closer together and the more we

00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:32,210
understand about what each other does

00:44:28,730 --> 00:44:35,460
the better the results are going to be

00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:37,530
so just a just to just to finish with I

00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,730
mean you know these might be kind of

00:44:37,530 --> 00:44:40,619
motherhood statements but I just got a

00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:42,660
few set of keys things that we've we've

00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:44,760
sort of found a keys to two working

00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:46,349
together successfully start talking to

00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,869
each other early in the project that's a

00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:50,039
really really important one obviously

00:44:48,869 --> 00:44:51,359
that's going to depend on how the

00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:54,329
projects actually set up in the first

00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:56,309
place but if you possibly can get the

00:44:54,329 --> 00:44:57,480
content person and the developer sort of

00:44:56,309 --> 00:44:59,670
talking to at least have a conversation

00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:01,140
earlier in the project about what kinds

00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:04,859
of things you might want to do live

00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:06,569
content on the site so that you can

00:45:04,859 --> 00:45:09,960
actually plan with more more set of

00:45:06,569 --> 00:45:12,150
knowledge learn about each other's jobs

00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,770
and an obviously educate each other

00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:15,420
about your jobs that's that's that's

00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:18,119
pretty pretty obvious we've already

00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:23,190
talked about that don't be territorial

00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:25,260
so I know when you know I think content

00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:28,410
modeling is a good example of this when

00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:30,270
when developers hear about content

00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:31,170
modeling I think it would be easier for

00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,369
a developer to think well that's

00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:33,839
something I already do you know I

00:45:32,369 --> 00:45:36,000
already do all this configuration of

00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:37,559
content types in Drupal so why do I need

00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,730
a content person to come in and do my

00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:43,950
job for me the you know really the point

00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:45,930
of that content modeling is that it

00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:48,960
isn't isn't who does it it's that it

00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:51,000
gets done at all and if a content the

00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:53,609
content person person can actually help

00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,930
you to understand how the user is going

00:45:53,609 --> 00:45:59,760
to be sort of using the content on the

00:45:54,930 --> 00:46:01,319
website then then it's ultimately going

00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,710
to help you when you went come to do

00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:09,450
that sort of configuration so don't you

00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:10,799
know you know try not to try not to take

00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:12,299
things personally when people do things

00:46:10,799 --> 00:46:13,770
that you might see it's sort of part of

00:46:12,299 --> 00:46:15,869
your job and then finally the

00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:17,190
evangelists for each other so I think

00:46:15,869 --> 00:46:19,309
especially when you're working within an

00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:21,210
agency it's really important to

00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:24,089
understand enough about what each other

00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:25,770
does that you don't undermine each

00:46:24,089 --> 00:46:29,790
other's point of view when you're when

00:46:25,770 --> 00:46:32,130
you're talking to clients so

00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:35,160
yes oh so that's pretty much what I've

00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:40,760
got for today so thank you very much for

00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:43,860
coming small crowd but a good crowd and

00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:46,110
yeah Ricky we're actually going to

00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:48,780
switch mics so that Ricky can take

00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:50,520
questions as well so we'd like to hear

00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:54,000
if you have any questions but also hear

00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:57,680
a bit about cooperation and anything

00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,680
that you found his s worked for you

00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:26,020
it's a very good question it is

00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:29,700
something sorry I'll repeat the question

00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:32,170
as an agency to our clients come to us

00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:34,540
with you I already with the idea that

00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:36,310
they need help with their content or is

00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:39,940
it something that we have to sell them

00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:42,400
on it's a bit of both I certainly people

00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:44,800
who approach us because we because of

00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:48,910
their I guess our expertise with with

00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,650
content we pretty much don't we pretty

00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:53,950
much won't write a proposal for a client

00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:57,880
that doesn't include at least some work

00:47:53,950 --> 00:48:01,240
on content even if it's just working on

00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,770
a positioning statement or working on

00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:06,190
sort of key messages for the site or

00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:07,960
something something like that we and and

00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:10,680
and and really I guess we have a we have

00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,730
a workflow where content is a key part

00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,860
part of it whether it's us that's

00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:16,840
working on the content or the client so

00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:20,790
we don't start design without at least

00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:23,050
some some sort of content in place and

00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:25,180
you know clients alike I guess Collins

00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:26,530
will often realize you know when you had

00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:28,270
that kind of process in place clients

00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:29,470
will often realize that they need help

00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:31,810
with content even if they didn't

00:48:29,470 --> 00:48:33,640
initially think they did but it's on I

00:48:31,810 --> 00:48:35,500
went lights it's a struggle for us to

00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:38,220
sell content services as much as it is

00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,220
for anyone else I think

00:48:56,130 --> 00:49:02,160
uh that that depends ideally yes ideally

00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,440
yes we would have an ongoing so I will

00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:05,850
repeat the question once we've launched

00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:09,360
the site do we then leave it to the

00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:11,280
client to to keep it updated and to to

00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:15,410
make changes or do we I guess

00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:19,440
proactively proactively remind them or

00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:21,060
review this review the site we certainly

00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,880
i guess like most web urgencies we

00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:26,190
always try to sell clients on an ongoing

00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,750
support package and if we've done

00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:31,220
content work with them that would always

00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:33,750
include that kind of content review

00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:37,920
realistically we have is we have sites

00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:40,170
where clients just don't want to make

00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:43,890
that ongoing commitment and they you

00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:45,660
know you know we we're not perfectly as

00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:48,840
many souls as anyone else where where

00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:51,180
the clients just done just let the left

00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:54,630
side to sort of lie lie fallow but we

00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:56,130
definitely make an effort to to

00:49:54,630 --> 00:50:00,770
encourage it hard to think of content as

00:49:56,130 --> 00:50:00,770
an ongoing and ongoing process

00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:10,510
hmm

00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:39,940
absolutely actually do can I give you

00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:41,560
the mic so you can repeat that so so

00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:43,690
it's a comment rather than a question

00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:45,040
just talking about content strategy and

00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:47,470
the way that the subtleties of these

00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:49,390
things can happen if you click on the

00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:52,330
link that says in a relationship between

00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:54,670
two people on Facebook it will take you

00:50:52,330 --> 00:50:57,040
to a page there's automatically created

00:50:54,670 --> 00:50:58,870
by facebook for every piece of content

00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,060
that those two people have written about

00:50:58,870 --> 00:51:03,100
each other or tagged each other in or

00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:06,130
written to each other on each other's

00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:08,290
walls so that somewhere along the line

00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:09,640
someone you know and I think it's

00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:12,070
somewhere in the last year that became a

00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:13,060
link instead of just a word and that's

00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:14,830
the kind of thing that a Content

00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,940
strategist at Facebook would have been

00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:18,640
working on of saying how can we improve

00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:24,310
that I also find that kind of creepy and

00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:27,280
stalkerish but you know I almost almost

00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:29,020
feel like we need to call face what

00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,450
Facebook does black hat content strategy

00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:37,510
or something because a lot of it is

00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:38,950
pretty pretty pretty creepy but anyone

00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:42,150
got a question for Ricky I want to make

00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:42,150
Ricky us answer a question

00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:53,970
I haven't haven't looked at any of them

00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:55,890
no sorry the question was do i do I

00:51:53,970 --> 00:51:59,520
write any of the content audit modules

00:51:55,890 --> 00:52:03,210
um and no I haven't because Angus does

00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:14,640
the content audit for me I don't do that

00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:22,280
yeah and we've worked together for four

00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:22,280
years yeah um started yeah

00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:32,609
yeah well I can say that since I've

00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:34,950
learnt more about content strategy

00:52:32,609 --> 00:52:37,050
through Angus I've been able to make

00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:40,140
certain decisions in a build on my own

00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:43,589
and they've sort of sped up my process

00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:46,490
and met anguses approval as well so it

00:52:43,589 --> 00:52:46,490
helps yeah

00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:26,369
so the question was what's what wysiwyg

00:53:25,049 --> 00:53:31,079
editor would we recommend for someone

00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:34,170
that likes using Microsoft Word we reuse

00:53:31,079 --> 00:53:36,140
ckeditor and we find that pasting in I

00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:38,720
mean I always tell them to paste it in

00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:41,700
select it all and hit the eraser I'm

00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:43,380
just in case and then that seems to work

00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:49,470
fine for people pasting in from work

00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:50,910
yeah probably i guess we probably

00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:55,410
haven't worked with projects that has

00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:58,440
such a massive amount of of content

00:53:55,410 --> 00:54:02,069
migration from word that that it would

00:53:58,440 --> 00:54:03,869
be might start that sentence again most

00:54:02,069 --> 00:54:05,249
of our projects are small to

00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:06,990
medium-sized enough that it's actually

00:54:05,249 --> 00:54:08,249
realistic to tell a client that if you

00:54:06,990 --> 00:54:10,559
if you have to write your content in

00:54:08,249 --> 00:54:14,819
word just paste it in as plain text and

00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:16,920
do the formatting in the cns so we we

00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:19,829
probably don't have a good a good answer

00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,509
to that about you know if there's a way

00:54:19,829 --> 00:54:23,849
of actually automating the process but

00:54:21,509 --> 00:54:27,690
as i said i'd much rather encourage

00:54:23,849 --> 00:54:29,069
people to write you know to use

00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:32,029
something other than word to write the

00:54:29,069 --> 00:54:32,029
content in the first place

00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:49,040
you

00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:16,240
ah it's a very interesting question no

00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:18,040
we don't we don't have a luxury of doing

00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:20,589
one you know be great if we had the

00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:22,240
luxury of doing one project at a time we

00:55:20,589 --> 00:55:24,460
were always doing multiple projects at a

00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:25,660
time and I guess we know we've got one

00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:28,270
contents treasures we've also only got

00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:31,300
one developer so if anything it's even

00:55:28,270 --> 00:55:34,420
more about I guess that's something

00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:36,010
where yeah yeah I guess that's something

00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:40,349
where we're still whistle growing as a

00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:44,530
business and we we manage as best we can

00:55:40,349 --> 00:55:45,730
but we can certainly see a time in the

00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:47,800
not too distant future where we're going

00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:54,970
to need to do a lot more bringing in an

00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:56,109
outside resources yeah sorry for the

00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:57,940
piston at the paper question was about

00:55:56,109 --> 00:55:59,619
your probably gather the question was

00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:08,190
about how we manage to do lots of things

00:55:59,619 --> 00:56:08,190
at once you Oh further according sorry

00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:18,089
