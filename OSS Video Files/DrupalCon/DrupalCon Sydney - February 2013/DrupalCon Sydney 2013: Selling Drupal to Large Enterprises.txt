Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Selling Drupal to Large Enterprises
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	In many large enterprises, Drupal is becoming a bigger threat to legacy enterprise content management systems. When approaching these enterprises to suggest Drupal projects, development teams often face an unfair fight. In one corner are the large, enterprise CMS players and their dedicated, expensive, powerful selling teams, and in the other corner is the development team shouting over the noise to promote the benefits of Drupal.

The proprietary CMS players have their arguments fully mapped out. On the other hand, Drupal developers are unique in their view of content as a strategic asset, and by promoting how the team helps clients optimize their content into digital marketing strategy shared by marketing and IT, this argument can put Drupal ahead of the pack.

However, not every battle has a winning outcome. There is no silver bullet and not every enterprise will be willing to rise above the legacy CMS noise. A development team must know when current Drupal limitations will keep a specific enterprise from achieving its goals and move along to another company whose project can benefit from Drupal and the support of its growing community.

In this session, I'll share experiences as part of a Drupal Sales Engineering Team. I'll discuss how Drupal can help optimize a client's digital marketing strategy, arguments against Drupal that development teams can expect to hear, points development teams can highlight as they promote Drupal to new customers and how to know when the team should cut their losses and move on to another company that will profit from Drupal's benefits.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,290
this is a segue to a session that I did

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:07,470
in Munich drapeau communic back in

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,660
august i did some updates based on two

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,389
cases that i had a chance to work after

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,830
that so that's when I put together I

00:00:12,389 --> 00:00:16,590
wanted to really share my experience

00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,480
around working with such organizations

00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:21,480
and selling Drupal to them in delivering

00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,550
Drupal to two large organizations but as

00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,730
I went through those two new case last

00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,380
year last six months and also talking to

00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,529
people today yesterday throughout the

00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:33,000
conference I am changing the tone a

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:36,510
little bit of this presentation to

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,610
assess where I think we're comfortable

00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,920
comfortable around Drupal enlarge the

00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,450
price looks like into some case

00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,270
enterprise are coming and asking for

00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,070
Drupal and I've seen a few and talking

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,620
to some people I noticed that is

00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:52,500
happening here too but I think that's

00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:55,890
the most important time now that we

00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,350
don't let all regards lower so it should

00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,149
be prepared for the competition that is

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,969
going to come harder the proprietary

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,500
masses and continue to sell Drupal our

00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:06,479
enterprise the way we've been doing the

00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,070
past five years right so I think that's

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,380
the TP moment where we should not lower

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,479
our guards around that so hopefully we

00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,220
can get the momentum going and continue

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,220
to increase Drupal into large enterprise

00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,650
so mark introduce myself just a little

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,970
bit more so chief architect with CIT we

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,729
work with dhruva port for the past

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:31,590
almost five years now especially in

00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:32,790
cases involving digital marketing which

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:34,860
I'm going to be elaborate a little bit

00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,479
more what's that about so that means I

00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,520
haven't worked so much with the

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,170
government area but for large

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,750
organizations commercial organizations

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,090
and focusing on the final business the

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,380
digital marketing website so I lead a

00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:52,680
team of priests pre-sales engineers and

00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:54,420
some contact details later what I wanted

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,640
to do basically to share some details

00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:59,579
about the case and scenarios that I have

00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:04,290
worked in terms of presale for large

00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:06,119
enterprises and then encourage you to

00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,280
especially the ones that are really

00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,200
shops or agencies that are really eager

00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,220
or already doing selling to our

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:15,890
enterprise to building strong say

00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,780
team around drupal right so i will talk

00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,820
about being transparent one doing that

00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,160
with drupal what strengths and weakness

00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:25,280
so your whole sales team needs to be

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,500
aware of that it's important to know

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,060
what the competition is doing so like

00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,860
ice in the beginning there's a momentum

00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,590
first group was really getting hard or

00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,510
getting a bigger in our surprises so you

00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,760
would expect competitors would go after

00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:39,350
us so I wanted to share things that I've

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,010
seen happen in terms of what the

00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:44,420
competition is doing against Drupal and

00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,730
some things that are more pre-sales

00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,280
one-on-one and and how we can do the

00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:52,850
basic the basic think Rosselli and and

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,430
musically community for that a quick

00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,080
check who is actually selling Drupal or

00:02:55,430 --> 00:03:00,830
working as a sharp organization for

00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:05,660
Drupal okay and is there anyone like

00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:07,250
buying Drupal or okay and who is

00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:10,100
actually selling two large enterprise or

00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:12,440
had some experience okay that'd be great

00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,240
just to hear you guys throughout the

00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,470
presentation in the end i'll be your to

00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:20,480
to hear your experience as well

00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:22,610
throughout the presentation so i don't

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,380
think i have the audio but i think my

00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:27,830
point is basically this i don't know

00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:29,840
this is a BBC video and i just wanted

00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:35,209
two children through so it's basically a

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:39,680
fox and you can find in youtube just

00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:41,950
give it a second without this much

00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,950
better

00:03:52,260 --> 00:04:05,140
and it gets the mouth so what's the

00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:07,239
analogy here right like I said we're

00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:10,599
seeing droop Enterprise coming to us and

00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:13,239
talking about Drupal but uh but I still

00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,829
think we should spend energy and

00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:17,650
investment on keeping the sales force

00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:19,989
our sales team prepared for for what

00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:22,930
could be something like the proprietary

00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:24,580
companies trying to make us be back and

00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:27,370
be the mouse and then they will become

00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,680
the fox which so we don't want to be at

00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:31,930
that level right who want to be the fox

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:34,120
instead of the mouth so that's my

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:35,919
provocation here today so hopefully we

00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,180
can get out of this session with this

00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:42,250
mindset a little bit of context so make

00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,260
things easier for for you guys what I've

00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,810
been doing my company so CNT like marks

00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:51,310
at a brazilian company but we have a

00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:54,039
global delivery process at global

00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:58,690
delivery centers in Brazil Argentina in

00:04:54,039 --> 00:05:01,210
China we have offices in US Japan Europe

00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,949
and with my move to Australia that's

00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:06,520
we're going to be starting a Australia

00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:10,260
office as well we are about 1600 people

00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:13,330
we don't only do drupal but we have

00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:16,300
about 350 talents in Drupal so that's

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:18,130
almost a third little bit glass of

00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,289
Drupal develops so that means a lot

00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:25,150
we've been doing Drupal big part of our

00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:28,180
revenues coming from Drupal we've built

00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:30,820
a wee bit about 400 for any 50 website

00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:33,310
to a couple organizations going to be

00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:38,349
speaking about and support those sites

00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:40,630
too so those cases unfortunately I

00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:43,840
cannot share the names of the companies

00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:45,580
I'm sure you guys understand but its you

00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,310
might get it throughout the presentation

00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:51,970
where I don't know but we'll be working

00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:56,380
with chu global fortune 100 from a

00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:58,120
silicon Enterprise one Brazilian butt is

00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,830
more latin america cosmetics

00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:01,490
organization

00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,270
chose Drupal with our help last year

00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,570
there was another one that I

00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:08,280
participated last year in US which is

00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:10,860
also a globe organization in terms of

00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,900
nutritional product and also Japan a

00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,150
branch of a global technology research

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,460
media companies for carnival analysts

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:20,250
that are using Drupal to analyse company

00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:24,180
so my experience my complex piece come

00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:26,220
from from those cases and basically what

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,110
did they have in common or or do still

00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,210
have some things in common when they

00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,820
felt like they should switch gears and

00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:36,270
move what they had is if was even if it

00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:39,840
was a CMS or just custom cold dark

00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:42,200
matter just Java guess to some extent

00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,490
they do share some commonalities are

00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:48,240
regulated markets especially the form a

00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:50,310
circle ones highly in that case I almost

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,050
all of them they had a presence

00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:54,210
pulverized across different technology

00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,310
platforms across the globe so it was

00:06:54,210 --> 00:07:00,060
really hard to maintain that technology

00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:02,070
forum also localization was a key part

00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,070
of the requirement for those

00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:06,990
organizations some of them when I got

00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,150
there they had the proprietary model in

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:11,730
mind only so all the open source was

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,410
really something that would scare to

00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:16,590
begin with so several questions would

00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:18,690
come around that from the business side

00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:21,660
though there was the complain about this

00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:23,910
low time to market so using either coast

00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,770
custom code or using proprietary CMS

00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:28,020
either way they will take a lot of time

00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:30,060
to implement new features or to

00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,610
customize what the business or the

00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,160
marketing teams they needed so the idea

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:39,410
they always complain about that and of

00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,410
course a push for for cost reduction

00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:47,310
well that's two part of yeah that's part

00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:49,830
of it but one of the organization's they

00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,540
really said well if wasn't for for

00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:53,490
Drupal we will be able to launch his

00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,650
website in a couple months I just

00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,940
leveraging the modules so that's the key

00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:59,370
part they would just go to proprietary

00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:01,800
and ask well can we build this or can

00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,210
get a package either they have to pay

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,580
for that package in the proprietary one

00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:09,090
or building their own and it's in that

00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:10,920
case was Java and it could have

00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:12,100
difference around which vendor they used

00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,410
would take more time to

00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,030
that crystal package but in a way they

00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:18,190
felt the difference between opal and

00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:20,620
they felt it was easier to go to the

00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:21,790
market with new features for example one

00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,010
particular case was around the

00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:25,510
integration with google plus so you can

00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:27,370
just get the module there was already

00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:29,230
there by the time was launched at

00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:31,000
integration right with Google+ so that a

00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:33,729
couple weeks after Google+ was launched

00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,490
update i think a beta phase someone

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:38,710
build a model for Google+ just a couple

00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,060
weeks can start using that so in a

00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:43,000
proprietary one maybe you'd still have

00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:49,030
to ask them to build the package for or

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:52,150
the library for that so with all those

00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:54,430
things combined they all came to a point

00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:58,510
where they had to make a decision as an

00:08:54,430 --> 00:09:00,790
IT group which the competitors would go

00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,740
straight ahead and pass them under their

00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:05,050
markets so they had some challenge so

00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:07,300
whether we stay behind or we do things

00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:10,090
and change and and try to get ahead

00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:16,930
again and they all ended up using Drupal

00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:18,970
for that another poll so please talk a

00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:22,930
little bit i think i have some backup

00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:24,550
boundaries this week but is there anyone

00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:27,420
that thinks that Drupal or the

00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:32,560
enterprise is not important for Drupal

00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:35,080
ok so i guess that propagate or my

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,660
question comes from some people that I

00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:40,240
talk to it's either they want to stay

00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,950
with the blogging world just or with a

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,590
mass market and not worry so much about

00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:47,140
enterprise not spend building modules

00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:48,310
are concerned about security and all the

00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,860
things that Enterprise consider

00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:53,560
important and keep the things keep

00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:57,490
things around simple or small medium

00:09:53,560 --> 00:10:00,040
SMBs I i think is very important I

00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,470
myself my company we've learned a lot

00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,800
work with enterprise and drupal and be

00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:07,240
able to respond to their challenge when

00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,310
it comes to all the challenge Jordan

00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,220
show the requirements that they have any

00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:14,170
proving Drupal platform as well so i

00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,640
think is important for us to keep going

00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,800
like jerry said in the keynote like i

00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,200
said it helped me with my presentation

00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,930
so eventually get to the airport to to

00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:24,820
amazon so it should really be aiming

00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,350
high to get those guys and i think we

00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,910
should

00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:33,420
we should always spend or make

00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:35,670
investments toward that so it's me a

00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,320
long time now that group group was part

00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,870
of the global enterprise level is not a

00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,420
little bit news but I like us in the

00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:46,350
beginning I think we should be prepared

00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:48,750
for that as a sales team the two cases

00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:51,720
that are there are we parked last year

00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:53,090
they came really strong against Drupal

00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,770
with arguments I'm going to be

00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:57,960
elaborating a little bit more so they

00:10:55,770 --> 00:11:00,540
they really have a very well prepared

00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:03,450
sales team they have demos very well

00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:06,000
prepared for for for those organizations

00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:10,100
they have certified sales team they have

00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:12,660
all these are ammunition ammunition of

00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,910
artifacts or assets that can just come

00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,550
and try to convince organization to use

00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:20,000
and we well we're big community almost a

00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:22,590
million developers according to to do

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,860
but still when it comes to sales and

00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:27,750
even marketing we kind of try to do the

00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,580
job ourselves but on our own right

00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,840
there's no centralized I'll do a few

00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:34,320
things but there are no centralized

00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:36,930
effort in terms of marketing and selling

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,600
Drupal so I think that's something that

00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:42,030
we should be focusing on this year next

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,710
couple years because what we've been

00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:46,230
working so far might not work in the

00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:47,970
past remember jury is talking about web

00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,810
experience management right so that's a

00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:54,240
new thinking the market but also being

00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:57,960
funded by those proprietary enterprises

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,820
appropriate SMS to try to bring

00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:03,450
everything into one product and that

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:04,950
will go against or would go to some

00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:07,470
extent against what drew way is right

00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:09,750
you will have to combine products and so

00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:11,460
adobe aside core Oracle they are out

00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:13,110
putting together acquiring companies

00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:15,420
they put together several products and

00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:17,250
trying to convince organizations which

00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:19,140
is with this new approach web experience

00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,210
management right so while it's not

00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,620
working the way we used to sell Drupal

00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:24,990
to those organizations artwork is not

00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:28,290
that easy anymore and it could be unfair

00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:31,020
sometimes like I said so I think we

00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:33,270
should try and and span our energy on

00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,920
that area to not only development not

00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:37,890
only support but really think about

00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,850
marketing in sales and that's where I

00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:42,779
wanted to spend

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:45,300
a few time a few spent some time of that

00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:47,819
which is basically shreds look at the

00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:51,569
competitors are doing and training your

00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:53,370
sales team the first thing is about

00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:57,930
Drupal strength and weakness at the

00:12:53,370 --> 00:13:00,149
enterprise level so i think is key for

00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:02,160
us especially if you have not worked

00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:03,540
with enterprise before understand what

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,649
are the difference between SMB and

00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,480
enterprise we're at the type of

00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:09,839
requirements that you might be faced

00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:14,250
with when it comes to to participating

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,630
in a bid for an enterprise there is some

00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,370
debate about what could be a large

00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:19,829
enterprise to to the purpose of this

00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:21,660
session I'm going to be defining some

00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:24,569
requirements that some to some extent

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:28,079
again my match some of the cases that

00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:29,790
you guys have at least we we know what

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,310
is not so it's definitely not the small

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:34,500
shops that are just looking for a simple

00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:35,579
side at least we know what is not but

00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,880
sometimes there's some confusion about

00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:40,350
what what's a large the prize right we

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,199
have some pub TKS that I want to share

00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:47,250
just to illustrate and plus the ones

00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:50,220
that I cannot share but on basically

00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:52,980
what is involved so proprietary software

00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,529
model might set right so that's monkey

00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:57,240
thing that I we as a sales force thing

00:13:55,529 --> 00:14:00,180
or Drupal sales team gotta be prepared

00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,100
we might be facing that there are

00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:03,449
several ceased integration points so

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,819
it's you're not just talking about a

00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:07,560
simple website data it's going to be out

00:14:05,819 --> 00:14:09,389
there and not communicating with

00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,459
different systems right there's much

00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:13,139
more involved you've got to be prepared

00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:16,560
to answer questions about integration

00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:18,420
with CRMs and different components we

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:22,079
might be talking about fortune 500

00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:24,540
companies that are that are global the

00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:29,069
presence is global they are in the

00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:30,810
revenues of more than 45 billion dollars

00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:32,130
a year so that's the type of

00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:35,130
organization shall be talking about

00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:37,019
today they don't have just one major

00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:39,420
website I'll talking about dozens or

00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:41,430
even hundreds websites the true pharma

00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:45,000
companies they are really only hundreds

00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:46,880
of website round I wasn't the other

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,559
presentation about migrating large-scale

00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,389
Drupal so several groups involved to

00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,939
dimension about that too so you're not

00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:55,029
dealing

00:14:51,939 --> 00:14:57,609
just one single product owner although

00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:59,529
sometimes you get that lucky but still

00:14:57,609 --> 00:15:01,509
there's too many groups evolved to make

00:14:59,529 --> 00:15:04,059
that happen so how you as an

00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:06,909
organization that is proposing Drupal

00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:08,409
444 dine enterprise how can you be

00:15:06,909 --> 00:15:11,669
prepared to do with different layers

00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:14,470
different roles within that organization

00:15:11,669 --> 00:15:16,889
global Rita said regulated industry and

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:19,299
the cost reduction as at the beginning

00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:20,769
so I think the first thing that we need

00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:22,839
to do is to be prepared for those

00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:25,559
challenge so we got to be able to answer

00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:29,139
things about performance in Drupal right

00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:30,819
multiple sites management so again the

00:15:29,139 --> 00:15:33,970
proprietary SMS they have all those

00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:35,829
answers so how we as a group of 16 can

00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:38,109
answer that right off the bat or show

00:15:35,829 --> 00:15:39,459
them right what are the options that we

00:15:38,109 --> 00:15:41,409
have in Drupal what is the best brats

00:15:39,459 --> 00:15:43,659
around mood multiple site or move to

00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:46,149
side management the best tools for

00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:49,689
localization Orton internationalization

00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:51,009
as well how we can I show them the

00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:54,129
Drupal really satisfy those requirements

00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:55,629
for a global organization then when it

00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:57,669
comes to implementation of group I think

00:15:55,629 --> 00:16:01,149
there was a talk about Drupal and using

00:15:57,669 --> 00:16:02,829
agile so how does that affect my

00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:05,379
delivery process my delivery method as

00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:07,169
well using agile and using Drupal does

00:16:05,379 --> 00:16:10,209
that change anything what I'm used to

00:16:07,169 --> 00:16:13,239
are you able to follow my else as the OC

00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:14,769
process as well single sign also there

00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:18,369
are a lot of requirements about singles

00:16:14,769 --> 00:16:20,859
I know usually those organizations or

00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:23,199
try to for example pharma ones they'll

00:16:20,859 --> 00:16:25,209
have portals for health care

00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,159
practitioners health care providers so

00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:28,689
they just one one central point but

00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:32,439
different websites right single sign on

00:16:28,689 --> 00:16:34,419
is key and drupal has some capabilities

00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:36,099
on that but it still their partnerships

00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:40,629
that we can do and use different

00:16:36,099 --> 00:16:42,809
products integration support well i'm

00:16:40,629 --> 00:16:45,999
going to be talking more on details so

00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:48,249
so one of the first things is i have one

00:16:45,999 --> 00:16:51,159
person that I call in this proprietary

00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:53,649
CMS when I need it need help but what

00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:55,569
about Drupal it's the one where Caeser

00:16:53,649 --> 00:16:56,829
insist the community who is responsible

00:16:55,569 --> 00:17:01,509
for that so you got to be prepared to

00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:04,539
answer those questions hosting security

00:17:01,509 --> 00:17:05,299
and analytics so how we can show Drupal

00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:06,919
that can

00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:09,019
rupal connected with other components

00:17:06,919 --> 00:17:16,069
can actually satisfy those those those

00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:18,679
requirements so I think so next thing is

00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:21,169
to to master what Drupal has to offer

00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:23,869
right I just I'm sure you guys have more

00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:26,659
here I brought a couple things that I

00:17:23,869 --> 00:17:29,659
think have been different or have heavy

00:17:26,659 --> 00:17:32,269
stand stand out to those sales

00:17:29,659 --> 00:17:34,730
engagements that I had last year to the

00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:38,960
enterprise word and I it's really key

00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:40,369
having really key to to make group of

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,279
success so I think the first one is

00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:45,139
flexibility when I was able to

00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:47,330
demonstrate Drupal to them but

00:17:45,139 --> 00:17:50,419
flexibility they would have to a point

00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:52,580
where drupal in one farm organization is

00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:54,350
actually different from very competitor

00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,419
which those two companies they actually

00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:58,009
compete against each other of course so

00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:59,600
uh it's something that really stands out

00:17:58,009 --> 00:18:01,419
I'm sure sure I'm sure the proprietary

00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:04,549
ones you can actually customize as well

00:18:01,419 --> 00:18:06,080
but I really believe the Drupal the

00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:08,869
level that you can go with that we can

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,450
really make the plataform mingle win in

00:18:08,869 --> 00:18:13,909
the enterprise word and really become

00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:17,359
their platform without of course hairy

00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:19,369
heck in the core but I think flexibility

00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:21,379
is one of the key arguments to

00:18:19,369 --> 00:18:24,799
demonstrate to those organizations

00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:26,869
during the sales pitch the second one

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,720
which ties back to our question agasshi

00:18:26,869 --> 00:18:33,289
is innovation rate so uh you are not

00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:36,049
relying on just the that vendor did the

00:18:33,289 --> 00:18:37,669
proprietary SMS vendor you are relying a

00:18:36,049 --> 00:18:39,320
lot of people using that across the

00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:40,999
globe we're getting diversity regret

00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:43,609
you're getting the you're getting

00:18:40,999 --> 00:18:47,299
ovation quite faster when compared to

00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:50,710
this monolithic big global proprietary

00:18:47,299 --> 00:18:53,869
SMS organization right so I think it's

00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:56,269
especially to the marketing teams IIT is

00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:57,830
very concerned about this but when it

00:18:56,269 --> 00:19:00,200
comes to the marketing really they

00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:01,970
really like this to see they're getting

00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,179
they're getting content they're getting

00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:07,820
features built by different ganization

00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:10,129
across the globe right not only are

00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,379
caused not only sitecore not only that

00:19:10,129 --> 00:19:14,119
organization without too much diversity

00:19:12,379 --> 00:19:15,710
they're getting we're getting has a

00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:17,010
Drupal community again experience across

00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:24,300
the globe v4

00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:26,100
naggers and that's really key as well so

00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:29,430
those are the two things that are the

00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:32,270
right that I think really helped drupal

00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:34,500
standing out for for the sea of speech

00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:37,490
but I think we've got to be honest and

00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:39,900
transparent I think it's one of the

00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,400
talking this morning one of the key

00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,130
things about us as a group of community

00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,770
very very transparent on what we do and

00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:49,770
how we do things so what you wouldn't

00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:51,600
hear I guess proprietary SMS talking

00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:54,360
about their their witnesses order

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,950
they're flawless so uh but we gotta be

00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,410
we got to be able to talk about during

00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:00,210
the sales pitch as well and i have a few

00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:03,630
here that i've been challenged last year

00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:06,150
and i think we just don't show it as a

00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:07,590
flawless or an issue but you just show

00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,720
how things are getting fixed or how

00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:11,610
things are getting better right so one

00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,860
of the things I'm saying over and over

00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:16,380
juries make sure that other sessions

00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:18,480
mention that is about the altering those

00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,460
organizations when I started with one of

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,260
them five years ago the marketing team

00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,150
they wouldn't want to actually do the

00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:26,250
content chains they would relied to us

00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:28,620
as a vendor or to a different department

00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,150
there was more technical that has

00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:32,670
changed quite a lot throughout the years

00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:35,310
but the organization has chosen Drupal

00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:37,830
five years ago and has done nothing to

00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:41,180
improve this experience so we had a bit

00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:44,160
of a challenge trying to go after the

00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:46,380
implementation of better interface for

00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,090
the content editors right still not that

00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,950
perfect still there's some investment

00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,800
that needs to be done but I think the

00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:55,650
key part here for new sales is really to

00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:57,750
look at this park project is to look at

00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:59,430
what is being done in terms of improving

00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:02,340
the sales are the content or the

00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:04,200
altering experience when you see all the

00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:07,410
products they have inline editing for a

00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,570
long time now and finally we're getting

00:21:07,410 --> 00:21:11,280
that in Drupal so that was one of the

00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:13,710
key things that I that I've seen

00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,170
happening that would go against rupal so

00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:17,970
I think we should be prepared to show

00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:21,600
data this is going to be or it's already

00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:23,550
being tackled the second thing which is

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,590
kind of related to the content staging

00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:27,960
so they're really mostly a bill to

00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:30,180
preview is not a is not one of the

00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,570
strongest part in Drupal again looking

00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:33,059
out there

00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:34,889
proprietary software and again if you

00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:37,590
guys have more experience just shout out

00:21:34,889 --> 00:21:39,539
but uh you would have the preview so you

00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:41,190
would do the content change in staging

00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:44,100
you could preview the whole thing in

00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,659
context in Drupal this last time I

00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,419
checked we cannot do that so perfectly

00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:50,850
at so is to have no way it should see

00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:52,320
the whole page within the website allows

00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,750
you do the whole staging and production

00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,519
right but how can I do the production

00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:58,679
chains and actually see things in

00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:00,960
production in the context web user of

00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:03,330
the website if I have a pop-up window

00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,970
hour layover how can actually see that's

00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:07,470
not that simple right now so the

00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:10,409
contestation ishit is trying to tackle

00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:12,090
some of that and improve and I think

00:22:10,409 --> 00:22:14,370
this one is being financed by the

00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:17,070
large-scale Drupal should be talking

00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:18,990
very soon content management

00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:22,529
configuration an initiative as well so

00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:24,090
the whole deployment again when I went

00:22:22,529 --> 00:22:26,730
over there and there was someone that

00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:29,850
heard about Drupal they would come with

00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:32,429
those points the the preview altering

00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:34,769
and the ability for his motor

00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:36,809
deployments right again those the other

00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:38,639
platforms they would have a simple way

00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:40,889
just one straight for the way of pushing

00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:43,110
content configuration from different

00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:44,940
environments to production we still

00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:47,549
shrug a little bit but there's a lot of

00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,990
things happening starting with the

00:22:47,549 --> 00:22:52,830
configuration management so that make

00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:55,019
things like things much easier for that

00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:57,750
so be aware of that and bring up during

00:22:55,019 --> 00:23:03,539
the sales pitch and and of course show

00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:07,470
them the next one is really learned what

00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:10,529
the competitors are doing I guess I

00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:13,379
could feel that I couldn't actually talk

00:23:10,529 --> 00:23:16,529
to the competitor and see their their

00:23:13,379 --> 00:23:17,820
actions around this but but when I was

00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:19,679
listening to the customer during the

00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:22,649
sales pitch and he was choosing between

00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,990
between these or Drupal I would get the

00:23:22,649 --> 00:23:27,980
sense of those things especially around

00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:31,200
foots fear certain doubt that is true

00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:33,870
you might think that should be passed or

00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,909
way behind us still going to face some

00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:38,970
of them there's to some guys that I were

00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:41,760
part of the whole microsoft thing 10-15

00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:42,540
years ago and I face down in Brazil last

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,920
year

00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:48,660
and then one of the first questions was

00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:52,320
around security with open source right

00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:54,810
so uh the point that I that I showed him

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,060
is to talk to security specialized

00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:58,860
organizations it's basically it's just a

00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:01,530
regular concern so we've gotta do your

00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:03,600
homework you gotta have you still gotta

00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:05,130
have your your team that's going to be

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,950
doing the tasks and validation of

00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:09,990
websites regardless if it's Drupal if

00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:11,940
it's appropriate SMS which to changing

00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:13,980
code is to tell web application in the

00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:17,820
end of the day to go do your homework

00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:21,270
right so uh this is this is really a

00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:23,760
myth that we gotta be prepared to to to

00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:25,530
mitigate again you guys I'm not seeing

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,080
that so much I don't know Europe I

00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,940
haven't heard but I in Brazil I don't

00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,400
know here there's still guys that we

00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:35,130
think that I well open source security

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,990
Drupal and there's also the whole

00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:38,640
security community right we've got to be

00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,590
able to explain how this work and how

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,870
you as a vendor or is it an agency can

00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:44,820
actually apply the patches and actually

00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:47,490
part of your process of the governance

00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:51,320
of the plataform right so be prepared

00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:56,040
that it might come as one of the myths

00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:58,350
support so uh same organization that the

00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:01,620
Latin America cosmetics they said well

00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:03,720
know what I can just call this guy in

00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:06,060
this organization and I can he's going

00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,980
to fix whatever is failing within the

00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:10,260
whole platform if it's the website if

00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:12,060
it's the CRM if it's the other component

00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,880
underneath it he's going to fix because

00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:17,610
it's just one is everything with him so

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,460
I'm very comfortable with that oh he got

00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:23,190
a point some extent I think he just have

00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:24,750
to call one person compared to this an

00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,070
area where well there's something wrong

00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:29,790
with the website and this website

00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:32,280
integrates with this ESD or another two

00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:34,410
so I got to bring both vendors or three

00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,180
vendors on a call and try to fix that so

00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:41,640
things might get a little bit hairy or

00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:44,910
messy but I like to to show what I

00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:47,370
usually do is show an innovation for

00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:50,280
engineers oh that's more one focal point

00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:53,220
right or just one support he will handle

00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:55,320
the whole thing in red but when i'm

00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,310
teaching drupal i try to bring in a way

00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,410
that are going to be able

00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:00,420
to bring more innovation organization

00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:03,090
more diverse again just sticking with

00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:05,550
one organization you are kind of locked

00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:07,860
to whatever the rate of innovation is

00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:09,750
whatever they're going to be bringing to

00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,160
you you're not going to be fostering

00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:14,430
discussions or things that can be

00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:17,010
improved in your organization so I show

00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:18,960
something like this right so yeah the

00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:20,760
organization I they still do all the

00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,500
other components we don't want to

00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,230
conquer the world only do everything

00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:27,630
I'll do a few things you actually yes we

00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:29,130
want to do but yeah we can live with

00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:31,320
that and you know what by the time we

00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:32,430
get on a call to improve our platform

00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,260
we're going to be getting feedback from

00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:35,970
different perspectives they're going to

00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,590
be getting feedback from us as a Drupal

00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,960
and you have me work with different

00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:41,730
organizations we have the community and

00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,410
yes we're going to be also getting

00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:45,750
feedback from your current vendor

00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:47,100
whatever best practice he's suggesting

00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:50,880
and then you guess the but you get the

00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:54,300
best out of it out of the two lenders so

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,760
for support that's what I i tend to to

00:26:54,300 --> 00:27:00,030
move the discussion around has been very

00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:02,630
beneficial to them and rest assured I

00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:04,980
guess the thing that also come is around

00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:06,720
there is no support it's just open

00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:10,950
source who is supporting this who is

00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:12,300
behind this code right so ha then you

00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:13,590
have to go into how about the costars

00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:16,140
how it works how the Drupal community

00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:17,640
works but rest assured you're not going

00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:19,260
to be locked in so the whole vendor

00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,390
lock-in that's one of the things that I

00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,610
use you're not going to be locked in

00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:25,350
with CNT we can actually go to another

00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:27,840
vendor there's plenty of vendors that

00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:29,340
can actually help with that so I and

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,680
we're just growing and growing so this

00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:33,270
is also key to bring to them again

00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:38,040
around transparent so that's very

00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:41,550
important performance because this has

00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:43,590
to do with some triple cases that

00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:46,170
haven't been so sexual right so that

00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:49,350
gets out there people who know about it

00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:51,960
and I like to think that performs well

00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:54,930
under control in terms of Drupal as long

00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,850
as you of course you use the right ad on

00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:58,710
so there's plenty of components that you

00:27:56,850 --> 00:28:01,050
can use and it should bring that even in

00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:03,000
the sales pitch especially of course if

00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:05,490
you face that that question well I heard

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,590
the droop with low droop was just just

00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:10,200
bringing my side down so I don't want to

00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:12,060
use it one of the key

00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,250
that I also says that may be what you

00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:16,650
heard was because roop was not the right

00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:19,440
to for a job we tried you tried to build

00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:22,680
facebook maybe with Drupal yes can be

00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,850
done but you might think about what I

00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,580
want to achieve in the end of the day

00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:28,890
right yes you can build facebook with

00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,450
those components as well but then the

00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:33,300
impression was out there already right

00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:38,880
so you got a better shoulder it's not

00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:41,400
it's not like that the other thing that

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,260
I heard was well you know what with

00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:46,170
proprietary vendors I can just call them

00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:47,490
and because I'm paying I can try and

00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:49,230
influence what I'm going to come the

00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:50,640
next build right depends depends of

00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:52,830
course the organization how much power

00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,600
they have with that how much they're

00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:57,630
paying for license fees etcetera bora

00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:59,760
somehow they have some feeling that they

00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:02,580
can influence influence more on the

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,460
proprietary word and hear how would they

00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:08,880
do that to finance drupal 7 Drupal 8 how

00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:10,500
they can do that right I guess we have

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,170
to use the community we have to go back

00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:15,540
and talk about how their ganization

00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:17,610
should be part of the Commission train

00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,980
foster that should have not only the

00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:22,380
vendors but their IT team also being

00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,900
part of the community so they can see

00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:27,500
what's going on and really few how they

00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:30,510
can actually be part of this ecosystem

00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:35,030
so that's one important thing and I'm

00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:37,860
happy to see that this one I just used

00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:40,590
one time there's just one organization

00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:43,950
that is part of it for the large-scale

00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:46,650
group I think everyone or most of you

00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:49,290
guys know what it is but something that

00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:50,580
I think is founded by a crea and this

00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:53,490
organization this form a company is

00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:55,950
actually part of it and is contributing

00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:57,480
with basically money-making vestments

00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:00,030
but across different groups so that's

00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,650
how it works and then they can focus on

00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:03,120
this particular in particular features

00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:06,540
that they need that are very common to

00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:08,160
them so I think the first the first

00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:10,320
thing that came out of it was related to

00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,940
konkan staging so they build a quite a

00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,650
few modules and it's going to come back

00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,350
to the community right so they have a

00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:17,850
roadmap they get together every month so

00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,290
like the IT directors of the

00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:21,690
organizations that are part of the group

00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:23,670
so for large enterprise I think this is

00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:25,440
key for a

00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:27,600
very small amount of money compared to a

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,880
ting for the last fees you can actually

00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,490
join a special group of corporations

00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,160
that might have the similar pain points

00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:37,290
that you have leverage in Drupal and you

00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:40,140
can actually do it better by sharing the

00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:42,480
resource and financing so I brought this

00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:45,390
and a couple months after they chose

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,000
rupal they joined the group and I still

00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:53,310
investing on that so this is a very good

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:56,700
point drupa talent we all keep hearing

00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:59,010
about this my personal view and working

00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:02,310
with my developers in Brazil it that

00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:05,220
it's getting better so uh yes it's true

00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:06,720
still have a shortage but they're

00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:08,730
they're a bunch of things happening

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:10,680
around that and I think the global

00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:14,820
training days I think last year was the

00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:17,310
first year that rigid as association did

00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:18,720
so I think that's going to be key if we

00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:21,570
continue to participate on or if you

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,000
guys had a chance to join that i really

00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:26,670
recommend you try to put together even

00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,200
if it's just the what is Drupal of

00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:30,240
course it's just a couple of hours in

00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,220
the morning but try to help with that

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,230
it's going to be very important and

00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:36,840
again they're going to be bringing this

00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:38,850
into the sales pitch university so

00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:40,530
there's some working happening in trying

00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:42,960
to put Drupal as part of curriculum

00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:45,720
universities so that's also something

00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,520
that can be bought training companies

00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:50,430
there's I see every now and then more

00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:53,130
training companies spinning up and i

00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:54,650
think was i just added about juries he

00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:57,330
mention about the symphony so I think

00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:59,010
troupe away things going to be tend to

00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:01,770
be a little bit easier to bring new

00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:03,420
developers and get away from the Drupal

00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:10,020
isms that we have in the other versions

00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:11,490
of the group so the other thing is the

00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:14,730
web expense management so I told you

00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:16,500
that I i do see as a trend in the market

00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:19,590
but I also sometimes get the feeling

00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:22,470
that it has somehow been fabricated by

00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:24,210
by those proprietary ones but still it

00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:26,730
does make a lot of sense show to the

00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:29,010
topics that are bringing bringing being

00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:32,040
brought to this marketers are really

00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:33,420
needing this so I think we've got to be

00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,460
prepared to answer the questions how

00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:36,230
Drupal can support my web experience

00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,480
managing right

00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:40,340
actually if you luckily get access to

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,620
the marketers which I don't usually get

00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:45,559
to is just the IT or the group between

00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:48,110
itm marketing but this talk will

00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:50,600
definitely come and it involves

00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:54,080
basically being worried about how you're

00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:56,419
building the brand right so as an IT

00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,130
organization as a native vendor us we

00:32:56,419 --> 00:33:00,169
got to be prepared to really be worried

00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:01,940
about what does what does that mean to

00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:04,520
be this website in Drupal how can I

00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:07,250
actually help you the brand to achieve

00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:09,440
your goals right so do is mention a

00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:11,210
keynote about commerce content in

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,760
community there are some pillars that

00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:15,410
you can deep dive on on the web access

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:17,330
management but you know it's all

00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:19,760
basically goes back to conversation

00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:22,370
engagement be able to create a community

00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,720
and then listen to that community so we

00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:25,790
can go back to your brand so what are

00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:29,150
the tools that are long with Drupal we

00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:31,700
can help marketers listen to their to

00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:34,640
their consumers and then adapt around

00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:36,370
that so how we can how the brand can

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:39,470
improve their conversation engagement

00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:42,230
demand generation how I can actually

00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:44,360
email newsletters for example so how I

00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:47,390
can be more proactive and be more

00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,950
personalized around generating more than

00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:50,900
man how does Rupa can help with that

00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:53,299
because we need to bring another 24 that

00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:55,220
may be right but we got to be able to

00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:57,500
show that Drupal can actually connect to

00:33:55,220 --> 00:34:00,980
the 22 email newsletters or even to ads

00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:02,960
right for advertisement so what are the

00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:05,090
tools that I can help that can help

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,510
Drupal be better at the man generation

00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:10,490
court organization so analytics SEO what

00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:13,520
are the tools if not just Drupal that

00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:15,980
can help again the brand's achieve the

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,560
contamination and with your channel

00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:20,600
management I get over and over everyone

00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,369
is talking about this not just mobile

00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,740
it's not just desktop site or talking

00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:27,139
about mobile mobile apps and pushing

00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:29,570
content to the social media as well so

00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:30,740
that's very high level but that's the

00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:33,020
web experience management right so

00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:34,940
that's if you look at the the same

00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,980
operator SMS website you're going to see

00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,600
a product that's basically something

00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:40,070
around those lines they're going to be

00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,590
covering the whole thing your whole

00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:44,659
ecosystem marketer I'm covering

00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:46,700
everything for you and what about other

00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:49,270
says group of what we how we can cover

00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,270
that right

00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:58,980
and lastly as the little part of that

00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:01,440
the three points is a let's focus on our

00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:03,900
pre sales on one let's try to empower

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:08,520
our sales team and leverage the

00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:09,869
community to make it better so one of

00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:14,220
the things i think i saw in the business

00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:17,819
day we use quite a lot is a requirement

00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:20,040
score matrix so this is there's there's

00:35:17,819 --> 00:35:22,650
no standard one although several

00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,849
requirements might be the same but it's

00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:25,920
really something that it can help the

00:35:23,849 --> 00:35:27,750
organization and do together with them

00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,270
what are the most important requirements

00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:32,910
for you when you're choosing a CMS and

00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:34,799
it's not only for you as an IT you've

00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:36,599
got to bring the marketer the final

00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:39,720
consumer of the solution are putting out

00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:42,030
there and then put some value out of it

00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,950
so it's not just listing out the

00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:46,410
requirements but trying to put what is

00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:48,900
the value that how much does this

00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:51,809
represent to you because then if it's

00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:53,549
not so much drupal can really stand out

00:35:51,809 --> 00:35:55,170
or the other solution we stand out but

00:35:53,549 --> 00:35:57,390
anyways review transparent and honest

00:35:55,170 --> 00:36:00,329
about that so i really recommend having

00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:04,170
a template i can even share this one

00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:06,119
little bit you guys but if they don't

00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:07,500
have one work with them in the very

00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:08,339
beginning of this assessment and put it

00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,240
together something that is very

00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:13,980
customizable to them and well there's a

00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:17,490
risk that of course they might choose

00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:19,950
the other CMS but you know what it is

00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:21,990
what it is right but it needs were being

00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:24,180
transparent and honest and be able to

00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:27,000
maximize what Drupal can actually do for

00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:28,740
them it's very straightforward I've been

00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,859
through choose and errors like this one

00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:34,230
actually one spreadsheet was prepared by

00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:36,180
analyst firm so while they help the

00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:40,500
organization put together spreadsheet so

00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:42,900
you can tell some particularities around

00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,730
that and you can tell for example when

00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:47,010
the person was used to work with another

00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:49,040
semis in that case with sharepoint so

00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:51,900
the spreadsheet was created towards

00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:54,599
requirements that only sharepoint could

00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,130
satisfy to some extent so i was able to

00:36:54,599 --> 00:36:58,260
just all let's talk about this you know

00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,839
what this is sharepoint if you look at

00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,740
the other CMS they're not going to be

00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:07,230
supporting this

00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:10,230
so just be prepared for that I guess

00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:12,600
what I also realized when they come to

00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:14,790
ask for for help on choosing a platform

00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:17,940
is that it's not only the technical

00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:19,560
platform there's there's also something

00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:22,740
happening between the marketing in the

00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:24,840
IT they're not talking as they should

00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:27,650
the communication is not as smooth as

00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:31,440
possible they have different goals

00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:33,180
someone we can see here nit has its own

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,800
goals as well might not be supporting

00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,300
only the marketers by me supporting

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,340
different organizations within the

00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,140
enterprise so I guess what's very

00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:42,210
important for us when we're pitching

00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:45,030
that is also to understand what is this

00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:47,310
business gap right how we can fit in in

00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:50,430
the middle here and complement those two

00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:52,260
organizations right so I guess it's not

00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:54,869
only the platform but being able to

00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:56,369
understand what what is the attraction

00:37:54,869 --> 00:37:58,320
that is going on the friction that is

00:37:56,369 --> 00:38:00,660
going on between the two groups that

00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,900
really helped has been helpful for us to

00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:06,030
go one step ahead not technology or

00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,680
being able to understand what is

00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:09,330
happening in organization again all the

00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,640
challenge around different groups they

00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:13,770
are big you don't get that answer just

00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,180
in the first week so you got to be

00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:18,150
prepared to spend some time with your

00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:20,790
sales team finding out interviewing

00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,960
getting to know connecting two different

00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:24,119
people in the organization and

00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:25,590
eventually you connect the dots then you

00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:28,350
set up the session to have everyone

00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:30,480
let's talk about Drupal and how Drupal

00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:32,490
can help both of your organizations

00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:39,650
within enterprise I think that's very

00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:44,760
key as well and this one was just

00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:46,800
December yeah I was surprised to hear so

00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:49,440
of course organizationally hire those

00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,810
companies to advise them especially in

00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,420
such a critical moment right so we

00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:56,940
should not be naive they're not just

00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:58,260
listening to should us Drupal and to the

00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:00,300
proprietary ones they're also looking

00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:03,030
for someone that might be in the middle

00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:05,100
right so I had a chance to to go through

00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:07,140
the scenario where they hired the

00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:11,760
company to the journalist company to

00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:15,320
help them make a decision and there was

00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:18,380
a the organization

00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:20,540
this firm tend not to benefit Drupal so

00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:24,770
they will bring things around TCO even

00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:27,800
for drupal and i really recommend we

00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:30,260
also try if we have if you guys have

00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,700
capability to to try and work with those

00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:34,700
analysis there are ways you can work

00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:36,950
with that can influence that as well but

00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:39,050
most importantly being transparent so if

00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:41,090
you have access to analysts and you can

00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:43,670
show off your case in Drupal please do

00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:45,860
it so you can they have the perception

00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:47,690
the droop is getting some friction on

00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:49,850
some issues in some areas on their

00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:52,670
business management so by the time they

00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:55,040
go to recommend Drupal it's really not

00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:57,680
going to help so if we can try to work

00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:00,050
on that area too if you have the

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,990
capacity to do so I really recommend so

00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:04,880
right now we're trying to have scheduled

00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:07,550
meetings with with specific analysis

00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,260
about CMS throughout the year so we can

00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:11,510
we can show them the case that we've

00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:13,460
been doing Drupal and how our customers

00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:15,920
are benefiting from that it's just being

00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:18,110
honest and transparent right but some

00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,210
time is really hard to find the school

00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:23,720
and try to find success case in Drupal

00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:26,360
that really can touch on the mind of

00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:29,360
those guys so I really recommend if you

00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:34,490
have capabilities try to influence such

00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:38,000
organizations as well lastly I guess is

00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:40,370
a try to do the best radish for a 16

00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,020
right so it's it's a process not it's

00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:45,080
not going to take a couple weeks or

00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:47,060
months the last one took me 12 months

00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:50,540
from the time I was called for the first

00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:54,140
presentation to I get it NSO w signed so

00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:55,790
be prepared to spend some time and the

00:40:54,140 --> 00:41:00,290
battery were prepared I mean the more

00:40:55,790 --> 00:41:03,110
we're prepared to better so one that one

00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:06,140
of the things about putski for us this

00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:09,980
by the time we were there they wanted to

00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:11,510
see a Drupal Ronnie and I google round I

00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:14,210
searched around I didn't find a demo

00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:16,580
that really satisfy what they wanted to

00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:18,260
see although you can you can show what's

00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:21,410
out there but it's really my

00:41:18,260 --> 00:41:22,200
recommendations to somewhere right there

00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:24,869
try to

00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,599
to customize so that was really so sex

00:41:24,869 --> 00:41:29,490
we spend we had of course you have to

00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:31,710
metro resource but we had a chance to

00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:34,109
actually get three developers from one

00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:36,000
week you get a few use cases of a

00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:38,339
website that's live out there for the

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,339
organization and we build those features

00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:43,140
in Drupal and need a demo so we get all

00:41:41,339 --> 00:41:45,480
the assets from the side we build the

00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:49,410
website and show them just one week and

00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:51,660
a half that was key for for them to all

00:41:49,410 --> 00:41:53,040
and they also show the CMS although

00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:56,040
we're going to work out the interface

00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,079
the way we want it but we could show

00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:59,280
what we can change content just you here

00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,320
and then you have access you have

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,099
permission we have logs we have track of

00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:07,920
what's going on so I really recommend

00:42:04,099 --> 00:42:10,140
when going after enterprises be prepared

00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:12,630
to save some time some sorts to actually

00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:14,880
do the more customize them Jeanette once

00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:16,589
i'm not going to be touching upon what

00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:20,160
the market has in mind he wants to see

00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:24,690
his problem being sold by that right so

00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:30,630
that's that was very key lastly ah i

00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:33,359
keep seeing last but uh also team

00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:35,520
up even as although i said three hundred

00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:37,319
talents you know what their excuse that

00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,640
we don't have even the web experience

00:42:37,319 --> 00:42:40,710
matters there are components that we

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,960
just don't know how to answer some

00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:45,780
questions so what there's a couple

00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,420
scenarios last year so we brought one of

00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:51,089
our partners to complement our offer and

00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:52,710
we work on the pitch process together so

00:42:51,089 --> 00:42:55,079
this is really key oggi i guess it goes

00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:56,849
along with the whole community and i

00:42:55,079 --> 00:43:00,089
really recommend so if you're going

00:42:56,849 --> 00:43:01,290
after those giants and you have the

00:43:00,089 --> 00:43:03,569
opportunity to bring someone else with

00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:06,450
you I sure there's there's space for

00:43:03,569 --> 00:43:09,599
everyone within the organization so I

00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:12,510
really recommend doing a partnership and

00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:19,380
working together on pre-sales for those

00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:23,010
organizations and might be getting to

00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:25,440
the last loop art finally know when to

00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:29,970
give up one of the things and I said

00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:33,780
before is around trying to force the

00:43:29,970 --> 00:43:35,820
customer to use the tool again we have

00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:37,620
our ego very big and we

00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:40,530
one group what you really can do

00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:43,590
anything everything but I'm stronger

00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:46,230
believer on on the the right tool for

00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:49,650
the right job right so try to build an

00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:51,680
LMS or try to build something on top of

00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:54,300
Drupal yes we know it can be done but

00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,770
you have to be transparent in to see you

00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,540
know what you better off just by this

00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:59,910
because you want to build such a

00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:01,560
specific solution so many business rules

00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:03,420
we're going to be we're going to have to

00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:06,090
customize so many Drupal modules to do

00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:07,650
that you better off by that solution and

00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:10,950
then let's use Drupal for something else

00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:12,540
right so that's my recommendations well

00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:15,090
then I don't think that I think that

00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:16,980
doesn't help drew parole so that those

00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:19,710
are the cases that we here drupal was

00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:22,800
not successful and then so I really

00:44:19,710 --> 00:44:24,660
recommend let's be transparent if it's

00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,290
failing on their Drupal's really not

00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:29,490
getting no score at all just be honest

00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:34,130
and you're going to get our customer

00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:39,000
eventually so just be transparent I

00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:41,580
think I'm ya think I'm good guys that's

00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:44,160
spring much it kind of a little bit

00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:45,720
boring border for friday afternoon but i

00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,540
wanted to share those that that

00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:51,360
experience and my recommendations try to

00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:54,180
really empower your sales team invest on

00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,770
that again things that I heard this week

00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:58,320
I think we're in a comfort zone

00:44:55,770 --> 00:45:01,620
customers are asking i coming and ask

00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:04,020
you for drupal but it might not last

00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:06,870
that long and i am sure the appropriate

00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:09,990
error ones they will come more strong so

00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:13,410
I rather be prepared for that and we

00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:16,140
have a huge sales team we're able to do

00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:20,010
marvelous things as long as we get

00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:22,410
prepared for it right and my last point

00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:24,210
is to go back to this right what would

00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:26,400
rather be so right now I think we're the

00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:28,980
Fox but I want to continue to be the Fox

00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,440
so hopefully we will continue investing

00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:35,910
our sales team we continue to be in

00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:43,280
growing the way we are right now that's

00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:43,280
pretty much it I know any questions yep

00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:04,840
so to that point first we try to

00:46:00,670 --> 00:46:09,580
implement a governess module so should

00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:10,990
ever as a repeated question right so so

00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:12,700
what are the process or how we can

00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:15,220
assure the real ability of the modules

00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:17,680
being chosen by the corporation right so

00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:19,810
we when we get in first thing is let's

00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:21,700
put a governance process in place for it

00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:23,230
for the modules we don't want developers

00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:27,940
just go and choose whatever they want

00:46:23,230 --> 00:46:30,850
right so for organizations although the

00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:33,010
whole time to market it might be slowing

00:46:30,850 --> 00:46:34,210
down things I think it's very important

00:46:33,010 --> 00:46:36,250
especially if you're talking global

00:46:34,210 --> 00:46:38,140
scale different vendors working with the

00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:41,440
code so we got to have a very strong

00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:43,540
processing place so for for the two

00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:45,310
pharma ones they do have a very strong

00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:46,750
so every time I developers to jazz new

00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:49,270
module has to go to some sort of

00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:52,600
approval to use that so try to get that

00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:54,880
ahead during during the grooming of the

00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,920
sprint so based on the requirements try

00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,200
to identify which module will best suit

00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,820
that particular requirement and submit

00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,490
for approval usually takes a couple days

00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:08,200
and then they allow it and of course try

00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:10,510
to use a maybe just data or Randy for

00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,760
prediction released versions I'll do

00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:15,070
also sometimes we would allow it and

00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:17,020
then we would implement or fix the bugs

00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:19,690
and eventually help move to next level

00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:21,520
but I guess the answer a very short

00:47:19,690 --> 00:47:24,000
answer is have a strong governance

00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,000
process

00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:42,989
no no no it was I don't I don't recall

00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,549
any any case yeah I mean first

00:47:42,989 --> 00:47:46,589
developers are actually assessing that

00:47:44,549 --> 00:47:48,210
before submitting and then there's their

00:47:46,589 --> 00:47:50,039
internal committee that's actually

00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:52,200
reviewing so for that particular

00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:54,930
requirements basically supporting what

00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:56,819
they want and then there's security

00:47:54,930 --> 00:47:59,450
involved as well that's part of the

00:47:56,819 --> 00:47:59,450
governess

00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:30,339
in me like a checklist of I don't have

00:48:28,329 --> 00:48:31,930
it handy right now but I those customers

00:48:30,339 --> 00:48:33,940
that's what he called the once they step

00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:36,490
to the governance process they create

00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:38,470
what they call the plataform their own

00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:40,240
platform so the platform is basically a

00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:42,309
set of Drupal modules that I should be

00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,920
tried should be even used across all the

00:48:42,309 --> 00:48:47,260
side to be implemented so to get a new

00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:50,589
module into that platform has to go to

00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:53,380
that process and then and then it would

00:48:50,589 --> 00:48:56,039
be blessed and be able to used by them

00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:56,039
across the globe

00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:44,120
the beginning when I start working with

00:49:38,540 --> 00:49:46,070
Drupal yes you know what and I don't see

00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:48,830
that having much right now I feel like

00:49:46,070 --> 00:49:50,810
the IT groups the large the price is

00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:53,570
slowly are getting up to speed with the

00:49:50,810 --> 00:49:55,550
innovation with looking what smds are

00:49:53,570 --> 00:49:57,410
doing and trying to bring that to the

00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:58,880
enterprise so the cool stuff that I

00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:02,390
happening out there they wanted to bring

00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:04,480
is not as fast as an SMB but I feel like

00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:06,950
they're trying to change the mindset and

00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,620
instead of trying to do things the same

00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:11,870
way again trying to leverage what has

00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:14,150
been done in startups and these more

00:50:11,870 --> 00:50:16,250
companies and and we're seeing a lot of

00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:18,200
startups become enterprise just in a

00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:20,420
couple of years right so they're getting

00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:23,270
that experience and trying to bring into

00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:25,760
the to their process of creating new

00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:27,350
websites or new requirements so it's

00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:31,630
getting better in the past five years

00:50:27,350 --> 00:50:31,630
changed a lot but it's not that fast

00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:18,830
they basically came with with the whole

00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:21,920
analytics was very key so for example I

00:51:18,830 --> 00:51:23,660
think Adobe omniture so they just come

00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:26,000
with with the pitch where what's

00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:28,220
everything fairly integrated is just as

00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:30,740
easy to create a new website omniture

00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:33,619
just worked fine over there so that was

00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:35,600
going to key things that I heard but

00:51:33,619 --> 00:51:37,880
then I would go with you know what you

00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,410
can either use omniture there's a module

00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:41,420
for that in Drupal or you can use google

00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:44,390
analytics or you can use a core metrics

00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:45,800
for example so that's that that better

00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:50,470
I've been through that was one of the

00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:50,470
things apart from that no

00:52:06,349 --> 00:52:11,220
yeah yeah or at least you need more

00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:13,109
configuration to do it right so you can

00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:15,000
do a few things with views and roles in

00:52:13,109 --> 00:52:19,440
terms of personalization there's more

00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:21,089
you can code on top of it but but I

00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:24,510
think they come with everything ready

00:52:21,089 --> 00:52:27,240
and they show it and where else whereas

00:52:24,510 --> 00:52:29,400
us we just have to to build and show

00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:31,349
them so it takes takes us more time to

00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,060
actually show what they want in terms of

00:52:31,349 --> 00:52:46,109
web experience management I guess that's

00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:48,359
one of the key things I am NOT that at

00:52:46,109 --> 00:52:49,920
that level but that's a great idea

00:52:48,359 --> 00:52:51,720
especially when it comes to Alex

00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,420
mismanagement I mean we're seeing

00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:56,400
companies so we're not a product company

00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:58,589
so what you're seeing like aqua is doing

00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,680
something very similar to that building

00:52:58,589 --> 00:53:03,780
an ecosystem around one project and just

00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:06,480
bringing components but yeah ideally

00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:08,369
that will make things just at the same

00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:11,400
level as the appropriate everyone's eyes

00:53:08,369 --> 00:53:13,020
are doing yeah I don't do that what I

00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,089
what I do is basically they must try to

00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:17,160
bring the requirements but ideally

00:53:15,089 --> 00:53:19,770
that's where we want to be or to be able

00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:21,740
to knowing those components like there's

00:53:19,770 --> 00:53:24,839
a I think there's a bunch of companies

00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:26,970
here this week that offer like offer

00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:28,619
service of translation for example and

00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:31,650
there's a module to connect with Drupal

00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:33,599
so we knowing that we don't actually

00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:35,250
have to build something but actually

00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:39,680
show that those things can work together

00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:39,680
and then burn the win and sell

00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:18,210
both are doing both so why we have to be

00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:20,130
proactive so as we start building those

00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:22,080
case definite that helped us as well as

00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:25,500
position ourselves as supporting a

00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:27,450
service to large organizations but but

00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:29,910
especially as miam brazilian company

00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:32,310
we're not so famous in US or europe so

00:54:29,910 --> 00:54:34,500
we have to the surprise of work but has

00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:36,810
been scenarios where they would just

00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:38,670
come and ask for Drupal service because

00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:39,780
they saw it so other things that we've

00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:43,320
been doing out there in the community

00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:45,900
and unfortunately we cannot share those

00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:48,900
cases but somehow they get you know

00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:50,460
there is of course word of mouth so as

00:54:48,900 --> 00:55:06,540
we continue be the new cases that

00:54:50,460 --> 00:55:07,890
eventually will help us yes the office

00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:11,310
is going to be my place the begin of

00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:13,800
course as usual but eventually we're

00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:17,630
going to be sitting yeah yeah that's

00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,630
being started over there yeah

00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:26,720
okay hurry up my only question is if you

00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:31,759
want to be the Fox do you have to get a

00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:33,470
face full of snow that was fantastic

00:55:31,759 --> 00:55:43,549
look could you please join me thanking

00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:46,160
Philippe ribbon yeah yep so feedback and

00:55:43,549 --> 00:55:47,779
slide slides will be about I think your
