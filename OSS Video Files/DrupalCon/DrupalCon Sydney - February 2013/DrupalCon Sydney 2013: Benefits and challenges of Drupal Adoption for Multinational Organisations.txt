Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Benefits and challenges of Drupal Adoption for Multinational Organisations
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	There are many success stories of how organisations converted all their web systems to Drupal. But what about blanket adoption of Drupal by multinational organisations with business units operating all over the world?

In this presentation, I will discuss the benefits attained and challenges facing multi-national organisations adopting vendor-independent Drupal solutions. The goal? To improve cost-effectiveness, uniformity, scalability and maintainability of their business's websites across the world.

Topics will include:

How to improve cost-effectiveness and maintainability while ensuring scalability
Utilising local vendors
Code governance - how to prevent local vendors from breaking the entire platform
How to efficiently provide user-level support and platform-level support
What to look out for (e.g. regional legal obligations, regulatory requirements)
Modules briefly discussed/demonstrated:

Features
Simpletest
Issues that will be addressed by this session:

Business:

How Drupal can increase the efficiency and ROI of web systems for multinational organisations
Strategy:

Maintaining the maintainability, scalability and security
Importance of selecting the right local vendors
Importance of adherence to Drupal best-practices
Governance: change and code management
Technical:

Git and access control
Whether or not to run sites under multisite settings
Code / release governance

maury is a technical account manager for

00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:09,090
aquion based in the UK he is also

00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,190
coordinate coordinator of the drupal

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:15,839
security team or a coordinator there's a

00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:18,539
few auntie yep he's the admin or one of

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:23,220
the admins of the Japan groupon rupal

00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:25,289
drupal groups I'm G do he's a module

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,260
contribute and core translator he

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,000
translates core strings into Japanese if

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:35,670
not other languages as well maybe yeah

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,559
shot that yeah please and he works with

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,290
customers who operate internationally

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,989
with over 20 officers around the world

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,329
so as you can see he'll have the sort of

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:48,180
experience that he needs to be able to

00:00:45,329 --> 00:00:51,980
talk about this topic while the talk is

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,329
all at one more ease I'd say teco really

00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:56,699
fundamentally or historically you have

00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:59,399
been today's talk is not going to be

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,109
overly technical it's classed as an

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,940
intermediate level anyway without

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:07,200
further ado I'd like to you to welcome

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,600

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,159
swap over microphones here so talk

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,430
amongst yourself for ten seconds oh you

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,430
hold that

00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:45,880
oh sorry okay right okay so sorry for

00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:49,240

already know my name my name is Maurice

00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:02,230
in melter on my screen name is dr. mori

00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:06,190
I've been using Drupal for the last six

00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:09,580
years and I'm based in the UK although

00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:12,580
i'm originally from japan and i work for

00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:16,920
are clear and very quickly about a queer

00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:20,410
so we provide expert 24-7 drupal support

00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:24,760
we are we provide optimized drupal

00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:27,430
hosting so it's a platform as a service

00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,190
so you basically bring in your code and

00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:33,130
we look after the rest and we also

00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:36,130
through our like trainings and

00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:42,070
professional services we foster drupal

00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:45,540
adoption and also we are hiring so and

00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:48,550
we are especially interested in hiring

00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:51,070
click on client advisors if you're

00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:55,690
interested please let me know we have

00:02:51,070 --> 00:03:00,310
many other posts available as well okay

00:02:55,690 --> 00:03:05,560
so can I quickly ask about yourselves so

00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:09,280
um are any of you developers or a good

00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:12,550
developers are project managers okay and

00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:16,180
like business businesses interested in

00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:23,920
using Drupal have been using Drupal

00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:26,560
ready yeah okay thank you and um okay

00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:32,950
well if your developers probably pretty

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:35,650
experienced with Drupal but so um people

00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:38,709
who own business what's your experience

00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:44,470
with Drupal like have you have you been

00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:47,510
using Drupal yeah okay cool so he had um

00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:49,730
good to know um yeah so since

00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:52,220
there are some developers I might i'll

00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:55,069
be adding some technical details to the

00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,680
talk but just so you know just to make

00:03:55,069 --> 00:04:00,200
it very clear it's about multi nasa

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,120
drupal adoption for multinational

00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,209
organizations and it's not about

00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,310
multilingual drupal some people for my

00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:12,950
talk is about multilingual that it's not

00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:15,019
so if you are not if you're here to to

00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:16,549
learn about multilingual drupal

00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:22,699
unfortunately you're not going to learn

00:04:16,549 --> 00:04:26,300
much about it all right okay so um i'll

00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:31,539
be quickly going over our about the

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:35,080
benefits of adapting drupal and also in

00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:38,419
in multinational in the context of

00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:41,630
multinational organization it makes it

00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:44,620
quite more a lot more complex so there

00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:48,260
would be peculiar challenges related to

00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:50,930
this kind of use case so i'd be

00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:56,030
discussing about these challenges as

00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:58,610
well as solutions to that so arm so

00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:02,930
first of all benefits of using or

00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:07,699
adapting Drupal or disadvantage of North

00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:10,340
adapting Drupal so on a typical scenario

00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:15,229
for multinational organizations is that

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:17,990
they have many country they have

00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:20,090
businesses around the world and each

00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:23,449
each country office has their own

00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:27,199
website which you know which is fine but

00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:29,750
if they have these websites are on

00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:34,699
different CMS's and different frameworks

00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:37,849
then it becomes a problem because the

00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:40,340
way things are built is quite different

00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:44,419
and also each site needs to be built

00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:47,120
from scratch so you need to if if you've

00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:50,150
been involved in web you know web

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,669
development project you know how how

00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:56,200
much effort it requires and if you need

00:05:52,669 --> 00:05:58,940
to do this for you know twenty or thirty

00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,120
countryside's then it's a lot of work

00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:04,410
and

00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:08,280
as well so and drupal can really

00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:11,360
simplify this and oh yeah and on top on

00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:15,810
top of that if you are using proprietary

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:22,070
CMS's then you'd have to pay pay for

00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:22,070
license so it as you know further costs

00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:32,419
so building each site from scratch on

00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:35,039
multiple CMS's is quite inefficient and

00:06:32,419 --> 00:06:38,340
I'd like to dig down a bit deeper on

00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:44,310
this so problem of having multiple CMS

00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:46,949
is that the reusability is quite poor so

00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:50,130
for example if you want one feature on

00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:52,470
all the sides you need to build that

00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:58,080
feature in different in 44 different

00:06:52,470 --> 00:07:00,479
CMS's so for example in in the EU there

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,810
is now a law that if you if you usually

00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:07,229
a site uses cookie you have to notify

00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:13,139
the visitors that your site uses cookie

00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:16,139
and it if you have five websites in the

00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:18,180
EU and if they're all different platform

00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:20,660
then you need to develop that simple

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:26,010
feature for five of those different

00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:29,610
CMS's so it's quite the reusability

00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:33,210
would be quite poor in that pen scenario

00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:35,729
and also if you want to have the same

00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:38,070
same look and feel for all those sites

00:07:35,729 --> 00:07:42,300
or all the sites you have you need to

00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:47,370
build a theme on a template for each of

00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:50,000
those CMS's so poor usability means more

00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:55,199
development work and more maintenance

00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,690
and also if you are if you are been

00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,539
involved in Drupal development you'd

00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:03,330
probably know this but they are set of

00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:06,060
best practices and standards that you

00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:09,539
want to follow and if you have let's say

00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:12,750
10 different CMS's it's quite difficult

00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:13,980
for your developers to adhere to best

00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,370
practices of those

00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:20,580
all those ten different CMS's so that

00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:26,480
can lead to arm substandard quality and

00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:30,690
low maintainability and also are

00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:33,350
applying bug fixes and security updates

00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:38,310
for all those CMS's would be quite

00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:40,860
cumbersome as well and if a group of

00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:44,730
editors are in charge of updating on

00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:47,970
those different sites um you need to

00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:52,100
train train them for different CMS's as

00:08:47,970 --> 00:09:00,540
well so that's another young efficiency

00:08:52,100 --> 00:09:03,690
so the the solution to this is to build

00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:08,390
a Drupal based platform and then build

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:12,630
those country sites on top of that and

00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:14,910
Drupal can that the reason why Drupal is

00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:21,300
so good for this kind of use case is

00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:24,840
that tuple allows you to run multiple

00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:29,480
sites on a single code base so even if

00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:32,370
you have 30 40 sites you only need to

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:35,520
you only need to update the code in one

00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:38,040
place so for example you have the the

00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:42,030
core and common features and themes in

00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:44,760
in one place so if you if you ever need

00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:47,130
to apply updates you only apply that to

00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,590
that one place and then it gets applied

00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:56,760
across all the sides so that makes the

00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:59,370
maintenance very simple and benefits of

00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,020
having such Drupal based platform it's

00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:04,380
basically a reverse of what I've just

00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:07,620
talked about so high reusability if you

00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:10,890
need a certain feature you basically

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:15,060
build that feature once and it works on

00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:19,110
all the sides and also it the same thing

00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:21,060
applies for the fame so if you're if all

00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,600
of your let's say you have 20 sites and

00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:27,300
if all 20 sites need to have the same

00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,790
look and feel you basically build one

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,770
thing

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:35,260
and you enable that on all the sites and

00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:38,620
what one of the customers I was working

00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:42,970
with how the how the real issues they

00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:48,460
had multiple websites on for they had

00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:53,100
each they have a site for each country

00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:55,600
country of this and if you if you if you

00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:59,110
look at them side by side they have

00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,230
different size of logos these different

00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:04,600
color schemes some of which were not

00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:08,020
actually not allowed to be used but they

00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,930
weren't following those design

00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:13,150
guidelines and so on so they both sides

00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:15,850
looked almost like there are four

00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:17,950
different kind if ur encompass so you

00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,900
can you can avoid that kind of problem

00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:23,710
quite easily by using this kind of

00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:25,900
platform and also rapid construction of

00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:30,810
new sites this is a real strength of

00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:36,100
this this type of platform so basically

00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:39,580
what Drupal allows you to do is to to

00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:42,730
build this thing called installed

00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:45,400
profile so if you if you run that you

00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:50,290
can spin up a site with within a matter

00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:52,870
of seconds so you you have the platform

00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:56,980
and you have an install profile to spin

00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:58,870
up a site then if once once you build

00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,840
the platform you can you can create new

00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:03,760
sites very easily you just basically run

00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:07,000
the script and then populate the content

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:10,870
and do a quick uat and you can launch

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:13,120
the site so it's very efficient compared

00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:14,830
to like what you saw you know going

00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:20,590
through all the phase of the development

00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:25,960
and like I mentioned because you you can

00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:29,080
update the you can apply update in one

00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:31,600
place to our for all the sides the

00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:33,550
maintenance will be much easier well

00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:38,770
there are some challenges which I will

00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:40,920
talk about later and also hosting

00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:44,579
requirements will be simple

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:47,760
if you have multiple CMS's that runs on

00:12:44,579 --> 00:12:51,690
different technology for example you

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:56,130
know you might need to have Ruby or Java

00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:58,199
and then specific requirements for

00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:00,690
servers would be completely different

00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:03,120
however if you have this this type of

00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:06,180
platform then all you need to have is a

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:08,790
stack that can run PHP and MySQL

00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:11,250
basically so it can really simplify

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:17,220
hosting requirements so this this is

00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:22,470
also another arm thing that reduces the

00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:26,699
maintenance overhead so um in terms of

00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:28,829
cost efficiency so that this is I can't

00:13:26,699 --> 00:13:31,519
tell you how much it would actually cost

00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:35,040
to build a platform because it entirely

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:40,130
entirely depends on how complex your

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,130
solution is but just to give you an idea

00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:49,160
see the initial development would

00:13:45,269 --> 00:13:52,980
involve development of the platform and

00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:55,740
common theme and features and you also

00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:59,550
need to document how things work and

00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:08,370
provide trainings so let's say you have

00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:11,160
20 sites and you you you spent 44 first

00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:13,110
four sites it will be initial

00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,300
development transitional phase so you'd

00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:18,360
be working on a number of common

00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:21,510
features but once you have the platform

00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:25,350
in place the rest of the 16 sites can be

00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:28,170
span up very quickly like I mentioned so

00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:34,470
it really cuts down on the the

00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:37,889
development costs so it it really

00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:41,310
improves the efficiency of not only the

00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:43,949
development but also maintenance and it

00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:49,050
provides you with a better return on

00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:53,279
investment as well so it looks all in a

00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:54,630
nice and easy but um is it really

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:59,340
straightforward on

00:14:54,630 --> 00:15:01,070
I would say yes for the kind of common

00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:06,980
website so if you're talking about

00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:09,650
common corporate sites so you you have

00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:12,830
you have information about your company

00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:15,990
about your products and services and

00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:20,700
articles and quarterly reports and so on

00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:22,020
then having have building those sites on

00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:24,210
this kind of platform would be

00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:27,890
technologically quite straightforward

00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:31,440
however because because of the

00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:34,590
complexity it comes with a number of

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:39,540
challenges that are quite peculiar so

00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:43,830
I'd like to cover those so challenges

00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:47,940
are there are challenges in different

00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:51,210
phases so the first one is in during the

00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:53,940
preparation phase and the second was

00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:57,120
second one is in the development phase

00:15:53,940 --> 00:16:04,280
and the third one is in operation and

00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:04,280
maintenance so during preparation phase

00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:17,040
consensus within the company is very

00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:19,650
very important because if the at least

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,890
the companies and organizations that

00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:25,370
I've worked with if they're if they are

00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:29,040
operating globally they have quite

00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:32,340
complex our organizational structure and

00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,440
also each country office is quite

00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,360
autonomous so they have their own budget

00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:38,580
for web development they can do whatever

00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,790
they want basically what the aren't

00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:47,760
there are budget restraints but they

00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:51,630
don't have to they can they can make on

00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:54,330
own decisions on on their web project so

00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:57,240
it makes it a little bit difficult for

00:16:54,330 --> 00:17:04,520
you to get a consensus and all the side

00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:08,329
all the offices so um when I when I

00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:12,050
worked with them I had to help them

00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:16,350
share the image of success among this

00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:19,170
this country offices and also there

00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:21,569
would be restrictions because the

00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:23,730
platform is shared you can't do

00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:26,430
everything that you want to do that

00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:28,050
there are some things you can't do or

00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:32,040
you have to collaborate with other

00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:34,890
offices so it's um it can't be it can't

00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:38,100
be done as quickly as they wish so there

00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:41,820
would be some restrictions so they they

00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:45,770
need to understand that and but there

00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:49,260
are benefits that are definitely worth

00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:53,360
the trouble so they need to they need to

00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:55,740
understand this before this project can

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,080
in order for this project to succeed

00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:03,600
because you don't want them to drop off

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:05,310
on in the middle of the project and you

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,250
you really need their support and

00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:13,260
understanding to lead the project its

00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:16,860
success and also um this is this is kind

00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:19,650
of kind of a common issue for for any

00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:23,790
project but selecting the right vendors

00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:26,610
is it's a big challenge because because

00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:29,610
you have multiple offices you'd be

00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:32,340
hiring on multiple vendors so that makes

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:38,010
it slightly more challenging than just

00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:40,050
selecting one right vendor and then the

00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:42,390
vendors must must be highly competent

00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:46,710
there's no question about that they they

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:48,360
must know well about Drupal and they

00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:51,090
they need to be able to other here to

00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:55,980
best practices and they need to know

00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:59,220
what they're doing basically but um from

00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:01,350
Maine so you have to in this kind of

00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:05,820
project you that you would have two

00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:07,770
types of vendors one is the main vendor

00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:11,400
who would be building and maintaining

00:19:07,770 --> 00:19:13,800
the platform so they have they have a

00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:19,710
great responsibility in this kind of

00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:22,020
project and they they need to be not

00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:23,940
only compensate

00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,460
but they need to have adequate resources

00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:32,300
because the project can be quite big and

00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:36,180
time effort on and the same arm

00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:38,280
intensive so they need to have adequate

00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:40,680
resource to be able to run this kind of

00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:43,350
project and they need to be highly

00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:46,230
capable in managing projects because

00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:49,380
this with this kind of project you'd

00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:51,840
have you'd be working with an

00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,150
organization which has quite complex

00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,000
organizational structure as well as

00:19:54,150 --> 00:20:00,120
you'd be working with local companies

00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:05,280
and vendors as well so they need to be

00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:08,010
able to manage that well and as part of

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:10,740
that they need to be able to communicate

00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:20,430
well and they need to be able to manage

00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:25,310
customers expectations but well so local

00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:29,070
local vendors they would be it depends

00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:32,700
they need to be good developers are good

00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:34,620
good drupal shops but it what they need

00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:39,900
to do really depends on what the country

00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:42,450
sites need and how how complete the the

00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:45,180
platform is if the platform can provide

00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:48,960
all the solutions that country sites

00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:53,610
need they'd be doing some minor

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:57,480
modifications so as long as they are

00:20:53,610 --> 00:21:00,480
experienced with Drupal and they

00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:02,580
understand Drupal stunt best practices

00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,650
and standards it might be sufficient

00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:09,330
they may not be doing any custom

00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:12,300
development but um they need to be

00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:15,680
because the chances are they would be

00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:19,560
their mother tongue would be not the

00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:22,440
common language of the company they they

00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:26,660
need to be able to speak the company's

00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:28,830
common language fluently so if it's

00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:32,990
Spanish or English they should be able

00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:32,990
to communicate well in those languages

00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:45,030
so in order to ensure that the vendors

00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:47,780
are capable before before signing a

00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:52,860
contract with them you'd want to

00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:56,280
explicitly define set of acceptance

00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:59,220
criteria and they they must be able to

00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:03,720
understand that and execute that so if

00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:06,000
they they need to be able to they need

00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:10,080
to know what Drupal best practices are

00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:15,270
in terms of farm development and like

00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:16,980
security performance and so on and they

00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:21,230
need to be able to of course the river

00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:26,400
deliver that and if it really helps to

00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:31,320
clearly define this and before before

00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:34,110
they are designing the contract and also

00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:37,800
in terms of project management it's more

00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:40,590
difficult to assess their capability so

00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:44,220
you can ask for references and ask for

00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:46,230
customers who who are happy with the way

00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:51,120
they manage their project and you can

00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:58,110
ask them and get get first-hand opinions

00:22:51,120 --> 00:23:05,370
and information about those vendors so

00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:08,940
um so the second challenges are during

00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:12,300
the development phase so project

00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:14,430
management is well again it's a it's a

00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:17,750
common thing but because of the

00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:22,190
complexity it makes it quite challenging

00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:25,380
I myself have come across a project that

00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:29,100
didn't go very well because of because

00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:31,860
of the complexity of the of the

00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:35,060
organization organizational structure

00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:39,240
and the communication and also

00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:41,490
maintaining quality since you'd have

00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,130
multiple vendors working on the same

00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:47,510
code you really need to think about

00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:55,540
maintainability so um

00:23:47,510 --> 00:24:00,440
I'll go over these one by one so um

00:23:55,540 --> 00:24:03,560
because the companies are the company

00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:06,710
that operates internationally would tend

00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:10,700
to have quite a complex organizational

00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:14,030
structure communication would be very

00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:16,910
complex and you would have multiple

00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:20,330
stakeholders involved in from multiple

00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:22,730
departments involved in the project so

00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:29,060
as a result they would be conflicting

00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:32,150
interests and requirements and the the

00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:34,460
problem arm I've I've faced was that

00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:36,680
within the company there were two IT

00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:39,620
departments who are in charge of

00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:42,950
different parts of the the platform so

00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:46,790
they they had budget for certain parts

00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:50,510
of the the platform and the other the

00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:53,110
other department had the budget for some

00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:54,970
of the country websites and so on and

00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:58,430
because they were not coming

00:24:54,970 --> 00:25:01,220
communicating with each other the

00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:02,930
developer on the development shop had a

00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,910
real hard time capturing the

00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:08,630
requirements and building the right

00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:14,120
solution for them so managing

00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:17,750
communication is is really a key and in

00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:22,580
order to resolve that so you should

00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:26,720
simplify communication you know they are

00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:31,940
the the organization really need to come

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:34,520
up with a way to communicate their

00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:39,860
requirements to the development shop in

00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:43,990
a unified way and also to do that you

00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,990
need to clarify responsibilities and

00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:52,520
also it happens quite often in

00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:55,790
traditional development on methodologies

00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:58,820
such as waterfall which is not I don't

00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:59,900
know how common it is now but I I see

00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:05,720
that on

00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:08,350
I see still being used but um if you if

00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:10,700
you stick to traditional development

00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:14,360
methodologies you don't review often

00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:18,920
enough so you get a big documentation on

00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:22,160
requirements and you go off and spend 3

00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:24,380
3 to 6 months building the solution and

00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:28,040
finally when you have the customer

00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:32,330
review it they they tell you that it

00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:37,610
wasn't what they wanted so so revealing

00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:39,950
frequently is very important and through

00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:43,550
through better communication and

00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:47,810
frequent review providing better

00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:52,430
transparency can be possible and also a

00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:55,040
customer can't expect developers

00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:59,440
understand what they want they need to

00:26:55,040 --> 00:27:02,960
collaborate and they they need to really

00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:09,320
be involved in the be committed to the

00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:12,460
project for for them to have developers

00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:17,720
build the the right solution for them so

00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:22,070
in one word basically this is pretty

00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:27,860
much possible by doing agile so how many

00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:30,980
of you use or aware of agile project

00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:34,310
management methodology okay great and do

00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:37,460
you do use it in your projects yeah

00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:44,120
great good to hear that okay yeah and

00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:48,080
also in an agile sorry so I can't hear

00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:52,040
you quiet well it depends i mean i think

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:57,740
i think it depends on I mean personally

00:27:52,040 --> 00:28:03,140
I I really yeah yeah exactly they think

00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:07,700
it's a it's a different mindset really

00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:10,990
and also you know the way budget thing

00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:14,320
is budget budgeting works

00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:17,440
you can be slightly different so doing

00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:22,030
it properly can be quite difficult but

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:27,460
you want to do it properly and I've seen

00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:30,130
many projects that you know they say you

00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:32,290
know doing agile didn't go very well

00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:35,559
because they weren't applying the

00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:37,780
methodology properly it is challenging

00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:41,140
but it comes with all the benefits that

00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:43,000
I just talked about so you know for

00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:46,780
especially for this kind of complex

00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,660
projects you want to you want to have a

00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:53,080
good communication going and you want to

00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:56,170
make sure that you work in a customer's

00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:58,210
the customer and developers work

00:28:56,170 --> 00:29:04,870
together to build the solution that they

00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:09,400
need so I I think agile is is is a great

00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:13,510
solution for that so um as for

00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:15,850
maintaining quality I come I can't see

00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:22,450
the notes I'll find out what I I've

00:29:15,850 --> 00:29:25,840
written but so that the quality consists

00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:29,410
of different elements so I'm going to go

00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:31,630
through those I'll try to remember what

00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:34,290
I've written so okay so ensuring

00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:37,540
scalability this is slightly technical

00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:41,320
but basically when you build features

00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:44,260
for the platform it should be as you

00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:48,429
reusable as possible so if you build

00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:51,850
features that are two are you know that

00:29:48,429 --> 00:29:55,360
are too specific for certain sites then

00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:58,240
you'd need to build and and if another

00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,640
site needs a feature that is almost

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,280
identical but slightly different you'll

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,160
need to build another set of features

00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:08,710
that works for that site and then you

00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,830
will end up with five ten different

00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:14,860
features that are essentially the same

00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:17,590
but little bit different then that makes

00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:20,710
me that makes it really difficult to

00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:24,620
maintain and it also doesn't really

00:30:20,710 --> 00:30:28,700
scale so there is a great

00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:31,910
tation about this by Jeff Beeman he's

00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:34,220
he's also not kweon he's senior

00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:38,180
technical consultant and he did a

00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:40,070
presentation on this at San camp so if

00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:49,570
you're interested you can see his

00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:54,530
presentation the URL to that okay um and

00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:58,100
ensuring high maintainability so um

00:30:54,530 --> 00:31:00,050
because it's not just the main vendor

00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:02,660
that would be working on the code but

00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:05,809
you would have multiple vendors working

00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:09,800
on multiple sites that they would all go

00:31:05,809 --> 00:31:11,690
into the same same repository they they

00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,700
all need to adhere to Drupal best

00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:19,250
practices make sure they're doing the

00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:23,179
same thing in the same way and also I it

00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:26,300
you know five six to 12 months down the

00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:28,220
line if you need to make changes you

00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:31,400
need to know you need to be able to know

00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:35,510
you know what code is doing what so it

00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:38,510
needs to be well documented so another

00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:41,570
thing up until Drupal 7 some

00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:44,870
configurations on the database so it

00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:48,440
needs to be everything needs to be in

00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:50,390
the repository there's some there's a

00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:55,580
module called features that allows you

00:31:50,390 --> 00:31:57,590
to do it and the Drupal API that also

00:31:55,580 --> 00:32:00,370
allows you to do this so with with the

00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:03,050
combination of these two you can really

00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:05,710
move everything all the configuration to

00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:08,840
the code and there's a great

00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:11,150
presentation on this because I can't see

00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,850
the note I can't remember the name of

00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:15,800
the company but it's a belgian /

00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:17,450
italy-based company who did the

00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,460
presentation on this so if you're

00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:26,690
interested there's a URL at the bottom

00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:29,780
and also because you have multiple

00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:32,480
vendors working on the same chunk of

00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:36,080
code you want to somehow restrict their

00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,480
access to the repository popular way to

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:41,240
do it we also use

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:45,320
this aquia for some of the customers is

00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:52,640
to use github and pull request basically

00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:55,210
on reviewers can on accept or reject the

00:32:52,640 --> 00:33:00,350
request to merge the changes that

00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:04,130
vendors made we have I'm working with a

00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:08,919
customer who is slightly who doesn't

00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:12,080
have a very much budget and reviewing

00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:14,450
every single commit is is too

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,390
time-consuming and costly so what we've

00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:21,340
decided to do was to simplify that

00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:27,880
process a little bit by restriction

00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:32,020
restricting access to directories so if

00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:35,270
one vendor is working on the honest on a

00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:38,690
site for New Zealand office they'd only

00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:41,000
have access to the New Zealand to the

00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:44,270
directory that contains the code for the

00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,809
New Zealand office and get by default

00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:49,850
doesn't you give you that kind of

00:33:46,809 --> 00:33:54,220
granular access control but get a light

00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:59,470
allows you to do that so that makes it a

00:33:54,220 --> 00:34:02,330
little bit more simpler simpler to

00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:04,640
manage our vendors access to the repo

00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:08,389
and there's this service called get lab

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:14,210
which is based on get get a light and it

00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:19,399
allows you it gives you on same same as

00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:21,800
I say um it's quite similar to github so

00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:23,659
they have this thing called merger

00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,639
requesters which is essentially pull

00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:28,700
requests and you can you can manage

00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:31,639
users and teams in the same way but it's

00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:37,070
more powerful so for this customer we

00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:41,020
use this as well and like I mentioned

00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:44,149
it's it's quite important that you make

00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:48,470
the components as reusable as possible

00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:50,130
and avoid unnecessary dependencies so

00:34:48,470 --> 00:34:52,410
you can you can only

00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:55,350
you would only have one version if you

00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:58,290
if you end up with multiple versions of

00:34:55,350 --> 00:35:01,880
sight because of some dependencies with

00:34:58,290 --> 00:35:05,400
modules then you'd end up in maintaining

00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:08,640
multiple versions of besides or multiple

00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:10,710
versions of the platforms so it's it

00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:15,470
really degrades the meaning of having a

00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:18,360
platform so you'd want to stick to a

00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:23,070
single single version of the platform

00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:25,830
and having automated test continuous

00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:29,970
integration which is also very important

00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:32,610
because you make one change to the

00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:36,150
platform and that gets applied across

00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:40,860
older 20 30 sites so you want to make

00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:45,420
sure that those changes are up to common

00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:49,500
features don't break any sites and also

00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:52,200
if you're building a platform that which

00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,810
you know 20 30 sites is going to be

00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:59,700
based on you want to you want to have

00:35:54,810 --> 00:36:05,880
the platform built as as nicely as

00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:08,070
possible so before up letting multiple

00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:11,100
country sites migrate to the platform

00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:13,290
you'd want to do a site audit to make

00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:21,170
sure that the platform is built in there

00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:24,990
in a sound and an maintainable fashion

00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:27,690
and also documentation it's quite

00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:30,600
important well it's you know it's

00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:35,370
important for any any science really but

00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:38,570
especially because it's shared among the

00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:42,390
different different country offices

00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:46,080
having having a documentation which

00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:48,030
older the local vendors can refer to is

00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:51,810
quite important so it's not only about

00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:54,620
documenting your code but on documenting

00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:58,410
how features are built how they should

00:36:54,620 --> 00:37:01,150
interact with or how they should be put

00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:05,890
together so on

00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:10,559
quite important security is another

00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:15,599
challenge so making sure you know that

00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:18,609
there are you know common and easy

00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,789
mistakes that you can make to to make

00:37:18,609 --> 00:37:25,480
your site vulnerable for example

00:37:20,789 --> 00:37:30,940
enabling PHP filter or things like that

00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:33,490
and this kind of check can be done by

00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:36,430
you know scripts it can it can be

00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:39,309
automated so you use that you should

00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:43,349
have that kind of automated checks for

00:37:39,309 --> 00:37:46,960
this kind of this kind of issue and also

00:37:43,349 --> 00:37:49,720
like like site audit doing a security

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:55,539
audit for the platform would be quite

00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:59,349
important as well and in terms of their

00:37:55,539 --> 00:38:04,329
performance so it's it's more or less

00:37:59,349 --> 00:38:05,710
more or less common sense stuff so you

00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:09,760
know you won't clean they enable

00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:13,150
internal external caching and this this

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:17,170
is something that um if um if you're

00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:20,170
hosting your site on Acquia cloud we do

00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:23,799
this practically so if if a customer

00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:27,609
terms of the external caching by mistake

00:38:23,799 --> 00:38:31,779
we we'd get notified immediately because

00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:34,359
the site is in risk so you know this

00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:38,920
kind of check can be also done manually

00:38:34,359 --> 00:38:42,220
and also because well if you if you

00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:44,710
decide to have all those country sites

00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:47,349
on the same stack you'd want to perform

00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:50,799
a load test on all the sites on the on

00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:52,839
the stack because doing doing a load

00:38:50,799 --> 00:38:56,680
test on the single site wouldn't really

00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:59,020
make sense because the the load that the

00:38:56,680 --> 00:39:01,960
stock would be experiencing is the sum

00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:04,630
of the load of all the sites so you want

00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:12,069
to perform a load test on the entire

00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:14,680
platform as a new site launches so as I

00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:17,290
mentioned there are many many

00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:22,450
things that need to be checked but that

00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:26,500
can be done automatically so we built it

00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:31,300
if you if you have your sights on aqua

00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:34,180
network you can run this thing called

00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:40,120
inside which basically tells you the the

00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:43,720
health of your your site how well it how

00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:47,650
well it adheres the best practices how

00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:50,050
will it set up in terms of SEO how well

00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:52,720
it set up in terms of performance but

00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:55,780
you can also do this thing called

00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:59,380
instant insight so even if you're not a

00:39:55,780 --> 00:40:02,410
narc we're customer you can go to this

00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:07,210
URL so inside the aqueduct chrome /

00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:10,270
instant insight and you enter URL of

00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:13,060
your Drupal site and we do a scan and

00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:15,670
tell you how how well your site is built

00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:19,000
basically it's it's quite interesting

00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:21,940
and I don't know if it's still running

00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,600
but there's this campaign that if you

00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:30,790
get a the great aid for all the all the

00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:32,790
criteria will send your t-shirt so yeah

00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:38,500
you can you can try that out and see how

00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:42,280
your site is would be rated okay so

00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:45,850
finally the challenge is during the

00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:48,780
operation and maintenance phase so our

00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:51,580
change release and deploy management is

00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:53,470
can be quite complex because of the

00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:56,380
number of the sites you have as well as

00:40:53,470 --> 00:41:01,660
the number of vendors that are involved

00:40:56,380 --> 00:41:07,690
in the project and also because you'd

00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:11,260
have different vendors and you know if

00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:15,850
you're outsourcing hosting support can

00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:19,840
be a little bit complex so I I'll go

00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:25,180
through that one by one so governance

00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:27,010
does change management because

00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:29,859
multiple sites share the same codebase

00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:34,200
you you'd really want to be careful

00:41:29,859 --> 00:41:39,309
about making changes so you you need to

00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:43,180
us as you make or as you plan for for

00:41:39,309 --> 00:41:46,240
changes you'd need to assess and make

00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:48,369
sure that arm it wouldn't negatively

00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:54,280
affect some of the sites that you have

00:41:48,369 --> 00:41:56,559
and you want to have preferably you want

00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:59,530
to have a formal process like it you'd

00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:01,930
want to have change control board and

00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:05,829
you know you you apply for the change

00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:11,170
and you assess the change and approve

00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:13,540
and things like that and also release

00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:16,270
management when you make changes to

00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:19,750
common features it would affect all the

00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:21,910
sides so you would want to do a

00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:23,319
regression test if the changes are

00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:26,920
significant you'd want to do a

00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:31,180
regression test for all the sites but in

00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:34,240
order for in order to make sure that all

00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:38,290
the sites are functioning as as they

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:40,270
should it can only be done really by the

00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:44,799
the webmasters of the country sites

00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:48,790
because no one would know how all those

00:42:44,799 --> 00:42:53,549
20 sites should be behave behaving some

00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:58,210
sites may have some custom features and

00:42:53,549 --> 00:43:01,780
the people in people in the central

00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:05,799
office may not be aware of how how it

00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:08,619
works exactly so by schedule scheduling

00:43:05,799 --> 00:43:13,930
releases you'd be able to allocate you

00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:16,150
know provide let's send send out notices

00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:21,690
and give them enough time to allocate

00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:25,210
resource for the regression tests and

00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:30,430
also because you have multiple vendors

00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:32,950
involved in the in the development you

00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:36,190
don't want all of them to be able to

00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:38,700
push code to production as when they

00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:42,819
want so you'd need to have

00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:48,400
in quite strict on access control and

00:43:42,819 --> 00:43:52,450
deployment management as well and for

00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:55,119
governance using racy so racy stands for

00:43:52,450 --> 00:43:59,559
responsible accountable consulted and

00:43:55,119 --> 00:44:02,650
informed having this kind of chart is

00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:07,119
really useful because you wouldn't be

00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:09,279
saying okay this vendor is responsible

00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:14,890
for doing this but you can you can

00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:19,450
really describe more more precisely

00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:22,720
which party is which party is

00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:25,349
responsible for what action and also

00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:28,839
even within the company like I mentioned

00:44:25,349 --> 00:44:31,299
companies would have complex

00:44:28,839 --> 00:44:33,849
organizational structure so you'd want

00:44:31,299 --> 00:44:38,079
to have which department isn't in charge

00:44:33,849 --> 00:44:46,359
of what action and racy really helps you

00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:48,910
to to clarify so challenge would support

00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:52,900
is that there would be multiple levels

00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:55,809
of support editors would be asking you

00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:59,739
know how to insert videos to an article

00:44:55,809 --> 00:45:02,440
for example and they they may also find

00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:06,489
some pages that aren't functioning as

00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:09,819
they should and there may be some issues

00:45:06,489 --> 00:45:14,589
with hosting so if I'm the editor has a

00:45:09,819 --> 00:45:16,989
problem they can you know it's some

00:45:14,589 --> 00:45:19,960
editorial issues maybe they can resolve

00:45:16,989 --> 00:45:23,049
that internally but some some technical

00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:26,289
issues for example in some sun blocks

00:45:23,049 --> 00:45:29,019
are not displaying or if you know if

00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:33,220
they get a white screen of death who

00:45:29,019 --> 00:45:36,700
should pay contact they this editors

00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:39,519
shouldn't have to editor's you know that

00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:42,249
it just don't have to know different you

00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:44,109
know vendors and you know they don't

00:45:42,249 --> 00:45:47,849
have to make decisions on whom to

00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:51,069
contact so one way to resolve that is to

00:45:47,849 --> 00:45:51,830
example build a web form with a this

00:45:51,069 --> 00:45:55,340
isn't this

00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:59,920
trees in the in the back end so by

00:45:55,340 --> 00:46:03,710
selecting few options so is this you use

00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:06,710
you know you answer a few questions like

00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:12,170
whether it's a problem with the website

00:46:06,710 --> 00:46:15,670
or some questions regarding content

00:46:12,170 --> 00:46:19,430
creation and then the webform would send

00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:22,760
support tickets to risk respective

00:46:19,430 --> 00:46:28,010
parties so it would simplify the

00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:30,920
communication and also if multiple

00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:33,490
parties are providing support you want

00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:37,910
to make sure that it's comprehensive and

00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:39,830
each vendor covers you know you should

00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:45,100
make sure each vendor covers what others

00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:48,110
are not covering so you can the support

00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:56,900
contract would cover all the foreseeable

00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:58,880
problems and finally there are there are

00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:02,780
legal requirements in different

00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:05,840
countries for example in the EU you need

00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:09,110
to store all the personal information

00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:12,560
within EU so although for example our

00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:14,990
career has hardware uses some of the

00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:18,290
data centers in in the States we can't

00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:22,630
offer those two or European customers

00:47:18,290 --> 00:47:26,120
they need to they need to use our arm

00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:30,530
the Amazons data center in Ireland and

00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:33,140
also in Germany there's a law that all

00:47:30,530 --> 00:47:36,650
the personal information needs to be

00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:40,550
stored within Germany so they can't even

00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:46,570
use this data center in Ireland so what

00:47:40,550 --> 00:47:51,560
we did was that the site is hosted in

00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:53,780
the the island data center but when you

00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:56,510
pull the the customer information that

00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:58,370
comes from some some server that's

00:47:56,510 --> 00:48:01,500
hosted within Germany and that's

00:47:58,370 --> 00:48:05,530
displayed within an iframe

00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:07,930
then it's pretty you know it's bit silly

00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:09,820
but it's it's a you know it's law and

00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:12,340
you have to adhere to that and you want

00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:16,000
to make sure that you you build the

00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:21,340
right solution that you know that and

00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:26,380
adheres the law and also if you are if

00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:28,810
you have all the 20 sites in in 11

00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:34,330
region for example if you have all those

00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:38,440
sites hosted on in island but you know

00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:40,330
some of us excuse me some of the the web

00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:43,000
sites are for say like Hong Kong a

00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:47,260
singapore there would be latency issues

00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:49,150
so one you know one obvious way to one

00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:54,100
of the obvious ways to resolve that is

00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:57,610
by using like CDN like Akamai for

00:48:54,100 --> 00:49:02,260
example that you can also distribute

00:48:57,610 --> 00:49:03,820
hosting as well but look if if latency

00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:07,960
becomes a big issue you want to

00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:13,380
certainly pay attention to that so I

00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:16,660
think that's all thank you very much and

00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:19,770
yeah if you have any questions I think

00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:19,770
we have five minutes

00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:43,870
how many sides is too much in one dork

00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:47,480
route I i think it's it's a tricky one

00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:50,570
it kind of depends on what you're you

00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:54,230
know what your stack is and also how

00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:57,560
your site site how complex to your site

00:49:54,230 --> 00:50:01,040
is but our career we have customers who

00:49:57,560 --> 00:50:11,080
have like 80 sights on a single doc

00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:16,100
route or 120 plus I think so sorry 160

00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:19,100
well talk talk to us but yeah I think

00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:22,070
yeah I mean it i guess it depends on

00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:24,800
what kind of site it is really but yeah

00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:27,250
from from what i've seen i'm pretty sure

00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,250
it's possible

00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:53,720
right so what's the reason for for

00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:53,720
dividing the the two

00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:10,750
right um yeah well it I mean you know

00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:13,240
for like latency reasons it you know you

00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:18,460
might want to consider geologically you

00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:21,160
know placing one arm one set of sites in

00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:23,950
11 region and another set of sites in

00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:27,089
another regions but if you can combine

00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:30,119
the two in you know run it in one

00:51:27,089 --> 00:51:34,740
geographical location then you know I

00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:34,740
personally don't see an issue in that

00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:53,640
right okay

00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,190
right

00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:29,950
ok

00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:34,940
hmm

00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:49,100
right

00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:26,730
right um so um it's kind of a complex

00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:29,040
access control I've I've only I've only

00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:33,480
been dealt with what I just talked about

00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:36,720
so one is github a pull request or get a

00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:38,720
light or using you know get lab which

00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:44,760
basically which is basically built on

00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:47,340
get alight so do you want them to be

00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:51,230
able to push it push their change all

00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:51,230
the way across through the production or

00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,480
right

00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:11,290
hmm

00:54:16,859 --> 00:54:19,519
right

00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:39,180
for continuous integration okay shall we

00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:40,740
