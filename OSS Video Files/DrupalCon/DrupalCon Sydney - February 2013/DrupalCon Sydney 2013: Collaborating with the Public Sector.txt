Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Collaborating with the Public Sector
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	This presentation will drive at the heart of the 'what and how' a Drupal business can do to engage with and create positive outcomes for public sector organisations.

If you are interested in working more effectively with the gorvernment market, this talk will give you the information you need to know to create solutions that resonate with your clients. We'll identify the key people who need to be involved and how to get to them.

As organisations grow in the public sector, they are subject to more stringent requirements for content management and record keeping, such as the Archives Act 1983 (Australia) and the Public Records Act 2005 (New Zealand). We'll briefly look at what that means for Drupal.

Modern EDRM Systems provide web service APIs that give unprecedented capabilities and opportunities for Drupal-oriented organisations to integrate best practice UI/UX and build fantastic public and internal websites.

We'll talk about:

Business strategy - Why work with the public sector? What opportunities exist for your company to get into public sector work?
What is the sales cycle in the public sector? Did you know that 12 to 18 months is considered normal?
Successfully responding to 'Request for Proposal' style tenders. Like CVs, what will get your RFP response in the 'Keep' pile and out of the 'Unsuccessful' pile.
The language of public sector procurement.
Where Drupal fits into the enterprise architecture and how to communicate that to Government CIOs.
Today, public sector workers are educated, computer-literate people who have to do more with less as part of government pressures. They expect responsive interfaces, contextual work environments and solutions that solve business problems.

Drupal is incredibly well placed to be the engine bringing the Web to life for organisations that ultimately exist to serve us - their citizens.

okay hello everyone and welcome to the

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:05,940
next session in the business and

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,059
strategy track a few familiar faces here

00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,910
I noticed people are following tracks

00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:16,080
more or less i think and i hope that's

00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:18,869
been a good strategy for you now today

00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,400
we have the next session now is

00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,100
collaborating with the public sector by

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,410
david Cal Callie and have i I've

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,279
actually said that correctly other night

00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:29,279
excellent just so it's always worth

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,630
while checking we'll just leave that

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,279
door open for a little bit I'll shut

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,430
that in a minute while people still come

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,300
in and this is a session that I've

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,149
really been looking forward to

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,460
personally because i think it's sessions

00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,800
like this session and also the next

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,989
session where philip ruben will be

00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,870
speaking about selling Drupal to large

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,390
enterprise that really underpin the

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,820
theme of the conference which is growing

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:56,309
Drupal down under so really i think you

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,489
know we need to look carefully into

00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:01,440
moving dribble into large organizations

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,180
including government and enterprises so

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,750
this session obviously is

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,549
focusing on government now David is

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:11,310
their business solutions consultant for

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,229
objective corporation in New Zealand he

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,299
consults with the public sector to bring

00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,970
together end-to-end enterprise solutions

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:20,580
enabling organizations to do more with

00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:21,750
less which I find to be very intriguing

00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,820
and I'm sure we're going to find out a

00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:25,740
little bit about what he does and how he

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:33,780
does it in a minute so could you please

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:38,220
welcome David Cal Cully wonderful thank

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:39,840
you thank you all right have you guys

00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,810
been enjoying the conference so far if

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,590
you have say yes yes fantastic alright

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:50,000
so let's have a quick look about the

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:53,759
public sector so a little bit about me I

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,240
started developing software at age 12 I

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,829
got my first turbo c compiler and i was

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,399
working out what on earth does all these

00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:03,299
symbols mean and from there I started

00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:07,740
developing various bits of software and

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:10,289
she'll I got into web and my first real

00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,239
job was developing Drupal brochure sites

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:12,870
for a graphic design agency and so we'd

00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,629
create

00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,610
various types of websites that would

00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:19,890
start off from the simple five pages

00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:22,560
about us contact who we are what we do

00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,750
through to the Pacific coast or come

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,120
today you which one the New South Wales

00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:29,190
tourism gold prize in 2011 so that's a

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,110
iphone app and a website that helps you

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,230
plan your holiday between Sydney and

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,720
Brisbane then I moved on to integrating

00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,099
CBC room with Drupal alfresco bit of

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,560
document management records management

00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:42,269
all tied together with this custom zend

00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,790
framework and that was really the first

00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:48,030
time where I'd seen open source product

00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,440
eyes in an actual product then I got

00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,760
shoulder tapped and said look you're

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,730
doing this stuff why don't you come over

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,940
to New Zealand and do this for the

00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:59,040
public sector and I don't know okay why

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,359
would I go to Wellington then they sent

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,879
me to Wellington just just try it out

00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:03,810
have a look and so far I haven't looked

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,079
back it's been absolutely brilliant

00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:08,819
living in Wellington so what I do is I

00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:11,370
work exclusively with the public sector

00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:14,040
and some very large enterprises that

00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,620
work with the public sector so the

00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,840
perspective I'll give you today is

00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,880
essentially how would you target large

00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:24,060
enterprises that have very stringent

00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:27,870
requirements and the same carried over

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:30,060
to a government organization so to cover

00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:31,349
off today we'll have a look to get

00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,329
everyone on the same page we'll have a

00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:34,590
look at exactly what a public sector

00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:37,739
organisation looks like what they do

00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:40,290
what they get up to and will then go and

00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:42,870
say where can we fit your solution in

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,180
there how can you sell it and how to

00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:48,329
follow this slippery process that we

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:53,910
call due process and we'll have a look

00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:57,480
at that so a typical cross-section is a

00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:58,739
minister than a secretary executives

00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,900
public servants and then a supply chain

00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:03,750
underneath so just to make sure or on

00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,000
the same page typically the department

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:07,470
of a government is secretary and

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,879
executives and public servants and the

00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:14,250
other to fit in alongside that so the

00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:15,750
minister is the only person that is

00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:18,449
elected by the public this is the people

00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,269
you ballot for and put the paper in the

00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:23,130
ballot box now they administer what's

00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:25,720
called a portfolio NAT portfolio is a

00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,610
group of departments for example you

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,830
might administer the minute you might be

00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:32,710
the Minister for agriculture and you'll

00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,510
administ agriculture fisheries waterways

00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:37,420
and a few other things that are related

00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:38,800
now they promote what's called outcomes

00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,810
and as you can see outcomes is in

00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,660
italics on the screen there and that's

00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:47,200
because outcomes is a keyword if you go

00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:49,780
to a departmental website you will find

00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,400
their outcome statement or you will find

00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:54,100
their statement of intent the mission

00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:57,730
statement and it will be our outcomes

00:04:54,100 --> 00:05:01,000
are to deliver X Y and said now outcomes

00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:04,060
are there are two edged sword really

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,230
their varied their ethereal there could

00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,000
be something like we're going to

00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,010
increase the efficiency of the public

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,470
transport network they could be

00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:14,110
something that is very very specific

00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:17,500
such as we're going to commit 200

00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:20,470
million to rural education so outcomes

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,120
really are the trend setting or the

00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,980
direction setting of a government

00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:29,770
department now then comes the secretary

00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:32,050
the secretary is the CEO essentially of

00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:34,210
an organization they're appointed by a

00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:35,919
minister for a fixed term usually a

00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,870
contract of about three to five years

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,310
and they report to the minister and they

00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,350
have to deliver that outcome thought

00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,000
that means is the minister goes to the

00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:45,430
media puts their hand on heart and says

00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,220
we're going to deliver this then they go

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,180
back to the secretary and says um I just

00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,940
told everyone out there you have to

00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:54,700
deliver it and that is why secretaries

00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:57,370
get gray hair very quickly so they have

00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:59,520
to deliver it now executives the

00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:02,350
executives manage the day-to-day

00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:05,320
operation so what they do is they create

00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:07,630
budgets they allocate resources and they

00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:10,780
produce what's called outputs so that's

00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:12,970
a very key term there as well outputs of

00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:17,410
what the organization produces as a

00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:18,490
result of day-to-day work now sometimes

00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,500
they're called different things

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:23,310
assistant secretaries deputy assistant

00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:27,640
secretaries usually they have a chief

00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:30,790
officer in their title so CIO CFO CTO

00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,050
that kind of stuff in the police and

00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:34,060
military there might be Deputy

00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:36,520
Commissioner major general lieutenant

00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,470
general that kind of thing so the

00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,430
outputs they deliver are actually

00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:42,430
legislated so

00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:45,970
if they say we're going to deliver some

00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:48,250
kind of output which is public transport

00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:50,620
they have to deliver that transport in

00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:53,890
order to get funding so what they do is

00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,660
actually very very important then we

00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:58,300
have the public servants so these are

00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,660
the middle managers and the staff making

00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,710
the world go round so HR finance IT

00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,050
frontline staff so they do the

00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:07,180
day-to-day work and they consume the

00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:10,000
resources that have been allocated by

00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:12,400
the executives and so part of their work

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,610
contributes towards this output which is

00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:17,080
the direction the organization is going

00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:18,760
so then at the end of it you've got the

00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,620
supply chains of private supplies of

00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,900
goods and services other public

00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:25,470
organizations that for instance you

00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:29,020
might have a land information department

00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:30,970
they do a geospatial surveying mapping

00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:33,850
and they might provide the result of

00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:36,190
their work to a local council who deals

00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:38,640
in streets roads properties so that kind

00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:41,650
of thing and then we've got vendors now

00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,810
vendors deliver and support a good of

00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,750
service now it could be that vendors do

00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:49,420
something cheaper faster and quicker

00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:51,580
than having to train the internal staff

00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,230
so by having to train internal stuff

00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,600
you're taking them off the role that

00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:57,520
they're good at and making them trained

00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,380
in something that they're going to be

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,210
good at a later time so it may be

00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:04,090
cheaper just to get a vendor to come in

00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:08,440
and do that bit for you the corollary to

00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:10,450
that is that you can free up staff to do

00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:12,910
a better job by coming in and taking

00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:14,740
over some kind of function so being a

00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:17,920
vendor is a really good place to be if

00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:20,170
you can say hey we can make you put more

00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:22,600
stuff into the frontline serving the

00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,460
citizens by clearing up the back office

00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,100
so rather than having ten people

00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,750
scanning your emails let's send you your

00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,400
letters let's send them to a mail

00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,990
processing center where it's

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,510
automatically scanned and automatically

00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,640
put into your system and those 10 people

00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:39,150
can then go and start serving more

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:43,180
customers who come into your front door

00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:44,740
so that's what vendors can do now let's

00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:46,180
think about levels you've got Minister

00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,370
Secretary executives public servants

00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,380
supply chain and sometimes it can get a

00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:53,170
bit complicated as to who does what

00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,990
because a minister can look at

00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:59,019
one or two departments or two or three

00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:00,190
portfolios or more than one Minister can

00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:03,160
look after one so it's a bit of a

00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:05,139
many-to-many relationship then Mad

00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,209
Hatter style everyone changed seats

00:09:05,139 --> 00:09:09,430
machinery of government changed that's a

00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:11,470
technical term everyone shuffles around

00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:13,360
departments are moved here and put there

00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,810
then all the sudden the contacts you've

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,490
been developing are gone so rather than

00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,110
thinking about who's the one particular

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,120
person in a generic sense let's think

00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:24,730
about the different levels we've got the

00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,949
political level the executive level and

00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,620
the operational level so what that means

00:09:26,949 --> 00:09:31,060
is if you're a director of a company you

00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,279
really want to be engaging at the

00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:34,810
political and executive level because

00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,079
that's what the government expects you

00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:39,940
to do if you are a for example a

00:09:38,079 --> 00:09:43,029
Solutions Architect you would wanted to

00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:44,769
exec am you would want to connect to

00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:46,899
people at the operational level and

00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:49,480
perhaps the executive level to get them

00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:51,730
to understand what you're proposing so

00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,800
the levels essentially allow us to

00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:55,720
abstract away the people that are

00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,209
shuffling and allow us to concentrate

00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,550
okay we're targeting these people this

00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:02,740
week and these people next week to give

00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:08,699
them the resources they need to work

00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:08,699
together so let's work with these levels

00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:15,910
the outcomes get promoted from the

00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:19,930
political level the outputs come out of

00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:22,690
the operational level so in a sense what

00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:24,399
this means is that the outcomes is the

00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:26,980
direction the minister and the

00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,560
government is saying this is where we

00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,680
need to go the outputs is where the

00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:34,269
organization is actually going and

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,430
sometimes as Kate Lundy said this

00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:38,260
morning it's a big ship and turning that

00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:41,890
ship around to start going a different

00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:44,140
direction can be difficult so what does

00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:47,860
this mean for us as people who supply

00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:51,370
goods and services well when outcomes

00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:53,199
don't match the outputs that is the best

00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,000
place for you to be because that is the

00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:56,319
place where you can say hey I realize

00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,579
you're going in this direction but your

00:10:56,319 --> 00:11:00,069
minister says you have to go in this

00:10:57,579 --> 00:11:02,470
direction we've got some low-cost stuff

00:11:00,069 --> 00:11:04,160
we can do to save the headache of having

00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:08,959
to switch everything at once

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:11,360
so it is the best place for you to be to

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:14,540
realize this value proposition and that

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:17,120
value proposition is become a trusted

00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:19,339
advisor become the person that the CIO

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,920
goes I've got this headache who do I

00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:24,350
talk to I know I'll talk to my mate give

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,269
them a call he'll give me some good and

00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,819
bad ideas and i'll be able to get at

00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:31,550
least a picture of what's out there what

00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:34,519
i can do so the best position to be in

00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:37,040
is to be where the organization knows

00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:39,529
that the app comes in the outputs aren't

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,199
matching they know that you've got a

00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:44,509
plan to help it but more importantly

00:11:42,199 --> 00:11:46,610
they know that you're helping them get a

00:11:44,509 --> 00:11:47,660
plan to get funding because in the

00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:52,129
government nothing happens without

00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:55,610
funding now how do you how do you find

00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:57,889
out exactly where things are not working

00:11:55,610 --> 00:12:00,350
and how do you find out where you can

00:11:57,889 --> 00:12:03,319
fit in well it comes down to something

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:05,480
called enterprise architecture so

00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:09,259
enterprise architecture is the place

00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:12,050
where business meets IT so every

00:12:09,259 --> 00:12:13,250
organization has of a certain size every

00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:15,199
organization has what's called an

00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,540
enterprise architect and you they have

00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:19,149
different titles you can find them by

00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:22,069
the couple of key things what they do

00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:24,860
they create the three to five-year road

00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:26,720
maps of the whole ecosystem so you might

00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,209
have an infrastructure architect asst

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,980
information architect and network

00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:33,589
architect so they all put together their

00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:37,939
roadmaps to create the plan of what is

00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:40,970
it that we're going to do so they report

00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:43,910
to the CIO or sometimes for small

00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:45,649
organizations they are the CIO so what

00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:48,220
you straight away know is ok we know the

00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:52,939
CIO let's have a look down the corporate

00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:54,769
the corporate chain and see who reports

00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:58,399
sort of maybe they are the enterprise

00:12:54,769 --> 00:13:00,500
architect so why is enterprise

00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:04,009
architecture really really really

00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:06,879
important the reason why is because

00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:10,879
enterprise architecture is the recipe

00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:12,439
for the organization so for example if

00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,959
the enterprise architects are going you

00:13:12,439 --> 00:13:17,540
know what we haven't invested in our

00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:20,209
phone system for the last 10 years

00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:22,399
let's for the next 12 months really

00:13:20,209 --> 00:13:24,230
focus on getting a state-of-the-art VoIP

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,420
based system that people can just take

00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:28,550
their phone sit another desk in our

00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:29,839
other regional office plug-in they know

00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:32,110
where they are their phone number

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:36,139
automatically routes to them they get

00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:39,259
WAV files sent to them as voicemails via

00:13:36,139 --> 00:13:40,459
email let's do that now twelve months

00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:42,740
they have agreed they're going to focus

00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:46,009
on this if you come in trying to sell

00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,569
them a website they're focused on

00:13:46,009 --> 00:13:50,329
something completely different and you

00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:52,329
may be facing some disappointment when

00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:58,610
you get the pushback and the resistance

00:13:52,329 --> 00:14:00,889
so again it's the it's the 8020 rule if

00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:02,209
you have a new cio or a new enterprise

00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:04,430
architect they're going to want to make

00:14:02,209 --> 00:14:06,199
some quick wins and quick wins means

00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:09,380
they get their stripes they get the

00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:12,230
reputation in the organization to make

00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:16,279
the stuff they won't happen so what can

00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:18,139
you do to bring together the business

00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,990
and the IT side to get some quick wins

00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:24,319
on the board so there's usually a

00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:26,680
personality issue the business has some

00:14:24,319 --> 00:14:29,000
requirements IT has some requirements

00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,220
usually business is at the end of the

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,370
day headed by the CFO the person who

00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:36,949
signs the check the accountant I T is

00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:39,230
headed by the CIO the person who brings

00:14:36,949 --> 00:14:41,180
together so what happens is the CFO

00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:43,850
stands over here in the CIO come c and

00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:45,649
the CFO thinks this guy coming to me

00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:47,990
again wanting to spend money on gadgets

00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:49,880
and this that and the other all i want

00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:52,550
to do is manage the risk of my

00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:54,079
investments why is it such a difficult

00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:56,779
thing to be happy with what you've

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,850
already got the cio on the other hand is

00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:00,740
coming and saying we've got to do this

00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:02,870
particular outcome because your guys

00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,380
told my guys that they need to start

00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:08,600
using Dropbox in-house well you can't do

00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,740
that well exactly that's why we need

00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,930
another solution so the conversation

00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:15,009
happens and usually there's a bit of a

00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:18,319
clash between the two so can you be a

00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:20,720
friend to the CFO no cio if you can

00:15:18,319 --> 00:15:22,670
bring them together then you're in that

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,529
trusted advisor role that says hey look

00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:27,230
i can help you get on the good side with

00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:29,720
a CFO this solution that i'm proposing

00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,980
you will manage the risk of whatever the

00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,940
CFO is afraid of

00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:36,500
and vice versa so there's a word on

00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,740
there called innovative and innovative

00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:40,760
is overused but let's say in government

00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:44,959
innovative is used to describe an

00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:48,920
outcome that links to an output of a

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:51,680
public organization so the principal is

00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:54,620
called do more with less so organization

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,990
or a department that's called innovative

00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,420
is a department that can go in and say

00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:01,790
hey you've cut our budget but that's

00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:03,620
okay we've rearranged our internal

00:16:01,790 --> 00:16:06,560
processes we've done a few different

00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,329
things and now we're delivering a better

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:12,380
service than before thanks for cutting

00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:14,779
our budget it's not a worry to us that

00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:16,639
is an innovative government organization

00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:19,639
and the best thing is you can help them

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,250
become that so as part of enterprise

00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:24,889
architecture there is something called

00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:29,120
the road map the road map is a three to

00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:31,490
five year plan of what application

00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,670
systems what infrastructure systems are

00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:37,579
going to be put into the whole

00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:40,190
enterprise so there's a couple of names

00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:42,850
their togaf my key to porno dragon 1 EA

00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:46,639
they are essentially different

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:49,370
methodologies now togaf is by far the

00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:52,190
most popular one if you're talking to

00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:55,910
see iOS and enterprise architects really

00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:59,180
really helpful if you know the TOGAF are

00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:01,819
naming the domain specific terms because

00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:05,449
what it does it allows you to create a

00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:06,890
plan that the cio everyone we're human

00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:09,020
we don't want to do more work than we

00:17:06,890 --> 00:17:11,299
have to the CIA can take your plan and

00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:13,069
you say hey this is already using the

00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:15,350
right terminology it's already using the

00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:17,990
right concepts I can just integrate this

00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:20,540
into my roadmap and that puts you in a

00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:25,040
fantastic position as that trusted

00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:29,120
advisor of goods and services so so what

00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,740
that means really is if you're coming in

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,710
and saying hey we've got this awesome

00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:36,080
website we can do for you but the

00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:37,490
business doesn't want a website then

00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,870
really it's like having a waiting room

00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:41,090
where you're sitting then you've got a

00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:42,580
to think and a doctor comes into and

00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:45,970
says hey

00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:47,769
you know what I'm a splint doctor so

00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,750
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:51,279
get your leg measurements we're going to

00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,890
create this awesome cast for you we're

00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:55,480
going to iteratively put the cast on and

00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,850
we're going to let it set for a bit and

00:17:55,480 --> 00:18:00,130
then we'll go live by taking the cast

00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:03,250
off and voila you'll have a perfect non

00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:06,130
broken leg you're sitting there with a

00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:08,559
tooth not a leg same thing with a

00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:10,779
roadmap if the roadmap is saying we've

00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,299
already just invested a number of

00:18:10,779 --> 00:18:14,860
dollars in our online presence we're

00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:18,220
going to focus on something internal

00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,330
keep hounding the people is just going

00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,440
to make them your enemy they're not

00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:22,240
going to be friends with you because you

00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:24,250
keep annoying them because they've got a

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,250
different headache to fix than the one

00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:30,610
you're suggesting but what you can do is

00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:34,059
you can say hey I realize I'm selling

00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:35,889
you web but I know a guy who does some

00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:38,320
kind of VoIP infrastructure maybe I can

00:18:35,889 --> 00:18:39,429
put the two of you together might be

00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,110
able to have a chat and come up with

00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:43,179
something so what that means is you

00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:46,240
become the connector and the connector

00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:50,350
is a very important thing because if you

00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:52,600
have this network of people who rely who

00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:55,330
you rely on and they rely on you you're

00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:57,340
at the center of knowing our yeah so

00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:00,460
this person I've just spoken to I've got

00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:02,919
this mate is looking to upgrade his

00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:04,000
infrastructure but you know what I've do

00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:06,549
you want to meet with him have a chat

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,960
yeah sure in the course of discussion

00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:10,210
you might find out that one of his

00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,309
clients is looking to upgrade their

00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:13,480
website and all of a sudden tit for tat

00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:15,429
you've both got a bit of business

00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,769
together in the future you'll be more

00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:19,720
willing to share and that is a really

00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:23,590
powerful networking opportunity for you

00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:25,029
so assist the cios whether or not you

00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,700
get have a good or service right now

00:19:25,029 --> 00:19:31,929
doesn't mean you can't provide someone

00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:34,659
to them to help them with that so know

00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:36,909
the terms know togaf know the language

00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:39,639
that is used because that's really

00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:41,919
important it's straight away you're part

00:19:39,639 --> 00:19:43,510
of their group of their world and they

00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,070
see that you understand what they're

00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:49,570
talking about what they're paying points

00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:51,730
are so this is the TOGAF enterprise

00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:52,840
architecture this is their statement you

00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,179
don't have to read all of it but

00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,380
essentially enterprise architecture

00:19:55,179 --> 00:19:59,980
according to toga

00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:02,290
is a way to optimize existing and legacy

00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:04,630
business processes to make them more

00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:06,940
responsive to change because the issue

00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:09,940
is not that an organization is

00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:12,220
profitable or unprofitable the issue is

00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,140
that we're with the web with the

00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,510
Internet moving so quickly our

00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,340
technology changes so often if an

00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:20,740
organization can't change and keep up

00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:22,630
with the times very quickly it becomes a

00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:26,020
case study or a post-mortem of an

00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:28,870
organization so this is why so many

00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:31,090
people it used hoga to essentially

00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:35,860
manage their infrastructure it's like

00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:37,810
using six sigma for production so there

00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:41,020
are four big innovative outcomes in

00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:43,000
government they're talked about non-stop

00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:45,280
and if you want ur you need to know them

00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:49,930
off the top of your head social Big Data

00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:52,000
mobile cloud now the cios are talking

00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:54,370
about them not because the term is

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,740
overused but because what each term

00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:58,960
represents to them now in terms of

00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:01,450
social for an author for enterprise and

00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,940
a government organization being social

00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:06,190
means that you get feedback as soon as

00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,770
you go to market so your citizens can

00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:10,930
talk to you your constituents can talk

00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:13,330
to you big data means that what you can

00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:15,310
do is you can analyze all the

00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:17,740
information that you can collect and

00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:20,920
then start creating metrics and say well

00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:24,940
we've spent 20 million dollars on this

00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:26,560
feature but fifty percent of our users

00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:28,360
are using a different feature so let's

00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,340
invest some money on that so what that

00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:33,580
means is that government organizations

00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:35,170
particularly can effectively manage

00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:36,580
public funds and that's a really

00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:39,370
important thing which we'll cover in a

00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:43,450
bit mobile we're all doing mobile now

00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:45,580
cloud and what's called excess so that

00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:47,050
software as a service infrastructure as

00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:49,180
a service platform as a service

00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:52,480
application of service you name it as a

00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,860
service really important for government

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,020
today because what they want to do is

00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,180
they want to move away from a capital

00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:00,580
expenditure model where you buy an asset

00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:02,200
through to an operational expenditure

00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:05,560
model where you buy a good or service

00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,120
for a limited so those are the big four

00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,100
and if you can drop those in

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,029
conversation say hey look we realize

00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:13,509
that different p

00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:17,469
will mean different things for us this

00:22:13,509 --> 00:22:21,429
is what we mean by this term so let's

00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:25,419
have a chat about open source and in

00:22:21,429 --> 00:22:27,789
open source there is a certain meaning

00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:29,889
that you get out of it for a government

00:22:27,789 --> 00:22:31,389
official the government domain language

00:22:29,889 --> 00:22:33,070
for open source means something slightly

00:22:31,389 --> 00:22:35,830
different so let's have a look at what

00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:37,989
that means so so if you're sitting at a

00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:40,450
table and somebody who doesn't know open

00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:42,849
sources come in and said okay I'm the

00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:44,409
guy signing the check and you mention

00:22:42,849 --> 00:22:46,960
open source this is what usually comes

00:22:44,409 --> 00:22:49,179
to mind so source is corporate

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,700
information it's the data system where

00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:53,109
everything is stored it forms part of

00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,539
the single source of truth which

00:22:53,109 --> 00:22:58,570
governments hammer down so much avoid

00:22:55,539 --> 00:23:00,369
duplication deduplicate get your data in

00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:02,440
order make one single source of truth

00:23:00,369 --> 00:23:04,119
that kind of stuff and it also

00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,339
represents their own intellectual

00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:09,159
property and we'll cover off why that's

00:23:06,339 --> 00:23:11,049
really important now what is openly open

00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:13,419
means accessible in government such as

00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:15,429
open government proactive disclosure

00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:18,849
where governments say hey if there was

00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:20,889
an FOI request we'd probably give it the

00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:22,960
information to them so let's just give

00:23:20,889 --> 00:23:26,519
the information to the public now so

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,139
that's what open source means now for us

00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:31,269
open source is a technical term its

00:23:29,139 --> 00:23:34,690
technical language along with lambda

00:23:31,269 --> 00:23:36,580
functions and anonymous functions and

00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:39,519
what it does it denotes philosophy

00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:43,229
philosophy around creation collaboration

00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:45,519
of content such as source code hardware

00:23:43,229 --> 00:23:49,589
graphic art techniques really anything

00:23:45,519 --> 00:23:51,849
can be done in an open-source way so

00:23:49,589 --> 00:23:53,619
there's sometimes gets a bit of a

00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:55,419
conflict of interest where people who

00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:57,269
don't understand open-source have

00:23:55,419 --> 00:24:01,479
preconceived ideas about it especially

00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:03,729
people who sign the checks so when you

00:24:01,479 --> 00:24:05,619
say oh it's open-source what is it well

00:24:03,729 --> 00:24:08,070
it's usually for a website a drupal base

00:24:05,619 --> 00:24:10,690
configured modules custom modules theme

00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:13,539
maybe some dns settings to make it look

00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:15,520
like it's under their domain so what

00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:18,650
they see

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,750
is something slightly different what

00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:23,510
they see as this application has got

00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:25,460
everything that I own everything that my

00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:28,190
organization organization does is in

00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:31,160
this application and it's open so what

00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:33,530
they see is that the operational level

00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:35,150
as we mentioned before is putting so

00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:36,890
much effort into making intellectual

00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:39,110
property and all of a sudden that

00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:41,780
intellectual property gets given out for

00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:45,350
nothing that is a certain element of

00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:47,180
concern now the reason why it's an

00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:50,690
element of concern is not necessarily

00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:53,660
really really obviously logical so in

00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:55,580
two things if you have an information

00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:58,400
leak now an information leak is not

00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:00,110
something that is an accident it's

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:02,000
something that the media calls an

00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:03,020
information leak which is where it's

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,090
really important if you have any

00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:08,270
information leak whether it's because of

00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:10,820
an improperly described proactive

00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:13,370
disclosure what happens is that as an

00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:16,160
executive your career is now tarnished

00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:18,410
with the brush of you bought this system

00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,800
it was open and now look your

00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:24,860
information is out now people in the

00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,450
public sector tend to be career people

00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:28,370
so that means they go from one

00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:31,580
department to a ministry to a department

00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:33,920
to a council back to a department so if

00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:37,310
in one of the particular departments

00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:39,380
they have a security issue essentially

00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:42,050
that careers over so that's why

00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,490
organizations that purchase goods and

00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,950
services really in the government

00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:48,380
security is number one it is the number

00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:51,710
one thing for government purchasing so

00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:53,570
the other thing is it's part of

00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:55,580
something called achievement Alissa term

00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:57,830
we'll look into it a bit later but if

00:25:55,580 --> 00:26:00,410
you have information that you've created

00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:02,840
and you don't give that information out

00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:04,910
or you give it out improperly that

00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,840
affects this term called achievement

00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:10,700
we'll have a look at that in a second so

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,710
if you are really really passionate

00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,970
about open source and that's fantastic

00:26:12,710 --> 00:26:16,010
what you need to do is need to educate

00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:18,680
them about the merit of open source

00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:23,370
educate them in language that they

00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:25,620
understand of what is open source now

00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:28,230
you do that by creating mindshare

00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:30,750
mindshare is a term used to describe how

00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:32,970
much something or someone thinks about

00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:34,680
you if you're always in front of mine

00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:36,330
because you're the person the other

00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,880
first person they get a call when it's

00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:41,970
an issue you've got mine share so what

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:43,680
does that mean if you give them the

00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:45,750
tools because at the end of the day if

00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:48,150
they're signing as a CFO they're signing

00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:51,780
the check this secretary is going to say

00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:54,420
why are we buying this solution now if

00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:56,850
the CFO does not understand what open

00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:59,429
source is they're going to go I don't

00:26:56,850 --> 00:27:01,170
know and they can't do that so what we

00:26:59,429 --> 00:27:03,090
need to do is we need to give them all

00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:04,830
the tools and materials they need to

00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:07,530
properly understand what open source is

00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:12,450
now we'll have a quick look about how we

00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:14,070
can describe what open source is when

00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:15,480
you purchase goods and services in

00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:18,510
government you have a line item that

00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:21,540
goes into a particular budget so the

00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:24,059
open source line item needs to be not

00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:25,559
we're buying some good and service that

00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:28,679
we don't really understand it needs to

00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:31,110
be we're buying risk mitigation what

00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:33,929
we're buying is the ability for any

00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:36,300
developer or any support organization to

00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:38,490
look at the core of our system and

00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:42,059
provide support that we may not

00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:44,640
otherwise get so if you position your

00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:46,710
solution and give it to them in this

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,390
kind of term say hey look if you've got

00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:50,460
this open source product what that means

00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:53,340
is if we can't support it as an

00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:56,250
organization you can hire anyone really

00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,780
who knows how to support this and you

00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:59,490
can go ahead and keep supporting it so

00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,679
what that means is for you it's a risk

00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:03,600
mitigation and they love that and if you

00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,309
keep going along those turns then what

00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,840
happens is it's not your solution it's

00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:09,390
their solution because they understand

00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:12,720
exactly what they're getting and that is

00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:15,750
the really valuable thing so it's about

00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,640
open source when the optimum result is a

00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:21,450
solution to a business problem so what

00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:23,790
that means is a lot of the time I me

00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:25,530
know in say a bidding process where

00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:28,620
we're negotiating stuff and we've got a

00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:30,000
partner who's perhaps particularly

00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,590
passionate about something they say

00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
great we're going to give you this open

00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:35,100
source solution and it's going to be

00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,290
fantastic and the buyer doesn't really

00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,480
understand that

00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:40,910
because they're talking technical to a

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,860
person who doesn't talk technical so

00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:47,030
what that means is that you need to give

00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:49,100
people who sign checks the solution to

00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:50,930
the problem not the technology because

00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,970
if you give them a solution that takes

00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:55,460
away their headache underpinned by

00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:57,250
really good risk management then it

00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:00,230
doesn't matter what the technology is

00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:03,410
because for them they need to deliver an

00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:06,380
output for the organization the output

00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:08,240
they need to deliver has to be something

00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:10,910
that they can go into the public and say

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,700
yes we did this the actual technology

00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:15,260
behind it is coming second place so

00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,840
that's really a really important point

00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:21,230
so technology is an enabler an open

00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:24,050
source is a really efficient enabler but

00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:26,740
it's not the key point so sell the

00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:28,580
solution sell the entire solution as

00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:31,340
something that will solve a business

00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:35,630
problem the technology will just fall in

00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:37,940
line as part of the process so since

00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:41,990
we're talking about selling let's have a

00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:44,510
look at a sales team unfortunately sales

00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:47,630
seems to be a dirty word and it's true

00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:51,350
some people ruin the reputation for

00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:54,140
others but what a sales team in the

00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:56,780
healthy sense of the word is it's a team

00:29:54,140 --> 00:30:01,430
that converts coffee and phone calls

00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:06,080
into signed deals you can relate to that

00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:08,330
yes absolutely so what we need is the

00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:10,490
3ds discipline direction and drive a

00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:13,040
sales team needs discipline because if

00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:17,230
you're going hey as a salesperson go

00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:19,790
sell something where do I start so

00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:22,430
discipline needs to be there to go hey

00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:25,040
you're going to be selling stuff so the

00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:27,260
process of making a sale is very very

00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:30,170
important now in government the process

00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:33,590
of making a sale is very long so you

00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:36,740
need to break down barriers with people

00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:38,630
as a salesperson but not barriers of any

00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:42,280
kind of like can I call you its barriers

00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:45,770
of understanding because if you make

00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:48,350
mind share in the mind of a person with

00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:50,100
whom you're dealing to say hey you know

00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:52,679
this isn't a sales person who's

00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,620
going to sell me something this is a

00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:57,270
person who's going to fix my problem

00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:59,130
that is the barrier of understanding and

00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:01,020
unfortunately a lot of salespeople very

00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:02,820
gung-ho yes go and sign on the dotted

00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:04,350
line will have a coffee you'll do this

00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,150
will do that it would be awesome and

00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:08,039
that's the wrong approach the right

00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:09,630
approach is to say hey look I realize

00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:12,020
that there's a problem and this is a

00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:14,850
solution I can see for your problem and

00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:17,370
what happens is you don't sell them on

00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:20,480
the idea they sell themselves on your

00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:24,419
idea and create their own solution so

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:27,480
when it comes to direction as a business

00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:29,610
owner now make sure that your sales team

00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,950
has a clear direction of where they need

00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:33,840
to go whether it's one specific vertical

00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:37,020
whether it's a market niche make sure

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:39,539
that they're not chasing every low

00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:41,250
hanging fruit because reminds me of an

00:31:39,539 --> 00:31:43,559
organization really in Wellington that

00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:46,500
essentially chases any deal they can get

00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:48,960
and sure if they're successful but the

00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,600
problem is their sales team is worn out

00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,330
they're fatigued because as soon as they

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:56,309
come back into the office I look you've

00:31:54,330 --> 00:31:58,440
got this really awesome opportunity go

00:31:56,309 --> 00:32:01,400
get it they don't know anything about

00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:04,260
how to install coffee pots into fridges

00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,730
they're an IT salesperson but no this is

00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:09,720
an opportunity for java because it runs

00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:11,970
on any device so again this is keep your

00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,870
sales team in a clear direction if you

00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:15,659
need to go in a different direction

00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:18,960
create a different sales team and then

00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:21,120
there's drive a sales team needs to be

00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,669
passionate and i need to be passionate

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,789
not about getting more money but about

00:32:23,669 --> 00:32:28,320
achieving the best result for their

00:32:25,789 --> 00:32:30,270
customer and that's really really

00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:32,370
important get your sales team so

00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:35,070
passionate about delivering the best

00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:39,330
solution with the technology offering

00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:41,789
that you have and question is how do you

00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:45,840
make a good salesperson into a great

00:32:41,789 --> 00:32:48,870
salesperson rule number one always be

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:52,169
closing ABC always be closing who's seen

00:32:48,870 --> 00:32:53,970
glengarry glen ross the movie yes that

00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:56,480
speech that ten minute speech now a

00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:59,360
little bit of trivia

00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,520
the the act of performing the ten minute

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:04,280
speech that was his only ten minutes on

00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:07,429
screen and he won a very very esteemed

00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:09,980
award for that so in a sales team it's

00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:11,960
always important to be closing not to

00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:13,970
keep dragging the process because in

00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,370
government the process already drags on

00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:19,220
don't help but get the process done

00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:21,260
quickly so typically the government

00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,059
expects you to have this particular type

00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:25,610
of self seen so you have a sales

00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:27,500
director yeah the account manager a

00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:30,860
business developer and then technical

00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:33,620
sales so an account manager they're

00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:36,770
essentially they look after the existing

00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:38,419
clients they educate existing clients

00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:40,690
with the new products and services that

00:33:38,419 --> 00:33:43,520
your organization is doing they also

00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:45,590
look after support for existing clients

00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:48,830
now the most important thing they do is

00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:52,070
they give the people in your client

00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:54,260
organization the ability to be first to

00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:55,760
know of what the market is doing which

00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,470
means those people can go to the boss

00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:59,450
and say hey there's this new thing

00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:01,580
called ediscovery have you heard about

00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:02,990
it no well I've heard about it let me

00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:06,220
tell you and they look better in front

00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:10,129
of their boss business development

00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:12,800
that's hunting new business acquire new

00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:15,109
clients manage contracts go through that

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,990
whole process so once the sales process

00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:20,149
is done the deal is signed the client is

00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:21,440
handed over to the account manager then

00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:23,450
in the middle you've got the technical

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,679
sales technical sales essentially is

00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:29,540
like the the person who says no we can't

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,730
put a coffee pot in the tea in the

00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:35,090
refrigerator because we don't sell

00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:36,919
refrigerators so they create the

00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:38,480
solution set and they assist the

00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:40,399
business developer in the account

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,350
manager and they provide essentially

00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:45,200
presale support to get the whole process

00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:47,090
across the line the sales director is a

00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:49,690
very important role because that role

00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:53,810
essentially mediates between the sales

00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:56,480
the CEO and the customer they mediate

00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:58,400
the whole process to provide deals to

00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,960
say hey look let's just give you a bit

00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,869
of a discount to make this deal go ahead

00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:05,060
because sometimes it may be important so

00:35:02,869 --> 00:35:07,190
they set the price they get the

00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:09,590
contracts done they're essentially the

00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:12,240
key enabler of smooth function

00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:13,260
so this sales team is going to go out

00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,800
and they're going to go and make some

00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:18,360
stuff make some deals it'll be awesome

00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:23,640
so let's talk about how to get funding

00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:26,420
from your clients bad news funding is

00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:29,250
allocated 12 to 18 months in advance

00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:32,010
meaning if you're coming in and trying

00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:33,750
to have a quick sale there is highly

00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:36,530
likely that that budget unless it's been

00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:38,640
previously allocated just isn't there

00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:40,590
now your project is going to be

00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:43,140
competing with a few other projects

00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:46,350
which means that only some projects can

00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:48,300
go ahead and be implemented and what

00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:50,310
that means is that the safe projects are

00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:53,850
going to go ahead of the risky ones so

00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:55,860
what does it mean well unlike

00:35:53,850 --> 00:36:01,560
traditional business you don't really

00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:05,160
have a sense of well if we get to the

00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:06,780
top their cio the CFO the CEO will go

00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:09,780
and say yes make it happen it's a

00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:12,810
solution I need what happens is you've

00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:14,220
got to fold competition and the

00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:16,110
competition has got nothing to do with

00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,970
your competitors it's got to do with the

00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:21,120
media and the public's perception of

00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:23,490
your department so the Secretary has two

00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:25,500
aims and their two M's is this how can

00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:27,990
they make the minister achieve the

00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:30,150
outcome that the Minister has said which

00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:31,620
means changing the direction of the

00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:34,290
organization output to match that

00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:35,670
outcome the second one is how can you

00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:38,310
make the public appreciate the

00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:41,670
organization and I think Kate touched on

00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:43,260
that this morning about having being in

00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:45,600
a position where the public really

00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:47,520
understands that a policy is successful

00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:51,390
and it's not a PR disaster even though

00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:53,220
the policy has done a good job so what

00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:55,350
is safe mean and we'll cover this off in

00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:57,500
it in a second safe means following do

00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:59,970
process it means respecting

00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:02,310
documentation privacy and security that

00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:04,380
the department needs now departments

00:37:02,310 --> 00:37:05,880
need differing levels of both so for

00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:08,220
example if you're looking to make a

00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,570
website for Department of Defense that's

00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,700
a slightly different security

00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:15,990
requirement to making a website for the

00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:18,030
department of fish so make sure you

00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:20,069
respect the documentation and the

00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:23,099
security and the privacy that you need

00:37:20,069 --> 00:37:25,319
you need credibility credibility is

00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:28,529
paramount in government there is nothing

00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:31,440
more than losing a deal because you

00:37:28,529 --> 00:37:33,900
weren't credible incredible means you

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,209
have established implementation in the

00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:38,009
marketplace you can point to say hey

00:37:36,209 --> 00:37:40,079
your colleagues have already done this

00:37:38,009 --> 00:37:41,519
you don't want to be behind the ball of

00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,539
your colleagues they're very ahead of

00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:44,309
you look they've already using our

00:37:42,539 --> 00:37:46,920
softly you wouldn't say it in those

00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:48,539
terms but it's very competitive in

00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:51,289
government you don't want one council to

00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:55,680
add to another give them both the way to

00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:57,749
get get ahead so you need to somehow get

00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:00,269
funding so you know that if you've got a

00:37:57,749 --> 00:38:04,259
solution it's safe you respect at all

00:38:00,269 --> 00:38:07,170
how do you get funding well there's

00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:09,839
what's called the funding threshold and

00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:11,549
that's this big scary thing so you've

00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,989
got common with procurement rules it's a

00:38:11,549 --> 00:38:15,420
document you can go look it up on the

00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:17,789
net and that tells you in Australia the

00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,619
rules you need to follow and the limit

00:38:17,789 --> 00:38:22,019
for Australia is eighty thousand dollars

00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:24,660
in new zealand same document slightly

00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:29,609
different name and $100,000 in new

00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:31,469
zealand so at the thresholds and this

00:38:29,609 --> 00:38:33,779
represents total contract value at this

00:38:31,469 --> 00:38:36,690
threshold the organization if they want

00:38:33,779 --> 00:38:39,599
to buy off you has to go to tender to

00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:41,430
public process below the threshold they

00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,920
may still choose to go to tender but

00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:46,019
they don't have to which means if you

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,359
give them a really good idea or really

00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:50,699
good reason why they should waive the

00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:53,400
tender process you won't have to go

00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:55,920
through the whole lengthy documentation

00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:59,569
phase because it's a low-risk solution

00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,829
so above the threshold you might have

00:38:59,569 --> 00:39:04,289
you run into other thresholds that

00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:08,400
aren't publicly documented so for

00:39:04,289 --> 00:39:11,789
example a CFO might only be able to sign

00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,920
two hundred thousand dollars if your

00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:15,869
deal is above that it might have to be

00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,519
signed by the secretary who can only

00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:19,289
sign four hundred thousand dollars and

00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,219
that's called delegated authority and

00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:25,680
that exists in enterprise as well now

00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:28,829
anything more goes to the cabinet and

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,349
the cabinet sits down once a year in

00:39:28,829 --> 00:39:32,900
something called the financial and

00:39:31,349 --> 00:39:35,480
expenditure committee

00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:37,460
so very very very scary term isn't it

00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:40,310
what it is it's the cabinet sits down

00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:42,230
and all the departments all the

00:39:40,310 --> 00:39:44,630
ministries basically say this is what we

00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:46,910
want to do have our bucket of project

00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:49,070
ideas so the cabinet sits down for two

00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:51,490
weeks and they go through all the ideas

00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:54,260
and they allocate funding now the

00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:58,460
console e consequence of that particular

00:39:54,260 --> 00:40:01,790
process is that one project has 40

00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:03,830
seconds to 1 minute of air time they

00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:06,470
look at it is this aligned to our

00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:08,420
strategic direction is this aligned to

00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:12,920
our ICT strategy that we've published

00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:15,080
last year no in the bin next nope in the

00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,400
bin next so that's how it happens

00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:21,380
because there is just so much

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:23,690
competition so what that means is you

00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:25,940
need a really really really punchy story

00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:28,940
so who was here at Caitlyn DS

00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:32,420
presentations morning oh wow everyone

00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:34,910
fantastic almost everyone cool so did

00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:37,820
you notice how she was talking about the

00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:40,460
statistics that she represented she said

00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:41,990
we had a forty-eight percent increase in

00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:44,450
uptake of this policy we had a

00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:45,740
30-percent that is how ministers talk

00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:48,320
and the reason why they talk like that

00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:51,200
is because they have to substantiate the

00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:53,270
outcome they said with what actually

00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,580
happened two years later so this is the

00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:57,260
world they live in right now may not be

00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:59,750
the optimum world but that's what they

00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:03,950
have to live right now so reminds me of

00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:05,720
a particular story where this brief this

00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:08,390
abstract that went to the financial

00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:11,660
expenditure committee went along lines

00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:13,820
of hey we want to increase public

00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:17,780
transport efficiency by thirty percent

00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:21,260
and increase the travel satisfaction of

00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:23,930
citizens in southern queensland by forty

00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:25,490
five percent and to do that we just need

00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:28,730
two and a half million dollars it's yeah

00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:31,070
that's spider boy can anyone guess what

00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:33,220
the actual project they were suggesting

00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:33,220
was

00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:42,420
close they were wanting to buy a bunch

00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:44,860
of you v.v whether they call radios on

00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:46,480
trains and buses so that the train could

00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:49,870
radio the bus and say hey we're five

00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:51,040
minutes from station don't leave yet now

00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:54,100
if they would have said hey can we have

00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:58,510
two and a half million for radios what

00:41:54,100 --> 00:42:02,020
would the committee say yeah do next so

00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:04,210
the abstract gets created by the CFO and

00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:06,190
a CIO and the secretary and that goes to

00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:08,410
cabinet what that means is a lot of

00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,670
people don't know and this is in the

00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:11,530
public sector a lot of them don't know

00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:14,260
they have to create this and that it has

00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:16,450
to be short punchy and in the language

00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:18,400
of the ministers what that means for you

00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,900
is that you can go through and say hey

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,940
do you guys know that your project is

00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:24,100
going to be up for review if it is is

00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:27,310
there anything we can help to help you

00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:30,100
write that brief because ultimately

00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:31,780
you'll be in control of what goes to

00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,490
administer because there is so many

00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:35,290
briefs to write they'll be more than

00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:37,240
happy to get you to help them to write

00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:40,240
this particular one so that's just

00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:45,610
something that that happens in the in

00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:50,380
the funding so we've got due process now

00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:53,010
bureaucracy or red tape unfortunately is

00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:55,450
the government's way of accountability

00:42:53,010 --> 00:42:57,460
so if you're sitting on the

00:42:55,450 --> 00:43:00,880
decision-making hot seat and you have to

00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:04,090
sign a check or sign something then if

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:07,030
you follow due process what that means

00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:10,540
is you're following something that has

00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:14,080
been defined as being the most fair way

00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:18,190
to buy something now it may not be the

00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:20,470
best way but in terms of how public

00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:22,150
servants are career people if the

00:43:20,470 --> 00:43:24,070
department has said follow this process

00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:26,260
because this is the best way for us to

00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:27,940
work and you don't follow it the news

00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:29,410
will spread but you're not quite

00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:32,200
following the policies of your

00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:34,240
government again being a career person

00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:37,330
you don't want to lose your career over

00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:39,730
something that simple so if you prove

00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:42,490
that you followed the meetings the

00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:44,590
process the forms the emails then you're

00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:46,870
protected because you did the best thing

00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:47,770
you could under the situation if you did

00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:49,540
your due diligence

00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:51,970
if you did all the research you could

00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:55,240
you went to market the market responded

00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:58,360
you did the best thing you could the

00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:02,230
process is supreme what that means is

00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:04,270
that if you know the process government

00:44:02,230 --> 00:44:07,000
organizations will be happy to work with

00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:09,790
you because you respect how they work

00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,100
and it's just a people thing if you

00:44:09,790 --> 00:44:13,390
respect a person they'll respect you

00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:18,130
back and that's the same on an

00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:20,290
organizational scale as well so what's

00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:24,400
this thing about probity the term

00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:27,100
probity means being decent and fair so

00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:28,330
probity means that for example if you're

00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,800
a government organization you're going

00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:32,260
to market and you're going to spend five

00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:35,550
hundred thousand on goods and services

00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:37,630
around web probity means that each

00:44:35,550 --> 00:44:40,600
organization is going to put in their

00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:43,540
best bid they're not going to collude to

00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:45,580
give you an inflated price probity means

00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:47,290
that the organization's you deal with

00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:49,120
you don't then say to another

00:44:47,290 --> 00:44:51,220
organization or this was their bed can

00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:53,230
you do better it's a two-way

00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:55,720
relationship and probity ensures the

00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:58,570
integrity of the government purchasing

00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,830
process and again this latin phrase i

00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:01,060
can't pronounce that unfortunately but

00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:03,250
what it means is who will guard the

00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:05,530
Guardians and the probity process

00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:08,050
ensures that the government and the

00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:12,130
vendors are both being fair to each

00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:14,880
other so let's have a look at some

00:45:12,130 --> 00:45:16,930
stages you might see these in the market

00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:20,140
essentially these are definitions of

00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:22,240
stages so at the very start a government

00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:25,420
organization has a bright idea the light

00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:29,230
bulb goes dinked on and they go right I

00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:31,270
want to buy widgets what kind of widgets

00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:32,590
I don't know some of them so they create

00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:34,960
what's called an expression of interest

00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:36,550
an expression of interest is a document

00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:40,450
that goes into the marketplace and the

00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:44,440
marketplace response and aoi gauges the

00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:46,180
market for their interest in doing what

00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,830
you've asked them to do because there's

00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,180
no point saying I want to buy a widget

00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:51,690
and the market is but we don't do

00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:54,250
widgets we just yeah that's a silly idea

00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:55,480
so once you've done in ela as the

00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:56,650
government organization and you've got

00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:58,600
your results back you've got your

00:45:56,650 --> 00:46:00,849
vendors who are interested in responding

00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:02,489
you then go and do an RF

00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:05,589
which is a request for information an

00:46:02,489 --> 00:46:08,470
RFI again goes to the market and it

00:46:05,589 --> 00:46:10,269
gauges the market solution maturity so

00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:11,680
what it does is everyone responds oh

00:46:10,269 --> 00:46:16,809
yeah we can make widgets out of duct

00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:18,729
tape and glue yeah the RFI uncovers how

00:46:16,809 --> 00:46:21,430
much you are a solution to your

00:46:18,729 --> 00:46:23,079
particular business leaders so then

00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:26,200
you've got the request for proposal or

00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:30,940
tender usually RFP rft same name and

00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:32,680
that determines the best solution for

00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:35,140
your organization out of the available

00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:38,380
market so the market is interested the

00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:41,019
solutions the market suggests are mature

00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:43,599
and rfp now picks the best one of them

00:46:41,019 --> 00:46:45,940
so then you go what's to what's called a

00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,470
preferred supply and who's received a

00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:49,239
letter saying you're the preferred

00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:51,160
supplier for our organization you guys

00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:53,999
have got that yep what that means is

00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:55,839
okay you're the one we're going to try a

00:46:53,999 --> 00:46:58,509
negotiator with you give us your best

00:46:55,839 --> 00:47:00,640
price give us your contracts let's try

00:46:58,509 --> 00:47:03,160
and make this work because we really

00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,229
like how we can work together and then

00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:07,359
there's the signing of the contract the

00:47:05,229 --> 00:47:09,640
sales team rings the bell and it's all

00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:14,710
rainbows and unicorns and happiness and

00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:17,739
sunshine from there on so this process

00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:21,609
is the full process for example if an

00:47:17,739 --> 00:47:24,219
organization is going to market for a

00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:25,839
web content management system it's

00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:29,979
probably not going to do an eoi or an

00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:32,229
RFI it knows the marketplace has web

00:47:29,979 --> 00:47:34,960
content management systems the solutions

00:47:32,229 --> 00:47:36,729
are very mature we know the marketplace

00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,650
is interested in responding let's just

00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:41,170
save everyone's time go straight to rfp

00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:44,859
by offered and sign the deal get on with

00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:47,349
our jobs so that process is linear so

00:47:44,859 --> 00:47:49,359
you get a oh I and through so you'd

00:47:47,349 --> 00:47:51,069
never go to an RFP and then back to any

00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:54,039
I that just doesn't happen but you go

00:47:51,069 --> 00:47:56,829
forward so that's essentially the due

00:47:54,039 --> 00:48:03,880
process and at the end of the day it's

00:47:56,829 --> 00:48:05,589
not that scary is it awesome so that's

00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,180
more or less everything I wanted to

00:48:05,589 --> 00:48:09,809
cover there any questions there is

00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:09,809
straight up

00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:17,960
very good question how do I know all

00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:19,550
this well the two documents that are

00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,320
listed before the mandatory rules for

00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:25,670
procurement and the column of buying

00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:28,190
rules outline all of this in 120 pages

00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:30,370
and let's just say I had a spare weekend

00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:30,370
one

00:48:56,900 --> 00:49:01,220
okay so the question is what's the is it

00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:03,860
is it worth doing all this effort for

00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:05,620
what you get back out of it that's a

00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:10,490
really it's a tough question to answer

00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:14,300
yes or no so one thing where you can see

00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:16,940
is when the contract is signed then that

00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:20,060
contract represents essentially accepted

00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:21,620
cash flow so halfway through the

00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:23,510
contract unless you're really screwing

00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:24,740
things up halfway through the contract

00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:26,420
they're not going to back out and say

00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:28,730
hey yeah we're not going to pay you

00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:31,430
anymore so it because it's a government

00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:33,620
purchasing program it represents a

00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:36,590
certain surety of future cash flows and

00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:40,340
for a person planning their business

00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:42,500
pipeline that can be a very safe kind of

00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:44,410
sort of the minimum safe kind of thing

00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:48,980
that you do now the other thing with

00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:51,920
with government is that you get money

00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:56,030
from government that essentially you've

00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:57,410
put in so if you're not happy as an

00:49:56,030 --> 00:50:00,830
individual with how the government is

00:49:57,410 --> 00:50:03,590
managing your funds then being part of

00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:06,200
the process that helps the government in

00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:08,770
being more efficient really helps you in

00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:11,390
return so there could be a bit of a

00:50:08,770 --> 00:50:13,130
self-interest goal there where you say

00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:14,770
hey look i think that the government can

00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:18,020
do much better job using this solution

00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:20,300
now to really sort of get to the point

00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:22,100
of is it worth it well if you have a

00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:24,590
dedicated sales team focusing on

00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:27,410
government because of such a slow

00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:30,830
process what that means is you can have

00:50:27,410 --> 00:50:34,700
so many different opportunities on the

00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:36,770
go at once and after the first 24 months

00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:41,470
you'll essentially have all your ducks

00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:43,790
in a row going forward which means that

00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:45,440
potentially it is worth it but it's not

00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:46,790
worth it straight away so to be more of

00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,970
a strategic investment from that

00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:48,970
perspective

00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,790
another question

00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:06,210
so questions how do you find the RFPs

00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:08,370
and the answer is yes so how you find

00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:11,640
them is in Australia it's called austin

00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:13,890
de it's a website and you subscribe to

00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:16,410
various categories of rfp in new

00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:18,840
zealand's called gets and government

00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:24,560
organizations are legislated to put

00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:24,560
everything on austin or gets so you can

00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:30,870
there's tender link which is paid yep

00:51:29,370 --> 00:51:32,820
this tender link which is paid but our

00:51:30,870 --> 00:51:34,710
standard should be free but you have to

00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:37,020
go through a qualification process to

00:51:34,710 --> 00:51:38,880
say yes I'm this organization yes this

00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:42,630
is my address and that kind of stuff but

00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:44,820
yet definitely so the the tender the

00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:46,920
tender list is one of those things that

00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:48,540
should be available to the public for no

00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:54,500
charge that kind of thing it's that kind

00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:54,500
of list yes

00:52:00,829 --> 00:52:03,459
yep

00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:13,560
so the question is about panels how do

00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:16,350
we work with panel say yep so there's

00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,790
two types of group buying that

00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:20,130
government has it's called syndicated

00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:21,480
procurement or panels syndicated

00:52:20,130 --> 00:52:23,220
procurement is when two or three

00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:26,190
ministries or departments come together

00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:28,890
and they do one RFP and they all can buy

00:52:26,190 --> 00:52:32,280
off that one process a panel is where

00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:34,980
that process happens but not necessarily

00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:37,470
anyone buys off at the end so you go

00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:39,090
through the RFP process and the end

00:52:37,470 --> 00:52:41,910
result is great you're allowed on a

00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:43,950
panel and so from that what what it

00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:45,810
means is that your first and foremost as

00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:47,250
you mentioned so the government goes

00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:49,890
okay we need a web content management

00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:52,710
system let's look at our panel and in

00:52:49,890 --> 00:52:53,760
Australia the the organization is a GMO

00:52:52,710 --> 00:52:56,100
straddling government information

00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:57,420
management office and that organization

00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:59,670
basically says these are the panels that

00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:03,180
we've got and you go to the panel and

00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:05,550
you say hey we're going to contact these

00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:08,640
four organizations and get them to do a

00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:11,280
closed tender potentially or get them to

00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:14,369
answer first so in terms of answering

00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:18,690
the question I would say that if you can

00:53:14,369 --> 00:53:21,810
get the hang of basic rfps first getting

00:53:18,690 --> 00:53:25,400
on a panel would be fantastic but it's a

00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:25,400
much longer process still

00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:33,430
that's right

00:53:51,130 --> 00:53:57,280
okay yeah so the question is how similar

00:53:54,640 --> 00:54:00,910
is the state process for the to the

00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:03,430
federal processor terms of state and so

00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:04,780
you have buying groups in state

00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:06,250
government so for example in New South

00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:08,350
Wales there's the New South Wales

00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:10,360
procurement arm and they publish

00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:14,620
documents that essentially say this is

00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:16,780
what we can do as a state so in every

00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:19,150
state would have a similar type of

00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:21,030
procurement department which will then

00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:23,230
give you guidance as to which panels

00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:25,690
which syndicated procurements are

00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:28,300
currently in place but I would say

00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:31,030
overall the best place to be is that on

00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:35,080
a GMO for federal because you can just

00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:37,230
carry over essentially another question

00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,230
yes

00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:49,180
yes

00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:19,480
yeah that's a really good point so just

00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:21,280
to repeat that then a lot of time the

00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:24,070
people on the other side who've got this

00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:25,869
big big pile of rfp response on their

00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:27,880
desk they're going through and the

00:55:25,869 --> 00:55:31,330
answers aren't what was asked and so

00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:32,950
that can harm how well you're perceived

00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:36,670
because you didn't really answer the

00:55:32,950 --> 00:55:38,140
point of what I've asked so make life

00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:44,260
easier for yourself and the people who

00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:49,980
have to review a work yeah absolutely

00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:49,980
yeah cool there any other questions yes

00:56:01,990 --> 00:56:07,030
okay so question is how do you avoid

00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:09,400
being sort of labeled as politically

00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:10,780
aligned when there's certain things

00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:16,000
going through in machinery of government

00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:21,490
change okay so in that the the top level

00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:25,270
of a political government structure

00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:27,850
would be the secretary so if you are

00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:30,850
really careful about your work and you

00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:32,380
stop contacting above the secretary then

00:56:30,850 --> 00:56:34,720
essentially you're working with the

00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:37,900
department of government as opposed to

00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:40,720
with a particular government in scituate

00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:43,420
achill party so I would say if you're

00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:45,310
really if that's really a concern and it

00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:47,860
is a very valid concern when government

00:56:45,310 --> 00:56:50,130
changes because all of a sudden you're

00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:52,869
now talking to the shadow government

00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:55,119
that's a very important point here so

00:56:52,869 --> 00:56:58,750
keep talking at the secretary or CEO

00:56:55,119 --> 00:57:09,369
level to avoid getting labeled as

00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:12,400
friends of a specific party we we are

00:57:09,369 --> 00:57:15,400
out of time but look that was a

00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,530

00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:21,369

00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:22,810
well informed and very skillful and

00:57:21,369 --> 00:57:26,460
carefully staged so could you please

00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:29,260
