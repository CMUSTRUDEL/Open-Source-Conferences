goal so thank you very much for that

00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:11,310
well to introduce myself I humbly

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:14,370
introduce myself as just a freelance

00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,290
drupal developer and I am just one year

00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:18,720
and a half in the Drupal development I

00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,209
have not yet contributed any module

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,510
development in the Drupal core but I am

00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:27,209
somewhat initiating event in the Drupal

00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:30,810
philippines in Manila so I'm also

00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:32,959
heading on the first of flipping geek

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:36,600
girls where we founded only last year

00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:40,140
2012 which is composed only of five to

00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:45,120
ten females for a while you might be

00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:48,690
asking why ten females really of in the

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,700
Philippines we have so many female

00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:52,549
working in different industries right

00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:56,780
even in Australia let me ask you this

00:02:52,549 --> 00:03:05,780
how many of us here are developers

00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:11,959
developers designers businessman

00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:14,820
marketers sales okay so many of us but

00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:18,560
the pure drupal developer just like a

00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:22,370
jury's sadly stock is

00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:26,270
rarely found right but it is not

00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:28,760
impossible for us to evolve into that

00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:31,010
kind of development someday I guess that

00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,390
the community really matters that's what

00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,660
I'm really here that's why I'm really

00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:39,040
here because I wanted to encourage

00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:42,380
especially the female the female to have

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,050
the active involvement in the community

00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:47,360
like this especially in the Philippines

00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,739
because we have a very rare female

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,200
involvement in the Drupal community

00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:53,720
especially in the IT community we have

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,319
in the Philippines I guess we have a

00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:00,200
total of twenty groups we have

00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:01,790
Philippine web designers we have OS

00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,569
developers allowed to have Drupal

00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:07,549
developers group but rarely you can find

00:04:05,569 --> 00:04:10,099
females involving themselves in the

00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:13,010
activities of the community so that's

00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:14,930
what main problem that I see nowadays on

00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,820
how we can empower this women and

00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:21,350
encourage then how to participate in

00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:23,120
this kind of activities so as the main

00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:27,070
organizer of the Philippine Drupal

00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:31,130
Philippines okay about me first let me

00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:36,110
let me say something about me my

00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:38,390
interest was I love dogs okay there is a

00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:43,960
saying that you can test your patience

00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:47,240
by taking care of a pet if you want to

00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:50,419
develop your patience try to grab some

00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,700
pepper a dog and learn your patience by

00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:54,740
taking care of it you will see how

00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,830
patient you are after one week of taking

00:04:54,740 --> 00:05:02,030
care of dog after it poop and then it

00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:04,669
will give some some herrick on you after

00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:07,030
if you will feed the you will feed the

00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:10,070
dog then you have to give out the food

00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:12,860
every now and then so it will test your

00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:14,870
patience so that's why the first main

00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:18,380
reason why i need a pet is because i

00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:22,160
need patience so dog is the number one

00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:26,599
test for me so number two i love

00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:29,050
twilight who doesn't like twilight you

00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:32,680
don't like to highlight

00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:35,479
you tell me why you don't like twilight

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,879
cheesy right it's okay but we have our

00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:40,879
own likes and dislikes and we respect

00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:42,949
that but for me I can see that even

00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,349
though I you you find the cheesy for me

00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:48,349
I find it all one more thing with the

00:05:45,349 --> 00:05:52,250
character of Bella I see some strong

00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:55,639
willpower woman inside her the way that

00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:58,699
that she our display her character in

00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:01,159
the movie the way she fight for Edward

00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:04,220
in the movie really it inspires me that

00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:07,009
Oh someday if I became a vampire I will

00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,590
really fight for it huh and if ever I

00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:13,250
have the chance to be a wife of edward

00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:17,150
of course right so who who doesn't want

00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:24,050
to fight for Edward next is who is crazy

00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:26,060
up starbucks starbucks coffee coffee so

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:30,020
you have starbucks see right we have

00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:32,990
starbucks right so any anyone that is

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:35,330
addicted to starbucks when you are smell

00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,580
the aroma of that coffee or even at

00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:41,270
starbucks here you tend to be craving

00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:43,550
for that aroma you tend to where's that

00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,400
coffee I want to really sit at least one

00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:50,330
cup this morning at least it can suit

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:54,050
your satisfaction ok number four we have

00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:57,919
oh I like this pit solid and we have

00:06:54,050 --> 00:07:00,680
that in Manila so it's a 65 inch pizza

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,680
so if you're going to be traveling to

00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:07,340
Manila you're going to try that pizza

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,319
hero so it will be a customized pitstop

00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,680
65 inch I don't know if you can handle

00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:15,009
that 65 inch and you'll be alone eating

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:19,639
that the whole day and you'll be stuff

00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:21,949
so but as a programmer or a developer if

00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,919
you are doing coding most of the time

00:07:21,949 --> 00:07:27,469
when I'm at home stuck at home I cannot

00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:29,330
stand on my chair it's like my husband

00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:31,340
is just feeding me some food on the door

00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:35,029
and just get the food out of there and

00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:37,610
I'm just ok what else is there lunch so

00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:41,210
I'm just continuing coding so that's how

00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:43,270
my life is before until that I met

00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:46,400
Drupal

00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,840
okay for just a short history about the

00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,580
Philippines you might not be shocked

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:54,580
about this picture but okay so it sounds

00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,980
so boring it looks so boring actually

00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:01,370
maybe you ever asked me that if that is

00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:03,170
my grandmother no it's not it's the

00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:05,000
women during the 18th century in the

00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:08,030
Philippines so I just want to give you a

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,610
fresh back or outlook about how women

00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:14,030
dressed up during those time and how are

00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:17,060
we doing our role in the Philippines

00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:19,760
during those 18th century those eat are

00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:24,430
those years we are bound to take care of

00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:27,670
our kids so we are just are designed to

00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:30,110
primarily take care of our husbands

00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:33,250
children's needs so we are just stopped

00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:37,850
at home during those previous time

00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:42,590
excuse me so that's art our main role in

00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:46,250
the Philippines before so you might be

00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:47,840
agreeing with this right can you tell me

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:50,990
something in Australia can you share

00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,700
something about your women history here

00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:54,710
because you know I've never done some

00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:59,350
research about women and Australia and

00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:59,350
the basic task or mineral that you have

00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:12,980
yeah the west from the 50s late 50s

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,840
right so so the those are all the main

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,540
role of women sometimes that we are

00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,490
designed to clean the houses and just

00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:24,620
washing the dishes and ironing the

00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:26,390
clothes of our upper husband's until on

00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,160
the old days when women started to be

00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,110
active in the community in the 19th

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,300
century in the Philippines so during

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:35,620
those time you know that philippines

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:38,420
have been conquered by Spaniards and

00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:40,910
Americans and different countries have

00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,800
all over concord Philippines and Manila

00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:46,130
so during those time we have now the

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:48,410
access for education so those time women

00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:51,350
evolved themselves and try to be curious

00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:54,200
about education so during those time

00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:56,990
women are asking what can I do to

00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:59,870
improve myself other than just washing

00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:02,780
the clothes staying at home taking care

00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:05,170
of the baby what else can I do so those

00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:10,850
are the time that women became are

00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:13,610
curious until today on the 20th century

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:16,460
era as you may see in the Philippines we

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:18,520
have now different league of women women

00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:21,530
who are highly involved in the artillery

00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:24,860
auxiliary group and women in the Magna

00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:27,860
Carta and women in the sports field and

00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:29,930
even in the IT industry so this one as

00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,870
you can see is Eiling a polo which is a

00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:34,970
she became one of the marketing

00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:38,240
representative from google philippines

00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:42,010
and she highly represented philippines

00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:45,290
for google during those time but the i

00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:47,600
guess the the latest news now has been

00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:54,440
replaced by a man named Narcisa reyes

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:57,800
already in google so ok this is a case

00:10:54,440 --> 00:11:01,600
to case study what i want you to do is

00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:05,390
if for every all for every for every

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,920
part of this a word i would like to ask

00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:09,260
for your suggestion your opinions

00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,430
regarding this because australian is has

00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:17,120
a different or situation right basically

00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:19,910
this are some reasons that I've seen why

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,940
uh why there is a small population of

00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:25,779
women in the IT community number one is

00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:29,000
the lifestyle depends on the country

00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:31,190
depends on the culture for example in

00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,560
the Philippines mostly our Philippine

00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:36,560
women are basically designed to just

00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,750
primary care for their children's for up

00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:43,070
for just decide design for the household

00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:46,070
tasks right so in australia women are

00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:48,080
being educated by the government so it

00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:51,140
is different it is a case to case study

00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,580
already so in your country if you have

00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,760
other countries if you have other

00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:59,089
culture you may raise your opinion to me

00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,970
and give a suggestion on what what you

00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:04,339
can say about this or idea they are

00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:07,330
depends on the lifestyle they have any

00:12:04,339 --> 00:12:07,330
suggestion

00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,120
uh-huh

00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,790
Oh

00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:54,629
okay other than that they have any

00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:57,119
opinion with the lifestyle what about

00:12:54,629 --> 00:13:00,209
you your own personal lifestyle how did

00:12:57,119 --> 00:13:02,009
you get into Drupal yourselves you and

00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:04,429
yourselves how did you get interested in

00:13:02,009 --> 00:13:04,429
Drupal

00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:18,290
okay that's so boring

00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:32,050
Oh

00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:42,899
yeah i agree with you because women are

00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:44,579
more sociable and that's how there is a

00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:47,610
misconception with regarding to

00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:49,860
programming sometimes they view this as

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:52,410
negatively that programming is just an

00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:55,709
unsociable work somehow because you're

00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:58,619
just going to stay at home and coding

00:13:55,709 --> 00:14:01,379
all the day of your lives and you're not

00:13:58,619 --> 00:14:02,939
going to do anything so we're just

00:14:01,379 --> 00:14:04,589
thankful that we have the drupalcon

00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:07,439
Association we have the Drupal community

00:14:04,589 --> 00:14:09,509
or the different IT organization in the

00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:13,079
different countries because we are able

00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:16,199
to mingle with other developers and from

00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:19,589
our boring life of programming and

00:14:16,199 --> 00:14:22,730
coding from our house we tend to express

00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:26,459
our stress or we have the stress relief

00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:29,369
to express our self in the society and

00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:31,920
become more friendly right so we became

00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:35,929
friendly by doing our activities in the

00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,929
community so

00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:59,230
uh-huh

00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:10,680
yes I exactly agree with you and the

00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:14,700
second of factor is the interest of

00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:18,630
women you know women are so vain right

00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:20,850
we are all being admitted we adore I

00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:23,180
don't know what guys are you guys in

00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:26,040
vain with with your looks with your

00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:29,490
cousin in some area there are guys that

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:32,910
are being right whoa-ho-ho you know uh

00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:35,610
yesterday I was with some Australian

00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:38,820
friends also they don't like hair hairy

00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:42,810
thing or with you call them yeah so

00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:45,690
women are really vain widow with with

00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:48,060
their looks so we tend to really exert

00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:49,950
an effort to make all feel more

00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:53,190
beautiful to look more beautiful right

00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:55,200
even inside or outside so the interest

00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:58,260
is some it has something to do with the

00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:01,710
interest also in the IT industry because

00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:05,730
men are there are critical thinking

00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:08,520
critical thinker right so in in terms of

00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:12,000
women we can also become we can also

00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,890
excel with men in terms of mathematical

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,440
but they are born with that kind of

00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:18,000
attitude that is it has something to do

00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,250
with the brain hemisphere do you think

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,090
so this is not something to do with the

00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:32,120
brain hemisphere when we are born do you

00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:32,120
believe in that yeah

00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:42,480
well what about the the interest for all

00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:46,070
for us female when we see the the coding

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,070
or the development in Drupal

00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:36,690
yes all right do you have any any other

00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:58,530
opinions okay is she also are interested

00:17:36,690 --> 00:18:00,920
in the IT thing or ide stuff specially

00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,920
girdle

00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:25,960
all right there was a nice opinion okay

00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:29,830
as we are talking about environment all

00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:32,430
right unfriendly environment because you

00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:37,510
know sometimes I in philippines on

00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:41,410
female used to view of the computer the

00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:45,340
IT world as unfriendly for them they

00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:48,160
tend to see it as hard and difficult and

00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:51,310
how can they be able to adapt to the

00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:54,670
environment because the system it's it's

00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:56,470
all I have to have some questions with

00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:58,390
the system itself because even myself

00:18:56,470 --> 00:19:00,880
and I first start learning the IT

00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:03,190
because I'm not a programming uh I don't

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,490
have a programming background I have

00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:11,200
some adjustment to make in order to

00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:13,270
learn coding first in the CSS HTML so at

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,120
first when you don't have a programming

00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:18,850
background for a female like like me it

00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:22,080
would be very difficult right so it's

00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:25,570
like you're learning from scratch so

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,910
it's it in itself you have to you need

00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:29,820
to you need to have an environment where

00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:33,670
you will you will feel more comfortable

00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:35,560
more comfortable with learning like the

00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:37,480
community of the polity gives you

00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:39,430
training or access the training

00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:42,070
mentorship then that will give

00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:44,290
inspiration to female to learn more I

00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,930
guess that's the suitable environment

00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:48,700
for a female to be encouraged in order

00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:51,910
to involve themselves in the community

00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:54,400
more mentorship and more training for

00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:57,820
them since we are females we need more

00:19:54,400 --> 00:20:00,220
we we need to be taken care with handily

00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,950
hun what you call this we need to be

00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:05,890
handle it taken care of it's like we are

00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:09,460
fragile right so females should be taken

00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:12,730
care of very very very carefully so we

00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,290
have the upbringing background also so

00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:16,450
in Australia you have a very good

00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:19,510
upbringing right with with the with in

00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:21,340
terms of your family with your kids so

00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,530
in Philippines we have some good

00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:26,440
upbringing backgrounds also but

00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:28,779
sometimes it depends on the culture

00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:32,649
or on the situation of the family what

00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:35,200
if all the for example a child grew up

00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:37,299
from a rural area or a suburban place

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,299
where in your parents do not really

00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:42,549
graduate from college or you are not

00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:44,799
really educated your parents don't

00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:48,159
really have the access for education and

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,629
you are not fortunate so those female

00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,620
that grow up from that kind of

00:20:49,629 --> 00:20:58,419
upbringing our attempt to negatively

00:20:53,620 --> 00:21:00,009
view the IT world as different so it has

00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:01,840
something to do with the bringing of

00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:03,850
parents because if your parents are both

00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:07,240
programmers yes you have the tendency to

00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:09,250
be like them to have the influence of

00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,990
both parents but what about those

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:14,669
children that are born with less

00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:17,799
fortunate parents so they have

00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:22,179
additional insights about this did you

00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:27,570
experience that kind of situation here

00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:30,759
where children have a very very are a

00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:34,419
small access or no access to the

00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:36,929
capability to learn the IT world or the

00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,929
IT

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:43,780
yeah yeah let's go consider also the

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:46,420
other third world country that are just

00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:49,030
beginning to grow with their economical

00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:50,920
stability especially Africa those

00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:53,860
countries that are not yet being rich by

00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:55,930
high technology right now nowadays and

00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,790
specifically in philippines there are

00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:00,520
some part of Philippe's that are really

00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:04,059
in the genius so up to now they're still

00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:06,280
trying to grasp technology you know it

00:23:04,059 --> 00:23:10,300
sounds so funny sometimes because even

00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:13,360
in our public at a public elementary

00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:16,230
school our teachers there were more than

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,870
50 years working in the public sector

00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:23,559
but whenever you introduce them how to

00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:25,750
use a laptop they're gonna they're going

00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:29,530
to be scared because they might Derek's

00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:31,390
Derek they are expecting that the laptop

00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:33,220
will explode or something that if they

00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:36,429
push the button and the laptop it will

00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:40,120
pop out from it so that's another sad

00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:42,730
thing about the reality happening in the

00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,460
Philippines sometimes and there are also

00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:47,460
some schools in the Philippines that are

00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:51,850
in our days are not being equipped by

00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:54,670
technology still need to develop more so

00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:57,730
I think the community that's why the

00:23:54,670 --> 00:24:00,280
community is here is he for us to help

00:23:57,730 --> 00:24:03,250
the government and for us to help the

00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:06,520
society to be aware of this kind of

00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:08,260
activities in an hour in the Philippine

00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:11,590
Drupal users group we have this so

00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:15,220
called the road show which is also we

00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:17,970
are a a road show where we do trainings

00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:22,470
and seminars to different universities

00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:25,540
so we go travel from different places

00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:27,940
provinces to introduce to Paul to them

00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:30,730
where the geek girls we are included by

00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:32,770
the geek girls and then we introduced to

00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:34,750
them the basic fundamentals of japal

00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:36,730
first is you need to understand the

00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:39,040
meaning of japal of course you cannot

00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,700
you cannot learn you Paul until you know

00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,460
the meaning

00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,620
of it and how it has been established by

00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:46,840
the community leaders because there is

00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:51,669
something with Drupal that has a very

00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:55,179
valuable thing and that is the the the

00:24:51,669 --> 00:24:56,830
community culture of Japan and I guess

00:24:55,179 --> 00:24:59,260
there's something it has something to do

00:24:56,830 --> 00:25:00,789
with the attitude of the developers so

00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:03,010
we need to introduce them that the

00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:05,409
Drupal community is a community of

00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:08,980
people working together networking as

00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:10,539
person for myself alone so we need to

00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:12,789
encourage them to be involved in the

00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:15,850
community and we need to start on the

00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:18,429
early stage because you know at the

00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:21,700
early stage we can still change their

00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:24,309
points of view right because you can if

00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,320
they're there a hook for example I

00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:30,149
excuse me for those out people that I

00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:33,990
guess it is much easier to access the

00:25:30,149 --> 00:25:38,320
the younger people because there are a

00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:40,750
bit are easy to approach with with the

00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,580
system because they tend to ask question

00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:44,559
like oh it is too pal I want to learn to

00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,760
you about some of the students that we

00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,799
thought in the Philippines in the

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,039
different universities they were asking

00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:53,500
is Drupal a kiss with Stacey a drop of

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,779
water please the thought that is it the

00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,820
drop of water is something like that or

00:25:55,779 --> 00:26:02,200
meaning or a symbol of water in your

00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:03,669
country no it's a CMS where we use for

00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,740
building websites so it's a very

00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:08,380
powerful tool that's how we introduce it

00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:12,070
and you need to learn it in an easy way

00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:14,019
so we don't talk teach them yet the

00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:16,539
local version because it's going to be a

00:26:14,019 --> 00:26:18,399
very long process so we need to show

00:26:16,539 --> 00:26:20,620
that we use first the web-enabled that

00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:22,419
come if you know that so it's much

00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:24,779
easier for them to point and click for a

00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:32,500
while then later on learn the hard way

00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:37,120
but there is a into open drupal users

00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:42,700
group we have 30 yeah out of the I know

00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:45,700
it's 50 out of the 750 but those 750 in

00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:48,519
the Facebook page are not all Drupal

00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:52,299
developers there just are trying to join

00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:54,250
the group so the total developers that

00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:57,200
are really attending

00:26:54,250 --> 00:27:00,920
moreover on the last event of japal

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:03,140
developers they are 100 so we have a Jew

00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:06,230
Pokemon februari 16 which is we're

00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:08,780
expecting 250 people but this time it's

00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:11,809
going to be big so we are happy that

00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:14,000
your pal comp Manila will be near so i

00:27:11,809 --> 00:27:16,940
hope you guys can would be able to come

00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,320
and also experience Manila so there will

00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:23,420
be great so this is also a case to case

00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:26,179
study with women are less confident

00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:27,669
because I there's this this it has

00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:30,679
something to do also with the

00:27:27,669 --> 00:27:32,840
environment in your in your house for

00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:35,090
example your family are your family

00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,429
upbringing your influence of your father

00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:39,650
and mother to is very strong and you

00:27:37,429 --> 00:27:42,110
have developed already self-confident at

00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:44,780
an early stage you will not be less

00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:46,970
confident right because some the

00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:51,140
community starts with our family sector

00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:52,820
so no one just evolved just or no one

00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:55,549
just pop out from the community without

00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:57,620
the parent so the parent are always

00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:59,540
involved in the development of a person

00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:02,450
so it should always start with the

00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:06,350
family sector so where there's so many

00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:08,380
female that are less confident in doing

00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:11,150
this kind of development team or

00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:13,220
involving themselves in the community so

00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:16,070
that is the main question so if you have

00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:18,320
any any insights about this because this

00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:22,370
is a case to case study you can raise

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:24,799
your hand and suggest anything do you

00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:27,950
have any insights about women that are

00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:30,910
less confident or do you believe that we

00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,910
are less confident

00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,550
you

00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:52,170
haha alright

00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:49,450
because my female girls yeah that's sure

00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,470
Oh

00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:22,820
yeah yes I agree with that sally has

00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:24,830
something to do with the negotiation

00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:27,680
evenly sometimes when I'm negotiating

00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:30,260
with the client I still consult my

00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:32,270
husband sometimes because you know the

00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:34,370
development thing with the project is I

00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:36,950
don't really know yet the whole

00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:40,040
information of the project so as a

00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:42,620
female I should be consulting first my

00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:44,690
husband in order for me to get the

00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:46,850
contract and push it on the client

00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:51,110
because the negotiation is something to

00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:57,860
do with the your firm a firm decision so

00:30:51,110 --> 00:31:01,220
female yeah he's an IT so I'm also

00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:04,060
thankful that he mentored me for this so

00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:08,710
I was able to adopt in the joopa world

00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:13,850
so fewer opportunities for mentoring

00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:16,640
okay do you see that there's a there's

00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:18,680
also some problem with the less

00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,350
opportunities of mentorship mentorship

00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:24,200
in the female industry for example in

00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:26,360
the IT world why why do we see that

00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,050
there are small population of hemoglobin

00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:29,050
in the IT industry

00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:35,549
Oh

00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:25,590
yeah the dot upbringing a factor is one

00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:29,100
main big factor that affects the female

00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:32,220
because you know to show you some short

00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:34,550
history about my childhood I was not

00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:37,440
like this before i'm a very antisocial

00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:41,610
person i don't grew up in a community

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:44,430
where I I was accepted and I'm not a

00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:46,620
happy goer or I don't go out from the

00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:49,650
house because my father is a military

00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:51,660
man so I'm somewhat restricted to go out

00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:53,550
from the US just study and clean the

00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:56,460
house that's all my task for the whole

00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:59,130
day until I grew up then I became

00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:01,230
curious about the world because it

00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:04,500
depends on the person actually even if

00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:06,780
your parents are are bringing you like

00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:09,060
that negatively it depends on you when

00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:10,860
you grow up at you have choices we have

00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:12,690
all the choices in our lives it's either

00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:16,050
you choose to be bad or you choose to be

00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:17,370
to be good right so it's not I don't

00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:20,220
believe in the saying that I don't have

00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:26,520
a choice you know I always heard the

00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:29,370
saying I don't have a choice yeah those

00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:32,130
were the days I was mentally black from

00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:34,650
the real world so because my father was

00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:37,260
very strict and I don't have friends

00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:39,270
imagine that how did I evolve here in

00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:42,990
the community I just thank God because

00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:47,190
my husband was a very friendly person

00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:49,500
and he is very alive and active in the

00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:53,100
community doing advocacy in the Drupal

00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:56,070
world so that's why you need one mentor

00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:58,560
at least in your household at least one

00:33:56,070 --> 00:34:01,440
positive person because if everyone in

00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:03,000
the household are all negative how come

00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,280
with the child be developed into a

00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:07,500
positive one right so at least there

00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,410
will be one positive person evolving

00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:13,080
around you or either you choose your

00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:15,840
friends you choose where you will be for

00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:21,240
example you're going out with people who

00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:23,280
who who are influenced you badly so I'd

00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,440
rather choose I have a choice I'd rather

00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,200
choose these good people because this

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,470
will return me some benefits later on

00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,610
not only the benefits of becoming a more

00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:34,920
social

00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:37,650
and more friendly but also the

00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:40,580
development inside myself the confidence

00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:43,110
so we always have a choice that's it so

00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:45,420
well that bringing has something to do

00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:47,760
but you have something to do with

00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:51,360
yourself also it matters on the person

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:53,790
also because we all have the choice next

00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:57,450
is yeah number one is when we are

00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:59,850
discouraged at an early age i'm talking

00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:02,130
about the philippine factor okay this is

00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:03,810
about the philippine culture not on the

00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:07,070
australian one because then our

00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:10,590
philippine culture when we were young

00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:14,790
parents tend to say during those time

00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:17,460
when we when we say something in front

00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:21,360
of them we were with that we they tend

00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:24,240
to shut shut shut us up like don't don't

00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:27,330
talk if we are talking so female in

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:30,300
during those time are very quiet we're

00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:32,750
very naive only nowadays that we want to

00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:35,070
be very very talkative and we are very

00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:36,900
you know alive in the community as you

00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:38,610
can see there are lots of rally going in

00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:41,970
in philippines and most of that are

00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:44,730
active females you can see them in the

00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:49,590
streets wrong perceptions about

00:35:44,730 --> 00:35:52,410
computing okay i have so many friends in

00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:55,140
the Philippines when I when I tend to

00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:56,520
introduce to them that Drupal thing did

00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:59,880
they tend to say what's that is that

00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:02,580
coding oh it's hard hey you've never

00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:04,200
tried it you've already said hard why

00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:07,070
don't you try it first before you say no

00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:10,650
right because you will not you will net

00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:13,740
you not say something unless you get

00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:18,080
there so try it first before you say

00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:20,970
something no so another thing is that

00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:23,880
their perception regarding the IT

00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:26,580
community because female are the female

00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:29,690
in the Philippines before when we were

00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:32,400
not yet very active during those time

00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:35,640
they tend to see the ID community as

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:38,820
being dominated by me Oh Oh mail again

00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:40,830
here we go here's the malefactor again

00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:42,480
and then the female out there were

00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:45,480
sitting in the back just listening to

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,160
the male speaker you you you you need

00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,310
to me this is love Goulding is a

00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:53,460
programming that's how we do it but

00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:56,310
until some female geek ladies in the

00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:59,540
 some spearheaded the community

00:36:56,310 --> 00:37:01,920
there are some women being inspired and

00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:05,760
became active in the community and

00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:08,550
participated already and I also did some

00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,250
encouragement for this female especially

00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:15,060
in the Drupal which is really really

00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:18,570
hard to encourage some female to be

00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:21,840
active because you know the main reason

00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:24,990
why female are bounded in the household

00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:26,820
task we are bounded by the household

00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:29,790
task we have passed in the house so we

00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:33,300
need to do and then the other factor is

00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:36,090
that most of us are moms mothers so as

00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:39,180
mothers we have our designated Task for

00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:41,340
children we cannot love it like that

00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:44,340
like we cannot leave the task alone with

00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:47,880
our husband because we are the main main

00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:49,410
person to handle it right because if you

00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,090
are especially giving birth to your

00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:52,710
child for example you have given birth

00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:55,109
to your child you'll be the one to nurse

00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:57,119
your baby it's not going to be your

00:37:55,109 --> 00:38:00,330
husband of course he doesn't have a

00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:03,900
breast milk right so should be us if

00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:05,760
only sometimes I am joking my husband

00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,190
and trying to joke a my phone lead up

00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:10,350
the breast milk will be transferred to

00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,900
you I would give it to you because I

00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:15,710
wanted to work and sometimes there's a

00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:18,990
factor between those are salary thing

00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:22,109
that if the husband salary is much

00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:24,570
higher than the female sometimes when

00:38:22,109 --> 00:38:26,340
the child gets sick the mother is

00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:30,570
already bonded to take care of the child

00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:34,320
so that's one main reason why why female

00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:36,840
female are rarely found in the community

00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:42,630
because they have so many operas

00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:45,900
abilities don't we have all right so who

00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:49,680
are parents already female female

00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:53,970
mothers who are mothers are you all

00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:57,090
single okay I'm a mother so I have three

00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:58,130
kids and I'm trying to balance my time

00:38:57,090 --> 00:39:00,750
and

00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:02,490
everything in my family went and with

00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:06,780
the community it's also sometimes

00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:09,720
heartbreaking if you left the job for

00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:11,550
your husband for example you are going

00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:13,830
to attend a community event then you

00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:15,540
will leave your child to your nanny it's

00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:18,060
very hard because you cannot entrust

00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:21,600
your child to someone who is not very

00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:24,120
trusted right so as a as a mother you

00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,730
have the heart to always think of your

00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:31,500
children for their welfare so it's not

00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:34,650
always like that next is um okay lack of

00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:37,050
female role models that's it in the

00:39:34,650 --> 00:39:41,130
Philippine situation we saw don't find

00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:43,500
the female female role models we want to

00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:45,810
like you know I've met antiviral and

00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:47,520
she's really a rock star for me but in

00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:50,160
the Philippines we have so many

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,800
community leaders but we want someone

00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:56,010
who will really mentor us and give us

00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,770
encouragement like we want someone like

00:39:56,010 --> 00:40:00,960
really a rock star behind us or beside

00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:03,750
us that will really show us that they

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,530
are really leading to a community so

00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:09,650
that is one factor that is lot nowadays

00:40:06,530 --> 00:40:13,380
next is the games classes aim toward men

00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:16,460
do you do you agree I have some some

00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:20,220
question about the gaming the gaming our

00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:23,250
gaming factor between oh do you play war

00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:27,210
world of warcraft and who play games

00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:30,090
here because you know i have Wi-Fi with

00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:33,450
those gamers designers or the game game

00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:37,620
designers used to create female versions

00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:41,220
in the game wearing nude very big

00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:44,460
breasts and it's so horrible that you

00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:47,820
can see your character is really wearing

00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:50,790
nothing but just the underwear right so

00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:54,360
i was trying to play a daughter before

00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:56,070
but my my my character is just like is

00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:58,980
this really the character that i'm

00:40:56,070 --> 00:41:03,030
having here with a big breasts and big

00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:07,220
butt and that's what they view was maybe

00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:07,220
with men are viewing a sexy butt

00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:24,330
yeah yeah so if ever we would be able to

00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:26,550
see some day some female role models in

00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:41,610
the game that we are also doing some

00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:44,400
good characters ha ha ha ha ha ha now I

00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:47,430
just I just want to to ask that question

00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,680
because some of the females were also

00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:54,330
looking for something that we will be

00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:58,260
viewed as not on the body but more on

00:41:54,330 --> 00:42:03,360
the brain men would see us in here not

00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:05,010
here right so typically that's what I'm

00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:09,210
looking for also in the gaming industry

00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:11,670
and importance of life balancing ok so

00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:14,220
there's something to do with our as

00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:16,440
parents or even if you are single and

00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:19,770
you're the breadwinner of the family you

00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:21,060
also have responsibilities so if there

00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:23,070
is a social events that you need to

00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:26,580
attend to sometimes you have family

00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:28,890
activities you have to go so we can be

00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:30,750
able to attend a session because you

00:42:28,890 --> 00:42:32,580
need to go there and sometimes your mom

00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:34,590
is sick you need to attend your mom and

00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:37,260
and unless you want to leave your mom

00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:39,600
and go attend the session for drupalcon

00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:44,600
right but finally matters comes first

00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:48,300
right so we females are really are very

00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:51,290
passionate with our families and with

00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:54,330
the way we rebalance our life so

00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:56,040
sometimes I also there are also men I

00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:57,750
know I believe that there are also men

00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,840
who are also taking care of their

00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:05,940
families but most of our females most of

00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:08,370
us are also more on passionate on doing

00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:11,700
these things because we are already in

00:43:08,370 --> 00:43:14,070
it so ever since the world began we are

00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:16,680
the first one to create the family like

00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:19,680
we're giving birth we're doing the

00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:23,970
reproductive thing so that's how we

00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:25,559
do it so just like what I said it's

00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:28,980
important that we build the community

00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:33,240
that to encourage more female to be

00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:36,569
active just like now I was asking a with

00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:38,430
Donna is it would be would be anyone or

00:43:36,569 --> 00:43:40,619
would anyone be interested to attend a

00:43:38,430 --> 00:43:47,309
session because there's more on geek

00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:50,069
girls so my my my my my idea with that

00:43:47,309 --> 00:43:52,050
is that as a community we should support

00:43:50,069 --> 00:43:55,770
one another right especially if there is

00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:57,960
a female speaker as female developers or

00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:59,730
female community members if there are so

00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,880
few more speakers we should support them

00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:05,430
to show our passion for the community

00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,930
work together as one so when the next

00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:09,359
time around you'll be the one to talk

00:44:06,930 --> 00:44:11,700
here we also support you right so that's

00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:14,099
how we work in the Drupal Philippines as

00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:17,490
a community we help each other we

00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:21,000
support one another and we tend to

00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:22,859
collaborate with other groups so how do

00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,599
we how do we collaborate with with other

00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:26,250
groups actually there are many groups in

00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:29,250
the Philippine dupa in the Philippine

00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:32,040
settings we have Python we have Ruby we

00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:35,240
have PHP there are lots of programming

00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:38,720
languages but we collaborate with them

00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:41,670
how we collaborate is that by meet ups

00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:44,309
so is there something to do with the

00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:46,589
fight of the programming language do you

00:44:44,309 --> 00:44:48,510
fight with each other for example here

00:44:46,589 --> 00:44:50,250
in Australia they have that kind of

00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:54,599
issue like for example if you do Paul

00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:56,130
and his Ruby I don't know you right when

00:44:54,599 --> 00:44:58,200
you attend the conference and he is

00:44:56,130 --> 00:45:01,980
Drupal and this is Ruby sometimes the

00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:05,250
community leaders are I am more more

00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:07,440
hard coded than you right just something

00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:09,270
to do with that I guess that would not

00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,430
be necessary for us to do that because

00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:14,190
you know as community we should be

00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:16,710
helping one another as and especially we

00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:20,069
are open source we're open source

00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:23,930
community so other than that they have

00:45:20,069 --> 00:45:27,589
more time ok five minutes to wrap up I

00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:32,339
just want to show you some some pictures

00:45:27,589 --> 00:45:33,790
ok right ok so to give us inspiration

00:45:32,339 --> 00:45:36,400
about this info

00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:39,550
show women I can see that they are very

00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:42,220
influential because she's the founder of

00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:44,740
slideshare Rasmussen huh you know her

00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:48,610
already and angie by wrong of drupal

00:45:44,740 --> 00:45:53,740
chicks and marissa mayer of google and

00:45:48,610 --> 00:45:55,450
kalia hamlin up open ID community so

00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:58,000
those are some of the women that are

00:45:55,450 --> 00:46:01,420
I've included in the Philippine here the

00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:04,090
geek leaders Eileen Apollo up Google and

00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:07,540
conform and a Python users group me as

00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:10,450
myself for filton drupal and sherry and

00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:13,750
domingo of PHP and the developers

00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:16,810
connect fluoride the Ortiz okay I've

00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:18,840
already discussed that and here are some

00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:24,520
of the pictures that we have with our

00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:26,850
female female are the girls that are

00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:30,100
already included in the Drupal community

00:46:26,850 --> 00:46:34,390
so we've encouraged them already we've

00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:36,460
already trained them and mentor them to

00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:42,430
learn drupal as well they're also doing

00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:45,220
japon now yeah okay let me pass that so

00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:51,100
these are some geek female events that

00:46:45,220 --> 00:46:52,620
are included here okay as you can see

00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,880
there are some women already

00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:58,540
participating in Drupal we have last

00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:03,100
year our Drupal inauguration day which

00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:05,550
we already acknowledged the volunteers

00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:07,450
so you really we have this what we call

00:47:05,550 --> 00:47:08,860
acknowledging volunteers for the

00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:10,960
community because you know it's

00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:13,360
important that we acknowledge every ball

00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:17,380
and tears so that we they have something

00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:19,710
to cherish further hard works and not

00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,710
only that

00:47:25,779 --> 00:47:42,039
drupalcamp Manila Drupal certification

00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:54,589
we have already if we have yeah sure

00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:56,799
uh-huh yeah mmhmm yeah that's yes that

00:47:54,589 --> 00:48:00,710
will be great that will be great and

00:47:56,799 --> 00:48:04,940
yeah we have in order to help them all

00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:06,829
so we okay we included them sorry for

00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:08,599
this we included them in the

00:48:06,829 --> 00:48:11,509
Toastmasters we're also doing a

00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:13,970
Toastmasters International for female

00:48:11,509 --> 00:48:16,640
because you know female is sometimes

00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:19,249
naive and shy so we try to develop their

00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,839
public speaking skills by involving them

00:48:19,249 --> 00:48:22,789
in the Toastmasters club so at least

00:48:20,839 --> 00:48:25,430
they can experience talking in front of

00:48:22,789 --> 00:48:27,410
the stage and that's not only the

00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:30,140
program that we have for this future

00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:32,749
coming events we have more training for

00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:35,509
the females and not only for the females

00:48:32,749 --> 00:48:38,359
but for the community volunteers so

00:48:35,509 --> 00:48:40,069
that's how we that's how we encourage

00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:45,489
our volunteers in the Drupal community

00:48:40,069 --> 00:48:47,630
and this is our logo for the duplicant

00:48:45,489 --> 00:48:52,420
philippine drupal users group and

00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:55,519
clipping geek girls and all right I

00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:57,980
think that's all my topic all about

00:48:55,519 --> 00:49:00,559
today so if you have any more questions

00:48:57,980 --> 00:49:03,789
we can you can raise it up or if you

00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:06,890
don't have any more that will be fine

00:49:03,789 --> 00:49:08,359
since this is my first time that would

00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:10,930
be great I will not answering your

00:49:08,359 --> 00:49:10,930
questions

00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:33,300
yeah he was raising his hands yeah

00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,300
charity

00:49:57,850 --> 00:50:04,970
so what what do you mean you want to

00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:12,200
establish a group or a meet up for women

00:50:04,970 --> 00:50:21,470
with you can she said they want more

00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:23,510
female no not really you're not doing

00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:26,570
anything bad to women it's just like the

00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:28,730
perception of some women over this IT

00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:30,860
thing and they we just need some

00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:32,840
mentorship and clarification with you

00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:35,810
guys sometimes also it has to do with

00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:38,690
some snappy people in the East versus

00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:41,300
industry especially the executives so

00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:44,510
women are you know women are emotional

00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:47,270
right so when we at the first impression

00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:50,480
when we tend to be ignored sometimes we

00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:52,970
we are sometimes discouraged already so

00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,790
somehow the first impression of a person

00:50:52,970 --> 00:51:00,820
you should be accessible at first two

00:50:55,790 --> 00:51:05,470
women and accommodating yeah should be

00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:05,470
so other than okay

00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,960
Oh

00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:57,230
well for me I believe that it has

00:51:55,820 --> 00:52:02,660
something to do with the community

00:51:57,230 --> 00:52:04,849
leaders because my first when I was not

00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:07,430
yet in our Drupal I will not say any

00:52:04,849 --> 00:52:11,450
particular group when I attended one

00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:13,310
community in philippines there's you

00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:16,700
know people are people you can change

00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:18,589
them right even if we are doable people

00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:21,890
and we are open source we have our own

00:52:18,589 --> 00:52:25,599
attitudes we cannot change that so for

00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:29,300
me it has something to do with the

00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:32,210
accessibility of or the availability of

00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:34,070
leaders to those week because you know

00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:37,510
in the community there there are groups

00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:40,970
of weak people or those people that are

00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:46,640
less what you call them they they are

00:52:40,970 --> 00:52:49,069
tend to yeah tend to be a look or

00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:52,220
somehow isolating themselves from the

00:52:49,069 --> 00:52:54,140
other groups so in order to let them do

00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:57,500
that we should be the one to approach

00:52:54,140 --> 00:53:01,069
them because we should be more aware as

00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:03,470
a leader like me I learned to be aware

00:53:01,069 --> 00:53:05,660
of the people around me when I felt

00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:08,359
something bad happening in my community

00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:11,349
I am the one first approaching the

00:53:08,359 --> 00:53:11,349
volunteers

00:53:14,229 --> 00:53:18,099
well that's in the Philippines

00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:12,150
Oh

00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:48,370
Oh

00:54:53,750 --> 00:55:00,620
yeah I I had to agree with her and

00:54:57,410 --> 00:55:02,990
somehow in our in our group what we do

00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:05,390
in the volunteers meeting when we have

00:55:02,990 --> 00:55:08,120
new members in the community this is a

00:55:05,390 --> 00:55:11,840
long process of past actually we're

00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:14,060
doing a background check for this person

00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:16,340
because we wanted to not really the

00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:18,320
background or the more deeper back but

00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:22,070
just are the family background so we

00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:24,770
know how to adopt with her emotional

00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:28,460
tantrums you know sometimes volunteers

00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:31,070
tend to not appear sometimes and so that

00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:34,760
you know what's going on and you will

00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:37,820
not be you don't look like to be so

00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:39,560
dictator with them because sometimes you

00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:42,140
will be misinterpreted as dictating

00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:46,570
something for them so it has to be

00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:46,570
always a request for the volunteer

00:56:07,089 --> 00:56:16,809
