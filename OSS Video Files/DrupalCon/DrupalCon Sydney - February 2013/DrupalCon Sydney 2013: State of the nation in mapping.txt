welcome to my presentation on the state

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:07,370
of the nation in mapping my name is Rick

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:12,690
the bore I've done software for 20 years

00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:15,089
I've done C++ Java Ruby and rails until

00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:18,660
five years ago I got to know Drupal I

00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:21,810
haven't looked back since I now only do

00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,960
drupal why because in my professional

00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:27,000
career I've never had more fun and have

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,519
never seen better results than when

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,090
using Drupal we see that all the time at

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,070
the fling collective we do small sites

00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,590
big sites commercial sites

00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:42,300
non-commercial sides government sites

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:44,520
and every time we're delighted about how

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,030
well Drupal performs at such a wide

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,730
variety of applications if there's any

00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:54,270
doubt in your mind or in your boss's

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:57,090
mind or in your boss's boss's mind about

00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:59,010
plunging into Drupal then I suggest you

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,710
what's the video of Cheong whose

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:06,540
presentation yesterday we showed how a

00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:09,990
big corporation suncorp went from 0 to

00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:20,490
30 Drupal sites in just a few years and

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:22,650
with no regrets so why does topic well

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,390
simply I love Maps I think maps are

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,350
beautiful and maps are also very

00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:33,680
effective above all they're very easy to

00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:36,869
make in Drupal but most importantly

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,939
they're really attractive to use for for

00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:43,110
your visitors maps will help your

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:47,700
business i started my mapping journey

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:50,159
six months ago and i started digging

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,939
into drupal what was what was out there

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,680
i embraced modules i discarded modules

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,079
are pets modules and i wrote modules

00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,530
from scratch and so did the rest of the

00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,380
community as a result it is now easier

00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,719
to make beautiful maps and then it is

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,450
than it has ever been I like to share

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,959
what I learned in six months with you in

00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,959
60 minutes

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:21,620
I've got three take away points these

00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:24,170
points are my kpi's my sponsor which is

00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:25,940
me will not buy me a return ticket to

00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:30,099
Melbourne if you don't remember these

00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:34,310
three things so here we go number one

00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:36,080
think Maps not tables every time you see

00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,760
a map I want you to sit sorry every time

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,629
you see a table I want you to think I

00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:45,200
can turn this into a snazzy mad number

00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:49,000
two leaflet we don't know what leaflet

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:53,359
is yet but just remember leaflet and

00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,420
number three you can do this you can

00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:59,989
make beautiful maps that look a million

00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:08,450
dollars in Drupal using only six modules

00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:10,790
and no coding quick outline of our

00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:12,590
presentation first of them to talk a

00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,390
little bit more about why I think maps

00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:18,829
are useful not just in Drupal but in

00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:20,450
general and secondly a bit of a field

00:03:18,829 --> 00:03:23,989
trip i'm going to show you a few maps

00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:25,790
from around the world and i want you to

00:03:23,989 --> 00:03:29,150
see how you feel about those are the

00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:31,819
good are they bouta bed and then I want

00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:36,440
to fast-track you through the jungle of

00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:40,250
Drupal map modules to present you with a

00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:42,799
set of six modules that will work ninety

00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:46,090
percent of the time for ninety percent

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:48,260
of your customers now and in the future

00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,790
and finally I want to put my money where

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:54,680
my mouth is if the internet works and

00:03:51,790 --> 00:04:02,359
show you those six modules live in

00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:04,940
action here on stage so why would you

00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:07,579
want to use maps because Maps engage

00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:12,019
maps draw you in like no amount of

00:04:07,579 --> 00:04:15,949
numbers can in an engage visitors care

00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:19,729
and they need to care before they do

00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:22,340
something on your side jesus said it in

00:04:19,729 --> 00:04:23,930
his keynote on that in order to run a

00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,740
business on the internet you need to

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,650
first attract

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:32,000
then engage influence convert and retain

00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:36,380
well maps are a very strong way I feel

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,520
to engage people but it's not just

00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:43,460
pretty pictures maps also help to

00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:48,139
analyze data they alert us to outliers

00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:50,240
they reveal correlations and I'm going

00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:52,460
to talk about that a bit more in my

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,449
demonstration that second aspects of of

00:04:52,460 --> 00:05:00,680
maps the analytical power of them but

00:04:56,449 --> 00:05:03,620
whether it's a pretty map or a very

00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:07,250
analytical map in both cases Maps sent

00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:09,380
the visitor on a journey leading to

00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:10,639
actions and at the end of the day that's

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:13,190
what you want you don't want your

00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,340
customers to just look at your website

00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:18,440
you want them to do things like pick up

00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:23,800
the phone and buy your product or your

00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:29,150
service does anybody care about this

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:31,969
don't think so but you got to use maps

00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:34,940
well because maps are strong visual

00:05:31,969 --> 00:05:38,330
elements so they play a role in the

00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:41,300
image that you create and the perception

00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:44,030
that you create for your website and

00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:46,400
therefore for your business so that may

00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:49,250
work out well or a main work out not so

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,820
well so I want to take you on a little

00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:56,120
field trip oh sorry I forgot to mention

00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:59,780
about the the image if I see a Google

00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,810
map an old 2006 then I think well these

00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:05,599
guys are probably a little bit lazy or a

00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:07,729
bit boring or just plain corporate but

00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:10,460
if I see a really creative modern map

00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:13,900
then I think wow these guys are with the

00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,900
tide guys these guys are cool

00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:25,750
so he's a little field trip you can look

00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:29,050
at these maps any way you like but in in

00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:32,910
order to judge them use either your own

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:37,360
criteria or these if you not quite sure

00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:41,350
so think for yourself is this map

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:44,200
functional does it visually engage does

00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:49,420
it tell a story fingers crossed that

00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:56,830
this all works technically so hopefully

00:06:49,420 --> 00:07:00,250
if I click on this ye anyone remember

00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:02,110
the great fire of 1666 in London well

00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:04,720
there it is on the real map this is

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:10,210
actually a real map so you can you can

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:12,250
scroll it and you can zoom in and this

00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:15,820
is a done by the wonderful guys of

00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:20,950
stamen it's so high-tech that it doesn't

00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:23,920
work on any browser but chrome actually

00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:25,060
and there is so much computation going

00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:28,000
on I don't know whether you can see that

00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:29,590
at the end but try this at home by all

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,450
means if you look close on the screen

00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:33,730
and you see all these pixels changing

00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:36,100
from chimney rare too pumpkin air and

00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:41,440
orange and banana and it's just

00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:43,150
fascinating to look at and after a while

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,610
your machine actually heats up the fan

00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:48,840
the fan kicks in because that's how much

00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:48,840
computation goes on here

00:07:53,169 --> 00:08:03,060
so what a cold hot one arm cut that was

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:10,300
cold don't like it who thinks it's hot

00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:13,090
yeah me too i think it's red hot um it

00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,590
definitely visually engages functionally

00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:16,620
well you can't really use that to go

00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:19,090
from A to B you navigate you on the road

00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:21,400
obviously but does it tell a story well

00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:23,259
anyway it does because when I see these

00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,909
I think whoa if I ever need

00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:27,490
visualization I'm going to call these

00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:31,930
guys because they clearly have the

00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:39,490
technology so yeah interesting example

00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:43,649
of a of a map okay this one maybe that

00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:48,190
one I can get live on screen as well yay

00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:52,420
ok this this is part of a website

00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:57,279
actually and this part is a map of print

00:08:52,420 --> 00:09:01,180
shops and design studios all over the

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:04,000
world what the guys done is used like a

00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:05,709
printing font to match the the topic

00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,040
which is kind of cool and then also the

00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:14,110
canvas of the map is a is a toner tone a

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:15,550
style font but it's not as simple as it

00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:17,949
may seem because you see all these

00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:23,140
balloons balloon here balloons hear a

00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:25,709
click on one it zooms in to the next

00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:32,110
level and all the underlying markers and

00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:34,120
explode out until when I'm here in this

00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:36,430
case in Chicago at the lowest level we

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,819
see the individual print shops we can

00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:43,690
click click on these and we get a link

00:09:39,819 --> 00:09:47,620
to the website so it's a very natural

00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:50,319
and beautiful way animated way to use

00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:52,870
maps to navigate the site basically

00:09:50,319 --> 00:09:55,089
because i'm using the map rather than

00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:57,480
drop downs and to get to a particular

00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:57,480
site

00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:07,690
you

00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:10,980
who thinks this is a fail not one cool

00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:18,370
yep fair enough who thinks it's a pass

00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:20,680
majority I think the past as well now

00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,150
this one this one I can't see life with

00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,650
it because the show life because the

00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:28,180
site isn't live yet and it was done by

00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,950
someone who contacted me and said week

00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:32,790
very Greek i'm using your modules i made

00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:41,170
a beautiful met of places where you can

00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:44,380
buy a good drink in belgium and yeah so

00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:46,150
um he did the right thing he started off

00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:48,130
with the first two of my recommended

00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,330
modules and then I said oh you really

00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:51,250
have to use the other ones as well

00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:52,750
because you can get the beautiful market

00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:54,130
clustering and you can navigate your way

00:10:52,750 --> 00:11:00,180
through Belgium you can actually see the

00:10:54,130 --> 00:11:04,180
Belgium is there ah so unfortunately

00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:07,260
this was there this was the slide where

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:10,540
where he was going to redeem himself but

00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:16,450
he never got back to me so sorry young

00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:22,750
Frederick okay what about this one see

00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:26,170
if I can that this this one live on ok

00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:28,270
this is actually for square and this is

00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:34,180
what you get when you're in coogee and

00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:36,550
you type in cold beer and so yeah ok

00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:39,880
it's a very attractive map it's it's a

00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:44,700
matte box map foursquare ditched Google

00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:47,380
last year in favor of leaflet the

00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:49,540
rendering system and matte box the tile

00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:53,320
tiling system so very attractive-looking

00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:55,360
map markers well they only have just

00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,360
matter numbers in them what do they mean

00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,870
not sure but the thing that annoys me

00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:05,050
mark most poor square is all about me

00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:08,110
right it's me surrounded by my friends

00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:11,560
and the restaurants and but where where

00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:13,839
is me I don't get a marker right and on

00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:15,810
top of that we had a good life at the

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,080
the previous

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:21,450
slide with all those markers on on top

00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:24,600
of each other looking like a scaly fish

00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:28,200
well this is no better oh but hold on i

00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,570
can i can zoom in right so zoom in zoom

00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,029
in oh yeah I've zoomed in but now my

00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:35,370
markers have gone north Oh pan pan pan

00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:38,130
do you see the difference between this

00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:40,710
one and that the the toner map how easy

00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:45,450
the toner one was and how cumbersome

00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:47,580
this is first I still don't know where I

00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:54,570
am I mean I'm new to Sydney where where

00:12:47,580 --> 00:13:07,230
is Cody on the map yeah he don't rain on

00:12:54,570 --> 00:13:15,510
my parade okay so um thanks mate 22 is

00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:18,600
actually manly I think might okay um he

00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:20,580
put me of mine that's right um so yeah

00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:24,960
what do we think hip a square who thinks

00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:30,420
this is really hip do you think this is

00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:33,510
pretty ordinary yeah i agree with all

00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:35,780
your millions foursquare you could have

00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,780
done better

00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:56,060
okay this very cute looking website is

00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:57,680
about New Zealand fruit stalls so you

00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,930
can sign up there and you can say i'm

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,950
selling fruit there there and you can

00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:06,110
put your marker on the map it's a really

00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:09,170
cute site i mean i love the the design

00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:12,440
of it and also an attractive map again

00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:16,460
leaflet and matte box so the same as for

00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:20,300
square but what foursquare failed to do

00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:23,270
this husband and wife did brilliantly

00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:27,650
look at the the Marcus again click on it

00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:29,180
bang you zoom in zoom into more ok I'm

00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:32,210
going to know about that fruit stall I

00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:34,190
get extra information and the black

00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:37,700
currants is a taxonomy so I click on the

00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:39,290
taxonomy get other black blackberry

00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:42,290
things that it might be interested with

00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:46,130
again with a beautiful map so you see

00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:50,740
how how easy this all works and and how

00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:53,480
easy it is to navigate this side plus oh

00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:57,730
don't we didn't get the market did we

00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,730
let me maybe you have to zoom out a bit

00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:04,580
okay I don't know but normally the the

00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:06,560
market comes up as well so you see

00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:09,710
yourself in relations to the fruit

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:18,730
stalls around you so very well done i

00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:22,240
think yes yeah yeah yeahs age 75

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,240
geolocation that's right

00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:33,340
okay so ripe a rotten definitely ripe

00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:37,090
very sweet indeed I think okay so in

00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:39,790
summary what's new in 2013 compared to

00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:41,890
two thousand six does map still mean

00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:45,640
Google Maps well I think we've seen some

00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:47,770
really fresh looks um and and none of

00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:52,620
them were except one I think we're

00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:55,060
google so we've got a lot more choice

00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,580
but there's two other aspects that have

00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,170
changed since 2006 and both of them have

00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:04,330
to do both of them have to do with

00:15:59,170 --> 00:16:07,270
mobility the first one is that people

00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:10,120
use mobile phones now more than ever and

00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:11,500
that means that and they want to know

00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,560
where they are they want to be the

00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:16,810
center of the map and in order to do

00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:19,360
that like Shawn said you need new

00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:22,090
technology which is html5 an IP address

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:25,330
lookup is not going to cut it if you

00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:28,480
want to look to show where someone is on

00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:33,640
up on a mobile the second aspect of

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:37,210
mobility is that phones and tablets are

00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:40,480
not as powerful as a desktop so ideally

00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:42,850
you want to work with a mapping package

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,720
that is optimized for mobile that is

00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:50,800
lightweight and doesn't require huge

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:57,160
dine downloads or huge CPU power in

00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:59,950
order to bring the maps to you so when I

00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,630
started digging around in Drupal and

00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:06,189
four modules that would help me with my

00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:08,709
maps as soon found that there's many to

00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:10,420
choose from but there's really strong

00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:11,980
dependencies as well so you can't say

00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,569
okay I'll pick that one for my

00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,720
coordinate storage and then I'll pick

00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:20,800
that one for filtering and i'll pick

00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:24,640
that one for to show the map it doesn't

00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:28,080
work like that because one module will

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:30,790
only go with one or two other modules I

00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:33,010
also found that some really obvious

00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:36,190
things that I thought every mapping

00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:38,020
module devoir calculation of proximity

00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:39,490
filtering by distance

00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:44,590
that sort of stuff that they would all

00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:47,440
have that not not so and of course like

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:49,470
any other set of Drupal modules they

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,480
have different levels of maturity

00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:56,050
different levels of the size of their

00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:59,110
issue queue so it's it is really a

00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:03,760
jungle out there there's an attempt made

00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:06,460
on the Drupal documentation site that's

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,410
this URL and that shows in a tabular

00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,850
form the various modules what they can

00:18:08,410 --> 00:18:12,070
do what they can't do what hoodie

00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:16,870
interface with etc I'm not going through

00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:18,760
that because if you know of specific

00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:20,290
needs then then focusing on those and

00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:22,150
then soon you'll find that a number of

00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:28,630
them will drop by the wayside if you

00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:36,340
want to get deeper into that I moved

00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:40,080
this whole story about the anatomy of

00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:43,510
maps to the appendix due to lack of time

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:45,490
but if you are interested after the

00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:47,200
session to read some more then encourage

00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,030
you to look at those because it's got

00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,890
some interesting quotes from people I

00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:53,260
met on my journey as well about what

00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:54,820
they did they started off with say

00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:58,870
openlayers and then ended up with

00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:03,430
leaflet for various reasons it also

00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:08,290
explains a little bit about the four or

00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:10,570
five parts to every map and how those

00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:13,210
those map to Drupal modules for now I

00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:15,340
want you to just remember to use cases

00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:17,980
one is a pretty much the traditional way

00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:20,950
like the maps we've seen so far whereby

00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:22,630
the coordinates are entered by the users

00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:25,300
of the site either in an administrator

00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:27,280
or people that from the public or

00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:30,910
authenticated users that sign up and

00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,470
they put location related info in the

00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:36,250
other use case is the one I'm going to

00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:38,290
demo which is where the data comes from

00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:40,660
an external source this could be a feed

00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:42,670
or a spreadsheet someone gives you that

00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:45,010
in fact that's what we found somebody

00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:49,180
said you know how to do maps we've got a

00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:51,750
spreadsheet so show me and that's where

00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,750
that hole

00:19:55,520 --> 00:20:00,600
analysis of the data really comes out

00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:04,250
and you can really see how the maps

00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:06,570
start to navigate your mind basically

00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:09,120
it's not just looking at the terrain of

00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:12,240
navigating the side then the maps that

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,490
will show in a minute and help you think

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:21,210
think about the data and that can only

00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:22,710
be a good thing so I said there's many

00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:25,040
moving parts and you can read about all

00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:27,810
of that and the pros and cons in the

00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,880
appendix I don't want you to go away

00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:32,640
thinking this is going to be hard

00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:36,390
because it's not if you just have the

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:38,730
right set of modules then it's easy and

00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:43,260
that the right set of modules has

00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:46,440
already been picked for you okay so

00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:50,100
here's the great mix talk a little bit

00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:54,620
about that hmm there are at least four

00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:58,350
modules for coordinate storage in Drupal

00:20:54,620 --> 00:21:01,290
this one the latest version is my

00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:03,210
favorite and because it does well one

00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:05,790
thing and does it really well it also

00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:07,860
sets you up for the future if you were

00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:10,230
talking here about Marcus only but if

00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,990
you want to do say the boundary the

00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:15,360
border of a country or a suburb then you

00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:18,630
can use polygons and that's all covered

00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:21,570
by this module as well the second one is

00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:24,950
views to some of you this may be bad

00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:27,540
news because views is a bit of a cockpit

00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:30,420
it's a bit of a beast but you you'll you

00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:34,740
will have to tame the beast that is I'm

00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:37,170
sorry your site builders and views goes

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,430
into core version 8 and you wouldn't

00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,920
want to be a side bill that if you don't

00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:43,020
know all of the core modules right so if

00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:45,300
you if you don't know a whole lot about

00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:51,170
views yet then now is maybe a great time

00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:54,180
to start and the third module is leaflet

00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:57,930
leaflet is a Drupal wrapper around the

00:21:54,180 --> 00:22:02,090
leaflet JavaScript library and it's one

00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:04,710
that is very lightweight it's been

00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:07,529
written from the ground up

00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:10,440
to support mobile in fact it's only

00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:14,789
download is about 28 case and if you

00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:16,649
compare that to one of its competitors

00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:19,460
or alternatives maybe let's say

00:22:16,649 --> 00:22:23,390
openlayers that one is I think 900 k

00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:26,700
here if so maps are built up of tiles

00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:28,649
about 20 k safe in memphis tenn k so

00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:31,770
you've got two hundred case of tiles

00:22:28,649 --> 00:22:34,049
then leaflet has already shown you for

00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:37,890
maps in the time that openlayers takes

00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:41,850
to just load its javascript so that's

00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:45,059
that's a big difference and if you use

00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:49,049
those first three then then you sort of

00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:52,320
get to the level of foursquare all right

00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:55,080
so you don't get a marker showing your

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,450
own position you don't get coloring of

00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:02,580
markers based on a taxonomy or something

00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:06,649
else you don't get centering options you

00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:09,360
don't get clustering so the next module

00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:13,830
brings it up one level above the

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:17,880
mediocrity of foursquare and then those

00:23:13,830 --> 00:23:20,279
other two are really small modules that

00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,470
give real bang for your buck leaflet

00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:23,940
more maps I think it's hundred lines of

00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:26,520
code or whatever but it gives you 20

00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,529
more maps just to from a drop-down you

00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,090
don't have to switch to a different set

00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:32,039
of modules to get a different map no

00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:39,360
maps are all and drop down and you pick

00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:43,970
the one you like okay so I like to rip

00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,970
into the demo if everything works

00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:54,059
okay so a little bit about this data set

00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:57,399
i'm going to show so this data set was

00:23:54,059 --> 00:24:00,100
given to it as a spreadsheet and with

00:23:57,399 --> 00:24:03,539
the idea of turning that into map or

00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:06,549
multiple maps and see what we could find

00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:10,210
out about that data set but but what

00:24:06,549 --> 00:24:13,890
would reveal itself and the data set is

00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:16,270
a weight loss program that was done in

00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:20,529
the melbourne area in two towns

00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:22,750
thomastown and dandenong and it contains

00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:25,539
four groups so there's a the control

00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:28,299
group people that did not take any

00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:30,490
special diet or did do any special

00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:32,350
exercise then a diet only group an

00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:34,630
exercise only group and a diet plus

00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:36,820
exercise group and we'll follow these

00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:41,049
people on their quest to lose weight

00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:43,240
through time the website here is just a

00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:49,240
standard out of the box drupal 7 point

00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:54,730
19 install no tricks no use nope no

00:24:49,240 --> 00:25:01,419
caching no styling or nothing okay and

00:24:54,730 --> 00:25:04,110
the map is here hopefully cool okay so I

00:25:01,419 --> 00:25:08,799
thought of start with a just a satellite

00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:11,039
view zoom out a little bit so that you

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:16,299
can see yes this is indeed Australia

00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:19,570
we've got 41 markers under there and the

00:25:16,299 --> 00:25:22,929
sorts 40 people taking part in program

00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:29,230
number 41 is us there so that's the

00:25:22,929 --> 00:25:31,299
html5 thingy that's located us and of

00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:33,730
course oh and I also attached here at

00:25:31,299 --> 00:25:37,000
the bottom just for debugging purposes

00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:38,740
and the data that you see in the map

00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,210
it's quite useful for debugging purposes

00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:44,799
when you go live you get rid of that

00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:50,100
because well boring okay so I've also

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:54,309
put in some controls on the right and

00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:56,409
there's five of them and these allow us

00:25:54,309 --> 00:25:58,860
to slice and dice the data in different

00:25:56,409 --> 00:26:03,570
directions so the first one

00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:06,540
is for the various groups control group

00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:10,080
diet only exercise only in diapers

00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:11,460
exercise and then as a few sliders for

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,380
weight so the first one is for start

00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:16,140
weight and then the second one is for

00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:19,100
the weight at each of the weigh-ins so

00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:21,750
the weigh-in is also a slider there and

00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:25,679
we can progress this through through

00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:28,730
through time so to give you an idea

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:33,660
about the slicing and dicing capability

00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:37,020
I can for instance look at all the

00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:42,169
people that start with a weight over 88

00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:48,480
and then come out with a ways and the 88

00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:50,250
and it instantly zooms in and we can see

00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,500
instantly that in in thomastown there's

00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:54,750
three people that do that and in

00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,750
dandenong there's six so you can

00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:59,250
instantly ask a civil why is there why

00:26:56,750 --> 00:27:01,679
do people in dandenong have a higher

00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:04,799
weight to start with but then they tend

00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:06,980
to lose it more so than the people in

00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,870
thomaston so we're ready starting to

00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:15,030
elicit information from that data set

00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:21,990
through maps okay just going to put that

00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:23,850
back a little bit okay so n and the

00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:27,900
clustering of course works beautifully

00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:31,500
every time it I pick it up go lose it's

00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:33,450
a little bit um but the clustering here

00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:36,870
is perhaps not so great if you want to

00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:38,790
come compare those two datas sub data

00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:40,740
set so we've got Thomas down and we've

00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:45,600
got dandenong and want to see them on

00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:47,610
the map simultaneously and with

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,559
clustering you can only zoom in on 11

00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:55,890
town of course so we kind of want to

00:27:49,559 --> 00:28:00,559
zoom in on both at the same time so I'm

00:27:55,890 --> 00:28:00,559
going to have to login as an admin

00:28:05,729 --> 00:28:25,239
go back to my map okay so in order to do

00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:27,070
that first going to enable another

00:28:25,239 --> 00:28:28,690
attachment so I'll created a second map

00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:31,659
which was based is basically a copy of

00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:35,799
the first one except that this one will

00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:37,450
filter by dandenong so I'll just enable

00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:41,739
that one and then I'm going back to my

00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:44,499
first map and at this point it's

00:28:41,739 --> 00:28:46,210
probably a good thing to drive into a

00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:48,340
little bit of detail so this is a

00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:52,090
standard views interface and we know

00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:55,149
we've had all we saw these other modules

00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:57,849
and all of them have some simple

00:28:55,149 --> 00:29:02,470
configurations all those configurations

00:28:57,849 --> 00:29:07,749
are channels into one additional setting

00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:11,679
in your familiar views interface this is

00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:13,479
the the format selector that you

00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,869
probably know normally you would not see

00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:19,479
the map google VIP geolocation and the

00:29:16,869 --> 00:29:21,669
map leaflet in there that's provided by

00:29:19,479 --> 00:29:23,559
the modules that have installed if I had

00:29:21,669 --> 00:29:25,869
installed open layers as well then it

00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:33,759
would be a third one saying map via

00:29:25,869 --> 00:29:36,309
openlayers going to the settings then

00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:38,229
the first thing we have to enter is the

00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:40,389
name of the fields that is providing the

00:29:38,229 --> 00:29:42,999
coordinates the reason why this is not a

00:29:40,389 --> 00:29:47,470
simple drop down is for the esoteric

00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:50,379
cases whereby a module may provide the

00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:52,210
coordinates in a kind of non-standard

00:29:50,379 --> 00:29:54,729
way and then the table will have a

00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:56,679
non-standard name and therefore we can't

00:29:54,729 --> 00:30:00,909
have a simple selector we have to give

00:29:56,679 --> 00:30:04,840
the name like that in this next selected

00:30:00,909 --> 00:30:08,249
oh we can just show the fields from the

00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:10,479
view so what we're showing in there is

00:30:08,249 --> 00:30:12,609
interview are the ones that we see here

00:30:10,479 --> 00:30:15,909
in this drop-down so it's things like

00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:16,240
they're the name the group there in the

00:30:15,909 --> 00:30:18,790
jan

00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:23,559
their address start weight and weight

00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:25,960
etc they show up here in this drop-down

00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:28,120
and for the differentiator a

00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,610
differentiator is any column or any

00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:33,990
field in the view that you select that

00:30:30,610 --> 00:30:37,110
you want whose values you want to

00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:40,809
differentiate the market colors by

00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:44,679
obvious examples are a taxonomy content

00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:47,460
type but it can be any of the columns in

00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:49,960
your view in fact it can even be an

00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:52,210
expression that's what I've done here

00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:56,380
I've created an expression in views

00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:58,720
normal way called weight loss and that's

00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:01,690
simply the difference between the actual

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,270
weight at the weigh-in and the start

00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:06,160
weight you could have argued that maybe

00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:07,630
that should have been a percentage

00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:09,280
rather than just a difference but then

00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:10,840
we get into divisions and

00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:14,140
multiplications and it sounds way too

00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:17,200
much like coding and this is a no coding

00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,280
session so just a difference so the

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,760
difference between start with an aunt

00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:25,540
wait that's the weight loss alright and

00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:29,800
then we can specify ranges so over ten

00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:32,590
we say is green if you lose between five

00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:34,240
and ten kilos then you get the yellow

00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:37,929
marker if you lose between zero and five

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:43,840
orange and if you gain weight you're in

00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:47,860
the red zone okay so you can add as many

00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:50,920
of those associations as you like okay

00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:52,270
then here's a few centering options the

00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:54,100
one that it's currently on is the auto

00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:58,809
box and we sorted when I went into the

00:31:54,100 --> 00:32:00,640
map it zoomed in exactly to the level to

00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:02,530
put a frame around all the markers on

00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,760
the map so that's why we had kuti all

00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:07,480
the way up there and Melbourne all the

00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:09,400
way up there in that form of centering

00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:14,230
is now not appropriate so I'm going to

00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:17,710
pick this one of the five others because

00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:20,650
I don't want I want to two separate maps

00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:22,540
and I don't want coogi to be in that

00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:28,080
because I want I want to concentrate on

00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:31,409
thomastown okay so

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,179
this is where leaflet more maps comes in

00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:36,059
it's does one thing and one thing only

00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:38,640
and it's this drop down without it the

00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:43,049
leaflet model gives you one map with

00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:46,500
leaflet more maps you get 20 more so

00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:51,120
we've had the satellite map and maybe

00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:53,190
I'll try the street map and I want to

00:32:51,120 --> 00:33:00,380
small map so I'm going to turn this into

00:32:53,190 --> 00:33:01,980
a 275 pics and this is the only

00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,799
configuration you have to do for the

00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:09,750
market clustering it's the radius within

00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:11,490
a within which a bubble ghazals up all

00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:16,320
the markers around it so if you make it

00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:17,549
really big then get big radius but now

00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,679
I'm going to leave it open because I

00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:27,149
don't want it at all never thought I

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:30,090
would say that yes but luckily this is a

00:33:27,149 --> 00:33:31,830
small population and we have lots of

00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:35,399
colors as well so there's two ways that

00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:41,340
we get around there okay forgot one

00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:45,299
thing of course live demo effects I now

00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:46,980
have to add a filter so that only the

00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:49,380
people from thomastown are shown in this

00:33:46,980 --> 00:34:00,080
top map so that's the called the

00:33:49,380 --> 00:34:00,080
locality and that's why so type in

00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:10,429
thomastown apply to this display and I

00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:14,040
think we should be in business now save

00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:22,530
what a nice views put me back to my map

00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:24,780
but it doesn't and so he will okay so

00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:28,050
lots of colors in two different maps map

00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:29,790
styles it's all possible at the top

00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:32,940
we've got the Thomas town area and the

00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:36,089
bottom we've got dandenong okay let's

00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:38,639
say the and and the colors are as i

00:34:36,089 --> 00:34:41,340
explained still a bit confusing at the

00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:44,880
moment because there's so many markers

00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:50,160
let's use our filters a bit more the

00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:52,680
control group so they start with with

00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:56,930
zero in the first weigh-in they haven't

00:34:52,680 --> 00:35:00,900
lost any weight in the second weigh-in

00:34:56,930 --> 00:35:04,050
they haven't lost any weight and in the

00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:06,420
third weigh-in one person lost a couple

00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:11,990
of kilos okay that's what you expect for

00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:16,980
a control group how about the diet only

00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:19,530
go back to the first one okay so after

00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:24,180
months or whatever it is few oranges so

00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:27,060
lost some weight and at the end of the

00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:29,430
program a few greens appear so they've

00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:33,210
done a bit better and finally of course

00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:35,910
diet plus exercise group at the same

00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:38,820
point lots of greens so you kind of

00:35:35,910 --> 00:35:41,580
expect that but you can imagine using

00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:44,880
data sets where you have no idea what is

00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:47,640
their hidden for you and but with a

00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:51,770
simple number of sliders and colored

00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,770
maps you can reveal so much information

00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:59,280
was it all smooth sailing oil is the

00:35:55,350 --> 00:36:03,360
more we can discover for instance this

00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,190
lot here they started off like so they

00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:09,450
ended up with lots of green what

00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:12,150
happened in the mill oops few people

00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:15,410
regressed some yellows have turned

00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:21,970
orange couple of green ones went yellow

00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:24,210
what happened any idea anyone that's it

00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:27,040
if you look if you look at the balloons

00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:31,180
then this Clarence Simpson by the way

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:32,859
all the names are fake to protect the

00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,750
innocent so yet awaiting at twenty

00:36:32,859 --> 00:36:36,820
fifths of January so that's that's after

00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:39,609
Christmas and in the Australian summer

00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:41,349
holidays this person leone she had a way

00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:44,950
in under 15 s of january so thank you

00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:46,750
right so there's something that we would

00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:49,780
never have found by just looking at a

00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:56,859
bunch of numbers and maps have helped us

00:36:49,780 --> 00:37:02,160
to dig up that information what do you

00:36:56,859 --> 00:37:02,160
mean how accessible from a what kind of

00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:12,070
da no is the answer yeah you basically

00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:14,849
you'll have to just the leaflet guys

00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,849
open layer guys

00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:31,440
for debug purpose is def definitely yeah

00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:33,600
it's it sorry um I guess I could do I

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:37,140
haven't been on a project with with maps

00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:39,780
and and accessibility requirements or

00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:42,120
can't really comment on it but for

00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:45,480
myself I like a table at the bottom to

00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,860
debug because if a map shows up a blank

00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,960
embers you go with what's going on is

00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:51,390
the internet down what's happening and

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:58,710
then the table will tell me whether the

00:37:51,390 --> 00:38:10,800
data is there or not um okay I'm think

00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:13,170
I'm going into my closing words so as

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,850
you have seen I've introduced a few

00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:18,450
other goodies and the first one is

00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:20,730
adverse field and geo coda the

00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:22,890
spreadsheet that we got doesn't have

00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:24,750
Latin along in it I mean who's going to

00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:26,520
type in let alone for a forum for an

00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,950
address right in fact it didn't even

00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:31,530
have states and country in it because it

00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:34,230
was done for Victoria and everybody knew

00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:36,060
it was for Victoria so the addresses in

00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:41,160
there weren't even complete they were

00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:45,330
just street names and and and towns but

00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:49,770
using geo koda and adverse fields you're

00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:51,720
able to geocode the address into letting

00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:53,190
long sort of what happens under the

00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,320
wraps it happens for instance when you

00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:57,330
created a new piece of content that has

00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:59,480
an address on it then the moment you

00:38:57,330 --> 00:39:01,770
save it will go out to the Internet to

00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:04,080
serve as you provide the default one is

00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:05,670
google i think and it will give back the

00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:09,090
latin long and store stores it

00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:14,690
transparently on one of the fields and

00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:17,250
you don't have to worry about it it in

00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:18,750
combination with geo feels basic

00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:25,080
basically geocode or is a bridge between

00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:28,070
geo field and address field yep well I'm

00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,070
didn't yawn then

00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:34,210
address field knows about the way

00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:37,029
addresses are done in the various

00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:39,460
countries so when in Australia it will

00:39:37,029 --> 00:39:42,579
it will know that a post code is four

00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:43,660
digits and not letters as well and so

00:39:42,579 --> 00:39:45,130
and in different countries may be

00:39:43,660 --> 00:40:01,150
different way and it knows that because

00:39:45,130 --> 00:40:03,819
it using yep yep yep the thing I was

00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:06,549
particularly impressed with was and I

00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:09,160
can't show this but I alluded to it

00:40:06,549 --> 00:40:11,109
earlier if you have a spreadsheet to

00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:14,619
turn it into Maps you first have to turn

00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:16,480
it into Drupal content right and you're

00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:19,960
using some sort of imported for that and

00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:23,579
the the go to module 4 that is feeds and

00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:27,779
when I importer the spreadsheet into

00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:31,029
Drupal content without setting anything

00:40:27,779 --> 00:40:33,069
geocoder kicked in picked every address

00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:35,890
from the spreadsheet send it off to

00:40:33,069 --> 00:40:38,589
Google give me the lat/long and after

00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:40,210
the import everything was there it's

00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:51,099
brilliant really really impressive

00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:54,089
module ok so then you don't have to rely

00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:57,819
on the drupal module ok yeah cool thanks

00:40:54,089 --> 00:41:00,869
mmm so the second module that I sneaked

00:40:57,819 --> 00:41:03,819
in is fused global filter it's kind of

00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:07,990
your normal views exposed filters on

00:41:03,819 --> 00:41:11,140
steroids with views global filter the

00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:13,089
settings that you make remain valid

00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:15,160
across the entire website so if you have

00:41:13,089 --> 00:41:17,319
number number of views and they may be

00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:21,130
tables or maps or whatever you don't

00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:22,869
have to make the selection over and over

00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:25,230
again so let's say I have a music site

00:41:22,869 --> 00:41:28,240
and it's got lots of bands lots of a

00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:30,789
errors and a lots of areas and I would

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,109
just want to know about beep Beatles in

00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:36,789
New York 1967 so I would change those

00:41:34,109 --> 00:41:38,559
make those three selections and then

00:41:36,789 --> 00:41:40,480
I'll look the rest of the site will be

00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:42,099
filtered by that until I change it so

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,039
then I see my videos for that

00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:46,869
period of the Beatles only I see the

00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:50,049
biographies I see the the concert

00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:54,160
listings I see the top 40 all filtered

00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:56,380
by the initial selection but on top of

00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:00,970
that views global filter adds another of

00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:03,130
a number of interesting widgets because

00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:05,380
it honors the original widget that was

00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:08,559
specified on the content type so for

00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:11,440
instance you you love her article select

00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:14,229
right for you taxonomy I do if you have

00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:17,440
that on the content type then when you

00:42:14,229 --> 00:42:20,440
make create a normal view then it's gone

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,999
because views does its own widget but

00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:24,279
would use global filterable honor that

00:42:21,999 --> 00:42:27,339
that widget same with 0 to complete the

00:42:24,279 --> 00:42:29,950
locks and also the same with slide with

00:42:27,339 --> 00:42:35,410
style that's the one and that was used

00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:39,519
to to do those those sliders one little

00:42:35,410 --> 00:42:41,559
problem it's like with style it uses a

00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:44,680
range right we set for a float or an

00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:47,049
integer you don't want to be filtering

00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:48,819
for one particular value you don't want

00:42:47,049 --> 00:42:51,910
to filter all the people that are

00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:53,339
exactly exactly 17.5 kilos that doesn't

00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:58,079
make sense you want to have a range

00:42:53,339 --> 00:43:01,390
slight problem views doesn't accept

00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:04,569
ranges not s contextual filters that's

00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:07,839
how views global filter works it takes

00:43:04,569 --> 00:43:10,079
advantage of the views and contextual

00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:13,619
filters so that's where the last module

00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:18,999
comes in it makes views understand

00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:25,539
ranges and yeah that's that sort of

00:43:18,999 --> 00:43:27,880
completes the picture okay a few things

00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:29,469
we haven't shown and we only showed

00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:33,910
markers you can do some really cool

00:43:29,469 --> 00:43:37,869
stuff with polygons and with the marker

00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:40,869
algorithm works great and then all the

00:43:37,869 --> 00:43:43,059
clustering in there up to about 5,000

00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:46,779
markers then things start to fall apart

00:43:43,059 --> 00:43:48,940
a little bit and of course people have

00:43:46,779 --> 00:43:52,140
already come up with new solutions and

00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:55,029
they tend to involve doing all of the

00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:56,059
clustering on the server and then send

00:43:55,029 --> 00:43:57,680
the result back to the brown

00:43:56,059 --> 00:44:00,559
because all this stuff is happening in

00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:05,930
the browser in the using using

00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:08,779
javascript so I've put some references

00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:10,549
in the further reading slide which you

00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:13,699
can see here also some really cool

00:44:10,549 --> 00:44:16,939
markers the nicklaus male or Nicholas

00:44:13,699 --> 00:44:18,769
mullet website has some really nice

00:44:16,939 --> 00:44:23,779
markers and you can customize them as

00:44:18,769 --> 00:44:27,079
well change colors in and so forth so

00:44:23,779 --> 00:44:29,599
thank you to all these people who came

00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:31,609
kind of on my journey with me some of

00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:35,749
the sites you've seen by the people

00:44:31,609 --> 00:44:38,269
mentioned here and of course drupal and

00:44:35,749 --> 00:44:40,729
Drupal calm open sores in general is

00:44:38,269 --> 00:44:42,920
such a great way to do softwares because

00:44:40,729 --> 00:44:44,869
you get so many people get to know so

00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:47,299
many people and work with so many people

00:44:44,869 --> 00:44:49,549
without even seeing the face like I

00:44:47,299 --> 00:44:52,549
don't know any of those people except

00:44:49,549 --> 00:44:54,799
one and she she she she he's not a

00:44:52,549 --> 00:44:56,509
Drupal person so yeah that's that I

00:44:54,799 --> 00:44:59,299
found it always interesting but most of

00:44:56,509 --> 00:45:06,709
all I like to to thank you for coming

00:44:59,299 --> 00:45:11,089
and staying till the end I have one more

00:45:06,709 --> 00:45:14,689
thing to ask you actually three remember

00:45:11,089 --> 00:45:20,719
those three points what was the first

00:45:14,689 --> 00:45:23,329
one let's write maps not tables you see

00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:27,319
a table think maps what was the second

00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:32,479
one leaflet very good and what was the

00:45:27,319 --> 00:45:37,329
third one that's right you can do it now

00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:37,329
go home and go do it thank you very much

00:45:40,359 --> 00:45:53,119
any questions oh ok yeah leaflet ones do

00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:56,690
yep oh sorry it did it everyone hear the

00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:58,880
question oh the question was um do the

00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:01,309
maps working mobile and that they

00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:10,390
support the the pinch and zoom controls

00:46:01,309 --> 00:46:10,390
and the leaflet maps do yep

00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,320
yep

00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:35,240
I think the answer is probably in in the

00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:37,310
gray area that is between really tight

00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,260
clustering or you lose a clustering

00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:42,890
remember I enter the the cluster radius

00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:45,320
I guess if you play with that but making

00:46:42,890 --> 00:46:47,120
it beer was smaller then you may find a

00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:50,480
setting that suits your particular data

00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:55,330
set that's that's all I can think of and

00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:55,330
coloring coloring the individual markers

00:47:03,869 --> 00:47:05,930
you

00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:26,160
yep hmm yep one of the the maps that

00:47:24,029 --> 00:47:28,680
come up when you have leaflet mobile

00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,750
maps installed there are a number of

00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:33,990
open street maps and the effect one of

00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:35,609
them is it open P star thing which puts

00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:38,339
takes the base layer and then puts

00:47:35,609 --> 00:47:39,930
terrain on it and then puts the the ski

00:47:38,339 --> 00:47:41,819
slopes a map of ski slopes over the top

00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:52,589
of it so yeah that's quite an

00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:55,680
interesting one now the cluster

00:47:52,589 --> 00:47:59,250
clustering am in provided by this module

00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:01,890
the leaf is purely by the radius by the

00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:04,230
number of pixels so and it will gobble

00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:06,750
up for instance the visitor marker as

00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:10,759
well even though that is different type

00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:10,759
of marker compared to the data Marcus

00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:20,779
cluster detection yeah i mean the the

00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:23,099
javascript and the math behind it is

00:48:20,779 --> 00:48:25,019
quite impressive i had a look but i had

00:48:23,099 --> 00:48:26,940
to close it down because it was doing

00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:30,619
doing my head in so it's really

00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:30,619
impressive what's happening

00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:40,369
another the moment now there are a

00:48:37,759 --> 00:48:42,829
number of parameters already in this

00:48:40,369 --> 00:48:44,829
particular clustering module at the

00:48:42,829 --> 00:48:49,970
JavaScript level but there's no UI

00:48:44,829 --> 00:48:53,480
except for the radius at this stage are

00:48:49,970 --> 00:49:07,539
you coder Shane find a coder and let it

00:48:53,480 --> 00:49:12,049
haven't contributed yep yep there's a

00:49:07,539 --> 00:49:16,180
deal field latest version has a filter a

00:49:12,049 --> 00:49:18,079
number of filters for views and

00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:20,710
everything's based on view so if you

00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:24,619
feel you can filter in the view by

00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:25,700
proximity you can you can give a central

00:49:24,619 --> 00:49:27,440
point and then say give me all the

00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:28,880
points that within a radius of ten

00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:34,430
hundred a thousand kilometers at this

00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:38,960
point oh I don't know of an

00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:49,569
off-the-shelf solution for that you had

00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:49,569
a question already so else yep

00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:53,640
yep

00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:06,020
right and that satisfied the the

00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:06,020
government requirements

00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:46,540
mmm ok

00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:53,670
yep 22 good solutions thanks for sharing

00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:07,270
what do you mean by directions oh and it

00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:09,730
will tell you the route I haven't come

00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:16,920
across that as part of the basic options

00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:20,050
within this set of modules yeah i can i

00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:22,780
used that sort of stuff myself but now

00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:30,450
hasn't come up as out-of-the-box options

00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:30,450
when using these modules okay

00:51:35,950 --> 00:51:40,839
mm-hmm yep I mean openlayers has been

00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:43,660
around for a while and there's quite a

00:51:40,839 --> 00:51:47,710
few modules but when i started with maps

00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:51,280
and openlayers I was baffled about how

00:51:47,710 --> 00:51:53,470
hard it is I mean it starts off with if

00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:56,260
you want to create one map you have to

00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:57,880
create two views you go what you know

00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:01,390
for a beginner that to get your brain

00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:04,869
around there and VIN Jones one of the

00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:07,089
people that I'm thinking they're also

00:52:04,869 --> 00:52:08,710
went on a similar journey he had to use

00:52:07,089 --> 00:52:10,390
overlays initially at least because

00:52:08,710 --> 00:52:14,680
that's what the company you votes were

00:52:10,390 --> 00:52:18,720
used and he also said it was quite buggy

00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:21,760
it was hard to use but then in the end

00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:24,130
he there was one specific thing about

00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,660
openlayers that he liked or that he was

00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:28,060
required to supply it if I had to do

00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:31,060
with a layer switch if done in

00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:34,540
JavaScript or something and so in the

00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:38,200
end he chose chose openlayers but he

00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:40,630
himself also says for my money star pad

00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:46,720
leaflet and it will do ninety percent of

00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:49,079
your job ninety percent of the time okay

00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,079
yep

00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:58,870
it is yeah it is there in the JavaScript

00:52:55,710 --> 00:53:03,970
but it hasn't really been brought up the

00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:07,960
surfers in the leaflet drupal module

00:53:03,970 --> 00:53:10,540
yeah but leafless is pretty new I mean

00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:14,530
it came on the scene in Drupal are

00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:17,640
saying September over so this there's a

00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:21,780
lot of activity and no doubt someone

00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:21,780
will provide the facility soon

00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:47,130
Oh

00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:06,440
yeah so you're saying it comes it comes

00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:08,240
about naturally purely because all the

00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:09,620
people flock to the city and so the

00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:13,330
population of the state has pretty much

00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:13,330
the population of the city yeah

00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:31,429
maybe I haven't researched that but how

00:54:28,819 --> 00:54:39,289
would you imagine that like a dropped on

00:54:31,429 --> 00:54:43,579
for a for a polygon or yeah right right

00:54:39,289 --> 00:54:48,049
import that and say yeah I like it yeah

00:54:43,579 --> 00:54:52,249
that would be a cool feature yeah right

00:54:48,049 --> 00:55:07,369
now don't know but love to work with you

00:54:52,249 --> 00:55:10,429
on it yeah yeah it leaflet market

00:55:07,369 --> 00:55:14,150
cluster does is beautifully it come when

00:55:10,429 --> 00:55:17,329
you have a 20 markers at the same

00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:19,429
location like 20 people living in the

00:55:17,329 --> 00:55:23,449
same I don't know apartment building

00:55:19,429 --> 00:55:26,660
whatever then it shows them as a sort of

00:55:23,449 --> 00:55:28,400
a spiral and so each of the markers is

00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:35,979
clickable and will have its own

00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:39,429
properties yeah looks good all right

00:55:35,979 --> 00:55:39,429
