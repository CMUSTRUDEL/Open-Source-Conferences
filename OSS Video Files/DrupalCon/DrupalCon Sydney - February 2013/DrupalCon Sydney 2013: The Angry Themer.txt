if you want to follow a place where we

00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:05,950
only talked about the truth and theming

00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:09,940

00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:13,210
is the place to do it i do come with a

00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:15,640
certain kind of love to this community

00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:18,300

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:21,040
patient from where I'm this is passion

00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:24,820
I'm trying to pose myself as a really

00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:29,500
nice guy that has a lot of hard for

00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:32,410
people it's not really true I do one

00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:34,630
this one one man shop told a gig way out

00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,910
and and we do handcrafted themes which

00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:39,370
means we'd like to nert your theme all

00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:41,590
the way down to each and every

00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:45,130
class because I don't believe in the the

00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:47,350
body class HTML we have seen up your

00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:50,459
body feels right got this HTML class

00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:57,340
what do we use that for I don't know but

00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:58,930
handcrafted thieves no we have that for

00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,850
one reason because we have a function

00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,160
that's called something about HTML that

00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:05,260
identify itself as HTML so that needs to

00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,180
be a class name thank you to before

00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,890
putting even more crap into my stuff

00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,560
this is what this session air actually

00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:13,600

yanjun that the whole name if we take

00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,900
only perch you will see there's a very

00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:30,010
close thing that could be a spelling

00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:33,519
error and this is this is just how it is

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:36,820

that so this is my hand another thing

00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,630
that's okay more interesting actually

00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:50,730
about you guys how many developers do we

00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:50,730
have in here oh how many designers

00:03:51,490 --> 00:04:04,420

00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,900
for is like we had back at least one

00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:17,570
common awesome come day in late anyways

00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:20,930
when we talk about the google femur this

00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:22,910
is kind of what we are what we have an

00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:26,150
idea to our clients really think what we

00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:28,280
do this is actually what my dad things i

00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:29,750
do this is yeah you know we just

00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:33,370
download a free template right you just

00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:36,140
download that that thing it just works

00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:39,470
it does this cope with what developers

00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:42,260
things of steamers yeah i can see if i

00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:46,040
do think that we are protecting the

00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:48,380
markup this is exactly what we do we do

00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,730
shell a combs work every day

00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:51,919
because i just need to change that

00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:54,650
little thing that little bit bit a

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,300
little bit little thingy in the theme

00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:59,360
that i cannot get you because some

00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,810
goddamn def put something in that some

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,030
function that I can't yet you and you

00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:06,620
and the thing is that a femur is not a

00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:09,440
designer let's get that straight

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,570
accurate it's not designed that's a tool

00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,729
designed is something about the colors

00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:17,330
and stuff what a theme does I mean I

00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:18,830
know that we do theming it is met the

00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:21,650
same thing that's calling developers

00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:24,530
modulus because that's what you do what

00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:27,680
you do a module anyways what the theme

00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,180
does is translate design into code we

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,030
are actually taking all the beautiful

00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:34,190
markup or the beautiful coat that evil

00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,590
developers gives us and turn that into

00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:39,410
this beautiful thing that arrogant

00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:41,450
assign us gave us that is what we do we

00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:44,900
translate this we kind of the middleman

00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:46,940
we make so you have a beautiful designer

00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,860
II had that thing that works it's us who

00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:52,300
combines it that makes actually the

00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:54,710
Themis the heroes of Google just saying

00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,510
but let's go back a little bit here to a

00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:59,090
little bit of Google struble history

00:05:56,510 --> 00:06:03,800
we're back at rubicon and blossoms in

00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:04,580
2006 this is me I am still happy and

00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,069
hopeful

00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,930
this is web chick she's also happy at

00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:11,930
this point I still think that web chick

00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:16,159
is still happy you can see how happy I

00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:19,069
look I'm still full of hope because well

00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:22,180
I looked at the theme system I thought

00:06:19,069 --> 00:06:24,349
that will take me six months to fix that

00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:26,479
you weren't at the trick session right

00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:30,560
how many was in a little i was talking

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:32,659
about trick what i thought would take

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,520
six months have taken over six years

00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:35,990
this kind of show where we are the

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,370
google thing but the first thing i heard

00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:41,440
of the first thing but one of the thing

00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:46,009
i heard here los 3 a.m. friday morning

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,690
at a bar in parcels very drunk Tavella I

00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:49,639
was saying to me I'm tired of the

00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:52,719
designers who's coming in and telling us

00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:57,139
that drew bull looks like well I

00:06:52,719 --> 00:06:59,750
mean I don't know why we would think it

00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:03,199
looks like I have no idea you might

00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:06,620
because this piece of utter beauty shows

00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:09,940
everything that's good right this is the

00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:12,500
top of Design Line this was google face

00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,599
so that of course made a little bit hard

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,430
so front-end people or a steam us

00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:20,029
to come in and work we were I mean hours

00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:22,539
I was I was young not as old there's a

00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:25,940
reason I have gray in my hair today

00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:28,219
drupal's fault um no sir when we try to

00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,680
do stuff we kind of came into this whole

00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:32,810
way of know the trooper world that you

00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,889
have you eggs and themas and designer so

00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,990
we'll hear like normal human beings

00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:38,479
right and you have over here the land of

00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,490
Trubel told us hackers sysadmin like the

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:45,789
developing and in the middle here we

00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:48,349
have the border CBS making sure that no

00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:53,479
non-geek could contribute to the project

00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:56,029
um because CBS is bad that's just how it

00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:58,520
is it's a horrible horrible system I

00:07:56,029 --> 00:08:01,370
actually hated so much that I ended up

00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,690
writing haiku poems for it that was the

00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,190
level i hate's because i couldn't have

00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,520
to ship you back to the Drupal community

00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:09,169
in anyways because CBS is basically it's

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,569
a foreign language for front-end

00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:13,639
developer or a designer it's not a way

00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:16,940
we work it's kind of like speaking

00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:18,230
Swedish or speaking Danish subs avocados

00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,660
nacho yeah put that

00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:22,340
so he do the parking of event al is

00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:26,060
enforced all day so get a rating my

00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:29,780
meaning it well that was kind of how

00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,820
should I translate that what I said was

00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:34,130
well if you could understand Danish

00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,870
which not the Swedish Swedish with the

00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,580
foul version of English thing is the

00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:41,000
beautiful version if you would

00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:43,610
understand that that we basically had a

00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,590
language CBS that kept us away from

00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:48,110
being able to contribute back to Google

00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:51,890
because it was impossible for us to work

00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:54,590
with it happened the gig went to be good

00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:56,150
without getting said it's way easier for

00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,520
us to use that's a good thing it's felt

00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:02,510
bitter hard for us it's been that it

00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:06,080
since 2010 2011 we gotta day and that's

00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:07,760
a good thing it is still half full of

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,610
fun two people should come in and help

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,930
out because of the shoe you ship because

00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:14,830
we have to when we had to learn this new

00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:18,710
language it's a barrier we know but it's

00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:22,070
at least got better oh this year let's

00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:26,290
roll back again PSP template since 2004

00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:28,370
it has ruled the waves of pupil at

00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:30,290
developer I will not tell you the name

00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:33,680
of created this beautiful system many

00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:35,480
years ago and it's a good thing I mean

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,860
we have this idea of Drupal that Google

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,270
is like you have theta then you have

00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,220
that Drupal matching you have a theme

00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:45,200
engine and then voila we have a website

00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:48,680
that's all good so we got this piece of

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:52,550
lovely thing right this is what we get

00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:55,330
to work with e thank you Jubal because

00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:59,180
apparently you had this idea of this the

00:09:55,330 --> 00:10:02,330
CSS kind of like the sinigang idea if

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:05,330
you just modify I mean you remember CSS

00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:06,770
same gun no you just have a predefined

00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:08,780
mark everything you could do everything

00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:12,230
with it that was how true Wilbur thought

00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:15,320
at that point well you know ten years

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:16,790
later people begins like hell bitchin

00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,930
known a little bit about how this stuff

00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,670
was done which was kind of

00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,560
understandable we have ducked down their

00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:25,430
markup way and and the thing that I

00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:28,640
learned was by going to the shooting

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:30,740
range with web chick in Denver I'm be

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,610
abiding out there and I as usual

00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,170
and moan about

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,240
theming layer and web chick looks at me

00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:38,260
and goes well you do know what more than

00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:43,010
six years ago nobody told us what to do

00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:45,950
nice well hmm nobody told anything about

00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,930
what to do so is it really fair to be a

00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:50,029
steamer and moan over thin layer

00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:53,149
well I think it's completely fair that

00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:56,839
we do that but let's be honest here but

00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:58,760
though at least we can try to push a

00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:00,829
little try to help the developers just a

00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,870
little bit just a little bit so one

00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:04,519
thing I've always kind of worked around

00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:07,970
like you you don't get mad you just get

00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:10,250
even nope I'm gonna this

00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:12,620
system so hard that I can do whatever

00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,420
with it that I want and then they can

00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:17,480
come afterwards to complain today we can

00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:19,120
maybe find a solution this kind of goes

00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:22,700
back to that you would have two problems

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:26,000
the CSS and the markup that's the only

00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:29,750
true problems google has the CSS files

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,490
the problem around that is well there's

00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:33,380
a lot of them we have Trubel call coming

00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,420
up with all kinds of sears weird we have

00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,920
modules coming with them we have your

00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:40,399
own theme coming with them and then of

00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:43,370
course repairing the site um if anybody

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:46,570
has ever thought about you know we have

00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:48,740
these mobile devices that how you can go

00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:50,899
what's the hot new thing we can do with

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:55,310
mobile phones you'll get a website right

00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:57,920
that's hot um when you're standing

00:11:55,310 --> 00:12:01,100
out in the middle of nowhere like in

00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,130
Sydney and you try to go to web page and

00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:05,600
it has about 6,000 differences as far as

00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:07,490
that's not good practice that's not a

00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,699
thing we want to have it actually makes

00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:12,199
me feel a little bit like this I don't

00:12:10,699 --> 00:12:14,029
get happy about this this is kind of

00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:16,399
this is directly wrong and everything

00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:17,779
that we learned about how to do CSS so

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:21,470
there's different ways of getting this

00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:23,899
done in the theme we have an info file

00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:26,630
the info file can do whatever the

00:12:23,899 --> 00:12:29,660
it wants that's because it's a 3,000

00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:31,130
pound info file the first version first

00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,959
way you can actually remove the CSS

00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:34,820
files its basic because we knew pian

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,440
should look at the CSS its begin to be

00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,779
very clear that every module come to

00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:40,339
this CSS file that you know art because

00:12:38,779 --> 00:12:43,430
I really need that red ball around

00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:45,220
effective Thank You module for that so

00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,480
you can if you're going to look

00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,649
to these things to figure out what do I

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,509
actually need you can begin to remove

00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:54,310
them apparently Andy by popular choice

00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:56,709
the man who's behind this technique is

00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:58,720
kind of a floor we found in in Google's

00:12:56,709 --> 00:13:00,459
way of using a theme in profile if you

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:04,720
call an info file that does not exist

00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:07,839
over rather it do exist so if you have

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,519
the common module have a common CSS file

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,649
that comes with the module you can

00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,870
override that by calling it in your own

00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:16,269
theme probably that file over and put it

00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:19,269
down your theme folder all goods now it

00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:22,209
can be override it if you forget to put

00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:25,660
that file into your theme Google is dumb

00:13:22,209 --> 00:13:28,269
as so Drupal things oh it's down in

00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,279
the theme folder there is no file in the

00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:32,949
theme folder a Drupal goes ok well fair

00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:35,139
enough and it jumps further head so you

00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:37,089
as you begin to define all these files

00:13:35,139 --> 00:13:38,709
you do not want to senior theme now you

00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:40,870
don't have to go about them you're not

00:13:38,709 --> 00:13:45,670
just thinking about they're just gone it

00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:49,660
is by publishers told f.o.e off and

00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:51,399
die that's that's how it's done that's

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,350
one way of doing it that's the creeks in

00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:55,899
there any way of doing this the Amal

00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:57,790
kind of nice way to do it there's a

00:13:55,899 --> 00:13:59,649
module called style stripper that can

00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,759
also do this we have like an interface

00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:05,769
layer click click click click click

00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:07,449
click it's it just came out in the

00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:10,059
Drupal 7 verse and so it's kind of worth

00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:12,279
to look at if you want to go in the way

00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:13,959
I normally goes it with the the best

00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:17,100
team ever in the world the mothership

00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:19,839
thing which is basically a it's a theme

00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,899
it's a theme that's based to clean up

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,209
all the dumb Google does basically

00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:26,769
it's removing diffs removing classes

00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:29,050
removing everything that you do not need

00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:31,180
and in here there's also settings for

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:34,000
kind of removing if they kind of system

00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:37,930
message the system since the menu system

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,240
themes all kinds of good stuff that's

00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:43,120
one way of doing it another thing is

00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,790
it's another way to remove this is also

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:50,649
to do you know about the holdback named

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:54,639
scheming bet phe okay well if you go

00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:56,529
into system folder developers look this

00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,000
is development if you look into the

00:14:56,529 --> 00:15:02,400
system folder the

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:05,350
drupal call so it is right in we have

00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:08,290
system that Athens is a system that base

00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:10,540
CSS and systems up the incisors so when

00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:12,820
you do a module if you have any class

00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:15,040
names do you need to have half in your

00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:18,730
administrator interface you put that

00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:20,890
into module name admin that CSS because

00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:23,500
now we in the front end can filter the

00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:26,410
CSS and remove all that crap you want to

00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,910
put into the admin beautiful right so we

00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:30,040
don't have to bring all that stuff

00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,090
around the same thing with the base if

00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,610
you have something that's actually

00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:35,860
important for the theme like an ajax

00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:38,620
past you need to like do a blog on a

00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,180
hide it you put that in too deep to the

00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,010
base and you have something that has

00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,050
anything to do with color or prettiness

00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:47,680
or nice let you push that into theme

00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:50,710
that CSS pretty simple have base CSS for

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,740
the important admin for the admin

00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:55,150
crap and this is folded pretty you don't

00:15:53,740 --> 00:16:01,240
have to put pretty into your module

00:15:55,150 --> 00:16:04,950
because we know your limits I mean I am

00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:08,110
not so good but calculating like 2+2 is

00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:11,020
something I really don't care I have a

00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:14,589
big calculator up here so it helped me

00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:16,540
out with that kind of another thing when

00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:18,400
we were going to I will not run into

00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,320
this whole smacks thing is if you as a

00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,350
developer really want to understand how

00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,870
those Themis those London people is one

00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:28,360
of ccss that CSS is actually more than

00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:31,990
just adding a little bit of color take a

00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:35,200
jump over to smacks CSS max calm it's a

00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:38,080
documentation standard for how to do CSS

00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,000
it's when you have read that and you

00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,130
understand that then you might begin to

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,720
understand by CSS it's a little bit more

00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:47,710
than just a little bit of color and a

00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:50,470
fun sizing we aren't by the way not

00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:52,720
leaving this intro to blade we are

00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:55,330
driving it directly through the

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,890
front door but lights and bells and fire

00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:59,770
and everything on it's not a secret

00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:01,570
anymore we kept it a secret so these are

00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:04,060
kind of jewels like clean up your CSS

00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:06,179
and that kind of makes it nice the

00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,820
problem is still that we have this

00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:10,130
devices

00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:13,370
and one st vitus world this is the

00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:15,170
bidder's div class content div class

00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:16,940
fields fueling body feels hot chicks

00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:19,940
with summary blah blah blah blah blah oh

00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:23,000
yeah div class field items div class

00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:26,780
field item even and now come content

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,600
what the seriously I don't need

00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,130
this this this I don't need any of it

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:34,220
the problem about this is actually make

00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:36,470
our websites are bigger we made them

00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:39,350
mean the footprint simply gets bigger

00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:42,950
it's harder to read it's harder to write

00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:45,650
CSS it's harder to justify its it's

00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:48,380
simply not efficient um to clean that up

00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:49,790
of course we have the mothership the

00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,130
mothership will help you in this it's

00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:54,860
the only this the mothership does not

00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:56,210
make pretty it's not its goal when you

00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:59,090
install it the first time you'll go a

00:17:56,210 --> 00:18:02,660
little bit like what well it does it not

00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:06,620
do anything look at the markup view

00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:09,740
source and you will see the it's

00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:12,770
beautiful it's naked it's there's no

00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:14,180
crap anymore um that's one way of doing

00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:16,250
it the other way it's actually a now I

00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,890
will teach the front-end develops how

00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:21,050
tragic to sneaking you can do the--

00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,490
functions so if you have a field and you

00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:24,530
want to clean that out do a theme

00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:27,080
function so the whole idea is there

00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:29,390
let's say we have a people call this no

00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,120
markup i am now calling it no markup

00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:33,920
because i'm trying to be the more

00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:37,760
political correct it used to be called

00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:43,340
the panty dropper I learned that that

00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:45,320
was not really okay and my chin up it

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,850
was more of an internal joke for myself

00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:48,370
I actually kind of left at the time I

00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:52,100
had a feeling that field painted rubber

00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:55,070
and but you know to drop that model of

00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:57,200
that hole bro code blue chalk crabber I

00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:59,630
know Nomad up actually makes more sense

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,460
so the whole the idea is that that every

00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,230
time you have a field you can you can

00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:05,300
define a new field function for it it's

00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,490
prettier theme underscore no markup oh

00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,230
now we have a theme function what it

00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:12,650
does is as you can see here it does

00:19:09,230 --> 00:19:15,560
absolutely nothing it just takes some

00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:18,770
kind of data thing out and rented it it

00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:20,600
doesn't matter than anything oh my god

00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,900
you're not having your markup on your

00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,360
your

00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,400
data into jew-jew maldives what should

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,610
we do how can you identify them oh no oh

00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:31,160
no no you can see the fear over here in

00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:34,370
the developer smiles like oh my god how

00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:36,320
can you even find it well it's it's if

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:38,270
you look at this whole new team found

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,340
the whole idea is that when you have

00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:42,950
your no GPL you go and say hey give me

00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:46,460
the content give me the field name use

00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:50,450
this theme and call no mock-up then hide

00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:52,430
the so now when you do if

00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,990
you do a print render on the content at

00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:56,360
some point it will not be printed out

00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:58,400
beautiful sweet that's that's wonderful

00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,860
so when you actually print this out the

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,230
field name we down set the field name to

00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:05,420
print just the data and nothing else

00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,430
guess what you can do with this in your

00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,960
notes evil you can wrap it in that class

00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:12,350
that you need if you want to put it into

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,420
an article check you can do that if you

00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:16,640
want to put it in a span tag instead all

00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:18,950
let's say you know a section because

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,930
that makes semantically that's semantics

00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:23,150
correct to do that way you can do that

00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:26,000
you don't have to wrap it in three dips

00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:29,180
every time just because maybe someday

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:31,280
you have a need to hit that with your

00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:33,800
CSS because that's not how we do this

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,710
thing if you want to read a little bit

00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,410
more into this it's in the Drupal wats

00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:42,290
talk that actually you've got in your

00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:44,030
welcome package there's s an article in

00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:48,170
there it's called Angry Thema about

00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:49,610
naked fields and it's described this way

00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,350
much more that I'm going to do right now

00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:53,570
because there's other ways of course to

00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:57,980
do this another way around it let me

00:20:53,570 --> 00:21:00,070
just get some more water is display

00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:03,020
Street the space we'd is written by a

00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:07,640
wonderful belgium developer who have

00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:09,050
been haggling for years about this the

00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,980
idea behind display sweet is that we

00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:14,840
have to use your way of our display on a

00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:16,850
note so you can go in there instead and

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,680
just that instead of the usual way we

00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:20,210
had we can you can adjust the order

00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,900
because of course the website is always

00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:27,110
only one older down so in this place

00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:29,810
with what you can do really easy is you

00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:31,970
can go and you can kind of defined every

00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:33,530
element that you want to have and put

00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:35,300
that into these to the

00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:37,040
to the margov and define this year as

00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:39,200
you can actually do these things that

00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:41,030
get a pond and click interface that can

00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,490
be very nice for your front end dips who

00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:45,890
don't want to fiddle around with Dean

00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:47,510
functions and crap it's some somebody

00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:50,180
likes this somebody don't I I just

00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:54,290
really like it it it makes my life easy

00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:58,790
just to crank out sides you don't like

00:21:54,290 --> 00:22:01,340
why you're not like why you hate me okay

00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:05,120
developers don't like it well fair

00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:07,550
enough another modules does oh no they

00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,870
don't know if one deaf speak out you

00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:12,260
that's how the rules are in this room

00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:13,640
I'm sorry for that another module is

00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,260
called fence that channel open growth

00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,090
that is kind of doing the same thing

00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,980
it's just a way of taking a field and

00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:22,970
saying how do I want to have this field

00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:24,620
displays um but as with one of the

00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:26,000
things i learned by actually doing a lot

00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,710
of talk around the whole display street

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,230
was that you can actually as you get the

00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:31,970
bellows and front end dev or Themis

00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,130
let's just hold the Themis so you know

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:36,230
who I said front end developer front end

00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:41,450
person is that political correct front

00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:43,340
in person front-end developer but isn't

00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:46,220
it just all so let's just call them

00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:48,830
phemus again yeah okay fair okay good

00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:50,930
well the thing is that what I've kind of

00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:54,050
figured out at some point we maybe need

00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:57,500
to hug it out because what we have after

00:22:54,050 --> 00:23:01,220
designers and it is a special kind of

00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:03,140
people it is I mean I've worked with

00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,360
designers who found out that there was a

00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:08,240
heaven there's a heading there was to

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:11,810
pick two pixels too big and set that as

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:15,860
a bark that was critical that makes your

00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:17,900
workday very long and this is where all

00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:19,790
developers should thinks the Themis

00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:22,850
because what is it that we really do we

00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:24,740
keep the designers over here and you

00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:27,260
guys over there and we protect you

00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:30,590
against their evilness and small kind of

00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:32,660
petty petty petty things what we hope we

00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:35,000
get from developers it's just a little

00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,080
bit of support that's the Chinese bit of

00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,760
support just a little bit of

00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,120
understanding because we know that

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:43,760
developers is a very special kind of

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,440
people that can use days are talking

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,480
about six you easy and loads and you

00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:52,710
in the test and blah blah blah blah blah

00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,899
blah I don't care that is what they do

00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:57,570
and that's all good you know if we get

00:23:54,899 --> 00:24:00,389
both of them to hug it out that is

00:23:57,570 --> 00:24:06,149
actually where the theme of wins that's

00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:11,669
where we smile is there anything wrong

00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:15,350
with that picture okay because what is

00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:18,629
it that we do we as femurs we translate

00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:21,269
coat into the sign and we take the

00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:23,759
design and translate that into code so

00:24:21,269 --> 00:24:25,919
so the developers because develops like

00:24:23,759 --> 00:24:28,590
things that works right that's kind of

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:32,669
crap in crap out it works it's faster

00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:35,250
that fiction it just works designers

00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:37,139
like things that looks good these two

00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:40,200
world cannot communicate with each other

00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:42,090
it's like seeing drunken 16 year old

00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,360
boys trying to like man up on each other

00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:47,460
it's horrible it is horrible so that's

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,279
where it's good we have the Themis who

00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:53,070
understand both worlds have more of a no

00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:54,509
grown-up look at the world we know we

00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:57,629
know what what's needed to make the

00:24:54,509 --> 00:25:00,330
project to be a success we will just win

00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:02,700
the success chomps and when know what

00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:05,100
the people rise up and say thank you we

00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,379
will just walk down to the bar and

00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,659
do a little chair to each other and be

00:25:07,379 --> 00:25:14,159
happy we don't need the fame we don't

00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:15,120
need that are you believe so so the

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,570
thing in this group ultramoon

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,879
interesting is how do we have had a lot

00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:22,799
of ways to help to getting these things

00:25:20,879 --> 00:25:30,779
to work somewhere to get the development

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:33,419
and the designers talk it it kind of

00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:35,970
works about a hat were kind of kind of

00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:39,149
um it was the thing is that when it

00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:41,309
comes to the this is a technical this

00:25:39,149 --> 00:25:44,159
this dude might have something to do

00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:46,080
with with some panels thinks and some

00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:47,370
things like that that other dude might

00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,129
have something to do with some theming

00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:51,779
things I don't know I'm not really sure

00:25:50,129 --> 00:25:54,570
there's something about twenty dollars

00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:56,990
on a bar and something but but the whole

00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:58,909
thing is here that we actually I mean

00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:00,379
yeah

00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:03,019
the world to serve something that's

00:26:00,379 --> 00:26:04,399
better than what we have right now when

00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:07,220
we look at the theme layer and that's

00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:10,759
when you know there's tricks thing comes

00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:16,460
in any idea what triggers heck don't

00:26:10,759 --> 00:26:19,009
come up padam okay who doesn't okay so

00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:21,259
the trick is the new hot ass seemingly

00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:23,269
and rupal so some of these kind of

00:26:21,259 --> 00:26:25,249
unearthly techniques i showed you like

00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:28,129
oh you can do this with a theme function

00:26:25,249 --> 00:26:29,629
Network merchant around we did not come

00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:32,090
in to pre-process and all this other

00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:33,649
kind of because didn't want to fill

00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:36,080
your pretty little head with too much

00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:39,080
information the thing is that trick

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:42,379
actually I mean this is all about the

00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:44,749
Google eight epicness and for the first

00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:47,599
time ever in the Juba community's

00:26:44,749 --> 00:26:50,509
history we actually have developers and

00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:53,239
Themis talking with each other I know

00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:55,999
it's completely crazy talk to have that

00:26:53,239 --> 00:26:58,700
kind of communication I have had it I've

00:26:55,999 --> 00:27:01,549
had a good time for many years in my own

00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:04,279
little bunker in Copenhagen shouting at

00:27:01,549 --> 00:27:08,809
developers it has been fun it has been

00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:11,690
fun um I've had the opportunity to go

00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:13,039
through every little corner of drooling

00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:15,559
to trying to figure out where that thief

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:18,320
came from where the class came from why

00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:20,989
life was so evil wise developers hated

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:23,179
me personally but at some point that

00:27:20,989 --> 00:27:24,440
gotta stop and that kind of stopped the

00:27:23,179 --> 00:27:29,119
last year we had to begin to communicate

00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:30,710
with each other and that we for about a

00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:32,359
year via kind of been notching around

00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:33,859
getting this trick in trick is a new

00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:37,580
feeling engine that basically makes

00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:39,590
everything better period so everything

00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,809
that is not logical today in the theme

00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:44,840
layer well more or less it will become

00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:46,489
it's a modern theme system let's put it

00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,049
that way I will not show you coat but I

00:27:46,489 --> 00:27:51,529
would much rather sure there's this

00:27:48,049 --> 00:27:57,289
reaction this is Jim Lambton this was at

00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:59,769
bad camp she looks happy right so at bad

00:27:57,289 --> 00:28:02,599
camp this year that's three months ago

00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:05,210
we had been pushing forgetting trick

00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:06,769
into trooper Cole do you know how much

00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:09,470
if what it takes to get new in

00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:11,510
chico creek arm how many does that know

00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:13,190
that if I

00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:19,520
say it's the biggest pain in the ass

00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:22,190
able to get anything in okay it's um I

00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,020
don't think that's words for how hard it

00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:27,520
is to get new into Drupal hole

00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:30,170
because every person and we have

00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,970
20,000 plus developers now have an

00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:35,300
opinion upon it and we will talk about

00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:37,400
the front end believe me every

00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:39,890
idiot in the world will communicate

00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:43,180
about like no I don't think that well I

00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:45,950
really like on these classes but just

00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:48,170
the thing is that when you have markup

00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:50,090
that's kind of the really easy thing to

00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:53,450
talk about some you do know what bike

00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:56,270
sharing is right it's it's everybody has

00:28:53,450 --> 00:29:01,940
an opinion upon it so us who really know

00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:08,180
me get tired well there's a couple of

00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:10,700
others maybe a ton but anyways to

00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:12,380
get stuff into Drupal it's a pain in the

00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:15,410
ass and we've been pushing forward in

00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:17,030
about seven months at this point I'm

00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:19,700
sitting as you at back and here is

00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:23,690
actually how how devious that developers

00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:27,890
are bad camp the morning for the first

00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:31,550
day of bad camp I'm at the hotel I'm

00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:33,410
sitting eating breakfast and trees comes

00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:35,090
over here you're gonna sit down and eat

00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:38,270
breakfast if of course you get into ease

00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:40,610
I mean now I get 30 minutes with grease

00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:43,850
and I will cam a trick down his

00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:46,790
drill I walk a lot of I would use any

00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:48,860
kind of up so i use the next 30 minutes

00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:50,720
to talk about how important trick is to

00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:53,570
the funding community how much easier

00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:55,670
life will be how much better everything

00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:58,340
will be how much cleaner the amount the

00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:01,760
way we can build a front-end community

00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:03,500
that really can ink to wrap this and

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:07,610
kiss it the right way make it beautiful

00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:10,240
for everybody and i'll go on for over 30

00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:14,270
minutes and dreams just eat breakfast

00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,560
fair enough and I come walk down to the

00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:18,800
conference i'm getting ready to actually

00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:20,060
give this session and that session was

00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,250
at that point you can see this is not

00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:24,410
really angry that session at that point

00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:27,150
was angry as

00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:28,620
it was kind of the we're like okay I

00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:30,360
need to tone down some of these slides

00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:33,330
because I lately every

00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,680
development world you that was kind

00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:37,500
of the way I would start up just like

00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,240
make people wake up in the morning so

00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:43,110
drinks has a keynote just before my

00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,910
session fair enough I read of I'm so old

00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:47,190
in this community so I don't do keynotes

00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:51,240
because no I'm all that I'm a rock star

00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:53,160
right this is not the time you should be

00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,470
silent now that's like yes mode you are

00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:58,290
that should be the way but no no you

00:30:55,470 --> 00:31:00,920
just you more than I one day I

00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:03,450
could see the looks for you anyways

00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:05,100
we're almost at the end of the at the

00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:06,600
opening keynote and Ruiz talks about

00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,800
traveling and and I don't really

00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,660
don't care I'm trying to figure out

00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:12,950
where my where my session is because

00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:16,620
they evil developers moved my sessions

00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:20,400
again trying to stop my righteous work

00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:22,530
to push this in and then suddenly John

00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,830
open comes running awesome mod mod more

00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:27,470
you need to come in like oh okay well

00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:31,200
I'll walk back into the room and goes

00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:33,510
holy so trees are standing now on

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:36,990
which is um with his laptop and is

00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:39,060
pushing trick into Drupal core this is

00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:41,640
how the maintainer of trick looks when

00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:44,490
that happens this is eight months

00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:47,010
of other other happiness so later that

00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:50,130
night I get a get a handle of trees at a

00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:53,400
bar like dude what the I mean

00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:55,620
seriously what the he just kills

00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:59,120
well if I've told you at that point it

00:31:55,620 --> 00:32:02,280
wouldn't have been a surprise would it

00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,770
six years i have used to push

00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:07,320
for a new and better see mention there's

00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:11,010
a gentleman I've hated the mark up so

00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:13,470
bad so bad you have me or people who

00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:15,570
knows me know how much hatred that's

00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:17,850
been in my body I've wanted to create

00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:20,190
this project so many times more

00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:23,010
than chicks more time than chase when I

00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,990
created oh yeah the only reason I kind

00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:27,420
of still kept on in this trilogy

00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:29,400
but because that community thing like

00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:32,850
 you community I won't have a decent

00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:35,010
markup to work with six years about the

00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:36,870
spiritual has to sit and listen to me

00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:39,920
 and known in there

00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:39,920
so it wouldn't have been a surprise

00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:47,150
Jesus but that kind of gets us back to

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:50,090
this but nobody told us what to do

00:32:47,150 --> 00:32:52,650
because world at this point we're like

00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:56,220
five or eight people that are trying to

00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:58,320
push this um and if nobody tells that

00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:01,290
developer what to do how can they do it

00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:05,430
if we as funded develops don't tell

00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:08,280
these people who doesn't know better

00:33:05,430 --> 00:33:11,250
because they don't how should they know

00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:15,140
the beauty of the article check how

00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:17,190
should they know why a section is its

00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:19,559
when you look at that man i'll just get

00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:23,730
hit am I the only one can get emotional

00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:30,030
I still get a nod up or just one other

00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:32,910
good I just need the Blowfish in I mean

00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:35,160
if if we don't tell other people about

00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:38,059
this that we need all show them what we

00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:41,760
need help them out we cannot change

00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:43,770
apparently so apparently this trick

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,679
thing is what I figured out later on is

00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:50,790
the most unholy alliance ever done in

00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:53,250
the world of google why one the thing

00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:55,920
about trick it's it's a sandbox so

00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:58,920
apparently we cannot do SQL errors in it

00:33:55,920 --> 00:34:00,960
or drop databases or this kind of stuff

00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:04,770
it's kind of a protected layer which

00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:09,000
makes developers heavy good now they are

00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:12,030
heavy the Themis we can get the markup

00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,310
we want now we are happy apparently

00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:16,350
trick provides that I don't even know if

00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:19,470
it's the right choice I really don't

00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:22,340
care because no matter what it cannot be

00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:27,560
worse than what the we have today

00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:27,560
so it's kind of an unholy alliance um

00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:36,629
but and this is kind of where when we

00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:41,040
talked about you know themis and

00:34:36,629 --> 00:34:43,230
designers and developers you know kind

00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,429
of joining hands and I try to make

00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,990
something better and that is actually

00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:47,760
what we're doing is Drupal q energy

00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:48,780
right we get an idea we try to build

00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,820
government

00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:54,179
to build something new there's actually

00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:55,950
now a chance to become immortal because

00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:58,110
this is the first time we have seen this

00:34:55,950 --> 00:35:04,200
and we are community that what 10 years

00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:07,260
old 11 years old now 2001 12 years old

00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:10,680
holy so in trophy as we have not

00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:12,840
been able to get the three key persons

00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:15,150
to do a website I'm not talking about

00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:17,280
DevOps here because they just get stuff

00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:18,840
done but the developers didn't assign us

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:20,970
and the theme is getting them in the

00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:24,980
same room and work together that have

00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:27,390
taken us 11 years or fair enough but

00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:29,550
that actually means that we need to kind

00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:34,320
of build up top of this data that's why

00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:36,330
we have a trick spend tomorrow and and

00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:40,920
say why would I come to a tricks went

00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:43,110
well you did download Drupal right you

00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:46,200
how many of you lives by lift with

00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:51,150
google I have a work that you do to pool

00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:56,010
all day good how many enjoys this

00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:58,650
community three for a little bit more

00:35:56,010 --> 00:36:00,810
and I know this may be sounds a little

00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:04,110
bit strange but I think we always back

00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:05,360
to Google i/o it personal back to Drupal

00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:08,460
to actually make the product better

00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:10,410
because I cannot expect not expect that

00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:12,930
somebody else comes in with a magic

00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:14,760
stick and they'll do some magic and

00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:16,110
suddenly the project of better if I

00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:19,650
don't want to make it better I have a

00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:21,990
responsibility to watch the project if

00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:25,470
you are front and deaf and you know this

00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:27,660
 you have a responsibility to watch

00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:29,310
true which you make it better that's I

00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:31,710
mean I'm sorry for saying it but that's

00:36:29,310 --> 00:36:34,440
just how it is you downloaded the

00:36:31,710 --> 00:36:39,420
you got the first job for free now the

00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:41,850
tax comes that's how it is I mean so as

00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:44,480
you so tomorrow more tomorrow we have we

00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:44,480
have a trick sprint

00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,400
yeah so now there's actually a couple

00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:57,030
layers in it this is this is the trick

00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:59,160
sprint from Munich it was a 10 hours non

00:36:57,030 --> 00:37:01,740
stop talking I stood in front of that

00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,020
light board and talked with every

00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:07,950
 development room and fought to

00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:10,530
my last dying breath we were actually

00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:12,750
about 50 people doing this the whole

00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:14,609
thing is I did not write one single line

00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:16,500
of code all day but we talked about

00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:18,390
principles we talked about what it is

00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:20,790
that we want we talked about how the

00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:23,400
markup should be how it should what

00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:25,349
should be done better so a thing with a

00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,790
sprint it's not only if you're like

00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:29,960
whipped chicken could roll in and just

00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:35,190
throw around patches all over

00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:37,020
push done away a sprint needs much more

00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:39,720
than that we need people to actually

00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:43,079
look at the that we do is this even

00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:44,309
a good idea I don't know I mean I

00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:46,260
figured out what I talked with John

00:37:44,309 --> 00:37:49,140
Tobin was like the prominent Thema on

00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:51,390
tubule seven and how they accused him at

00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,599
any given point I could get to accuse

00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:55,920
them of all the evilness Google seven

00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,349
because that's how we do in the theming

00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,420
world we're not be enough placing people

00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:02,549
hits each other the problem is around

00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:04,980
Drupal 8 is apparently up in like that

00:38:02,549 --> 00:38:06,660
one of the bigger boys in it so John

00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:08,430
Alden now says everything that goes

00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:15,920
wrong and Google eight it's my fault

00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:20,970
that kind of sucks i know i have a

00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:23,280
bigger ego than my big body shows the

00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:26,010
problem is i might not be right in every

00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,510
decision if we need a lot of eyes on the

00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:29,190
code we need a lot of eyes on the ideas

00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:33,359
so we actually need people who don't

00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:35,700
even know how to write PHP don't know

00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:38,220
how to write PHP see this is what

00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:41,040
tricked us you don't have to understand

00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:43,230
PHP but if you know how to write markup

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,030
if you know how to write CSS if you had

00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:46,799
designer that have ideas to what they

00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:48,599
actually that you want if you have all

00:38:46,799 --> 00:38:50,640
these things we need you we need you as

00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:54,270
you more now more than ever ever ever

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:57,599
because my mind is poisoned it with this

00:38:54,270 --> 00:39:01,050
group of theming engine you saw the

00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:03,840
picture of me back in 2006 I was happy

00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:08,400
I was a positive young man who looked at

00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:10,770
life with great amount of joy now in a

00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,690
depressed old man that wanna kick the

00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:16,770
 out of somebody from up my

00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:19,710
life for six years I'm sorry for that

00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:21,840
that's not how it is so we need new eyes

00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:23,430
at the code we need every person

00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,920
that we can get into what on this so

00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:27,330
that's actually why I'm that the thing

00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,550
that we ended up doing in Munich for 10

00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:31,350
hours was just talking principles we did

00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:33,960
actually almost the same thing at

00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:36,120
Berkeley three months later and now

00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,310
we're down here we have a week to patch

00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:40,050
in some pretty big patches but besides

00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:41,970
of that we have a ton of small things

00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:45,620
that we need to get done and the thing

00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:48,690
is about becoming a core developer um

00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:51,030
it's kind of scary but you do know that

00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:52,860
the expression about the code is good

00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:56,280
enough production but not good enough to

00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:58,770
get up oh yeah that's a couple here who

00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:00,840
knows that yo you push it in because

00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:03,300
it's done you don't want to show the

00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:08,070
world when you suddenly release products

00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:09,660
and into Drupal call that scary the

00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:12,180
good thing is that we have a lot of the

00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:13,770
developers loves to get new people in

00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,570
because that means that don't have to

00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:18,810
all they can just work on that little

00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:22,410
tiny thing they love what is the thing

00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:27,080
you would want to work with yeah

00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:30,360
comentarii what is that that is friendly

00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:33,840
developers that want to help out new

00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:36,570
people to come in and help for the

00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:38,640
record she is now shaking her head just

00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:40,350
to make sure that people who did not see

00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,630
it she is not meaningless but let's

00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:44,400
treat sense now the thing is that we

00:40:42,630 --> 00:40:45,990
have a lot of deaths who want to get

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,900
more people in because we have a very

00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:50,550
tiny amount of people that you do kool

00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,020
development the thing is that we

00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:54,900
actually need you even if you have no

00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:57,270
idea how to create a patch or no idea

00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,710
how to review a patch but you have an

00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:00,270
idea of how you want your markup you

00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:03,090
have an idea how CSS should be made you

00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:04,410
have an idea of if this kind of logic

00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:07,500
makes sense you have an idea of that

00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:08,910
kind of view I mean this is what we're

00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:12,609
going to work with the next couple of

00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:14,869
years and the thing is that if if you

00:41:12,609 --> 00:41:17,560
contributed to this same thing with

00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:22,369
limited the whole voting thing around um

00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:23,930
the drupal association if you voted you

00:41:22,369 --> 00:41:27,980
could about the drupal association

00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:32,240
if you didn't vote too bad how many

00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:34,099
votes you allowed to pitch the best of

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:41,390
you I'm sorry yes that's how the rules

00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:49,130
were let me just see what I have for you

00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:52,730
in here here is a piece of candy now the

00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:55,190
thing is that that we have if you have

00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:58,760
put your heart and soul into this just a

00:41:55,190 --> 00:42:01,010
tiny little little piece of code then

00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,510
you are allowed to even more the

00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:04,130
good thing in the two treaties that is

00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:07,010
what we do already you actually can do

00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:08,599
it in two ways but by actually becoming

00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:10,609
a part of the project it feels I know

00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:12,440
this feels strange but it feels pretty

00:42:10,609 --> 00:42:15,410
 good when you figure out that

00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:20,569
thing you put in in Google 8 the

00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:22,400
contextual links i did that only the CSS

00:42:20,569 --> 00:42:24,230
in the mark-up as you think it got

00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,490
changed again but anyways it's

00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:29,119
definitely going to be changed now we're

00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:31,450
rolling in a new female engine the whole

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,460
thing is that we need you no matter what

00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:36,079
because the success of trouble is based

00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:37,220
on one thing and one thing only and

00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,950
that's actually the strength of the

00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:41,810
community that's just how it is so as it

00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:44,359
one thing more just when I want to put

00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:47,930
in here I see this is three years ago

00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:50,119
this is my daughter that's how she looks

00:42:47,930 --> 00:42:53,060
today she ran my campaign by the way for

00:42:50,119 --> 00:42:55,339
the tuple association thing yes i am a

00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:57,680
ruthless I used little kids

00:42:55,339 --> 00:43:00,290
to run my campaign I don't give a

00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,640
that's why I promote this as the angry

00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:03,500
seeming session so you thought you would

00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,089
learn a lot about feeling no no this is

00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:08,980
a pitch to get you into the coach pinch

00:43:05,089 --> 00:43:13,720
em all do you feel cheated

00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:15,280
good good good anyways a big thanks for

00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:17,230
the support I got some more or less

00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,940
still hope actually even from Sydney

00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:23,460
about my daughter this is a couple of

00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:25,630
this is my own project and mothership

00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:28,140
which is if you really want to get into

00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:30,970
like cleaning up your markup and

00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:33,540
removing that headache the mothership is

00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:36,270
a the whole idea behind this theme is

00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:39,310
rewriting everything Drupal puts out

00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:45,070
that's that's what does it looks like

00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:47,980
shite but the markup in I want to make

00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:51,700
out with it that's how I feel with um

00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:53,820
smacks if you do not understand why CSS

00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:56,590
is complicated if you think that's just

00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:58,510
you know we just give that to the to the

00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:01,540
kids over here who played with column

00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:05,470
don't read smacks and understand how

00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:08,380
complicated this actually is / 3 of

00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:10,840
module display sweet I should have put

00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:13,859
fences in here I did not I'm sorry for

00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:16,690
that John but the whole thing is that

00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:21,490
dimas right now how many of you were

00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:24,060
like famous you you you you you you you

00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:27,520
right now you have an application to

00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:31,119
step the up tomorrow and come and

00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:33,550
help I don't want to die alone but this

00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:35,230
 does not work because the whole

00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:37,119
world would come after me that was what

00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:39,280
John saw he was like more than what the

00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:41,619
 you cannot go out and say it's my

00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:43,900
fault biggest then people pointed to him

00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:45,820
if your developer who are tired of

00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:49,540
hearing your theme of and moan

00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:50,520
over the markup come and help and you

00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:52,750
know why you should come and help

00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,790
because then they would be happy each

00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:57,130
morning it would be happy Thema each

00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:59,410
morning you'll have that big ass smile a

00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:02,230
demon coming like 'hey i'm going to work

00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:06,310
and today we're gonna we're gonna make

00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:08,650
it work on ie6 just for fun that's the

00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:12,850
level of happiness this will bring i'm

00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:16,019
not kidding i'm not i have seen it I am

00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:50,579
so much full of right now

anyway um any Christians yep yeah

00:45:50,759 --> 00:45:55,239
actually the thing is an hour I'm same

00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:57,220
thing that she will break mode sake

00:45:55,239 --> 00:45:59,140
I'm just sailing this getting win we we

00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:00,880
just need people to actually come and

00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:04,359
participate life you're just listening

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:07,119
in because the I've been a coach Prince

00:46:04,359 --> 00:46:09,009
since my second rubicon in sunny will I

00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:11,680
did not do anything else just hanging

00:46:09,009 --> 00:46:13,960
around mainly because I figured out if i

00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,630
was to able to change this team

00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:19,749
system i needed to be friends with it

00:46:16,630 --> 00:46:21,309
with the enemy right it developers so

00:46:19,749 --> 00:46:23,799
there's a reason I always hang out in

00:46:21,309 --> 00:46:32,289
the bath and bought people beers I don't

00:46:23,799 --> 00:46:47,109
like you that well that's

00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:49,119
because no I don't know yeah yeah so the

00:46:47,109 --> 00:46:52,059
thing is that we what we really need is

00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:53,950
is if we get the problem is that John

00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:56,979
was practicing the only themer that did

00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:58,359
on Drupal 7 now we doubled the amount of

00:46:56,979 --> 00:47:03,219
people working on the theme lay on

00:46:58,359 --> 00:47:05,289
Google's 8 we're now to people if this

00:47:03,219 --> 00:47:07,749
 runs on what two to three percent

00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:09,999
of the world's websites and you let that

00:47:07,749 --> 00:47:14,859
up to me to decide the mark-up are you

00:47:09,999 --> 00:47:18,759
 are you insane Jesus no

00:47:14,859 --> 00:47:22,299
way come and I mean we need help that's

00:47:18,759 --> 00:47:23,650
that's the thing and if you don't know

00:47:22,299 --> 00:47:24,910
anything if you just want to hang out

00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:27,069
that was actually what I did I was just

00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:28,640
hanging out for years also because it's

00:47:27,069 --> 00:47:31,220
fun you have this

00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:33,319
nerds going seeing three developers

00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:37,339
going not case over function begin to

00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:40,160
discuss about it that's fun they get so

00:47:37,339 --> 00:47:42,670
angry at each other like that gotta be

00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:46,400
but I function is way better than yours

00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:50,869
Wow in the theming community be doing

00:47:46,400 --> 00:48:12,109
way more mature you don't believe me

00:47:50,869 --> 00:48:14,660
come and see tomorrow yes oh yeah no I

00:48:12,109 --> 00:48:17,240
message using sent good now so Sentret

00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:20,480
just too revved up John open has this

00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:22,789
sent team which is based on his ideas of

00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,500
know he likes having class names all

00:48:22,789 --> 00:48:26,420
around that's fine that's one of the

00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:28,400
beauties around tuple seven he can get

00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:31,160
that and people likes that I like

00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:34,460
nothing I like naked that's just a thing

00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:39,589
I like I will not be naked in front of

00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:50,240
you today yet no well will not do that

00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:54,549
now there is cameras here so what you

00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:57,500
just we just want to have Themis just

00:48:54,549 --> 00:49:01,849
they have caught them in we want to have

00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:05,720
to win though so secret is is so John

00:49:01,849 --> 00:49:07,730
wrote this whole CSS preprocessor SAS

00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:09,619
thing is called sendgrid and send grade

00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:11,480
is basically one of the problems we had

00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:13,609
but this so if developers don't

00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:16,099
understand how frustrating CSS can be

00:49:13,609 --> 00:49:18,710
you I said that about math I was not

00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:22,160
good at math Safari the Safari browser

00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:24,890
is the dumbest piece of ever I'm

00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:27,289
not killing you so if i have 10 of an

00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:31,089
element that's ten percent white and i

00:49:27,289 --> 00:49:31,089
have 10 of them how much does that give

00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:41,039
100 it should give but it does not give

00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:43,569
that in Safari it's 100 and something

00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:45,819
because it does sub-pixel rendering like

00:49:43,569 --> 00:49:47,289
a because it adds if you

00:49:45,819 --> 00:49:49,089
have padding and margin it's kind of

00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:50,890
cannot really figure out how to do it if

00:49:49,089 --> 00:49:52,509
you do the straight up pixels it works

00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:55,150
out so John figured out a way to

00:49:52,509 --> 00:49:58,449
actually work around with this the idea

00:49:55,150 --> 00:50:03,130
behind saying is it's a very small and

00:49:58,449 --> 00:50:05,559
clean CSS grid system to build websites

00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:07,420
with yes I use it with the mothership by

00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:09,459
the way it's progressive you it's small

00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:10,809
it's simple it does exactly what did you

00:50:09,459 --> 00:50:13,089
do and that's kind of the whole

00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:15,609
principle my whole principle around the

00:50:13,089 --> 00:50:18,549
way that I think of teaming a thing of

00:50:15,609 --> 00:50:20,529
CSS is I have a design and I have an

00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:23,319
engine over here need to make those to

00:50:20,529 --> 00:50:25,479
work but what ability to make it work is

00:50:23,319 --> 00:50:27,279
in all of those browsers and mobile

00:50:25,479 --> 00:50:28,749
phones and all that stuff so that's why

00:50:27,279 --> 00:50:30,819
I want to clean it all out and I want to

00:50:28,749 --> 00:50:33,339
build exactly what I know because if we

00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:34,900
look at the theming in essence the

00:50:33,339 --> 00:50:37,509
theming is the front end this is the

00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:39,429
spearhead them towards the front it

00:50:37,509 --> 00:50:41,589
means it's called the fondant right it's

00:50:39,429 --> 00:50:44,319
the front and we have all this evilness

00:50:41,589 --> 00:50:47,109
coming in browsers new browsers old

00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:48,789
browsers lotus notes you know all kinds

00:50:47,109 --> 00:50:53,049
of crap is coming and trying to look at

00:50:48,789 --> 00:50:55,059
our pages and we don't know what's going

00:50:53,049 --> 00:50:56,410
to happen tomorrow we have no idea we

00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:57,699
know there will come new browsers we

00:50:56,410 --> 00:50:59,769
know they'll come new things coming in

00:50:57,699 --> 00:51:01,660
the way Google thinks it's like two

00:50:59,769 --> 00:51:03,670
years ago oh I'm going to predefine all

00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:06,609
the mock-up for you because I know if

00:51:03,670 --> 00:51:08,589
you'd like Jesus so that's kind of

00:51:06,609 --> 00:51:10,119
the problem and that's why we want to we

00:51:08,589 --> 00:51:12,400
want to make sure in the next version of

00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:14,529
Drupal their behalf know as little mark

00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,509
up as possible and as much freedom to do

00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:20,799
what we need so that's the whole idea

00:51:16,509 --> 00:51:23,619
and that by using extend creates it

00:51:20,799 --> 00:51:26,559
works perfect mainly because I'm

00:51:23,619 --> 00:51:28,989
brilliant but besides that he could also

00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:31,329
be just below it's because it just it's

00:51:28,989 --> 00:51:33,249
get to just job done and the mothership

00:51:31,329 --> 00:51:36,130
just clean out here I had since I

00:51:33,249 --> 00:51:38,259
need and that's kind of a in my mind and

00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:42,939
normal working way but Jubal dozen other

00:51:38,259 --> 00:51:45,330
wait any more questions no more

00:51:42,939 --> 00:51:51,850
questions well then

00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:59,530
as you think we up for time 1509 I have

00:51:51,850 --> 00:52:01,200
six minutes more yeah well okay now

00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:04,420
here's the magic are you a developer

00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:07,510
okay let me tell you you must tell this

00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:09,910
to anybody so responsiveness in theming

00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:14,290
that's CSS that's the only thing it is

00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:16,270
it's about having CSS and making sure

00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:18,760
that that CSS respond to different

00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:21,090
sizing of the screens so we have

00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:23,440
responsive themes in the Drupal world

00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:25,090
it's really easy to make them to

00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,280
themselves if you look into like system

00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:29,550
like said quit when you first get into

00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:33,310
that mindset of thinking it begins to be

00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:35,980
I mean in my mind it's kind of almost

00:52:33,310 --> 00:52:39,070
done to download a responsive theme

00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:43,120
because it's it's so individual what the

00:52:39,070 --> 00:52:45,180
design needs and how it needs to work so

00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:47,470
it kind of it doesn't really make sense

00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:56,530
how it sounds sounds kind of strange

00:52:47,470 --> 00:52:58,360
maybe I just show you this okay let me

00:52:56,530 --> 00:53:03,280
see if i can find this project I've been

00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:05,680
working on no I know but I know I do

00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,150
this thing I know that I'm not like a

00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:15,030
total badass because i'm going to show

00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:15,030
you Jesus come here let me just

00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,359
mmm

00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:55,160
oh I knew me achieving and remember this

00:53:55,310 --> 00:54:03,750
I'm using SAS because I'm a grown up the

00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:09,690
whole disk of there is a long discussion

00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:13,170
between if you want to use SAS or Jesus

00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:15,290
Christ or something god damn it hmm let

00:54:13,170 --> 00:54:15,290
me see

00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:25,340
pocket

00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:34,230
alright so let me see

00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:44,570
it really want to download some funds

00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:50,450
from the googly eyes why does you want

00:54:44,570 --> 00:54:52,700
to do that all right so let me just put

00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:56,480
this out here this this is a great

00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:58,130
system that i wrote for clients you hold

00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,260
idea behind this grid system is AG we're

00:54:58,130 --> 00:55:03,290
going to look at the mark-up just made

00:55:00,260 --> 00:55:08,630
really quick it's that that you have

00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:10,790
what we've done here in the so oh no

00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:15,320
he's not using semantic class names oh

00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:18,830
no who gives a I need to get this

00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:21,260
out of my body this idea of semantic

00:55:18,830 --> 00:55:23,180
class naming being wrong because of

00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:25,340
something about screen readers that's

00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:27,350
 it's always been

00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:29,660
 you can use whatever name for

00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:31,820
your classes that you want to if you

00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:34,280
have a grid system that makes sense use

00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:36,430
that what we've done here we wrote a

00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:39,170
great system based on the whole the

00:55:36,430 --> 00:55:42,080
whole sink rate so what do you do here

00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:44,030
oh you have like an LR that says a

00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:46,490
layout row that's 12 wide and you have a

00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:48,890
class in it so if you walk down a little

00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:51,050
bit down to watch it see when you talk

00:55:48,890 --> 00:55:54,500
about responsive the whole section is

00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:56,690
around responsive is that oh you know

00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:59,740
when you when your dragon a dinner the

00:55:56,690 --> 00:56:04,540
different designs kind of changes so

00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:08,990
that's that's kind of how it's thought

00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:12,050
that's this is what responsible you have

00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:13,430
a bigger or smaller size and it will

00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:15,680
work out exit this one that's see if

00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:18,950
that works so the whole idea we'd build

00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:23,590
this one exactly just to have great

00:56:18,950 --> 00:56:26,990
variations that that that moves with

00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:30,500
with an around different sizes and if

00:56:26,990 --> 00:56:34,190
you look at the CSS let us just we just

00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:37,370
moved out here i am again between

00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:38,780
checked it as us I don't know if I'm the

00:56:37,370 --> 00:56:40,190
only one who had this problem that every

00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:43,730
time I think now I found the perfect

00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:45,110
tech that isn't it kind of ended again

00:56:43,730 --> 00:56:48,160
because something something something

00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:49,900
and I'm a little bit anal about that

00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:51,930
Jesus on

00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,930
Oh

00:57:04,010 --> 00:57:12,180
tell me baby all right so this is one of

00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:14,970
the one of the when we talk about

00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:17,520
responsiveness what we do is we identify

00:57:14,970 --> 00:57:19,590
elements on a page and then we say oh if

00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:24,690
you're this wide or that white do this

00:57:19,590 --> 00:57:28,860
or that so this is a class that says if

00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:32,430
anything inside of this LF is a layout

00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:33,990
flow if you are layer flow dash for that

00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:36,360
means that i have if i have elements

00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:38,820
inside of this box you should break

00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:41,220
after four elements and do that all

00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:45,140
depends on the sizing of you so what we

00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:48,390
can do is this is the this is SAS it's

00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:51,480
going and look at CENTCOM figuring out

00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:54,450
um but this is the only this is the

00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:58,020
magic right here be the only screen and

00:57:54,450 --> 00:58:02,240
min with 601 pixels that means that if

00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:04,950
you're a minimum 601 pixels use this CSS

00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:08,870
that that's the only thing that that

00:58:04,950 --> 00:58:08,870
actually that this whole responsive does

00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:20,930
actually what you should use is no okay

00:58:16,550 --> 00:58:24,630
fm's i'll be talking about fun sizing or

00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:28,080
okay well the reason that at them so

00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:30,450
pixels is bad the reason pixels is bad

00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:32,580
when you do especially when you resize

00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:34,830
and stuff but we try to make everything

00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:36,840
is a percentage it's basically that that

00:58:34,830 --> 00:58:39,810
we don't want to right now let's say we

00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:42,300
have an iphone and ipad and oh the

00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:44,490
ipad mini came in oh god damnit nexus 7

00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:46,710
came out to mow another element comes

00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:49,050
out so we could a year ago we could

00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:53,040
predefined you're not an ipad was this

00:58:49,050 --> 00:58:54,740
size as screen loss that size well in a

00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,820
couple of years we're going to have no

00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:59,190
refrigerators with web browsers

00:58:56,820 --> 00:59:01,320
in and all we have no idea what's going

00:58:59,190 --> 00:59:03,930
to come in so actually the thing is that

00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:06,480
we need to move away from pixels and I

00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:09,510
hate this because I love pixels it made

00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:15,150
sense I mean what the back in the

00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:18,720
base 960 pixels right done set in stone

00:59:15,150 --> 00:59:20,280
nothing more then this dude comes out

00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,260
with that yellow little book and talk

00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:26,010
about responsive for blah blah blah blah

00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:28,470
blah and now our lives I can completely

00:59:26,010 --> 00:59:30,210
miss the reason if we don't want to use

00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:32,880
pixels is that we have no idea where the

00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:35,940
next break points comes the idea of

00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:37,590
having pixels having patience for the

00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:39,870
breakpoints because it needs to

00:59:37,590 --> 00:59:41,880
understand where when I'm am I going to

00:59:39,870 --> 00:59:44,160
break by pegging is when I'm going to

00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:47,760
use this amount this CSS all that CSS

00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:56,070
what that CSS to decline my my divs all

00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:59,070
my classes so by having them so by using

00:59:56,070 --> 01:00:02,070
percentage instead of pixels means then

00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:05,400
oh I am you know if I have a definition

01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:10,320
that says between 300 and 600 pixels you

01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:12,090
should be 20 no 50 and fifty percent why

01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:14,400
that's it that in pixel then it would

01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:15,720
break if I came in between these I want

01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,940
to be able to be as flexible as possible

01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:20,220
so it doesn't matter if there's a new

01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:22,650
device coming out that's 400 pixel wide

01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:25,350
instead of 480 pixel wide because it

01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:29,070
would just adjust to that that's kind of

01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:30,480
the new way of thinking in design it's a

01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:32,190
pain in the ass the first couple of

01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,290
months but when you first get to the

01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:35,670
into your head that everything is it's

01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:38,790
based that way and if you begin to

01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:40,200
educate your designers then dodge is

01:00:38,790 --> 01:00:42,150
going to be good if you don't do that

01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:44,430
then you're the reason that we

01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:47,760
want to use extra not ms part of the

01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:51,120
ramp event is relative ms how many of

01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:52,980
you know what an M is have you ever had

01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:56,220
the fun of calculating aims through down

01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:59,640
at CSS file that's fun right now it's

01:00:56,220 --> 01:01:01,590
pain in the ass the problem is that the

01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:06,150
way that you if you have a font that so

01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:07,680
it's a it's no 10m big it's going to be

01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:09,360
relative to the next into the next to

01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,980
the next so when you begin to nest stuff

01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:12,990
it's gonna be a pain in the ass if you

01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:14,760
just built it in google standard my

01:01:12,990 --> 01:01:16,110
markup then you're gonna have nice

01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:19,620
things all the what is going to

01:01:16,110 --> 01:01:23,940
be really pain in the ass but remember

01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:26,130
is relative m's which means that you

01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:28,470
said a base size of your M sizing and

01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:30,540
now if you think will follow

01:01:28,470 --> 01:01:32,460
that so if you suddenly have a website

01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:35,340
or at you know a screen size that's

01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:36,540
going to be like on the ODA phone on my

01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:38,849
phone here I actually want to have a

01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:41,010
bigger size of the funds instead of

01:01:38,849 --> 01:01:43,200
going through all the funds all over and

01:01:41,010 --> 01:01:44,640
say this size decides decides this size

01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:46,830
you can actually just change it by

01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:49,800
changing your relative size another

01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:51,780
thing is around Regina this place the

01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:54,060
funds actually followed that sizing as

01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:58,470
well it's kind of it's the the

01:01:54,060 --> 01:02:03,060
problem is I eh because of course ie7

01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:05,330
have a of cousin I ate of course

01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:07,920
does not understand this you can do a

01:02:05,330 --> 01:02:09,750
just a fall back on it so you first

01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:11,880
defined your rim and then you define it

01:02:09,750 --> 01:02:16,590
in pixels and just go well I ate

01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:18,180
you that's the way to do it so that way

01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:20,460
around so no my whole thing is that

01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:23,040
responsive is not magic responsibly

01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:25,109
actually pretty easy if you have

01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,910
a decent markup to work with if you have

01:02:25,109 --> 01:02:28,290
a designer who understands this then

01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:30,840
it's actually going to be CRO tonk road

01:02:28,290 --> 01:02:32,520
easy if you have a piece of a bunch

01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:34,619
of developers who stabs you in the back

01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:37,020
and do not want to help you out and

01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:38,820
think that that CSS is just a little bit

01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:40,530
of totally you could just can you put

01:02:38,820 --> 01:02:45,390
blue one this witty little sick warden

01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:47,369
can you do that you know I cannot

01:02:45,390 --> 01:02:49,830
but I can make your site that

01:02:47,369 --> 01:02:52,440
works good looks so good that the client

01:02:49,830 --> 01:02:55,230
will kiss you that's what I do because I

01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:57,839
translate code into the sign and the

01:02:55,230 --> 01:03:00,000
sign into code that's our Java steamers

01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:02,609
and if you're Thema you have a

01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:05,010
responsibility towards us the coach

01:03:02,609 --> 01:03:06,930
Brenda tomorrow if your developer come

01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:09,450
and hold my hand because I'm scared of

01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:11,460
this get thing and that's actually a

01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:13,320
problem that we have we I cannot just

01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:16,619
contribute without understanding it and

01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:20,630
push and commit and issue numbers and

01:03:16,619 --> 01:03:23,310
codes dog chewing and all that thing me

01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:25,470
it's nothing if smart up if it's Margo

01:03:23,310 --> 01:03:31,230
but needs to be done right but that code

01:03:25,470 --> 01:03:32,880
things who gives a right so that

01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:35,190
works of acids it's a good thing to just

01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:37,320
show up to them and it's kind of fun and

01:03:35,190 --> 01:03:41,619
you get a whole more day for free of

01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:45,800
trouble trunk I can see that

01:03:41,619 --> 01:03:54,170
sweet all right so with that said and

01:03:45,800 --> 01:03:57,550
I've over gone my time limit mmm I want

01:03:54,170 --> 01:03:57,550
to think that people trying to break in

01:03:57,700 --> 01:04:09,650
No so how many is gonna come tomorrow to

01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:12,650
the Coachman's to come on you know it's

01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:14,480
gonna be fun we we will not fight it it

01:04:12,650 --> 01:04:16,520
is actually fun even just hang around

01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:19,160
and talking crap and if you just want to

01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:21,589
sit down and I code on something and

01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:24,530
just look at what people does the first

01:04:21,589 --> 01:04:26,800
time is always the hardest right but we

01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:28,609
can pop the cherry in a gentle way and

01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:37,369
that is what we're gonna do tomorrow
