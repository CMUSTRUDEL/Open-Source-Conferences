Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	As we all look forward to seeing the final release of Drupal 8, in this session we will take a step back and look at the past and how we got here, how Drupal has changed over the years, and how we as a community have improved. We will have a chance to recall a growing pains as well as shiny moments. Doubtlessly, Drupal has changed our life. This session will show how it went backwards too -- our life changed Drupal too.

Over the session we will take a look at all 15 major releases of Drupal from 1.0 to 7.x and some of the major hi-lights like:

node system, what was before the node system? why does everything want to be a node?
The menu system, the early days of the menu system. how this has grown up, and the major future changes.
formapi and hook_form_alter() why hook_form_alter() was one of the largest, but only a small contribution for Drupal
How we used to theme, and how theming has changed, and improved.
Administration has changed, configuration and adding content
How we got a first class update system, and what was also spawned from and gave use many other great tools.
Also uncovering the truths behind the 2 most requested items in Drupal. hows these were finally put to rest.

All objects should be first class objects
Everything should be nodes. users, comments, etc
We have grown up, as a product and a community and this is a session to celebrate it.
