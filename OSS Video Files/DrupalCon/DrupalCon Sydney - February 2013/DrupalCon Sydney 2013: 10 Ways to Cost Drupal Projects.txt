Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: 10 Ways to Cost Drupal Projects
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	If there are 50 Ways to Leave Your Lover, there have to be at just about as many ways to cost a Drupal project. I'm going to discuss ten of them and show how all ten are valid in different circumstances.

And I'll show how Paul Simon must have had Drupal in mind when he wrote that song ;)

For example:

"Make a new plan, Stan" - Every developer dreams of a client with a budget for a new project with no preconceived notions to get in the way. It rarely happens but it does happen. I'll show some ways to approach and cost a greenfield project.
"Hop on the bus, Gus" - The project is in motion already and you have to jump on board with a defined task, or worse, when there's a mess happening. What do you do, how do you structure it?
"Slip out the back, Jack" - There are projects that you should simply pass on and not get involved in. I'll give you scenarios to look out for.
7 more.
Costing a project involves much more than estimating hours and multiplying by your hourly rate. You need to know exactly how you're going to approach each project and each situation, and have a healthy knowledge of common issues and risks. This session will provide practical advice and cover a lot of territory.

My experience is from an agency context, working with very small to very large organisations, but many of these ten situations are equally valid for an in-house development team. So this session should be useful for a wide audience of business owners, technology executives, project managers, subcontractors and anyone else who estimates work or writes proposals to deliver Drupal.

Sign up for this session for practical, real-world approaches to estimating, quoting and bidding for Drupal projects. And to find out which other lines of the song I use :)
