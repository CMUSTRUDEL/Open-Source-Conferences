Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: 10 Ways to Cost Drupal Projects
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	If there are 50 Ways to Leave Your Lover, there have to be at just about as many ways to cost a Drupal project. I'm going to discuss ten of them and show how all ten are valid in different circumstances.

And I'll show how Paul Simon must have had Drupal in mind when he wrote that song ;)

For example:

"Make a new plan, Stan" - Every developer dreams of a client with a budget for a new project with no preconceived notions to get in the way. It rarely happens but it does happen. I'll show some ways to approach and cost a greenfield project.
"Hop on the bus, Gus" - The project is in motion already and you have to jump on board with a defined task, or worse, when there's a mess happening. What do you do, how do you structure it?
"Slip out the back, Jack" - There are projects that you should simply pass on and not get involved in. I'll give you scenarios to look out for.
7 more.
Costing a project involves much more than estimating hours and multiplying by your hourly rate. You need to know exactly how you're going to approach each project and each situation, and have a healthy knowledge of common issues and risks. This session will provide practical advice and cover a lot of territory.

My experience is from an agency context, working with very small to very large organisations, but many of these ten situations are equally valid for an in-house development team. So this session should be useful for a wide audience of business owners, technology executives, project managers, subcontractors and anyone else who estimates work or writes proposals to deliver Drupal.

Sign up for this session for practical, real-world approaches to estimating, quoting and bidding for Drupal projects. And to find out which other lines of the song I use :)

fantastic thank you very much everyone

00:00:02,429 --> 00:00:06,299

00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,090
dozen people in the big room up there

00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,639
before and this thing was packed but

00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:16,770
yeah anyway what's electronic signage

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:19,350
for okay so this is going to be an

00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:23,820
interesting sort of thing because I've

00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:25,859
decided based this session on a song

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,720
which is 50 ways to leave your lover by

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,099
Paul Simon and I only realized the other

00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,470
day when i was typing in the year into

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:35,660
itunes and stuff that it's actually 1975

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:38,340
song and everything so who's Paul Simon

00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:41,989
hands up who's heard of Paul Simon ah

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:44,520
there we go fantastic okay that's good

00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:45,660
okay so we'll get to the song i was

00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,329
playing through the video before were

00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:49,500
just so it's refreshed in your memory

00:00:47,329 --> 00:00:54,210
i'm managing director glow digital

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:55,770
there's my contact info this is a new

00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,210
branding our new website that went up

00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,739
last night and everything we've got a

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,120
guy talking about responsive design so

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,829
we figured gee we better have a

00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,409
responsive site by the time drupalcon

00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:06,659
comes around so check it out sometime

00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:10,130
we're also sponsoring coffee haha and

00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,479
you must is my little my little spiel

00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:15,060
you must enter our competition to win an

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,909
ipad mini as well so to do that you have

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,380
to look in your program guide and do the

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,790
appropriate folding to make that

00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,950
response to make the our little program

00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,470
a tad responsive you'll get the gist of

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,790
it and there's a QR code on the cups

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,780
that you have to take a piccy off to

00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,100
enter okay I like music tennis and

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,299
photography and that is a rock in my

00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,299
backyard there you go

00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:44,450
why not okay so 10 ways to cost Drupal

00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,190
projects now there are a million ways to

00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,990
cost them and really it's not so much

00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:50,870
about the costing it's about the

00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:53,630
situations that you encounter that you

00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:55,040
have to interpret and then work out or

00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:57,350
how the heck am I going to approach this

00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,070
so really it's kind of more like 10

00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:02,930
situations that you need to come up with

00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:05,570
a costing in with various different

00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:07,610
conditions so it's really what my 10

00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:11,060
lines of the song cover so we'll get to

00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:13,940
the song in a minute the 10 ways are

00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:17,209
listed thus and I'm going to go into

00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:19,220
these in some detail you can just read

00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:20,330
that for yourself but a fair bit of

00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,040
material to go through i'm not quite

00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,910
sure how long it'll take so i might

00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,470
speed up or slow down and any questions

00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,060
probably will wait to the end and

00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,920
believe i try to leave a fair bit of

00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,600
time at the end for some some questions

00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,190
and discussion and I'm interested in

00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,540
input from you as well because I'm sure

00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:41,000
okay we have to do the mandatory hands

00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,970
up thing okay so hands up who runs a

00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,370
drupal agency and develops websites for

00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,290
people great thank you very much it's

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,910
quite a few hands up who develops

00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:53,060
websites internally for their own

00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:55,040
company excellent fantastic so it's

00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:59,269
about sort of a almost a 50-50 there

00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:01,570
which is fantastic ok so the ten Mohs

00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:05,090
what's not covered lots and stuff so

00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:08,600
yeah by all means we'll have a bit of a

00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:13,459
discussion loader ok here he is in the

00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:17,630
70s scary stuff complete with the

00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:21,920
appropriate mo this is a more recent

00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:24,470
shot of Paul Simon and I was playing the

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,200
music before but look I'll play a little

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:29,390
bit now and I have to rewind here always

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,620
dangerous playing video from within

00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:32,620
PowerPoint isn't

00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:38,530
I'm gonna move it along

00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:55,840
the problem is all inside your head she

00:03:51,280 --> 00:04:00,040
said to me yes was easy if you take

00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:03,670
androgyny I'd like to help you you're

00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:06,220
struggling to be free there was big 50

00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:09,280
ways to leave your lover it's me that is

00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:13,209
pickney wife she said it's really not my

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:16,539
habit to intrude furthermore haha

00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:20,049
meaning that allows Thomas Kostroun so I

00:04:16,539 --> 00:04:24,470
repair myself at the risk of being

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:27,190
through the must be fifty ones too

00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:27,190
about the course

00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:59,120
just don't need a guitar okay so that'll

00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:00,710
do for now okay we're going to hear

00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:04,130
snippets of that again in a minute so

00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:06,620
I'm with the ten ways okay so what I've

00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:09,200
got here is for each of the ten ways to

00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,870
cost the project I've got a little line

00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:15,470
of the song so let's see if this

00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:20,540
actually works again very brave doing

00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:26,900
powerpoint from mega new plans here i go

00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:29,450
make a new plan stan okay that's the

00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,340
short name the long name for way number

00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,840
one is entire project from conception

00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:36,050
using a methodology with a paid

00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:38,000
discovery phase okay a few problems are

00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,140
already what are those terms and I want

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,270
to spend a bit of time and some of these

00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:44,120
terms because it's critical to how we're

00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:46,700
going to approach this thing okay so a

00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,820
project from conception means that you

00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,260
start at the beginning where the client

00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,910
in theory has an idea of what they want

00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,590
to achieve and they probably have lots

00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:57,830
of lots of suggestions about how to

00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:59,480
achieve things and I'm sure you'll agree

00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,250
that projects from conception of

00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,669
projects that everyone loves you know

00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:06,830
okay who would developers here please

00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:09,710
lots of developers and everything is

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:11,990
there any type of project that you love

00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:17,660
more than a new project from conception

00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:19,100
any hands oh really support of fantastic

00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,890
yeah there you go very important support

00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:26,720
but most people like new stuff green

00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:29,570
fields but also company owners like

00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,850
projects from conception because they

00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:36,140
tend to be a bit larger I guess has the

00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:38,330
whole gets old team involved and project

00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:38,540
managers like them because again they

00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,730
get

00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,470
to work with Greenfield developers love

00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:47,060
them because yeah the world's their

00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:52,790
oyster and really everyone likes the

00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:55,430
idea of conception I think okay but a

00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:59,300
few projects really are from conception

00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:03,470
really it's very rare that you'll find

00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:05,240
that client comes to you and says I've

00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:08,270
got this wad of money I want to give to

00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:10,910
you can you please create a plan for me

00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:17,570
with using your best practice and just

00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:18,980
make it happen well at least in my

00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,530
experience that's kind of really usually

00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:25,460
they come up with you know you go okay

00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:27,590
we'll get to that so in reality really

00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:29,210
they come to you with with a list of

00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,940
things that they need they come to you

00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:33,860
with solutions for their problems and

00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:37,850
everything so they say right I need a

00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:40,520
blog I need a an event management system

00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:44,480
or something like that and you really

00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:45,950
have to say whoa they're busy stop and

00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,080
we'll find out actually what your

00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,640
business problems are in order to be

00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,650
able to solve those so you've really got

00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,570
to find out you've really got to get

00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:56,480
past what they think the project is

00:07:53,570 --> 00:08:00,680
about and and really reassess that

00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:03,680
yourself they might come to you with

00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,260
some design ideas okay one more show of

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,110
hands here and I promise not to try not

00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:11,750
to do any more after this who has had a

00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:15,980
client who has strong opinions about the

00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:19,550
design okay everyone it's got to be

00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:21,620
that's very impressive and often

00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:24,590
designers will tell you user experience

00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:26,090
wilt experts will tell you that really

00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:28,250
they have to go back to the start as

00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,300
well and ask the client or really what

00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:32,900
are your goals what are we trying to

00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,640
achieve so really oh and the

00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,260
functionality needed as well the client

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,630
you know has a list of things that they

00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,289
want you to implement of course and then

00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:46,290
you really need to unlearn all

00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:47,910
things using methodology so methodology

00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,949
is guideline system for solving a

00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:52,410
problem with specific components such as

00:08:49,949 --> 00:08:56,490
phases tasks methods techniques and

00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:58,980
tools the reason I'm going to this level

00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:01,110
on a methodology is because it's really

00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,970
really critical that you understand that

00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:05,730
you have a methodology and that you

00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,620
understand it well enough to be able to

00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,959
quote for your projects or well because

00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:12,120
the quote depends very much on your

00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:16,199
methodology in the case of Greenfields

00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,850
projects typical steps in a methodology

00:09:16,199 --> 00:09:20,639
sort of these days it's hard to find

00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:23,329
information on methodologies because

00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,110
people think that their secrets and

00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:27,149
don't want to give it to the competition

00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,259
and what have you so really if you look

00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,980
it up on the web it's kind of hard to

00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:33,449
find but these are some typical steps

00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:35,279
discovery phase content strategy stuff

00:09:33,449 --> 00:09:37,589
and design construction lines

00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,690
post-launch so those things are about

00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:42,029
design is typically sort of you know

00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:44,009
your project brief work out your goals

00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:47,130
you might have some stakeholder

00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:49,440
interviews do some user research user

00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:53,550
types goals personas scenarios

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,579
potentially and reviews as well so

00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:58,050
review the existing site review the

00:09:55,579 --> 00:10:01,649
marketing strategy review the branding

00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,850
review the competition discovery phase

00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:04,920
the reason I wanted to go into such

00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:09,180
detail on that is because it is critical

00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:11,399
for greenfield projects your content

00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:15,329
strategy typically that'll be you know

00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:19,019
information architecture ie sitemap and

00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:22,350
other stuff wireframe diagrams may be

00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:23,910
responsive layouts breakpoints etcetera

00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:27,000
implementation strategy which is how you

00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:29,100
put things together in Drupal design

00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,560
will typically be user experience stuff

00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:35,459
maybe Photoshop layouts if you still use

00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:38,220
that style tiles it's really interesting

00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:40,939
concept I know from anyone here from

00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:45,620
phase two it's a person if you notice

00:10:40,939 --> 00:10:50,750
style Tilly s which spelled style tiles

00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:53,730
it's a fascinating concept for

00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,769
preventing you from needing to come up

00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:57,510
with an entire website design in

00:10:55,769 --> 00:11:00,089
photoshop you can just really come out

00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:01,980
with a sort of the design elements a

00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:05,010
little bit like if you go shopping you

00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:06,600
know in a bathroom sales store or

00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,550
something you basically grab attire you

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,589
put next to some material next to some

00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:12,510
carpet and stuff it's a top concept

00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:17,639
developed by someone whose name I forget

00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:20,100
used to work for phase 2 technology okay

00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:23,250
so design construction will be building

00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,820
the site okay that's what most people

00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:28,410
here actually knows something about

00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:32,570
launching it setting up database server

00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:36,089
CD and potentially deployment

00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:38,430
documentation training go live etc and

00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:41,250
post launch stuff which is a gamut a

00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:44,430
variety of things including your

00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:48,690
promotional activities support and

00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:52,829
maintenance contract or SLA a review of

00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:55,880
both the project process and the the

00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:58,740
outcomes measure the outcomes metrics

00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:03,269
and potentially continued education as

00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:05,100
well so the typical steps but it and as

00:12:03,269 --> 00:12:07,079
I said before you it's pretty hard to

00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,230
actually find examples from the internet

00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:11,970
but here's one I don't know this company

00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:14,730
created stride anyone heard them they're

00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:21,240
in the States somewhere yeah you have

00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:22,740
Ryan you've heard of everything but this

00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,819
this was good I thought because this did

00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,019
have those elements I don't know if you

00:12:23,819 --> 00:12:26,370
can sort of read that properly but it

00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,600
has a lot of that stuff that I was just

00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:30,720
that are talking about in a slightly

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,319
note slightly different words but very

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,389
important elements all of those while

00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:38,339
the way the slides for this session and

00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:40,980
all sessions are going to be made

00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:44,000
available on the website all in one

00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:47,819
batch together presumably sometime

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,170
tomorrow here's another one envision

00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:51,060
interactive I don't know these companies

00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:52,709
but these are the only couple that I

00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:57,779
could really find that actually listed a

00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:59,880
bit about their methodology and one more

00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:01,319
as well so methodology you know what

00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,670
I've talked about so far in terms of

00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:04,649
methodology has been sort of a pretty

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,420
comprehensive sort of thing here's one

00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:06,899
that is a little bit on the other end of

00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,360
the scale

00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:10,619
from Nick's sight step one ask yourself

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,990
what am I really trying to achieve step

00:13:10,619 --> 00:13:16,019
two step three step four that's it cute

00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:18,029
so really a methodology is whatever you

00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:19,889
decide is going to be your working

00:13:18,029 --> 00:13:21,660
practice to get things done and that is

00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:23,579
up to you that's not the topic of this

00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,100
talk the topic of this talk is how to

00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:29,790
cost how to put a price on what you're

00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:32,819
going to be asking for and I'm still

00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:34,769
explaining the term the the meaning

00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:36,899
behind that make it make new plans that

00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:39,149
stand with the pay discovery phase so

00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:42,059
before we talked about the discovery

00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:45,029
phase having various components and that

00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:46,800
the idea is that it uncovers enough

00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:51,360
information to plan and cost the project

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:53,939
properly and of course the actual steps

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,529
in the discovery phase are probably

00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:57,240
going to include some of the things I

00:13:55,529 --> 00:14:00,749
mentioned before but it will depend on

00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:03,980
how you go about doing your projects and

00:14:00,749 --> 00:14:08,519
some people call it other things a study

00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:10,189
a project evaluation and a scoping of

00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:13,309
the terms that I've heard before a

00:14:10,189 --> 00:14:13,309
scoping exercise

00:14:15,569 --> 00:14:30,160
okay don't we just have that one right

00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:33,339
so the big advantage with I guess having

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:36,999
a green fields project with a paid

00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:39,490
discovery phase is that it gives you a

00:14:36,999 --> 00:14:42,519
huge opportunity to actually discover

00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:46,540
what the project is about without making

00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:49,660
a significant expenditure you'll see in

00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:51,189
a minute the second way to quote

00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,110
projects is very similar to the first

00:14:51,189 --> 00:14:54,910
way but there's no paid discovery phase

00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:56,920
in other words the client comes to you

00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,600
and says hey we want to cite give us a

00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,860
full proposal and you really have to

00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,439
kind of make guesses we'll get to that

00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:04,120
in a minute so the advantage is that we

00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:06,129
know what the project's about and then

00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:09,309
really we cost it in two phases the

00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:12,059
first phase being we recharge or quote

00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:14,319
the client for the discovery phase only

00:15:12,059 --> 00:15:15,550
once they're happy with that we

00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:17,709
understand what the project is about

00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:19,180
it's much easier to quote the rest of

00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:25,149
the project of course there's just

00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:27,459
common common sense really okay so will

00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:28,720
the client pay for a discovery phase and

00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,399
you know I've lost a slide here I was

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,500
editing these the other day there's one

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:36,670
more thing I wanted to say and I'll find

00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:38,470
the reference later one of the names for

00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,750
the discovery phase was a project

00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:43,449
evaluation and I'll post this link off

00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:47,980
it's the slides and post it post an

00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:49,959
updated version there's a great story or

00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:53,920
maybe it's actually coming up there you

00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:55,889
know see it's coming up there it is this

00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:03,189
is a great article it's just fantastic

00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:04,990
and it's about project proposals so just

00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:08,160
forgive me I'll just read this it's it's

00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:10,689
a fascinating thing this is posted on on

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,540
smashing magazine after several grueling

00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:15,550
days I'd finally finish the proposal

00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:17,290
tell me if you relate to this I sent it

00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:19,120
off and waited for response nothing

00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:21,059
after a few weeks I discovered that they

00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,079
were just looking in inverted commas

00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:25,269
despite the urgency and aggressive

00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:26,350
timeline for the RFP plus the fact that

00:16:25,269 --> 00:16:28,840
we had done business with this

00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:31,180
organization before the project was a no

00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:34,090
go my days of effort were weren't

00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:35,440
entirely what were wasted not entirely

00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:37,270
though because the pain of that loss was

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,750
enough to drive me to decide that it

00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:45,430
wouldn't happen again holy moly who's

00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:46,840
been there yeah okay lots of hands this

00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:51,190
is a great article I really encourage

00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:53,890
you to read that and there it is

00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:56,380
actually stop writing project proposals

00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:58,210
and my subtitle is start writing

00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:00,580
evaluation so they call that discovery

00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:04,320
phase a project evaluation and they

00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:06,900
charge the client for it marvelous idea

00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:10,000
will they pay for it that's the question

00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:12,910
my comments are if they're serious about

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:16,390
the project they'll pay for it if they

00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:18,190
really want you know someone who if they

00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:19,960
want a half-baked solution they should

00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:24,340
simply ask for you know an entire

00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:26,320
project from conception vessel parmo was

00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:27,960
here just before popped his head in and

00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,550
stuff he was talking about agile

00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:35,200
processes and that was really really

00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:36,910
interesting he was saying that agile

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,760
processes are really great especially

00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:40,840
for large projects for smaller projects

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,840
you can kind of plan the whole thing

00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,520
through and things tend not to go wrong

00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,680
or if they do go wrong they don't have

00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,040
such an impact large projects something

00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:53,770
goes wrong they have big impacts so

00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:55,620
wouldn't your client really don't any

00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,880
the head read if they don't actually

00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:00,040
take the project seriously and do an

00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,880
initial study before going any further

00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:09,430
and the other thing is do they want them

00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:13,350
if they don't pay for it hmm okay so

00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:13,350
options for costing the discovery phase

00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:19,750
there's lots of ways to do this you can

00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:22,060
have a standard cost in theory so you

00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,920
could just say right my typical website

00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:26,170
size is such and such and you can say

00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,640
right two grand two grand a pop or

00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:32,590
something if most your projects are

00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:34,060
similar you could say variable cost sort

00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,310
of based on your feel for the project

00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:38,620
size now this would feel I wanted to put

00:18:36,310 --> 00:18:40,110
in inverted commas because that's

00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,270
surprisingly important

00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:45,809
in these matters and we'll get back to

00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:49,530
that in a minute maybe a percentage of

00:18:45,809 --> 00:18:50,850
the estimated project size chicken and

00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:52,559
the egg there how do you work out how

00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:55,440
big your project is before you kind of

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:57,770
find out about it feel has something to

00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,270
do with that just chatting to the client

00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:01,740
and potentially go all the way and

00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,510
actually do a detailed costing fee

00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,970
discovery phase so there's lots of

00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:07,559
options there often you know in the

00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:09,120
first couple of minutes of talking to a

00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:11,700
client you will get a feel for how big a

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,860
project is and you can sort of say you

00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,410
could actually present a price with with

00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:18,210
conditions saying you know for a typical

00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:21,690
project that is going to take you know

00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:23,490
120 hours or something to to work on you

00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,169
know be charged this much if it turns

00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:29,520
out to be more than this will charge

00:19:25,169 --> 00:19:33,530
this much more for the extra hmm pretty

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:38,160
easy now I wanted to talk about feel

00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:39,840
feel is important in these ways to work

00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,020
out the overall project size as I said

00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:47,460
to work out what the client is going to

00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:53,390
be likely to deal with three to work out

00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:53,390
what they're likely to pay and it's all

00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:59,190
also when you look at the Smashing

00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:01,650
Magazine article check out comment1 47

00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:03,000
as well it's really pertinent and in

00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:06,179
fact I'm going to read this one as well

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,620
I don't have it up here but it goes like

00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:12,840
it says this I've been in this industry

00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:14,940
17 years and have had similar issues we

00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,679
now don't bother with rfps and now I'm

00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,600
very bold when someone needs three to

00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:21,570
five quotes I asked in advance if

00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:23,910
they're getting competitive bids I asked

00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,950
if I get to address the decision makers

00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:28,110
I explain this as a relationship not a

00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:30,150
one-time service and let them know it

00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:32,700
can take one to two days to engineer a

00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:35,010
quote I asked point-blank if they are

00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:38,820
serious about doing business with me if

00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:40,260
it feels right feel and without question

00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,929
my intuition is usually correct

00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,970
hopefully that comes after experience I

00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:48,480
decide to create the proposal or to turn

00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:51,059
it down so this feel thing is really

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,330
important because for this guy the feel

00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:57,560
of whether a client you

00:20:53,330 --> 00:21:02,120
sounds right fought for him the decision

00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:04,040
depends on field Wow okay also I saw an

00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,540
interview of Mark Bolton on Berg world

00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:09,290
and for the life of me I really can't

00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:10,880
find it now it was a podcast and he was

00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:13,100
saying that his relationship Matt

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:17,360
Bouldin by the way is the guy who helped

00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:20,540
redesign Drupal homepage for Drupal 7

00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:23,660
was it 7 yeah current current version

00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:25,610
anyone heard of Mark Bolton think he

00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,800
designed the he redesigned the logo and

00:21:25,610 --> 00:21:33,320
everything yeah tough job with a bunch

00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:34,730
of developers and his opinion was yet

00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,530
that relate his relationship with the

00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:38,120
client he has to feel right and

00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,920
everything and if it doesn't he actually

00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,650
knocks them back which is kind of hard

00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:44,420
if you need the money but often you're

00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:46,820
you're better off actually not entering

00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:48,320
into a bad relationship in the first

00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:52,430
place if you know it's not going to be

00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:55,790
good I'll give you another example as

00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:59,510
well a feel just because I think feel is

00:21:55,790 --> 00:22:01,280
so important one of our we have client

00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:02,930
in when Brisbane one of our clients

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,610
staff change so the person we dealt with

00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:08,780
on this system that we had developed in

00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:12,800
2008 changed and we dealt with the new

00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:14,150
person for enhancements and support and

00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,660
interestingly enough when the site

00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:18,860
needed some particular enhancements that

00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,930
our new client didn't want to tell us

00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,790
what their budget was instead they

00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:27,500
hinted that they were considering sort

00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:30,770
of outsourcing to China which gave me a

00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:34,400
very bad feel because we pride ourselves

00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:37,880
on high quality development and you know

00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,230
good quality processes we have permanent

00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,450
staff you know in the office during

00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,650
office hours that they can talk to and

00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:45,740
we can go around and see the client

00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:48,050
everything so really that started to

00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:50,420
feel like a bad match with the client

00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:54,200
and the jury's still out about what will

00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:58,640
happen there so my point feel is

00:22:54,200 --> 00:23:00,060
important okay now one thing I didn't

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:08,490
test before I came on board

00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:10,800
it was whether my little bit yes yeah

00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:15,270
well I think that goes to experience to

00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:17,760
be honest it's absolutely you know and

00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:20,190
and the feel that you get really once

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,020
once you get burned yeah you really you

00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,670
really get a feel for that situation

00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:30,570
again and you don't make the same

00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:32,400
mistake twice okay so yeah thanks thanks

00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,540
for the question and feel free to chime

00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:47,310
in I reckon that'll make it more

00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:49,740
interactive yep how do you sell it to

00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:51,240
them yeah I think you really need to

00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,730
actually list out all of the benefits

00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,840
for your own for your own mind and

00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:57,120
everything with respect to your

00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,250
methodology so I would actually make

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,360
sure that a I know my methodology and

00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:03,860
everything and be I know what the

00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:06,560
advantages are you know and you can also

00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:11,490
come to a couple of sessions tomorrow

00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:13,500
there's a session by philippe rubem and

00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:15,630
another one by David calc Holly about

00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:17,070
dealing with government and dealing with

00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:19,200
corporate clients and stuff that

00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:21,000
actually talks a little bit about that

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,130
so i would actually yeah work that out

00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,360
and make sure you got a cheat sheet so

00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:25,770
when you talk to them you can actually

00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,510
do it I know that's not really answering

00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:34,650
a question but it really does depend on

00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:40,260
on how it works um ok now the one thing

00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:44,390
I didn't test here was my google dog

00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:44,390
which is not working

00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:51,010
oh no that's it that's an image I really

00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:54,010
wanted to kind of go through it so

00:24:51,010 --> 00:25:01,420
basically if we put it over here oh

00:24:54,010 --> 00:25:10,720
there it is fantastic um okay so if I to

00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:12,310
swap back to my slide right now you can

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,630
follow along if you wish if you got a

00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:15,040
laptop there you can actually go and

00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,780
have a look at this or you can do it

00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:19,540
later it's a Google spreadsheet so it's

00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:22,510
multi user access and I've made this

00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:26,640
publicly accessible well actually want

00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:29,290
it to go through a bit of an example of

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:33,880
what you can actually do to come up with

00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:35,380
a costing for the discovery phase so I

00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,990
guess it's sort of related to to your

00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:41,170
question as well first of all at the top

00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:44,560
are you and if you could when you go

00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:45,970
into it you'll get a little purple or

00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,350
different color and everything so if you

00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:51,610
cannot move around too much it won't

00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:52,930
distract from where I'm pointing okay so

00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:55,150
you got your bright card there you got

00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:56,620
your different you're different people

00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:58,330
and you feel free to actually copy this

00:25:56,620 --> 00:26:00,220
as well from from where it is you've got

00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,960
your different roles you may not have as

00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:05,080
many or you may have more role as you

00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:07,420
can change the rights etc you have to

00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,180
decide on a contingency figure there and

00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:12,520
a project management overhead and then

00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:15,460
you work out basically what your steps

00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:18,010
in your methodology any discovery phase

00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:19,660
are so you might have a project brief

00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:21,880
you know which uses a project manager

00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:25,780
resource at 100 bucks an hour they'll

00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:27,460
take two hours yeah good luck with a

00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:29,710
cost of two hundred dollars so the same

00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,930
thing for the other roles you know for

00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:35,920
these different steps fill in your own

00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:38,200
methodology you need to add some sort of

00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,910
contingency offer obviously so you know

00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,740
I've chosen ten percent there is a round

00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:46,630
number but you could be fifty percent on

00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:48,370
a small thing like this maybe and a

00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:50,620
project management fee i always

00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:52,630
recommend to add those two items you

00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,580
know both contingency figure and a

00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:56,140
project management fee because project

00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,179
management fee the idea behind these

00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:59,750
here is you're putting in the hours that

00:26:58,179 --> 00:27:01,970
the actual

00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:03,230
work is going to take so if there was a

00:27:01,970 --> 00:27:05,390
development phase ii and we'll get to

00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:10,420
that that the hours that the developer

00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:16,090
has estimated probably x 1.5 or two if

00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:20,120
if it's like other developers I know

00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:22,520
okay so we have those and out pops at

00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,560
the bottom total so we're also

00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,780
separating it into optional components

00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,930
so here in this methodology we've got

00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:32,480
eight hours optionally of advanced user

00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:36,020
research which might be some user

00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:39,860
testing or it might be user personas and

00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:41,690
scenarios for example and often the

00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:44,570
client mail may not want to want to want

00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:46,250
to participate in that particular option

00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:48,290
it's always also read it another

00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:50,930
interesting article that talks about how

00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:53,000
it's great to give clients options okay

00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:54,650
you give them like a vanilla version you

00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,680
give them sort of a medium version and

00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:59,600
you give them up say super duper version

00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,130
and they can pick their options and for

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,510
some reason it just makes the client

00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:04,340
feel better because if there are budget

00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:06,650
conscious person they probably go for

00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:07,910
the for the low one if there's someone

00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:09,560
who you know just wants the bee's knees

00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:11,240
up will go for the high one and if

00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,410
there's someone who is you know like

00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,090
quality but don't want to pay too much

00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:23,900
for it they'll probably go for the

00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:25,280
middle one okay there it is great okay

00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:28,730
so that's just a screen print of that

00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:30,260
you can go have a look at it once the

00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:32,570
discovery phase is complete then let's

00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:35,030
say assume they actually said yes we

00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:37,640
will pay for that and everyone was happy

00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:39,230
the advantage is that quoting the rest

00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,700
of the project becomes easy because you

00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:44,060
know all about what's going to be

00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:46,220
involved in that project and you've got

00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:49,070
the history with the client so that they

00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:50,690
have an immediate trust in you and to be

00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:52,190
honest you have the inside running on

00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:53,330
the competition should they actually

00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:55,940
decide that they want to go out to

00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:58,970
tender or RFP they'll invite you for

00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:00,320
sure if you did a good job and they'll

00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,240
invite maybe one or two other

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,800
organizations but you've got the inside

00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:09,770
running because you know them and they

00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:11,330
have their trust in you so okay what if

00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:13,630
you method I said your methodology could

00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:18,350
be anything what if it's agile

00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:21,770
and was there any did anyone attend vesa

00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:23,660
polymers talk before year great was

00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:25,730
interesting that I was speaking to him

00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:28,190
afterwards as well and I said you know

00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:31,100
how sorted do you really have the

00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:34,400
costing of the agile process and he said

00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:36,380
about fifty percent so I'm glad that you

00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,750
know someone who touts a lot of

00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:41,299
experience with agile methodology really

00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:43,040
hasn't got the got the quoting quite

00:29:41,299 --> 00:29:45,410
worked out yet and there I saw a tweet

00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,630
from him some time ago that he's

00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:50,450
thinking about it which is great I also

00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:54,260
saw a tweet today from Justin Fremen you

00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:57,380
yeah no he's not here agile where and

00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:59,270
Canberra Drupal shot down there and he

00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:02,570
suggested maybe you charged by the

00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:03,919
sprint okay so if you have a weak sprint

00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:06,010
or something with you know three

00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,720
developers or something like that

00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:09,830
potentially charged by the sprint and it

00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,510
sounds like a pretty good idea we

00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:13,669
haven't done that before but I'd be

00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:15,860
interested in hearing anyone who has

00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:18,860
worked that out of course you'd have to

00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:21,679
actually sell the process to the client

00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:24,610
first sell them and Vessa talked about

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:24,610
that Xena

00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:48,340
yeah so for the audio recording you come

00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:50,780
up here and talk into my neck please

00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:58,130
would you say again you've my it's

00:30:50,780 --> 00:31:00,650
checked in me ah yeah okay for projects

00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:02,150
that generally cost a bit more yeah look

00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,500
I'm showing you figures here and

00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:05,299
everything and look they're very they're

00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,770
totally made up sort of figures you know

00:31:05,299 --> 00:31:08,750
I don't know what you charge is an

00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:12,230
hourly rate in Sydney it's bound to be

00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:13,970
more higher cost of living it'll depend

00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:17,950
on how big an agency you are as well

00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:23,270
yeah so sudden your own figures in um

00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:24,770
okay um and yeah I like the idea of

00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:28,460
charging by the sprint and sounds very

00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:32,299
consistent with with that okay so just

00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:34,820
as a as a bit of a summary then that

00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:37,850
slides doing there as a summary I reckon

00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:40,280
this number one making you plan stan is

00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:42,950
a pretty good option and this is by far

00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,539
my favorite way to work because it's a

00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:46,669
greenfield thing everyone likes the

00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:50,270
project you can use your most recent

00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:51,710
methodology and you know what the what

00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:53,840
the projects about the risk is very low

00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:58,640
for you and the client to be honest to

00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:00,320
be fair okay and number two I've cheated

00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,549
with the first two because i'm using the

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:13,030
same line from the song because they're

00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:13,030
so similar and that's not working

00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:23,410
I was considering that would you believe

00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:25,570
but no so this is similar entire project

00:32:23,410 --> 00:32:27,340
from conception it's the same using the

00:32:25,570 --> 00:32:30,400
dollar that same with no pay discovery

00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:32,049
phone with no paid discovery phase so in

00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,880
other words they want an upfront quote I

00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:36,190
should clarify here as well these first

00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,290
2 i'm actually talking really about a

00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:40,390
process where the client sort of comes

00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:43,570
to you with some sort of brief or maybe

00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:46,240
an RFQ or request for quotation maybe an

00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:47,620
RFP request for proposals so there that

00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:53,080
sort of things I'm going to talk about

00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:55,090
ten dozen minute okay so without a paid

00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:59,350
discovery phase what time do we start by

00:32:55,090 --> 00:33:02,620
the way we start quarter to holy moly

00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:05,049
better get gone okay we have much less

00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:06,549
information or as we know errant

00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:09,309
information because we haven't had that

00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:11,650
the opportunity to talk to the client

00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:13,059
about what the project is about it's no

00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:14,950
guarantee of getting paid for the work

00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:16,480
so basically you need to practice out

00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:19,299
into your charges you have to make a

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,160
bunch of assumptions because you're

00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:23,140
making estimates you probably have to

00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,090
increase that ten percent contingency

00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:27,490
figure which will increase the bottom

00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:30,130
line costs for the client and the client

00:33:27,490 --> 00:33:32,200
RG everyone's had this you know they

00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:34,360
come to you with a Wimpy request for a

00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,700
website and everything and if they go to

00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:39,460
ten agencies they'll get you know 12

00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,890
answers about and how are they going to

00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:43,090
compare those proposals because there'll

00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:46,720
be four totally different systems

00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:48,070
because I haven't specified it okay so

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,080
you'll have to decide whether you want

00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:51,520
to be part of that really and the risk

00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,820
is that you'll spend significant time

00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:56,919
and you won't get paid for that time the

00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,240
self-fulfilling prophecy party is okay

00:33:56,919 --> 00:33:59,980
if I'm not going to get paid for the

00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:04,419
time I'm not going to put the time in

00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:07,210
there for I won't win the bid so it's a

00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:12,070
tricky thing some projects are probably

00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:15,429
worth it and my recommendation would

00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:18,300
simply to be bother you gut feel not

00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:22,030
your heart now the reason I say that

00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,830
very briefly is because know there's a

00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,659
project just in the last year that I

00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:26,909
followed my heart

00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:28,799
it was a great cause and everything it

00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:30,419
didn't quite stack up in the start but

00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:32,039
you know I was talking to the CEO I

00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:33,839
wasn't talking to the actual board which

00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:35,399
were the stakeholders but it was such a

00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:37,559
great cause I thought I'll just you know

00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:39,869
put in for this and I'll show them I

00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:41,940
won't respond to what they ask where

00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:47,730
I'll tell them what they really need bad

00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:50,639
move anyway okay so an example of

00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:57,890
accosting without a discovery phase will

00:34:50,639 --> 00:35:00,210
move to the next sheet where is it there

00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:02,460
okay the entire project it's a very

00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:04,230
similar sort of spreadsheet to the last

00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,789
one we've still got a discovery phase

00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:07,319
but we've got to include a whole bunch

00:35:05,789 --> 00:35:08,940
of other things now so will include all

00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:11,099
our methodology and we've got to make

00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:13,410
some sort of guesses there notice how

00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:15,720
how broad this is here when I when I

00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:17,339
work out well how much are we going to

00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:21,299
sort of spend on actually building the

00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:24,990
site you've got to kind of have broad

00:35:21,299 --> 00:35:28,380
guesses here and but down the bottom you

00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:29,970
still come out with some titles okay so

00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:41,190
that's one way to actually do it yeah

00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:43,559
feel free to look at that later okay so

00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:45,420
the verdict on the nope a discovery

00:35:43,559 --> 00:35:47,190
phase at the beginning is try to get

00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:48,839
paid for discovery phase in my opinion

00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:53,490
yeah it just makes it so much harder but

00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:55,950
you can't always um okay number three

00:35:53,490 --> 00:36:03,299
let's see if we can get this little clip

00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:04,920
going beautiful I'm on the bus yes okay

00:36:03,299 --> 00:36:07,260
so I hope on the bus gasps that means

00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:10,069
the whole project is in motion and you

00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:12,720
have to run alongside and jump jump in

00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:15,380
meaning that you're asked to develop a

00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,990
site based on designs existing designs

00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:20,339
or wire frames or prototype or maybe

00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:21,630
someones actually commenced the build

00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:23,940
and you have to come in and help them or

00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,380
take over or something like that much of

00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,299
the planning is actually done you don't

00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:29,099
get a choice in that whole bunch of

00:36:27,299 --> 00:36:30,240
caveats come in here notice how it with

00:36:29,099 --> 00:36:31,859
this costing thing i'm actually not

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,380
talking that much about costing and

00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:35,430
fetus i'm talking about situations

00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,150
really hear that you have to watch out

00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:38,970
for when

00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:43,020
approaches to them so you got to watch

00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:45,839
for all of these things design missing

00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:50,089
page designs vector design files holy

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:53,460
moly print designers do not understand

00:36:50,089 --> 00:36:55,619
vector and raster doesn't matter how you

00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,119
drum it into them so you just say right

00:36:55,619 --> 00:37:01,319
we want photoshop files we want to

00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:03,359
negotiate on in design that you do

00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:06,359
designers and developers out there will

00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:08,760
understand that one or they'll give you

00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:11,579
wireframes we did an interesting project

00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:15,270
recently a design agency got a big

00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:16,950
government job in Queensland they didn't

00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:19,829
have any capability to actually fulfill

00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:22,140
it so they got us to do it but they

00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:23,490
mocked up the life roams in axia I think

00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:26,400
that's how you pronounce it aksha even

00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:28,500
anyone used that aksha it's a pretty

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,940
expensive at all but it's actually

00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:31,260
pretty jolly good and gives you

00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,210
interactive wireframes that actually

00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,200
work and do links in it and menus and

00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:37,500
all sorts of stuff it's pretty

00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:39,539
interesting but they're in lied a bit of

00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:42,510
a caveat lay a bit of a Cavett caveat

00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:44,670
because wither with a working prototype

00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,289
like that that they control that's

00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:49,500
actually the specification how do you

00:37:46,289 --> 00:37:52,500
lock that down so what I did was

00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:54,210
actually got them to produce a PDF from

00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,670
it which did not have the interactivity

00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:58,680
and a few little we ended up with the

00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:02,700
feudal gotchas functionality we didn't

00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:07,799
realize was there so and all this really

00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:10,190
goes to being able to define what you

00:38:07,799 --> 00:38:12,930
what you're agreeing to fairly carefully

00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:14,309
in terms of mess look there's all sorts

00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:15,450
of things that can happen on a project

00:38:14,309 --> 00:38:17,309
that started already and you have to

00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:20,520
make this assessment before you go into

00:38:17,309 --> 00:38:22,740
it I think things like they haven't

00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:24,240
scoped the project well enough so what

00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:25,559
is being built and what you're asked to

00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,760
build is actually not with the client

00:38:25,559 --> 00:38:28,829
wants and will make them happy so

00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,980
therefore it's going to be a lose

00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:33,450
situation you probably don't want to be

00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,220
involved in that or you try to be

00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:39,119
proactive and actually redirect the

00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:40,799
project get it back on track but and

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:43,200
that particularly happens if the pro if

00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:45,589
the goals of the project have not been

00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,589
defined

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:52,630
the you the relationship with a client

00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:56,000
is is often messy and of course the old

00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:57,079
the old beauty insufficient budget if

00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,480
they don't really have the money and

00:38:57,079 --> 00:39:00,619
they want you to bring you on board do

00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,880
you really want to be part of it if they

00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:08,270
don't have enough money to pay to do it

00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:10,849
properly hmm um okay so what do you do

00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:14,420
you have to decide you could do a

00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:16,819
detailed costing you could I suggest

00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:18,710
always lock down the scope that's

00:39:16,819 --> 00:39:20,180
probably the most important thing work

00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,500
out who is responsible for what

00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:24,170
particularly when there's multiple

00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:27,280
organizations involved and define the

00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:29,660
conditions in a contract very important

00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,099
I'm going to skip through this the most

00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,109
important thing that's in the contract

00:39:31,099 --> 00:39:36,970
has got to be really the specification

00:39:33,109 --> 00:39:39,470
if you don't have that careful enough

00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:41,539
you're just asking for trouble and

00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:45,680
you're taking on a significant liability

00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:47,390
and a risk in terms of you know if

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,460
there's just a rough sort of wire frame

00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:51,079
or something of some functionality that

00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:52,670
can be interpreted different ways the

00:39:51,079 --> 00:39:54,920
client will interpret it to their

00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:57,529
advantage and potentially you would

00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:58,849
interpret it to your advantage so it's

00:39:57,529 --> 00:40:05,569
in everyone's interest to actually have

00:39:58,849 --> 00:40:07,880
it well defined move on have a look at

00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:09,650
some model contracts there's a few

00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:12,579
examples of some model contracts on the

00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:12,579
web there yet Ryan

00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:28,580
where's are you at the top yeah yeah I

00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,200
think I was looking at the contract that

00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:31,640
we actually use and it has a generic

00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,530
scope section sort of say this is a

00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,960
webcomic website development contract

00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:39,800
blah blah blah legal stuff and then in

00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:42,410
the in the vehicle that the addendum the

00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,700
schedule we actually define in more

00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:45,650
detail what it is and that usually

00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:48,650
refers to an external document which is

00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:49,940
like a specification document anyway and

00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:51,350
have a look at the resources there's

00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:53,300
some some good contracts out there I

00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:55,220
suggest you use a contract very

00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:56,480
important contract conditions and that

00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:58,040
was my coverage of contracts Ryan

00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:00,500
because you put their comment in the on

00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:03,740
the page that's it no time for anything

00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:06,200
else so the verdict for Mick method

00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:08,570
number three hop on the bus gus yeah can

00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:12,340
work okay but make sure the project is

00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:15,530
on a good footing would be my summary

00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:23,540
okay number 4 we're gonna really speed

00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:28,700
up now okay this one here don't need to

00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:32,960
be me okay just listen to me you will do

00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:34,520
it how I say you will do it tandas can

00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,290
be really prescriptive and often you

00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:39,680
don't get a choice really about how the

00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:41,360
thing works for example are the worst

00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,860
kind of prescriptive I'm sure everyone

00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,050
has done tenders have actually seen this

00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:47,120
the dreaded standardized CMS requirement

00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:49,490
list drupal actually handles these

00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,410
things fairly well and everything but

00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:53,300
man it takes you a long time to respond

00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:55,730
or not they won't be written for Drupal

00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:57,500
Pam Barone is going to have a great

00:41:55,730 --> 00:41:58,760
session tomorrow called rethink your

00:41:57,500 --> 00:42:03,070
requirements and it's all about

00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:05,240
fashioning your requirements around

00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:06,850
drupal and what it can do and often it's

00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:09,410
just a slight change of wording or a

00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:10,490
change in slight change of requirement

00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:12,950
that really doesn't mean anything to the

00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:16,840
client that will make some some hard

00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:19,130
thing simple yeah and you all know that

00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:21,890
so yeah these requirements this

00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:23,450
particular one was 111 requirements and

00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:27,740
that's not as bad as they get they get

00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:29,570
significantly worse and I just think

00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,370
they're really sucky to be honest

00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:34,270
because it's a cop-out for the client

00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:36,160
they simply don't have to think

00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:37,690
it's it's not related to their real

00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,490
comments why they want all this stuff

00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:42,460
because they think they might need it or

00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:44,890
something as you know PHP being

00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:46,750
interpretive adding lots and lots of

00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:48,190
extra modules you know you want to you

00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:50,200
want to make sure you put them in there

00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:52,000
for the right reasons because it's going

00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,850
to make your site slower or more heavy

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,200
anyway another in two ways you can deal

00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:58,870
with that but gee isn't the best way

00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:02,140
actually not having the problem in the

00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:04,510
first place and the suckiest reason I

00:43:02,140 --> 00:43:07,030
must say we wanna we want to attend a

00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:08,470
few years ago and the client said to me

00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:10,000
after and it had one of these big long

00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:11,680
lists and i responded to it and the

00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,270
client said to me after oh we didn't

00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,190
really mean that we just got that from

00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:17,140
we just bought that list of requirements

00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:18,850
so that we could pre qualify the vendors

00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:20,560
you know it's make sure that they knew

00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:26,290
what they're talking about yeah so

00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:28,780
that's not valuing the vendors time okay

00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:30,610
so what is a tender it's a structured

00:43:28,780 --> 00:43:33,370
invitation to vendors usually it's very

00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:35,230
formal and well organized and well

00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:37,150
intention and everything but can really

00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:39,430
be off the mark and stuff but as I said

00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:42,460
before if you give them something other

00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:44,620
than they asked with they might welcome

00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:47,020
it with open arms they might also

00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:51,820
disqualify you completely so it's a bit

00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:54,880
of a lucky dip there as well as being

00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:56,740
prescriptive there can obviously be at a

00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,640
significant investment involved tenders

00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:05,380
are usually quite large they only have

00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:08,350
one winner we again a couple of years

00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:11,260
ago applied for work cover queensland a

00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:14,830
nice high profile sort of sight we and

00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:16,780
and there was a second round so we got

00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:18,910
in the top three for the first round and

00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:22,630
then the next round was give us a demo

00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:24,550
system which is also kind of interesting

00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:25,930
and so we gave them what they said was

00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:27,970
the best team ever had and then they

00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:30,220
chose someone else which is kind of

00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:32,560
interesting base for a lot of reasons

00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:34,630
risk assessment as well look can be

00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,070
really important for tenders i'm not

00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:39,490
gonna have time to go over this but if

00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:41,860
seriously look up a SN zs iso 31000

00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:44,020
sounds really hard it's the Australian

00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:46,750
standard which has been adopted as the

00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:47,970
international standard now and it's very

00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:49,920
clear

00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:52,950
but you just have to go through certain

00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:55,890
steps such as have a risk management

00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:57,750
framework have a process and this is

00:44:55,890 --> 00:45:00,869
really probably the topic for another

00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:02,400
day I think but I've got a few notes in

00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:04,320
here that you can that you can look at

00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,480
the most important thing is the risk

00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:10,109
register which is really define all the

00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:11,820
things that could go wrong how important

00:45:10,109 --> 00:45:14,640
they are or how severe they're going to

00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:17,820
be and tell us how you're going to

00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:20,520
mitigate those risks and if you don't do

00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:25,140
that and one of your competitors does do

00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:27,570
that they will assume the worst of your

00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:31,160
your ability be able to cope with those

00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:31,160
risks because you haven't addressed them

00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:36,540
um and tenders are often difficult for

00:45:35,010 --> 00:45:39,359
small companies to be honest because

00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:40,800
they require some artwork and and

00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:42,420
everything and they sort of seemed to be

00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,160
sort of set up for larger companies

00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:46,590
particularly when government departments

00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:48,270
feel better about larger organization

00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:53,070
pouring larger organizations to do

00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:55,050
things yes and no but that's what I

00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:57,630
found certainly a couple of times from

00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:59,670
experience these days Drupal is much

00:45:57,630 --> 00:46:01,770
bigger it's much more well accepted in

00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:06,330
larger organizations and again we're

00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:07,410
going to hear about that tomorrow and of

00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:09,300
course there are partnership of

00:46:07,410 --> 00:46:11,839
opportunities with companies like queer

00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,839
and others

00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:19,370
any costume okay I think you have a

00:46:17,870 --> 00:46:21,080
detailed list again you've really got a

00:46:19,370 --> 00:46:22,970
sort of cost to work out what's going to

00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:26,690
be in that in that list and everything

00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:27,890
and use a similar sort of spreadsheet to

00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:29,990
what we had before but it's going to be

00:46:27,890 --> 00:46:31,670
much bigger simply because there are so

00:46:29,990 --> 00:46:33,020
many more things involved enjoyed your

00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:35,540
preparation time they're going to ask at

00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:38,420
least fun at least five probably ten

00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:40,550
organizations are going to submit they

00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:43,070
get the benefit of all that ten that the

00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:44,360
nine that actually miss out who put in

00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:46,490
the work and everything so I reckon they

00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:49,340
can they can be charged a bit more

00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:51,230
tenders tennery organizations also tend

00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:52,910
to be bigger projects they are less

00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:54,620
price sensitive but particularly these

00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:56,390
days in state government departments

00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:59,120
with governments being fairly strapped

00:46:56,390 --> 00:47:01,370
for cash they are after overall value

00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:03,320
for money so they really want good

00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:07,550
quality at a reasonable price doesn't

00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:08,600
have to be the lowest price though and

00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:09,950
there's lots of places that you can

00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:18,050
actually find tenders there's a few

00:47:09,950 --> 00:47:20,840
examples there um ok and that's my

00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:22,490
verdict on tenders then is they can be

00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:24,980
very worthwhile but think carefully

00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:30,070
before competing committing to the

00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:30,070
substantial work involved I would say

00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:42,030
okay the ballpark estimate we did start

00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:48,420
quarter to four didn't we okay is that

00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:51,090
right yep ballpark estimate is like gold

00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:54,030
because if you can actually give a quick

00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:55,710
ballpark estimate to a client instead of

00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:58,080
spending copia sounds it saves everyone

00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:59,700
a lot of time potential potentially so

00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,930
really my definition of the ballpark

00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:02,520
estimate is coming up with a number

00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:07,740
without putting in a heck of a lot of

00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:09,900
effort all these situations is when they

00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:12,900
can be handy and there's lots and lots

00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:15,180
of situations there for when to use a

00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:16,920
ballpark estimate again it's sort of

00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:18,570
related to this idea of you know feel

00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,060
you get a feel for the project a feel

00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:22,230
for the client to work out sort of how

00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,730
much a project is going to cost and

00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:25,500
often you can actually give them a

00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:27,810
ballpark answer that you think it's

00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:29,520
going to be riteish and they'll say it

00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:31,320
knows too much you know and that's it

00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:34,430
but you haven't spent a lot of time on

00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:38,250
it so great but we didn't have the

00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:44,960
didn't have the thingy did we no one

00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:47,100
told me you don't need to discuss my

00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,930
yeah which is really cool you don't need

00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:50,450
to discuss much on on those because you

00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:55,650
don't need to go into a detailed

00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:57,480
discovery phase okay how to make it a

00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:59,580
few ways you can compare to what you've

00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:04,410
done before you can use your feel again

00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:06,840
add up some rough costs and look at

00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:08,130
number six okay so verdict I love the

00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:11,550
bill Polk estimates because I reckon it

00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:13,320
just weeds things out okay this is

00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:16,440
probably the trickiest one high level

00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:19,530
function point counting my version that

00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:21,570
this function point county has been

00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:27,480
around for a very long time and it's all

00:49:21,570 --> 00:49:35,369
to do with basically sorry oh thank you

00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:40,020
thank you very much John oh just got off

00:49:35,369 --> 00:49:42,000
the key okay chop off the Keely now

00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:43,980
unfortunately here I shouldn't admit to

00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,210
this should I forget why this oil but

00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,760
this line on this one because I work

00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:51,150
this out like last year so I'm open to

00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,920
suggestions maybe it's the key yeah it's

00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:57,140
probably because it's the key to doing a

00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:59,670
quote for a really big complex project

00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:03,570
and I'll just brush over this really

00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:05,460
quickly so there's four steps really you

00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:08,640
classify high-level website functions

00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:10,950
okay so things like we need a business

00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:13,380
directory we need an event management

00:50:10,950 --> 00:50:15,720
system and we need some other stuff okay

00:50:13,380 --> 00:50:18,540
us site assign each of those terms in

00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:22,770
Drupal speak vocabulary terms and number

00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:24,060
so that's small sorry I'm actually not

00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:25,590
reading what I'm doing here so you've

00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:27,600
got small medium and large you classify

00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:31,320
so your business directory might be a

00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:34,230
large so you assign it a 9 and your blog

00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:38,820
will be a like a an easy a quicker small

00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:40,230
so you'll sign that sale one so the I

00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:43,320
won't go to the spreadsheet but

00:50:40,230 --> 00:50:45,060
basically here is where we put this

00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:48,170
together and we'll go to the spreadsheet

00:50:45,060 --> 00:50:48,170
because it's a bit complex

00:50:51,280 --> 00:51:00,020
function point counting that's the other

00:50:57,410 --> 00:51:06,410
thing is you can't be offline to look at

00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:09,050
these things can ya huh ok I'll run

00:51:06,410 --> 00:51:10,790
through this really quickly so we have a

00:51:09,050 --> 00:51:12,950
magnitude table small to medium large

00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:15,440
jobs and these are the the high level

00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:17,720
functions home page news galleries blogs

00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:20,500
competitions you classify them with a

00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:23,180
magnitude how big is that approximately

00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:26,480
from this table here we work out the

00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:27,950
number of units of work and we add them

00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:30,320
up at the bottom is a total number of

00:51:27,950 --> 00:51:32,450
units of work 49 so I'm going through

00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:36,050
this really quickly so therefore that

00:51:32,450 --> 00:51:38,540
translates at what was it for three or

00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:43,040
four hours per unit of work to 147 hours

00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:45,440
you add on your project management costs

00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:48,980
and I forgot contingency oh there it is

00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:51,500
fantastic and hey presto at the bottom

00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:53,210
you get a number now this is kind of

00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:55,040
like your ballpark estimate for a

00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:58,070
humongous project where you don't want

00:51:55,040 --> 00:52:00,190
to just go you know what do I think sort

00:51:58,070 --> 00:52:03,260
of that's going to be from from a feel

00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:07,220
it's it's really taking into account

00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:10,550
what's involved in the project and

00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:11,990
giving it some rough ideas so have a

00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:14,120
look at the spreadsheet later on anyway

00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:16,370
it's an interesting sort of technique I

00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:18,080
use it every now and then when someone

00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:22,040
does want a quick in other words when

00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:23,150
they don't want to take much time they

00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:24,590
don't want to sort of pay for any

00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:27,230
discovery phase or anything you can give

00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:31,130
them some sort of ballpark estimate any

00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:33,820
questions on that one sorry yeah I'll

00:52:31,130 --> 00:52:33,820
ask you yep

00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:38,940
I've showed this to the client year yeah

00:52:37,259 --> 00:52:40,799
I look I like to be pretty open and

00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:43,349
honest you know about how I come up with

00:52:40,799 --> 00:52:44,700
things and if also they they tend to if

00:52:43,349 --> 00:52:46,529
you give them the bottom line you know

00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:48,089
the 40 grand they'll say what does that

00:52:46,529 --> 00:52:50,609
involve you know what can I cut out they

00:52:48,089 --> 00:52:52,140
don't have any information but then

00:52:50,609 --> 00:53:01,920
you're also giving them a haggling point

00:52:52,140 --> 00:53:03,539
so swings and roundabouts John I think

00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:07,200
you'd have to compress a lot of things

00:53:03,539 --> 00:53:09,029
into a big big heading really yeah often

00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,430
they have actually thought that far you

00:53:09,029 --> 00:53:21,180
know about the specification I reckon

00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:22,499
for that for this one yep no I don't try

00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:24,839
to hide it no I tell them what my

00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:26,759
contingency is as long as they don't say

00:53:24,839 --> 00:53:28,579
when you're actually in the project and

00:53:26,759 --> 00:53:30,869
use up some of the contingency they said

00:53:28,579 --> 00:53:32,190
okay there's a bit of contingency left

00:53:30,869 --> 00:53:35,970
can we use that for something else

00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:38,430
please you make it clear right up front

00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:40,049
this contingency is goes into our

00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:41,999
calculations what we're charging in

00:53:40,049 --> 00:53:45,599
there were you is a fixed price bottom

00:53:41,999 --> 00:53:46,920
line that's what's in the contract yeah

00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,630
you've got to be clear one of my tips

00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:52,380
before was make sure they understand

00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:54,690
your contract yeah okay moving right

00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:57,710
along because we have to have some

00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,710
questions and finish

00:54:04,390 --> 00:54:16,650
now we are back okay great um okay yeah

00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:16,650
yep

00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:34,150
147 ah yeah yeah that's right oh yeah

00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:37,330
yeah thank you thank you very much

00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:44,830
that's excellent one of the things that

00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:48,640
I skipped there was yeah this one here

00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:50,410
so I took the leap of saying if we go

00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:54,040
right to the top I'm actually saying

00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:55,930
right a project is actually going to be

00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:58,030
forty percent development and sixty

00:54:55,930 --> 00:54:59,700
percent something else because we've

00:54:58,030 --> 00:55:04,020
sort of worked out well you know we've

00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:06,430
got pretty good development capabilities

00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:07,390
and we're sort of worked out right well

00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:08,740
the rest of the phase that's according

00:55:07,390 --> 00:55:10,720
to our methodology are really going to

00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:12,490
take about sixty percent of project sort

00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,560
of all up and forty so that's the

00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:16,210
extrapolation phase basically to the

00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:18,340
rest of the project you might decide to

00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:20,200
actually base it on on something else

00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:23,130
and extrapolate based on different

00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:23,130
figures but that's just an example

00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:38,130
so I just lost my place here Ryan with

00:55:36,390 --> 00:55:49,100
my powerpoint can you repeat that

00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:49,100
question I'm sorry yep

00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:03,260
yeah yeah that's when it becomes

00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,520
probably a bit dicey and yeah you'll

00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:06,920
have to make your own decisions about

00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:11,990
how you structure that and whether you

00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:15,560
show it to the client okay lost my place

00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:17,210
there but so how they function plate

00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:19,730
accounting so the verdict on that one is

00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:22,820
is really that that can be really handy

00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:25,010
for quick estimates okay the last couple

00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:29,780
why can't we just leave art no time for

00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:33,830
music this is really Oh music oh that's

00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:39,770
a really long one though said why don't

00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:41,810
we both just think overboard Thank You

00:56:39,770 --> 00:56:43,580
low budgets and high expectations be

00:56:41,810 --> 00:56:47,690
creative Margie no one's ever heard that

00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:49,940
before low budget but high expectations

00:56:47,690 --> 00:56:52,190
every client really kind of falls into

00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:53,600
that category almost in some ways I just

00:56:52,190 --> 00:56:55,580
say big creative think outside the box

00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:57,200
I've got a few ideas for how you do that

00:56:55,580 --> 00:57:01,940
but I'm sure you've got a lots and lots

00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:06,200
of other ideas yourself okay an existing

00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:08,660
drupal system sometimes we clients

00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:13,940
actually come to us where the heck's the

00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:17,750
mouse there is problem is are inside

00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:22,700
your head she said to me the answer is

00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:24,080
easy if you take it logically um okay so

00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:25,430
they have an existing drupal system

00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,840
developed by someone else they want you

00:57:25,430 --> 00:57:28,670
to take over development and all

00:57:26,840 --> 00:57:31,670
maintenance of the system that happens a

00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:36,230
heck of a lot I think and look the

00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:37,850
answer is really easy do an hourly rate

00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:42,250
on it because you don't really know

00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:45,230
where that system came from I think why

00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:46,850
bad development on it there are ways to

00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:48,350
actually analyze sites you know there's

00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:49,730
the Acquia in sight tool which we

00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:50,869
haven't used before but it sounds like

00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:53,480
it does that sort of thing and there's

00:57:50,869 --> 00:57:55,010
some other things and maybe the problem

00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,650
was the actual client was bad client

00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:59,480
rather than their developer that's yeah

00:57:57,650 --> 00:58:03,200
and usually can tell that by the field

00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:05,480
when you talk to them so i reckon start

00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:08,280
the small task bill in advance blocks of

00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:15,030
hours easy

00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:18,150
um okay something no wish there was

00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:19,800
something I could do here's a funny one

00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:21,420
quote hi if you don't want the job or

00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:24,720
the client and you can't tell them

00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:26,640
directly you know and there's lots of

00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:28,230
reasons why you can't tell them directly

00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:30,060
then maybe they're difficult to deal

00:58:28,230 --> 00:58:32,070
with and you can never tell a client

00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:35,040
that really because they were they just

00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:37,680
want to see that so quite high you don't

00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:39,480
want the work you don't agree with the

00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,730
project's morals oh gee I just got to

00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:44,100
tell you I hadn't actually worked out I

00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:46,080
could curl call early on after star the

00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:47,940
Sun and glow digital from a brothel they

00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:50,940
wanted me to do a brothel website with

00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:53,040
explicit content and I said I'll get

00:58:50,940 --> 00:58:55,980
back to you but then I quickly worked

00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:57,000
out a policy to deal with that and since

00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:59,460
I've said that I've to the other what

00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:01,140
the policy was which was if I don't feel

00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:02,910
comfortable showing my kids I'm not

00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:05,850
going to take it on yeah I've used that

00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:16,070
a few times it's great and maybe you

00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:16,070
don't want to tell them yeah yeah

00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:22,700
fantastic yep yep so it and if the mesh

00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:24,200
doesn't feel right or if they smell

00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:28,370
maybe you don't tell them that I don't

00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:32,290
know and lastly this is my absolute

00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:32,290
favorite and it's great one to finish on

00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:39,290
okay tell them you don't want to work

00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:41,180
with them declined to be involved and

00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:42,950
for a number of reasons you know that

00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:44,270
you can tell them you have enough money

00:59:42,950 --> 00:59:45,950
this isn't going to work and everything

00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:49,700
you disagree with their morals you know

00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:53,990
you can tell them and the old famous

00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:55,370
history of bad debts um so there's a few

00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:57,020
summary points there but we're out of

00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:58,370
time I wanted to incorporate this in

00:59:57,020 --> 00:59:59,570
some way but I really couldn't find a

00:59:58,370 --> 01:00:03,410
spot for it so I thought I just thrown

00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:11,810
it in at the end I thought that was

01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:13,400
excellent maybe yeah okay maybe the

01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:17,330
moral is read the fine print in your

01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:23,660
contracts all right so we're done ok any

01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:25,160
questions sorry I haven't left any time

01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:27,260
for questions and stuff but I glad we

01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:29,330
had some time in between look I'll take

01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:30,530
one just maybe one anyone with a

01:00:29,330 --> 01:00:34,990
question otherwise we'll talk later
