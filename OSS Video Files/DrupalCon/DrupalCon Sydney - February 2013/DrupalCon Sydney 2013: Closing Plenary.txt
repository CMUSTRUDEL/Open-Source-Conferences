what we're doing here I know unless he

upon herself to make sure that there is

00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,680
a really bizarre prize of some sort at

00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,210
the end so we've set her free I take no

00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,430

00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:32,349

only 30 American dollars and he will

00:06:32,349 --> 00:06:36,729
beat you with that it was not an

00:06:35,349 --> 00:06:40,449
accident that we gave Morton a surfboard

00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:42,879
and you should use the pointy end when

00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:44,289
you beat people oh and tell them some

00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,879
important stuff about what happened here

00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:49,330
this week wow this is kind of fun stuff

00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:51,069
so I think one of the great things about

00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,740
a drupal connors we try and break a

00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:55,629
venue in terms of records for things

00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,360
that they've done so the first thing

00:06:55,629 --> 00:07:00,009
that we have is our use of the internet

00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,620
and I do want to thank everyone for

00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:05,020
staying on their 3g devices if they did

00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,300
it did save us in terms of bandwidth and

00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,159
we didn't necessarily break any records

00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,469
but you can see that we had a

00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:13,959
significant amount of traffic throughout

00:07:11,469 --> 00:07:16,599
the the last couple of days then hey you

00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:18,009
should introduce them to Doug yes so I'm

00:07:16,599 --> 00:07:20,830
you would have seen this very handsome

00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:23,080
man walking around a couple of days ago

00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:25,240
and this is doug robertson who is the

00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,700
head of IT here and he put all the new

00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,500
infrastructure in and was on the phone

00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:33,600
to telstra until the eleventh hour and

00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:37,000
you probably saw this guy walking out

00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:39,940
about half an hour ago so Doug really

00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:47,740
kind of went to the the eleventh level

00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:49,600
for us so yeah poor Doug it is no lie

00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:52,530
whatsoever that the internet actually

00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,820
came on at eight thirty Tuesday morning

00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:58,110
we were on the phone constantly working

00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:00,730
with what's that company called Telstra

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,410
yeah for those of us from the states

00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,670
it's kind of like working with AT&T and

00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,230
getting a cable modem back up and

00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:06,550
running but a much bigger deal because

00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:09,820
there's a lot more government politics

00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:11,680
involved Doug was phenomenal diligent

00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,750
worked as hard as he possibly could and

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,040
from what I've seen the internet was

00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,650
never out for more than a moment or two

00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:20,020
for a rat or an access point to reset

00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,070
itself so if you happen to see Doug and

00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,210
the rest of the time that you're here

00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:25,270
please give them a pat on the back and

00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:28,570
show him a little extra love so just in

00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:30,700
terms of you guys so everyone put their

00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,620
hand up before in terms of stats for

00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,780
people that are attended we're expecting

00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,400
about eighty percent local attendees and

00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,260
that's what happened and then you can

00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,510
see the interesting breakdown of the

00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:41,890
international attendees there and I was

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,360
trying to kind of pick who might have

00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,010
been the person that came the furthest

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,950
there was someone who came from

00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:51,720
Stockholm anyone come further than stock

00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:55,330
on who had more than a 30-hour flight

00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:58,000
they felt like more than 30 hours so I

00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:59,680
think this is a great example of being

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,530
able to invite all of our international

00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,840
visitors here shoma great time and and

00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:07,360
also for everyone locally to experience

00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:10,570
an event that's on par with what you'd

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,270
experience overseas so then in terms of

00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:15,490
all the stuff that you ate and drink we

00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:18,280
did go through 500 liters of coffee and

00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:20,830
a lot of other food there and I think

00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:22,600
the 25 pineapples i'm not sure what

00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,400
people are doing with 25 pineapples

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:25,810
let's just leave that out you're saying

00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,320
something about a Pingo just leave that

00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:30,990
out

00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:34,200
so I'm that's what we went through and

00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:36,390
then in terms of dollars this is the

00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,660
interesting part so we're in a it's an

00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,700
open source to event it's a nonprofit

00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,900
organization behind it and we're very

00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:45,930
transparent with all the money that's

00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,250
gone in and out of it absolutely so

00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,630
would you like to talk about the money a

00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,930
lot of people spent a lot of money to

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:54,750
get here the the sponsors obviously

00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:56,460
spent a considerable amount of money to

00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:58,020
help us and one of the things that's

00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,420
really important and will mention again

00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,160
in a couple of slides is without the

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,080
support of our sponsors this is a

00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,330
thousand dollar ticket so we want to

00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,130
offer just a lot of love and we'll go

00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,780
through them again but an awful lot of

00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:11,910
love to our sponsors for making it a

00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:18,020
reasonably priced ticket and bringing it

00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:20,880
in alright so oh let's go back one

00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:22,410
alright so to talk about where the money

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,760
came from basically there's a couple of

00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:25,980
different things one of those general

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,360
conference registration we actually blew

00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,800
our way our expectations our

00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,050
expectations were around ninety nine

00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,870
thousand dollars as you can see we came

00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:35,190
in approximately 123 and these numbers

00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:40,170
are actually a little bit older than

00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:42,240
what's today so so and by the way all

00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:43,710
these numbers are pretty good estimates

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,460
but they are not final by any means

00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:48,270
anyway so please if you're recognized

00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,580
123,000 dollars brought in through

00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:54,170
registration sponsorship as you can see

00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:56,160
you about the same amount and trainings

00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:57,480
we offered three trainings in the

00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,370
beginning and it turned out that only

00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,620
one of them really took off as well as

00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,990
we'd hoped for so we have a lot of kudos

00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,660
to the people who did the plan build

00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:08,910
launch a drupal track brought in fifteen

00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,410
thousand dollars and our business day of

00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,900
course as well brought in about nine

00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,250
thousand maybe a little bit less so

00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,870
that's where the money came in from and

00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:17,820
then you'll ask yourself what did we do

00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:19,320
with it I won't read through all of

00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:21,240
these but this is a pretty wonderful

00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,820
venue and it was actually fairly

00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:25,620
reasonable for the venue itself as

00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:31,290
anybody who's not from Australia will

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:34,110
say food costs a lot a lot McDonald's

00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:36,170
was like my weekly salary so no offense

00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,759
Holly

00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:41,129
so an awful lot of our money went into

00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:43,740
catering it's pretty much our biggest

00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:45,360
bill the internet we were charged by

00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,740
bandwidth and obviously we don't have a

00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,180
final number yet because we're not done

00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,829
we've got a great contribution sprint

00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,480
tomorrow but we estimate you know

00:11:49,829 --> 00:11:53,069
approximately twelve thousand dollars

00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:55,769
you break downs right there you can see

00:11:53,069 --> 00:11:57,329
where it went so the question is is for

00:11:55,769 --> 00:11:59,490
the first drupalcon in the southern

00:11:57,329 --> 00:12:03,689
hemisphere what exactly does this really

00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:05,370
mean well total revenue at 275 total

00:12:03,689 --> 00:12:08,100
expenses approximately two hundred and

00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:09,959
nine we're able to contribute back 60

00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:12,089
approximately sixty six thousand

00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:14,870
Australian dollars to the Drupal project

00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:14,870
and we thank you

00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:24,259
and for us in Australia this is a really

00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:26,629
important contribution we've obviously

00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:28,339
run drupal camps locally before and it's

00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:30,800
very hard for us to transfer that money

00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:33,529
back to the drupal association without

00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,509
lots of tax implications and I think

00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:37,610
personally and I'm speaking on behalf of

00:12:35,509 --> 00:12:39,170
the community here to see that money go

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,899
directly back to the drupal association

00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:43,279
to to grow the perception of Drupal

00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:45,800
around the world and the community

00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,449
support is something that I'm personally

00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,309
very proud of and everyone that

00:12:47,449 --> 00:12:51,920
contributed to the event should be very

00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:55,100
proud of 2 i'm so where does that money

00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:58,670
go you tell me Owen alright so anyone

00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:02,300
ever visited drupal org yeah so ever

00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:05,240
heard of they just to put it in context

00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:08,089
of running drupal.org if it's 21 million

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:10,850
unique visitors per month which is the

00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:13,430
population of Australia more or less and

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:16,220
if you put drupal.org in australia i

00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:19,160
would put some money that it would be by

00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:21,589
far the biggest website that's hosted in

00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,389
australia obviously it's not and in

00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:27,439
terms of the the members of that its

00:13:23,389 --> 00:13:30,110
services there's 930 2865 members as of

00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:33,980
late today and that's growing at about I

00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:36,079
don't know a thousand a month and then

00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:39,350
the developers that run through that too

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,939
we've got almost 23,000 of them and the

00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:43,970
contribution that they make through

00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:46,160
drupal org is immense so 20,000 plus

00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,870
modules and even this week there was

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,750
three and a half thousand code commits

00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:54,019
and I think to consider the drupal org

00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:55,970
is the the hub of collaboration for

00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:58,699
everyone here outside of these events is

00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:00,319
a vitally important thing and anyone

00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:02,769
that knows about web hosting hosting

00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:06,579
something that big is a considerable

00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:10,429
undertaking and where else it goes

00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:12,980
Drupal events like drupal comms and code

00:14:10,429 --> 00:14:15,290
sprints and and global training days and

00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,689
those types of things scholarships so to

00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:20,269
bring people into the Drupal community

00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:22,720
who don't have the means necessarily to

00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:25,189
do so and we had some scholarships here

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,350
community cultivation grant so someone's

00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:28,639
got a great idea about how we can grow

00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,319
the community than the drupal

00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,910
association will consider funding that

00:14:30,319 --> 00:14:34,340
and then finally the

00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:36,680
to mention is the drupal association is

00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:39,260
responsible for the legal protection of

00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:41,770
drupal as an open source product so if

00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,970
some dastardly person tries to

00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:46,030
commercialize it and make money off it

00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:49,820
than the drupal association will step in

00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:52,070
so that's where the money goes and in

00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,980
terms of more events this year you want

00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:57,860
to fill us in New yeah absolutely um so

00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:59,540
we go from if you guys are in the

00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:02,420
keynote this morning we go from this

00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:05,060
amazing height of summer beautiful beach

00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:07,760
in sydney we're going to go to rainy

00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:09,650
cloudy kind of Portland which is always

00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:14,440
fun and it has its own charm that's only

00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:16,490
300 days a year absolutely 320 I think

00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,930
about we to go to Portland our theme is

00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:20,210
a building bridges and connecting

00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:21,680
communities it's going to be the first

00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,630
event actually of its kind because we're

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,010
partnering with two other really

00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:27,050
fantastic events we're partnering with

00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:29,240
the web visions people and we're

00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:30,380
partnering with symphony live which

00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,880
trees talked about in yesterday's

00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,160
keynote the importance of symphony to

00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,750
the Drupal project we've done something

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,670
very unique we're all in the same

00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:39,440
building and if you would like to come

00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:41,300
to all three conferences and enjoy the

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,740
benefits of all three and only cost you

00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:44,690
a hundred dollars more than what a

00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,910
drupalcon registration is that's a

00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:49,100
pretty awesome deal that's well that's

00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:51,050
probably over 200 sessions that you'll

00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:53,020
have access to so we really encourage

00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:56,480
people to come on out to Portland I

00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:57,920
personally recommend that if you're

00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,360
interested in coming to Portland that

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,460
you sign them quickly one of the reasons

00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,500
being is we're actually quickly running

00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,940
out of hotel rooms if you're coming for

00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,730
the core nights the doubletree which is

00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:10,040
our headquarter hotel can handle a bunch

00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:11,690
more but not too many if you're saying

00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,040
on any of the shoulder nights were over

00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,200
to the marriott hotel which is also

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,670
fantastic but you know it's a little bit

00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,410
of ways away and the longer you wait

00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,420
further you're going to kind of get from

00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,830
where all the action is happening so

00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:23,090
it's not a deterrent to not come at a

00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:25,370
later date just a little encouragement

00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:27,620
if you'd like to join us by all means

00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,630
please do and no need to hesitate beside

00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,820
you want to beat the price bump right so

00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:35,690
make sure that you go online and you can

00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:36,920
register now and in September I've

00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,960
mentioned kind of the beauty of

00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,090
Australia I'm several times because I'm

00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:42,740
blown away by it there's another type of

00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,470
beauty which is the old european beauty

00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:45,180
and

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,580
really really excited to go see

00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,960
drupalcon Prague so we're in September

00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:50,370
we're going to be up there and we're

00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:52,560
building that program now there'll be a

00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:55,260
lot more details at of course Prague

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,990
2013 drupal.org recommend that you keep

00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,190
your eye on it check it out and I'm sure

00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,500
it's Rory to subscribe to all of our

00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:03,060
mail lists but by all means drupalcon

00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,040
Prague is going to be the other type of

00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:07,140
beauty and a little larger than what

00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:09,120
we're doing here probably around 1,500

00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:11,550
2,000 people somewhere in that range and

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,480
you make a lot of new friends and so

00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,580
you're really really interesting

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,220
gorgeous place and if there's anyone

00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:19,470
local who hasn't been to a northern

00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,570
hemisphere drupalcon they are an amazing

00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:24,090
experience it's this but six times

00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:26,100
bigger in the case of the USA and it's a

00:17:24,090 --> 00:17:28,320
it's a fantastic opportunity to have a

00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:31,140
nice holiday on the side of it so I

00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:33,090
think I base my vacations around going

00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:36,930
to Drupal cons for the last few yes as

00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:38,730
do I so just talking about some local

00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:41,430
events that are coming up over the next

00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:43,560
year as well and the first thing that I

00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:47,340
wanted to mention is that Canberra is

00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:49,140
stepping up to run a Drupal gov camp and

00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,330
that'll be running mid-year and that'll

00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:54,510
be an opportunity to come together and

00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:58,380
to talk about what impact Drupal's

00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:59,550
having in in government and the big

00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:01,830
question is what's happening with this

00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:03,210
event next year's so I think the

00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,460
important thing to point out is that

00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:07,230
this being a drupalcon is a floating

00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:09,420
event the likelihood that it'll come

00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:11,850
back to this region quickly is

00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,200
relatively low and I think the

00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:15,600
opportunity for the drupal association

00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,080
is to look at other emerging regions and

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,480
to put some attention into those but

00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,670
we're not going to halt the consistency

00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,130
of having a Drupal down under or a

00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:27,510
Drupal South event in this region we

00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:30,410
think it's really important to keep that

00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:33,570
momentum for the local community and

00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:35,940
unfortunately Josh why he who was going

00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:39,660
to announce the next event had to jump

00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:41,670
on a plane back to Wellington so the

00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,770
next event will be Drupal south in

00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:45,840
Wellington we've had Drupal down under

00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:47,970
in Australia for the last three years or

00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:50,790
two years three years if we include this

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,830
one and prior to that there was to

00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:56,100
Drupal South events over in New Zealand

00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:57,040
and I think on behalf of Australians we

00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,620
should pull our fingers

00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:01,900
out and jump across the ditch to

00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:03,250
Wellington and support that event so

00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,580
there'll be more information about that

00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:09,130
up on that website there in coming weeks

00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:11,170
as the the details of the event come

00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,730
together and finally I just wanted to

00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:14,920
mention that you've got a great

00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:16,570
opportunity following this event to get

00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,060
involved with your local drupal meetup

00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:21,610
most Australian New Zealand cities have

00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:24,400
a strong Drupal community now and they

00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:27,670
all meet on a monthly basis so to keep

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,870
the enthusiasm and the connections that

00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:30,700
you've made at this event going

00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:32,140
definitely get involved with your local

00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,860
meetup if you haven't been doing that

00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:42,070
already so we're going to move on to

00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:44,230
thank you use I'm learning the dialect

00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,420
as I go along here the international

00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:53,530
visitors might have picked up this is

00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:55,870
Australian isms all right so we

00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:58,480
mentioned just a few slides ago that are

00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:00,340
the importance of our sponsors and you

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,570
know this isn't your traditional trade

00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,250
show where people are coming and they're

00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:05,200
walking through exhibits and sometimes I

00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,790
don't see a lot of people and sometimes

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,410
they do but they always take the chance

00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,420
and they they help fund us so that we

00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:11,890
can offer a reasonable ticket so there's

00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,600
lots of different companies that would

00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:16,240
like to thank instead of listing them

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:17,110
all because we have limited time just

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,820
want to make sure that you see their

00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:21,070
logos one more time and really encourage

00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:22,720
you to visit their websites and stop by

00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:25,240
and show them a little extra love next

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,960
time the trend across them so thanks to

00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,960
all of you guys

00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,080
now if you work for a company that

00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,760
hasn't sponsored a triple calm before

00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,380
there's lots and lots of different

00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,760
levels you don't have to spend dramatic

00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,770
amounts of money although we certainly

00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,960
appreciate when you do but there is a

00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:48,790
package for almost any size organization

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,040
to give back to their community and help

00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:53,800
us out so we thank you all very very

00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,120
kindly for doing that and there's also

00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,740
some folks that we'd like to thank as

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,050
well along with the financial

00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:01,030
contributions of the sponsors anybody

00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:03,610
who volunteers where drupalcon is a body

00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:06,550
I didn't have to pay to come and take

00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:08,380
money out of the out of the project so I

00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:11,290
would like to go ahead and thank some of

00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:13,180
our local sponsors so and yeah so in

00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:15,880
terms of how we structured organizing

00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:17,950
this event we had a local team and then

00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,680
we interface with the the drupal

00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:22,180
association team to bring it together so

00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,920
can everyone that volunteered locally

00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:25,630
just stand up so that we can see and

00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,460
there's going to be a lot of you so

00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:32,080
please stand up if you were volunteering

00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:33,550
in any capacity I'm sure there's more

00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:39,490
than that there's a lot more names on

00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:41,710
here than that was a very monitor and in

00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:44,230
terms of the roles that everyone

00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:46,630
fulfilled locally I think the important

00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:48,790
thing to note is that all of the the

00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:51,700
session organization and the selection

00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:53,830
of sessions was done primarily by the

00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,350
local team interfacing with some global

00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:59,710
leads the web site was built totally

00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:02,260
locally and there was an enormous amount

00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:04,990
of effort going into that to release it

00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:08,020
on cod 7 which is conference organizing

00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:10,030
distribution and I think Robert who put

00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:11,890
a lot of the work in there rebuilt the

00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:14,560
site about three times to get it working

00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:15,990
on the beta so thank you for all the

00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,460
effort that went into that and

00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:21,190
definitely to the the track chairs as

00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:24,000
well I think everyone can agree that the

00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:26,920
the content of this event was

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:30,070
unparalleled amazing learning experience

00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:32,260
for everyone and the local track chairs

00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:33,910
they worked with the the global leads to

00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:36,160
ensure that the quality of the sessions

00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:39,070
that you saw today is of a world-class

00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,840
standard and the other thing worth

00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:43,060
mentioning is that coordinating all of

00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:45,760
the volunteers was a huge task that

00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:48,390
Magda took on and a huge thank you to

00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,390
make the for that

00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:55,920
and getting the word out via social

00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:57,970
media Manning the helpdesk online

00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:59,380
looking at all the student ticket

00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:01,780
applications and scholarship

00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:04,240
applications just general planning

00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:06,580
assistance and of course the business

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,280
day that ended up being an amazing

00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:11,500
success Thank You Xena for that the

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,720
people that meant the registration desk

00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,850
a lot of them paid for their ticket and

00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:19,060
gave up their time throughout the day

00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:20,950
regardless and it's a big undertaking to

00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:23,890
come to an event and to sit there on a

00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:26,140
desk for well great sessions are going

00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:27,310
on and then the room monitors as well

00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,660
they might have been stuck in a room

00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:31,120
where they weren't necessarily that

00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:33,040
interested in a session but by

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,080
volunteering they did that and I'd like

00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,330
to specifically thank the people that

00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,670
came as scholarship recipients who put

00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:43,780
some time in to help us out with that as

00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:45,700
well and then finally I'd like to extend

00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:49,150
an enormous thank you to the drupal

00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:51,310
association so Neil and the rest of the

00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:54,250
team Stephanie who was manning the desk

00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:56,020
the whole time here holly has just

00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,970
joined us and played an integral role

00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:00,570
throughout the event and then the team

00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:03,850
behind the scenes back in Portland

00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:07,210
Megan's living in Arizona we had a few

00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:08,950
people around the country there and the

00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,960
drupal association helped us out with

00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:15,340
all of the financials and logistics

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:17,860
marketing and we ended up spending about

00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:20,200
six months working together on that so

00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:22,770
huge round of applause and thank you for

00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,770
the drupal association

00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:33,510
so there's obviously a you know quite a

00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:35,039
few people that were really integral to

00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:37,230
this event not that any one person was

00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,370
any more important to any other but if

00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:40,019
you all wouldn't mind just kind of

00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:42,480
turning ahead just a little bit to the

00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:44,429
back of the room that way that young

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:48,059
lady is set Neil Hodge who is my right

00:24:44,429 --> 00:24:50,190
hand she handled Cobb she handled

00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:52,710
content working with a lot of local

00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:55,289
people as well but she worked tremendous

00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:57,179
hours because she dealt with the cod

00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:58,350
headaches my therapist was much much

00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:01,440
happier that we could talk about

00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:04,200
something else for a while and really

00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,419
just a tremendous thank you specifically

00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,340
to Stephanie Magda as well for working

00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:09,570
with all the volunteer contribution not

00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,740
that there any more important than

00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:12,539
anybody else but people who are

00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:19,200
specifically near and dear to me and I

00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:21,299
thank you both alright so outside of the

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,860
association and Magda there were

00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:25,470
definitely some people who really stood

00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:27,899
out if anybody was impressed with how

00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:31,649
quickly session content got up on the

00:25:27,899 --> 00:25:33,809
internet I know I was we have a couple

00:25:31,649 --> 00:25:35,279
of Ryan as hungry that's Jay and Ryan

00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:37,500
that you may have seen running around

00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,750
through the show they worked incredibly

00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,450
diligently they flew from the backwoods

00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:45,210
of Virginia I think it's okay to say

00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:47,610
that the backwoods of Virginia to come

00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,679
out and handle all the stuff and really

00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:51,120
nobody does session archiving as well as

00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,590
they do to get it up on the internet

00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,960
quite so quickly so we certainly like

00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:56,880
them at the crowne plaza we had some

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,679
wonderful support Jay Petry David

00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,919
Valentine and as we've mentioned poor

00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:03,510
Uncle Fester doug robertson who did just

00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,070
amazing jobs and helping us get things

00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:08,010
organized and paid attention to us and

00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:09,570
made us all feel special there's one

00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:11,970
other gentleman who was just a true

00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:15,120
pleasure a local guy to work with which

00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:17,159
was Lee Olsen if you think everything

00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,970
looked great it was Lee stand up late

00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,970
please stand up

00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:28,230
we came to Lee with bizarre requests

00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:30,780
such as Hayley I don't have a graphic

00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:32,940
design firm for the Prague event could

00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:35,490
you help me show Neil we could do that

00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:37,440
no problem and we design posters for

00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:39,780
them so we certainly thank me for his

00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,630
great attitude our printers over at

00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:44,790
Marsh media and I made a new friend with

00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:46,080
a Tim Miller our photographer who we've

00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:49,850
been jabbing back and forth at each

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,850
other with good humor so thank you Tim

00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:55,980
all right speakers we had over 50

00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:58,080
sessions here there's just too many of

00:26:55,980 --> 00:27:00,660
them to name individually but as I think

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,010
we've written a few times though the

00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,150
reason that people come or at least the

00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:04,620
reason that people give to their bosses

00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,450
to get justification to come to a

00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:08,400
conference so we thank all of our

00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:09,780
speakers for the great content that they

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,910
offered we know how much work it takes

00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:12,900
to put together a presentation we know

00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:14,340
that we pushed you guys to meet

00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,900
deadlines and show us that you're really

00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,790
working on this before you get on the

00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:21,510
airplane and we thank all of you folks

00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:23,220
and of course our keynotes trees you

00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:24,990
know gee I'm not employed without him so

00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,429
I particularly appreciate them I don't

00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:29,490
think any of us are employed without it

00:27:26,429 --> 00:27:31,170
matter that's a fair say I'm concerned

00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:33,540
about my refrigerator so I thank you

00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:35,160
geez and obviously Kate Lundy this

00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:36,630
morning you all saw what she was going

00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,730
through last night and how late she was

00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:40,590
on the media and that you came in this

00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:42,960
morning so calm cool collected a good

00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:45,030
sense of humor let us River a little bit

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,150
about the about the cricket match where

00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:51,360
I was awesome by the way or also it's

00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:54,540
not face bullet no it obviously not as I

00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,130
was ribbed mercilessly last night but

00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,360
they were all fantastic and we certainly

00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:59,640
appreciate them it's always great to

00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:03,630
have injuries notin somebody is notable

00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:06,030
as senator Lundy and of course what's

00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:07,170
the point of this without you guys so a

00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:09,510
lot of you guys made really long

00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:11,429

00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:18,270

that I think you would have seen us

00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:30,540
running around busy but at no point I

00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:32,310
think were we really stressed or worried

00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,299
about anything and it's been a true

00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,950
delight to

00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:37,230
this event on for you and you're an

00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:40,649
amazing community of people so thank you

pleasure name Toyota pleasure all right

00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:56,190
done yet oh and tell them what's coming

00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:58,320

00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:00,679
ourselves but hey trivia night will be

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,509
great fun we've got eaten hosting and

00:29:00,679 --> 00:29:05,940

wrap up the event meet new people and

00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:10,739

00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:13,169
absolutely and again just reminding you

00:29:10,739 --> 00:29:16,320
that the contribution sprint and sprint

00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:17,999
workshop tomorrow is the best way that

00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,629
you can contribute back to Drupal in

00:29:17,999 --> 00:29:23,580
terms of raw code and documentation and

00:29:20,629 --> 00:29:25,859
for you to have the the sense of

00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,710
achievement of actually contributing to

00:29:25,859 --> 00:29:30,809
Drupal 8 itself and I think having the

00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:33,119
the sense of building something together

00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:35,279
is something that you're not really

00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:38,220
going to get in many other parts of

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:40,049
society so like three said in his

00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,600
keynote it's about being able to do

00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:46,230
great work together so I definitely make

00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:48,330
the effort to come to that so that is

00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:50,580
the end thank you all so very much
