Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Running a Drupal Business
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	We know that Drupal is a technology platform that can be leveraged for a wide variety of use cases. However the greatest successes come from a synergy between design, development and business process which create a cohesive solution.

This presentation focuses on the organisational and business considerations with running a Drupal focused company. It is pitched for all levels and contains material for individuals considering freelancing through to ideas aimed at established organisations in this space. In particular there is a discussion on:

An overview of what helps make successful client relationships and staff engagement.
The importance of structure, focus and not overcommitting.
How this all can fit in to the Drupal community and create sustainable benefits for all.
The presentation's aim is to equip people with a framework and resources to better tackle the business side of the technology services industry and to enable long term and sustainable success around Drupal. Ultimately the community is only as good as its members and empowering Drupal startups to grow helps the whole ecosystem.

in his spare time I gather Andrew

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:57,420
session is titled running a Drupal

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:05,189
business and could could you please

00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:07,770
welcome Andrew Barnes we are excellent

00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:10,170
so thank you everyone and again it

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:13,560
wouldn't be a tech conference unless we

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,390
had technical difficulties so apologies

00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,710
were just running off a PDF at the

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,220
moment but hopefully that shouldn't

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:22,770
distract from the message so today's

00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:25,080
sort of talk i'm going to run through a

00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,390
couple of topics centered around to the

00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,820
running I'm sort of operating within the

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,530
drip drip ecosystem it's not just

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,630
designed for business owners it's

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,299
designed for anyone who's managing a

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:39,180
team project managers anyone who's who's

00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,979
sort of really looking to make make

00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,860
their mark with in Drupal in a

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:46,200
commercial sense and I want to begin

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,140
with by saying that starting a business

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:52,110
is not the hard part DZ to start a

00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:54,180
business you can jump online start one

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:56,790
today is that one tomorrow but the hard

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,399
thing is to keep it running and that's a

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,020
challenge that that I suppose anyone

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,600
beginning on their first steps in that

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,200
arm progression are really intending to

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,899
do so the focus today is on running a

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,480
business running a team all those sorts

00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,470
of related activities and how you can do

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,600
that in a sustainable

00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,480
I for the long term how do you make it

00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:21,000
scale so again it's if you're

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,270
freelancing in a round drupal operating

00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,990
in in a small team in a big team there

00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:29,490
should be some subject matter for you

00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:32,220
again I suppose mark already did the

00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:35,040
introductions but for myself probably a

00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:38,520
good question to begin with it is or

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,900
what do I know about Drupal I used to do

00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:44,390
allow the development and design an hour

00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:44,390
agency back by Merced running with 4.6

00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:50,040
4.74 Drupal core since then we've sort

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,940
of grown to to the 30 to 40 Drupal is

00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,350
across sort of three cities and on top

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,140
of that I suppose I've got a bit of a

00:02:55,350 --> 00:03:00,530
background in the theory of business as

00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:04,110
well however right or wrong that may be

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:08,700
so I haven't escaped academia in that

00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:10,500
regard either and I suppose my approach

00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,900
my personal philosophy with them

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,240
business in life in general is so you

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,040
want to achieve something which create

00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,390
sustainable growth you don't want to do

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,430
this just for the short term you don't

00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:21,870
want to do it for today or tomorrow you

00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,239
want to do it for something that that

00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:26,310
has a good sort of progression over the

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,930
longer term and from a personal

00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:31,410
perspective hopefully that makes us all

00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:34,739
very happy and that's as opposed to sort

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,480
of context their contact details are at

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:37,950
the bottom and by all means if you've

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,780
got any questions either during or after

00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:45,209
the presentation just dumb let me know

00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,010
so if we dive into this presentation we

00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:49,470
might begin with well what what is a

00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:52,049
business what do we mean by buy it by

00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:54,360
this sort of catch-all term then I

00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:56,640
wanted to cover another sort of three

00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,850
pillars in terms of some processes

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,600
systems and structures that sometimes

00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:05,459
are insured sometimes are obvious and

00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:09,360
sometimes are not that obvious and again

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,860
this isn't gospel this is just elements

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,810
that we've found work elements that we

00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:16,350
found didn't work and a worth sharing

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:18,750
and sort of talking about today but I'll

00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:22,109
touch on those sorts of three areas in

00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:23,880
addition to that business the world it's

00:04:22,109 --> 00:04:26,780
all about people so understanding those

00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,740
relationships internal external

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,410
and particularly with Drupal as a

00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:33,230
community project how that all sort of

00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:36,470
interrelate and the final one being

00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:38,870
hopefully the fun stuff is what's the

00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:41,240
end end point with it or what are we

00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:45,200
trying to achieve and how do we go about

00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:47,450
them so if we start off with what is a

00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,370
business we might first book to our

00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,830
wonderful friends at the ATO which is

00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:53,150
the Australian Taxation Office they've

00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:55,450
got a lot to say about what businesses

00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:58,550
and if you look at their definition a

00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:00,860
business is basically anything which is

00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,780
really unhelpful and self-serving in

00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,890
their regard because then pretty much

00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,910
anything you do you need to pay tax but

00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:10,340
you could also take a look at what

00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:11,750
wikipedia says and that would be a

00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:13,250
business as anything where you're doing

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,160
something commercially viable which I

00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:18,110
think it's important and something which

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,360
is creating a profit it doesn't need to

00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:23,710
be in a monetary sense but often enough

00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:26,540
that's what we associate business with

00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:29,479
but what does a Drupal business look

00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:32,500
like and I tried to put together a free

00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:34,970
to catch all terms which I thought

00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:38,180
captured a lot of of what a Drupal

00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:40,490
business can look like and they may not

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,830
be fully exhausted there may be other

00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:44,690
different models but the first one that

00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,240
we're probably all very familiar with is

00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:49,940
is a traditional services firm so and

00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,910
I've used I've just done italicized

00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,289
traditional here because you're now sort

00:05:52,910 --> 00:05:56,450
of looking at software as a service and

00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:58,610
everything is becoming a service within

00:05:56,450 --> 00:06:00,380
the tech industry but if you look at

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:04,820
traditional services as those at a time

00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:06,830
or project build operations then your

00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:10,940
Drupal shops similar to what we operate

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:13,970
a go one similar what pays to operate

00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:17,020
what one a crowd operates as that's

00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:19,700
really the traditional services model

00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:23,840
and more recently with Drupal we're

00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:27,229
starting to see a second model emerge

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,870
which is a product-based Drupal business

00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:31,970
and I'm trying to describe with that

00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,490
term anything which might be sort of a

00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:37,130
managed service or software as a service

00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:39,889
platform as a service you can look at

00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:42,439
arm startups like Pantheon or arm

00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:44,389
more um sort of recognizable name

00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:46,340
perhaps is our queer with their own

00:06:44,389 --> 00:06:49,879
cloud hosting offering and drupal

00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:52,610
gardens and that comes under that second

00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:53,870
banner but another element which might

00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,689
come under that second banner with the

00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:59,360
Drupal business sort of um world is is

00:06:56,689 --> 00:07:02,180
payment gateways payment gateways are

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,710
not necessary part of Drupal but at the

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,770
same time that they're part of that

00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:09,229
ecosystem and there are monetized in a

00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,150
totally different way and other services

00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:13,159
like Mollom while that may not be built

00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,389
into your website as an anti-spam tool

00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:20,900
you may subscribe to that as a service

00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:22,129
and themes and modules and this has

00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,710
always been sort of a touchy topic

00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:26,509
within the community in terms of okay

00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,580
well what's okay under the GPL what's

00:07:26,509 --> 00:07:31,099
what is the Drupal way terms of giving

00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:32,750
back and community contribution so it's

00:07:31,099 --> 00:07:35,060
always been sort of a more of a

00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:38,599
dangerous area but probably sits within

00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:40,310
that category and the final one is is a

00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:42,620
hybrid model where you might be

00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:45,439
releasing GPR products such as

00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:48,349
open-source distributions and then have

00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:50,419
related activities based off that so I'm

00:07:48,349 --> 00:07:52,009
not sure does anyone know about sort of

00:07:50,419 --> 00:07:53,990
commerce kickstart and commerce platform

00:07:52,009 --> 00:07:57,050
that the Commerce guys should put out

00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:58,580
yeah so that would be an example of a

00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:01,659
hybrid model where you've got a

00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:04,819
traditional services firm offering a

00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:07,939
distribution and offering that out to

00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:09,319
the community and I think one

00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:11,270
observation that I wanted to make around

00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:13,490
this point it is increasingly we're

00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,129
seeing traditional services firm branch

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,960
into that the third topic and that's

00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:22,430
something as well that that we're

00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:24,589
looking into doing as as we speak but

00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:26,270
what else makes a business is if they're

00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:29,689
the three types of Drupal businesses out

00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:31,490
there then let's dive into the details

00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:33,469
some of the the nuts and bolts in that

00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:34,940
and the first thing that I want to start

00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:37,370
off with is probably the most obvious

00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:41,390
but something which I feel is is the

00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:43,430
most important as well and that's that a

00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:45,620
business is made up of people and people

00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:47,779
are our clients or our staff they're our

00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,300
friends that the family that apology

00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:53,390
that forgives us for working late nights

00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:54,110
and travelling far too much and you

00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:56,570
achieve so much

00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:58,040
more when everyone is aligned you want

00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,720
diversity you want different opinions

00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:02,420
but you want everyone to be heading in

00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:04,339
the same direction and as a bit of

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,680
context around that what we do within

00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:08,570
our organization is try and achieve that

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,130
by making sure that we've got small

00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,320
teams that operate on different projects

00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:14,269
and operate together over a sustained

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,310
period of time and they need the the

00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:19,339
capacity and capability to do what they

00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:21,290
are required to do but at the same time

00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:23,690
you want them to be small enough to be

00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:25,550
flexible so that that way the goals and

00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,920
objectives of those teams can be very

00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:32,540
personal and very much aligned with the

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,550
individuals within it and when there is

00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:36,170
a group of people and then the group of

00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,880
people grows and you have to put a slide

00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,519
together like this you start to panic

00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,370
when you realize you missed out 20 or 30

00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:47,209
people within a slide but here's some of

00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:49,250
the faces that make up our operations so

00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:50,630
what are some more people strategies if

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,570
one of the strategies we're implementing

00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:55,880
is to have a small group lots of small

00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,769
groups rather what some of the other

00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,709
things that that we found it worked

00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:01,610
particularly well number one is is

00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:03,649
making the work environment

00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:06,410
collaborative you want everything to be

00:10:03,649 --> 00:10:08,240
as inclusive as possible and you want

00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:12,019
the right culture to permeate the

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,630
organization and part of that is making

00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:17,180
decisions inclusive making sure that

00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:20,240
people are armed to get engaged and

00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:23,899
proactive and energized around it you do

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,430
really need to listen to everyone and at

00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:27,110
this stage I should apologize because

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:30,140
when I was looking through different

00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:32,540
slides which should to fit this

00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:37,070
presentation I kind of turned the rest

00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:42,199
of the presentation into a sort of a

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:45,350
tribute to door button but but it really

00:10:42,199 --> 00:10:46,730
is important that you don't do it in a

00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:50,029
token effort when you're trying to make

00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:51,800
decisions inclusive and you need to sort

00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:53,510
of act act across all levels of the

00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,000
organization when you're doing that

00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:59,810
otherwise it's just a cheap trick that

00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,699
arm isn't genuine so in context for us

00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,920
we've got a whole bunch of different

00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:05,959
teams within our organization across the

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,389
sort of services and product related

00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:11,149
area

00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:12,920
we collaborate daily over Skype is one

00:11:11,149 --> 00:11:15,290
of our main tools I know it sounds

00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,879
simple but having group chats open where

00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:19,579
everyone just sort of posts at their

00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:22,429
feedback into it is an amazingly on

00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:25,100
powerful tool we try and be professional

00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:28,129
but be fun internally and externally

00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:30,170
with how we interact and we want to

00:11:28,129 --> 00:11:32,569
encourage excellence and we expect

00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:35,720
growth amongst everyone within the

00:11:32,569 --> 00:11:39,860
organization and coming back to that

00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:41,600
sort of listening point so going from

00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,239
people to something which is a little

00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,970
bit more abstracted is what else makes a

00:11:44,239 --> 00:11:49,429
business and I think processes provide a

00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:52,160
mechanism for your people to act they're

00:11:49,429 --> 00:11:54,350
particularly obviously useful in the

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,480
case of new staff but it's also really

00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,759
important that you have a consistency of

00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,999
behavior across your organization so

00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:05,209
that the interactions are fairly

00:12:01,999 --> 00:12:06,559
sustained and predictable and it's

00:12:05,209 --> 00:12:08,660
really important important that

00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,189
processes aren't again just implemented

00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:12,769
for the sake of it that they're not

00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:14,929
abstractions of reality and instead that

00:12:12,769 --> 00:12:17,149
you take the time to actually boil down

00:12:14,929 --> 00:12:18,619
what you're trying to achieve or what

00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:22,160
you're currently doing on a daily basis

00:12:18,619 --> 00:12:24,100
and you isolate that the salient points

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,439
of the the critical points within that

00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:31,069
and some of those critical points or

00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:32,809
what should a process contain is covered

00:12:31,069 --> 00:12:35,589
within these next two slides so if if

00:12:32,809 --> 00:12:37,999
you think about it a process should be

00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:40,220
effective in terms of if you're

00:12:37,999 --> 00:12:43,160
describing a process that you respond to

00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:45,709
support inquiries that process should be

00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,829
achieving what your overall goal is

00:12:45,709 --> 00:12:51,740
around that that is it should be

00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:53,720
efficient you don't want to add so many

00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,669
steps into it that it becomes a

00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,499
nightmare to fulfill because it's not

00:12:55,669 --> 00:12:59,929
the best use of time for the people

00:12:57,499 --> 00:13:01,610
undertaking it and the process should

00:12:59,929 --> 00:13:05,239
also be relevant so that way it doesn't

00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:06,679
have it's not superfluous you're not

00:13:05,239 --> 00:13:08,509
creating a process for taking the

00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:10,339
garbage out when everyone knows how to

00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:12,040
take the garbage out you're not creating

00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:15,949
a process for things which are

00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:17,660
unnecessary and it needs to be usable so

00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:20,570
it needs to be something which is

00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:22,600
accessible and understandable

00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:25,460
for the organization and for your staff

00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,450
need to be something that is introduced

00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,270
through induction it needs to be

00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:32,330
something that's reinforced over time

00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:35,390
and equally then if it's usable you need

00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:38,410
people to use it it's too often within

00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:40,520
our organization will create processes

00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:42,170
then we'll go back six months later

00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,570
we'll have another strategic planning

00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:46,070
session will create more processors then

00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,230
we'll compare the two processes and

00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:50,870
they're identical we just never use the

00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:52,550
first one in the first place which is

00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:54,410
important introduces why they need to be

00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:56,300
reused they need managed and monitored

00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:58,250
and they need to be measured and

00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,710
measurements a really critical concept

00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:03,470
that i found it into the business is if

00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:05,720
you're not measuring it those parameters

00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:10,790
those elements that you're trying to

00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:13,070
achieve just won't be achieved so what

00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:14,360
else makes a business in I was saying I

00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:17,570
was going to go through processes and

00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:20,920
systems and they may overlap a lot but I

00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:23,450
think particularly for this audience

00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:26,450
systems we might take today to mean a

00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:30,290
tool or a technical element that helps

00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:31,520
you achieve those processes and there

00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,410
are obvious systems if you've got a

00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,030
project management system if you've got

00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,910
a version control system in your

00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:40,490
organization but things such as your

00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:42,770
office phones like I said we use skype a

00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,600
lot internally to UM to keep abreast of

00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:47,060
what everyone within the organization is

00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:49,340
doing or if you use google chat they're

00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,800
all great systems I'd even go as far as

00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:55,370
to saying look coffee machines having

00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,710
beer in the fridge which for a caffeine

00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:00,770
addicted organization like us is a

00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:02,690
critical element to success are really

00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:05,150
important support mechanisms and systems

00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:09,380
that are that help you achieve your

00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:12,050
business objectives and as a technical

00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:14,210
person I also think I all I used to

00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:16,760
think that systems were the Kuril that

00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:17,960
they were fantastic and I would jump

00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:20,300
into a new system and set it up

00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:22,250
overnight and think excellent or all of

00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:25,430
our problems in our solved we've got

00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:27,980
this new task management system we've

00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:30,500
got this new finance system fantastic I

00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,360
read the feature list our business is

00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,540
going to double next year double next

00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,560
month

00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:39,300
but that that's not the whole answer

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,360
systems aren't the Kuril they're

00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:45,389
important to help sort of make those

00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,500
processes are usable and efficient but

00:15:45,389 --> 00:15:48,329
if you don't follow them if you don't

00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,819
use the system or if you don't use it in

00:15:48,329 --> 00:15:52,670
the right way don't expect to get the

00:15:50,819 --> 00:15:55,920
outcomes that that you were looking for

00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:58,709
they rely on underlying good processes

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,630
and the adherence to them which is why

00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:04,110
those reporting and monitoring metrics

00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:09,060
are so critical in those sorts of um

00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:11,730
contexts and if we are look at our good

00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:15,720
friend Ben Franklin here the next step

00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:17,519
is is around structure and once you've

00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,889
got processes and systems in place how

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,139
do you start achieving your business

00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:23,519
objectives whether they be the client

00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:25,410
project whether they be an internal

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,889
project or whether they be something

00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:31,380
else entirely it's really it's really

00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:34,860
important to have a structure and one of

00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:37,019
our project managers like to say that is

00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,790
very happy when he knows that he's not

00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:41,940
on time because at least he knows where

00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:44,639
he is I think that's again a little bit

00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,050
too self-serving but you have to agree

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,760
at the end of the day it's better to

00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,920
have a plan and know where you are

00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:53,130
relative to that they're not to have one

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:55,050
at all and as part of that that planning

00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:58,980
component we had a great talk this

00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:01,800
morning by the CEO of a triple shop out

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,290
of Europe on agile planning is is

00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:07,290
identifying those tasks breaking them

00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:09,659
out into small tasks prioritizing those

00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:13,470
tasks and allocating resources around

00:17:09,659 --> 00:17:15,089
them to help achieve those tasks but one

00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:18,439
part of planning that we often forget is

00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:20,760
what what if it all stuffs up what if we

00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:24,059
run these plans we follow these plans

00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,919
and it doesn't work out you have to

00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:28,580
consider contingencies if you're

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,809
planning on delivering a large project

00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,700
and then some of you win two large

00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:34,620
projects what are you going to do in

00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:37,679
those situations what's going to happen

00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:39,900
if one of the developers or designers

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:43,380
that you're depending on is sick or

00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:45,030
unavailable or otherwise busy try and

00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,049
foresee some problems that might arise

00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:49,769
make sure that your planning is

00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:53,049
as robust as possible to those events

00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:55,509
and then unfortunately paradoxically

00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:58,779
almost try not to over plan you can

00:17:55,509 --> 00:18:01,059
spend twice as long planning than the

00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:03,549
project itself and there's obviously

00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:06,429
diminishing returns to how long you're

00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:08,200
spending on that but I'd probably guess

00:18:06,429 --> 00:18:10,720
that everyone myself included in this

00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:12,940
room doesn't spend enough time planning

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,360
and if you get into the the category of

00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:21,279
over planning then that's probably just

00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:23,769
sort of self correcting a little bit now

00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:25,539
if we go back to to our suppose what I

00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,249
was saying is one of the underlying most

00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:29,769
important elements to a business in

00:18:27,249 --> 00:18:30,909
terms of the people within it what

00:18:29,769 --> 00:18:33,669
really makes people tick is

00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:35,470
relationships this is a topic that I've

00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:37,840
considered both within our professional

00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:39,850
environment but also from a research

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:43,149
perspective is in terms of how do you

00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:47,019
make better collaborations better

00:18:43,149 --> 00:18:49,629
relationships and a big part of this is

00:18:47,019 --> 00:18:52,320
the company culture your identity your

00:18:49,629 --> 00:18:54,129
brand both external and internal

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,379
marketeers have sort of latched onto

00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:58,600
that and now everything to do with the

00:18:56,379 --> 00:19:01,570
business is now marketing it's all how

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:04,239
you present yourself but that may not be

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:07,299
necessarily incorrect as well I think if

00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:08,859
you continue your culture as a core part

00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:12,549
of your business and it's something that

00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:15,519
you can't necessarily consciously always

00:19:12,549 --> 00:19:20,440
set out to achieve then then that's an

00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:22,679
important mindset to take so your

00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:26,019
relationships both internal and external

00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:28,119
with clients with staff are a key sort

00:19:26,019 --> 00:19:30,549
of part of this and one of the major

00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:31,989
important points that I was saying that

00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:34,359
I wanted to emphasize at the beginning

00:19:31,989 --> 00:19:37,929
with with our culture is we try and make

00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:39,549
sure that it's fun but at the same time

00:19:37,929 --> 00:19:41,679
that we're professional in terms of

00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:43,570
doing it and it doesn't matter how far

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:47,259
along that that sort of spectrum that

00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:49,389
you are but as long as you are sort of a

00:19:47,259 --> 00:19:51,789
conscious in setting out where you want

00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:54,340
the business to be in that culture to be

00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:55,570
and as long as it aligns with all the

00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,999
people within the company and what

00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,549
they're trying to achieve in their

00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:03,299
workplace then I think you're

00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:05,820
to a winner and Annie gendering a sense

00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:10,679
of collaboration is an important to the

00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:12,950
focus as part of that I thought I'd

00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:15,239
pause for a moment and just put up a

00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:18,899
what probably looks like a series of

00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:20,460
little dots and larger dots but anyone

00:20:18,899 --> 00:20:27,629
have won't have any guesses what this

00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:30,330
image is shown any guesses it is a

00:20:27,629 --> 00:20:32,580
picture of every single academic who has

00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:35,419
ever published a paper in the last 10

00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:37,830
years at the University of Queensland

00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:41,429
surprisingly academics at UQ look a lot

00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:42,899
like circles but on top of that what you

00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:46,409
should see is that there's a couple of

00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:48,470
big points within this diagram but the

00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:51,779
most important thing is how connected

00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:53,850
people are and it's those connections

00:20:51,779 --> 00:20:56,309
which have have been proven in research

00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:59,429
papers time and time again that create

00:20:56,309 --> 00:21:01,590
the outcomes so connections not just in

00:20:59,429 --> 00:21:03,389
terms of the number of connections I

00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:05,070
always tend to look at people on

00:21:03,389 --> 00:21:07,619
LinkedIn who have those 500 plus

00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:09,179
connections as trying a little bit too

00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:11,789
hard just to network for the sake of

00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:13,409
networking but also the quality of those

00:21:11,789 --> 00:21:16,950
connections in terms of are you

00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:18,389
connected with people that that will

00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,070
help you achieve the objectives that

00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:21,690
that you're trying to do with in your

00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:24,029
personal life in your business life and

00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:25,859
that can be as obvious and and and

00:21:24,029 --> 00:21:28,019
having diversity in those connections

00:21:25,859 --> 00:21:30,509
the one thing that you notice you in

00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:32,309
your own personal connections is they're

00:21:30,509 --> 00:21:35,159
probably very similar you're probably

00:21:32,309 --> 00:21:37,619
are very well associated with people in

00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:40,049
the same town as yourself speak the same

00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:43,169
language as yourself have the same

00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:44,879
personal interests but that doesn't

00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,960
allow you to think very differently to

00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:48,450
them it doesn't allow you to have

00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,460
conversations where you can come up with

00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:53,159
new idea is or bounce around different

00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,600
different concepts and one of the really

00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:57,509
interesting things that's coming out of

00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,519
research more recently is that for

00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:01,830
success both you need to have larger

00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:05,639
teams and you need to have more diverse

00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:08,220
teams and there's obviously difficulties

00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:09,690
involved with diversity but it's worth

00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:11,640
sort of consciously thinking through

00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:14,490
that as well

00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,200
on that subject of sort of having access

00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:19,500
to different sort of perceptions and

00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,730
indifferent um sort of mindsets I wanted

00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:22,830
to sort of come back to the fact that I

00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,120
think within our industry within the

00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:26,190
tech industry and within iti think

00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,440
knowledge is our competitive advantage

00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:30,020
particularly for a services company the

00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,730
more that you know the better you can

00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:35,520
implement different solutions that that

00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:37,200
is your competitive advantage and so

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,480
around that collaboration within your

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,040
business and exone to it is how you're

00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,220
going to grow that and how you're going

00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:46,290
to be able to leverage that and by being

00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:48,450
open in your discussions with others

00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:50,430
you'll actually achieve more it's not a

00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:52,140
scarcity mentality that that we have

00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:55,310
within an open source community which is

00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:58,050
fantastic but at the same time I think

00:22:55,310 --> 00:23:00,780
there's a lot of instances similar to

00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:03,210
slide here that I've been in going well

00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:05,970
look why why do I want to be open it it

00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:09,150
sometimes isn't intuitive but it really

00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:13,950
is an asset I encourage you all to sort

00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:16,380
of consciously set out to do and so if

00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:18,720
we go look if we're doing business and

00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:21,240
I'll start swing back towards Drupal now

00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,120
again for doing business in in the

00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:27,720
Drupal ecosystem what is Drupal in light

00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:29,940
of all all of these topics our Drupal is

00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,430
a community collaboration its mentality

00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,560
of looking for the long term that we're

00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:37,140
not just looking for for something which

00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:39,630
is going to solve our problem today or

00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:44,220
tomorrow in terms of you can hack or you

00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:46,140
could do some nasty sort of CSS hacks to

00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:49,170
achieve what you want on your website or

00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:51,900
on your clients website but fortunately

00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:53,730
enough this community doesn't advocate

00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,140
that and rather take so much longer term

00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:57,000
view going well how are you going to

00:23:55,140 --> 00:24:00,620
support that how are you going to make

00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,970
sure your life is easier into the future

00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:04,710
and when you develop something for a

00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:06,810
client releasing it back to the

00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,730
community as part of that is it going to

00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:11,340
be worth your while spending those extra

00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:14,670
hours releasing your module even though

00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:16,290
that may not necessarily be paid for and

00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:18,810
that's something that we come across

00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:20,850
quite recently and an out answer to that

00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:23,160
is is at least if we think we're going

00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:25,200
to come up with another requirement

00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,990
similar that in the future then

00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,399
yes it is worth that time and it doesn't

00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:33,000
necessarily need to just be in a

00:24:29,399 --> 00:24:36,120
development light as well so you can see

00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,840
that if you imagine that network of

00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:42,990
circles that we're showing before in a

00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:45,240
Democrat xed I defecate that similarly

00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,919
we've got a network of circles that that

00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,100
we're not necessarily always aware of

00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:51,870
within this Drupal community and add

00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,100
into the wider community as well we

00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:55,200
don't want to necessarily be inward

00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:59,279
focused either within our business or

00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,260
within the project but um but those

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,549
connections are how we sort of share the

00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:06,330
knowledge and how we sort of move things

00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:09,149
forward so rather than sort of touching

00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:12,320
too much on to the meetups versus

00:25:09,149 --> 00:25:15,059
contributions and closings proprietary

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,889
just want to advocate that doing

00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:19,200
business doesn't necessarily need to be

00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:21,179
against the Drupal way the open-source

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:26,039
way I think the two are very

00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:28,679
complimentary and now on to some of the

00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:31,409
UM more sort of our I suppose got fun

00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:33,210
stuff but the business outcomes in the

00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:36,210
pointy end of what we're trying to

00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:41,010
achieve with a commercial activity based

00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:42,840
in and around the Drupal ecosystem I'd

00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:44,429
suggest that one of the most important

00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:48,000
things that a business can have is a

00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:49,649
sustainable profit not not a lot of

00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,159
money today and a lot of money tomorrow

00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:54,899
but at the same time not running massive

00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:57,269
losses you're not going to be around in

00:25:54,899 --> 00:25:59,580
the future unless you can come up with

00:25:57,269 --> 00:26:02,730
the business model which allows you to

00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:04,200
create a sustainable profit and the

00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:06,179
million-dollar question around that is

00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,740
well how do you do that how do you

00:26:06,179 --> 00:26:11,399
create sustainable profit how do you

00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:13,049
grow a sustainable profit and I think

00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:14,580
there's three points three principles

00:26:13,049 --> 00:26:15,720
around that that I'll go through and

00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,190
then we'll sort of swing back to those

00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,169
Drupal business models that we were

00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:21,539
looking at before to work out how you

00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:26,070
can create sustainable profits in each

00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:27,690
of those business models I think the

00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:30,389
first principle to keep always in mind

00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,600
is is to be fair to your clients whether

00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:36,149
they be product users whether they be

00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:38,580
service users but be transparent Drupal

00:26:36,149 --> 00:26:40,409
is amazing help educate them about it

00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:43,620
I'll grow their knowledge and help

00:26:40,409 --> 00:26:46,559
educate them but also understand your

00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:49,500
client and I think one thing myself

00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,710
included that that we're developers or

00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:54,779
our website builders often forget is

00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:57,870
your client has different priorities to

00:26:54,779 --> 00:27:00,539
you their website may not be the most

00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:03,179
important thing to their business impact

00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:06,570
it off or not and how you then go about

00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:10,049
doing that needs to be a relative and

00:27:06,570 --> 00:27:11,760
appropriate to that and i think it was

00:27:10,049 --> 00:27:14,880
summed up nicely this morning by saying

00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:16,830
if you expose so that the cost or the

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,159
resources or the time it's going to take

00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:22,500
to do certain arm tasks or certain

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:28,620
projects then your client can work out

00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:31,289
if the business outcome supports it but

00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,940
the flip side of that is sometimes the

00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:35,279
website or the project that you're

00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:36,659
working on with your client is the most

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,000
important thing to their business its

00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:41,429
core it's central to their business

00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,649
succeeding and if that's the case it's

00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:46,350
really important to to treat it that way

00:27:43,649 --> 00:27:49,320
it's really important then to take on a

00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:51,720
level of ownership as as the expert in

00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:54,090
the field to make sure that what's being

00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,470
implemented is again not for the short

00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:59,279
term but for the longer term and

00:27:55,470 --> 00:28:02,299
educating through that and I'd probably

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:04,980
sum up the the bottom cartoon strip as

00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:06,870
try not to to achieve or convince

00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,809
through obscurity try not to be too

00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:15,179
abstract but if you can explain and put

00:28:09,809 --> 00:28:17,820
in in an understandable context for your

00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:19,919
client or for your end user then you'll

00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:24,510
really sort of hit the point much closer

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:26,429
and the other two principles are sort of

00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:29,389
stand from that be fair to your staff

00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:31,590
and be fair to yourself I think

00:28:29,389 --> 00:28:35,149
certainly one of our our learnings

00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:37,889
internally was that we always wanted to

00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:41,130
create a happy outcome even if that was

00:28:37,889 --> 00:28:43,769
at our own expense and sometimes in life

00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:45,389
you you can't always do that and whilst

00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:46,620
it's important for you to compromise and

00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:49,620
make sure that you're trying to achieve

00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:51,690
the best for your client don't expect

00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:55,470
the impossible from your

00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:57,269
team and don't I suppose put up with

00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:00,179
clients that expect the the impossible

00:28:57,269 --> 00:29:02,519
from you there is the 8020 rule in terms

00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:05,990
of the businesses that you engage with

00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:08,779
and which ones will be the most

00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:11,190
conducive to sort of long-term success

00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:13,490
versus the ones which will be a drain on

00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:16,399
your resources and a drain on your staff

00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:19,289
and in terms of being fair to your staff

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:21,450
do expect honesty and diligence but

00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:23,549
provide the same in return reward the

00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:25,769
small staff create a culture that really

00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:29,100
sort of um celebrates those small

00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:30,809
successes and an important note is if

00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:33,389
you're running a team if you're running

00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:35,970
a project if you're running a business

00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:38,850
be fair to yourself it's not going to be

00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:40,049
sustainable to work 100 hour weeks to

00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:42,120
not sleep it's not going to be

00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:43,710
sustainable to yourself to not pay

00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:45,600
yourself if you're in a business where

00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:49,559
you're you're earning much less than you

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,789
could elsewhere understand that and

00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:52,860
don't necessarily need to change it

00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:55,039
today or tomorrow but make sure that

00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:57,440
that's part of the plan for the future

00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:01,860
don't sort of skirt around uncomfortable

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:05,070
truths like that and one point which

00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:08,100
probably included on again from personal

00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:12,149
experience is you're not responsible for

00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:14,429
other people's circumstances yes it's

00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:17,389
useful and yes it's good to be

00:30:14,429 --> 00:30:20,100
empathetic and supportive but don't

00:30:17,389 --> 00:30:23,370
sacrifice yourself just for the sake of

00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:25,259
the circumstances that others are up

00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:28,139
against particularly when you're

00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:29,730
engaging with businesses where where

00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:33,179
they're trying to get you to solve their

00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:35,879
arm their business problems educate and

00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:40,350
explain but ultimately they need to help

00:30:35,879 --> 00:30:43,559
in the process as well and and change

00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:48,360
happens it's not necessarily a principle

00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:50,250
as in so much the truth and I I wanted

00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:51,990
to share a couple of hypotheses and

00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:54,659
ideas that relate to the Drupal

00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:58,080
ecosystem and business around it in

00:30:54,659 --> 00:31:00,779
terms of changes that I think other

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,480
people have sort of noted them and I

00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:04,480
think are obvious as well and the first

00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,490
one is

00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:10,299
I think there is a growing

00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:12,970
commoditization of websites websites 10

00:31:10,299 --> 00:31:16,419
years ago five years ago we're a very

00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:19,120
specialized domain but now it's much

00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:21,760
more of a product you can jump on to

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,410
Squarespace someone can can purchase a

00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:25,720
website off ebay for fifty dollars now

00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:29,770
so there's strong downward pressures on

00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:32,230
on services around that and is that a

00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:36,190
good or a bad thing I don't know but I

00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:38,440
don't think it's it's either and what is

00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:41,140
the justification from our end to a

00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,330
client for using Drupal over and

00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:47,040
off-the-shelf solution like Squarespace

00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:49,990
sure one might be more pure and from a

00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:54,549
sort of development tool Stan standpoint

00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:56,440
is a nicer option but what is their

00:31:54,549 --> 00:31:59,559
objectives and how we trying to sort of

00:31:56,440 --> 00:32:01,870
fit in with that and I think the

00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:05,140
response needs to be to compete with

00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:07,059
that so if you're going up against

00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,799
competitors like that make sure your

00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:11,230
process is our efficient make sure there

00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:15,040
is lean as possible use a platform like

00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:16,540
a gear to release different arm versions

00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,460
of sites very quickly or different

00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:20,020
platforms very quickly and use

00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:22,750
distributions like commerce kickstart

00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:25,059
which is it again people haven't come

00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:26,200
across is a fantastic tool to get you

00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:28,870
eighty or ninety percent of the way

00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,299
there for a small e-commerce shop use

00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:32,590
them to get a running start and and I

00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:35,620
think the most important point around

00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:37,320
this is if websites or web design is

00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,280
increasingly becoming commoditized

00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:41,590
differentiate yourself in terms of

00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,480
providing business solutions Drupal is a

00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:45,220
fantastic tool for embedding business

00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,590
logic into it embedding work flows into

00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:49,450
it or released it's now becoming a

00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:52,570
fantastic platform for that as opposed

00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:54,549
to where it was years ago but I'm use

00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,049
that to your advantage and embed some

00:32:54,549 --> 00:32:58,450
business logic into the site because

00:32:56,049 --> 00:33:03,870
that increases the value that you're

00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:06,250
delivering additionally separate to the

00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:08,760
commercialization of websites is we're

00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:11,650
in a market which is is now maturing

00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:14,290
we're not just small players anymore

00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:17,080
there's not just triple shops of of

00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:18,110
individuals or five people or even ten

00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,090
people

00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:22,220
again the speech this morning I think

00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:25,490
was a couple of hundred staff are creo

00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:27,290
has 300 staff and you've got

00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:30,080
organizations like Accenture and

00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:33,950
capgemini who have tens of thousands of

00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:36,350
staff how do you compete when a business

00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:38,690
or firm like that can throw 10,000

00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:43,160
developers at our project when you might

00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:44,390
have to and there a better risk profile

00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,090
for our government and corporate

00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:48,590
agencies or at least there is less

00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:52,460
perceived risk within those

00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:55,610
organizations whether or not the end

00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:58,760
outcomes are quite as conducive so I

00:33:55,610 --> 00:34:01,250
think the response needs to be to focus

00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:04,280
on your difference just sort of

00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:06,440
celebrate that and exploit that for a

00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:08,000
big team or if you want one Drupal in

00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,980
Australia might not fit that you might

00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,540
not be the development seeds of the

00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,389
world in terms of being a triple mapping

00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:17,929
specialist but still have a difference I

00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:20,480
mean that difference at the next point

00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:22,369
in terms of once we've got some profit

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,210
we now want some growth how do we then

00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:27,350
grow the business itself and I'm just

00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:28,850
going to go back to the types of

00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:31,070
business because I think it really

00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:33,919
depends on what your business model is

00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:35,690
in terms of how you grow it if you're

00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:37,070
operating as a drupal deb shop and

00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:38,810
you've got staff and your billing

00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:40,700
clients it's always going to be a

00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:44,090
function of hours or how much you can

00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:47,300
churn out and that's fine you just need

00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:50,210
to grow your numbers it's very difficult

00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:52,010
and challenging though at times products

00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:55,190
and software as a service unfortunately

00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:56,720
is very easy to scale the flip side to

00:34:55,190 --> 00:35:00,140
that though is it's very very difficult

00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:03,260
to to build version one or two get the

00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:06,050
first one out the door and if you're

00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:07,400
going after a hybrid model again it may

00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:10,130
be a defensible position but

00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:11,960
distributions or equivalents are again

00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:16,160
very resource-intensive to do up front

00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:18,230
so none of these options are other the

00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,910
Silver Bullet none of them is the one

00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:21,440
approach I'd advocator one sort of step

00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:23,450
out of the room and and start running

00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,490
after but I think it is important to

00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:27,410
consider it and go look for our business

00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:30,670
model for your business model where

00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:31,940
where do you want to position yourselves

00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:34,160
and I thought

00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:37,339
to contextualize a little bit with some

00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,859
examples from our end with one being a

00:35:37,339 --> 00:35:41,359
platform that we call the gyro which is

00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:43,910
an e-learning platform built around

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:46,010
Drupal because for us Drupal is our

00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:49,310
bread and butter it's what we we focus

00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:51,800
on day an item and we love the platform

00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:53,839
but um II learning and education is a

00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:56,839
market where we see tremendous results

00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:58,609
being delivered by drupal and we wanted

00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:02,770
to again sort of have a running start

00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:05,210
there and the the second one is a

00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:07,250
distribution that we're releasing over

00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:10,069
this week which is called go campaign

00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:13,130
it's a CRM or social media platform

00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:16,310
which you can install and download and

00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:18,890
run run yourselves but again it's

00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:20,599
designed to to allow us to have a

00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:24,050
distribution which we can support and

00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:26,210
and sort of grow into the future and

00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:28,640
those are really the sort of elements

00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:31,640
which I think define well what is Drupal

00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:33,380
in it in a business context what is the

00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,270
sort of models that are out there and

00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:37,579
what are some of the approach is to make

00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:39,530
sure that they're the structure that

00:36:37,579 --> 00:36:44,420
your organization is taking is as

00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:47,089
effective as possible and i think one

00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:48,859
minute early but um I just wanted to

00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:49,760
sort of open up for the next down five

00:36:48,859 --> 00:36:51,950
or ten minutes if there was any

00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,920
questions that people had or on any sort

00:36:51,950 --> 00:37:01,000
of thoughts are only sort of points that

00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:01,000
I just went through yeah

00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,960
yes

00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:21,880
yeah no it's a good question so just

00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:24,680
repeat for everyone how do we balance

00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:27,099
clients client deliverables versus our

00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:29,630
own internal projects or products and

00:37:27,099 --> 00:37:31,999
it's um in one we struggled with for a

00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:33,799
long time because you'll say look we're

00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:35,960
really excited about building on this

00:37:33,799 --> 00:37:37,190
product and then a client comes through

00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,599
the door and says look I'll pay you

00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:40,190
fifty thousand dollars if you do this

00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:43,220
website for me and you go well this

00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:46,519
product would be lovely but I would

00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:47,900
quite like this now and that's why that

00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:50,180
the short-term versus long-term is

00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:52,549
really important to consider we solve

00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:54,769
that problem only in the last six to

00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:57,410
twelve months and we've got dedicated

00:37:54,769 --> 00:37:59,119
teams so each of those units that I

00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,589
flashed up on the screen has their own

00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,289
teams has their own budgets has their

00:38:00,589 --> 00:38:06,079
own objectives they each have a manager

00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:07,640
responsible for that so if a project

00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,400
does come through the door and says look

00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:12,829
I want to do this then our services

00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,880
teams will will go after that and if

00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:16,549
they need to grow larger to accommodate

00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:19,789
that they will but they can't steal

00:38:16,549 --> 00:38:22,700
resources from from the other objectives

00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:28,809
unless and I said some really sort of

00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:28,809
monumentally justifiable project yeah

00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:42,900
you

00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:45,750
yeah so in terms of productivity I think

00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:47,430
it comes down to measurement but how do

00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:50,369
you measure an abstract concept like

00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:52,830
productivity you can have and we do in

00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:56,550
our organization have different types of

00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:58,700
people a developer who is very

00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:02,220
knowledgeable on Drupal as a platform

00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:04,800
very experienced in that regard and very

00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:07,920
very slow or you could have someone

00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,140
who's very good at just getting things

00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,330
done but may not do it in technically

00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:15,450
the best way I think productivity comes

00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:18,420
down to a question of well what was your

00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:20,010
expectations and how good were you at

00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:22,020
those expectations so if you're going

00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:23,790
into a project and you're saying look we

00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:26,580
think it'll be 40 hours of design for

00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:30,000
this project did you achieve a good

00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:32,160
result within that estimate or were you

00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,340
not productive enough and ended up using

00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,930
120 hours or well you're not productive

00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:40,980
enough and didn't achieve a good result

00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:42,990
in less than that it's not a perfect

00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:46,650
answer but that's our approach anyway in

00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:48,570
terms of trying to encourage that and

00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:51,330
measure it as well and I think some of

00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:53,369
the mechanisms terms of collaboration in

00:39:51,330 --> 00:40:00,530
terms of them that culture helped boost

00:39:53,369 --> 00:40:00,530
it but you have to measure it too yeah

00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,560
it's

00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:14,860
you know it's um a good question

00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,119
particularly for us because we operate

00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:20,090
fairly lean on the ground in terms of

00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:22,280
where across three next we copy off to

00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:25,550
Bangkok to open up an office there we

00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:27,880
will have all of two people in it it's

00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:33,440
those tools and systems to support that

00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:35,420
so a presentation just before from one

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:38,090
of the developers within Suncorp they've

00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:40,040
got four offices 30 people similar sort

00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:41,510
of size and they've just got video

00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,770
screens where you can walk up to and

00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:45,200
it's already got a video screen into

00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:47,840
their office in in China in Melbourne or

00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,570
in Brisbane we try and do similar things

00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:53,840
within our organization but even basic

00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:56,090
things like Skype are on a great and we

00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,320
do staff exchanges in terms of we try

00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:59,960
and get people moving between the

00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:02,600
offices a lot holding sort of events

00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:05,290
where people can can get together so

00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,290
those sorts of things

00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:44,099
that's it yeah so as Daniel who I'm sort

00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,869
of actually does all the work and I just

00:41:44,099 --> 00:41:51,089
sort of sit here and spend my life doing

00:41:45,869 --> 00:41:54,299
talks was saying we our corporate

00:41:51,089 --> 00:41:56,579
structure is not geographically based so

00:41:54,299 --> 00:41:58,980
those teams that I said that they're not

00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:01,170
focused in one spot or another they're

00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,940
they're spread across so you'll have a

00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:05,460
project manager in one location who may

00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:06,869
have a designer working with them in

00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:08,520
their same office they may have a

00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:10,470
developer work in another office and

00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:12,270
they'll run through a QA process in

00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:13,589
another office they'll all be on skype

00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:16,710
all at the same time talking together

00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:19,950
the the challenge will become in the

00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:21,780
future how do you run distributed teams

00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:23,700
and create a culture when you're

00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,770
operating in totally different time

00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:27,540
zones that that'll be a challenge at the

00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:29,579
moment where we're lucky that Ronnie's

00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:35,390
for the three hours different across all

00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:35,390
the unsorted basis any other questions

00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:41,609
all good well thank you very much I'll

00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:43,530
um sort of stick around if there's any

00:42:41,609 --> 00:42:54,119
other set of bunk worries afterwards but

00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:56,819
um thank you very much hello thanks so

00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:59,579
much Andrew now you might have noticed

00:42:56,819 --> 00:43:02,160
on the website the evaluation the

00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:05,369
feature has been switched on so go to

00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,750
the session schedule page and if you

00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:07,920
could evaluate the sessions that you've

00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:10,530
been to today that would be wonderful

00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,400
place you can also put comments on the

00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:16,380
individual session pages as well BB the

00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,160
the feedback will be collated by the

00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:22,109
drupal association and the speakers love

00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:24,150
to be able to hear feedback as well so

00:43:22,109 --> 00:43:26,790
they can you know continually improve

00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:30,720
their talks and everything so I believe

00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:32,369
that is us for today what's next on the

00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,609
program I didn't look before I came up

00:43:32,369 --> 00:43:37,680
here drinks beach cricket yeah okay

00:43:35,609 --> 00:43:39,000
across the road so thanks very much for

00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,410
your attendance and could you please

00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:42,410
