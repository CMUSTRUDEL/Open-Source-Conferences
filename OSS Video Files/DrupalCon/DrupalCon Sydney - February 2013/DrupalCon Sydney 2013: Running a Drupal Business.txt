Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	We know that Drupal is a technology platform that can be leveraged for a wide variety of use cases. However the greatest successes come from a synergy between design, development and business process which create a cohesive solution.

This presentation focuses on the organisational and business considerations with running a Drupal focused company. It is pitched for all levels and contains material for individuals considering freelancing through to ideas aimed at established organisations in this space. In particular there is a discussion on:

An overview of what helps make successful client relationships and staff engagement.
The importance of structure, focus and not overcommitting.
How this all can fit in to the Drupal community and create sustainable benefits for all.
The presentation's aim is to equip people with a framework and resources to better tackle the business side of the technology services industry and to enable long term and sustainable success around Drupal. Ultimately the community is only as good as its members and empowering Drupal startups to grow helps the whole ecosystem.
