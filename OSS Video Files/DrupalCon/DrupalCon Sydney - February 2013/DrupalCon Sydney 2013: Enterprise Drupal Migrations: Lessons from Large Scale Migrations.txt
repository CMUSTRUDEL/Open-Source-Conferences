Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Enterprise Drupal Migrations: Lessons from Large Scale Migrations
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	With sweat pouring down your brow you hover over the button that will launch you into the history books of web site wizardry, or be your epitaph in the cold dark tombs of project failure. Your client looks at you expectantly from across the table... you hesitate... you've tested your scripts 100 times, you've made sure the data was clean... you've had the client validate your trials so far. Yet still, your mind is racing. Did you miss something? It's launch day, and in just a few hours the whole wold will be able to see your triumph or your failure. Are you ready?

Of course site launches aren't all just code and there is no single "easy button". There are requirements, content, designs, features, servers, DNS entries, and CLIENTS! Few Drupal site launches are truly "from scratch". There are likely thousands of bits of content to migrate stretching back from before anyone heard of the terms "structured data" or "CMS". Preparation isn't just the responsibility of the dev team either, and we'll explore how and when clients should get involved. Further, we'll take a look at the process and tools to help assess, plan, and deliver a successful migration. Bottom line, this session will help everyone be more confident when "pressing the button".

This session is geared toward clients and developers wanting to know more about how to make migrations successful. It's focus is on the strategy, process, and tools that both sides of the table need to make their migration more successful.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,710
we're going to be talking a little bit

00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:08,130
about the full process of making a

00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,380
migration for the most part I think this

00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,019
this talk will go between sort of

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:17,390
business topics lessons learn best

00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:25,199
practices for a consulting and how to

00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:34,770
large project and it is a technical we

00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:36,719
doing okay on audio how's that is that

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,680
working now okay great all right we'll

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,570
pass back and forth okay we'll do it

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:43,559
we'll do a game show style so we're

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,960
gonna we're gonna we're going to mix it

00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:48,690
up a little make it fun alright cool so

00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,039
um we've already done introduction so I

00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,860
don't feel the need to belabor this

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,920
point um but I do want to talk a little

00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,960
bit about what a migration is um but

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,020
before I do that I note about our slides

00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:04,890
we have a very talented designer on our

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:08,369
team who doubles on the weekends as a

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:10,049
character artist so she's done she's

00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:11,820
done a great job of illustrating all of

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:14,549
our slides they're all custom drawings

00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:18,509
from her it's really cool what she's

00:01:14,549 --> 00:01:20,939
able to do so first of all a migration

00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,610
so one of the things that you know we

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:25,740
struggled with a little bit is you know

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,619
what do we mean by migration what we

00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,780
really mean is what anybody in a large

00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:33,210
sense is doing in most of these sort of

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,729
big triple platform builds which is take

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,560
some set of assets some set of property

00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:39,689
that they have intellectual property in

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,180
a business model and moving it from one

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:44,250
platform to another there are technical

00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,460
aspects of that there's literal content

00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,810
migration there are business aspects of

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,790
that there's stakeholders there's

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,470
project processes there's communication

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,590
and we're going to talk about all that

00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,329
stuff and so when we say migration we

00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,090
mean it's literally a migration like

00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:06,780
moving the whole herd of cattle from one

00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:08,369
pasture to the next so so just some of

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,360
the things we're going to cover one of

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:11,430
the things we'll talk about is the

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,560
people associated with the project team

00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:15,540
so who do you involve in migration

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,520
who are the stakeholders what is the

00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,739
makeup of a project what's the partner

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,959
landscape or the other vendor landscape

00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,010
that you're working on a project we're

00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,940
gonna talk a little bit about how you

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:29,370
set expectations around what a migration

00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:31,140
is going to entail the needs of the

00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,810
migration and what you really have to

00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,670
get done this is on both sides we want

00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,519
to look at the both the client side and

00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:40,319
also the vendor side we're gonna talk

00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:41,880
about preparedness this is a little bit

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:44,880
more than nitty gritty around what you

00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,650
do to get ready for it the process so

00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:49,799
how you take people through it when it

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,600
happens from the initial idea of hey

00:02:49,799 --> 00:02:55,860
we're going to go launch a new Drupal

00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:57,630
site to launch day and then we'll talk

00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,000
specifically about the launch a little

00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:02,010
bit and the transition that that entails

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,319
so when you actually are ready to press

00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:12,989
that button in and go live with your new

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:14,880
gerbil site what does that look like so

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:16,860
um one of the things that we want to

00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:18,390
make sure that we we clarify with this

00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,250
is that when you're talking about people

00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:22,709
in a migration you're not talking about

00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:24,180
just engaging one person or engaging one

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,329
aspect of the team we're talking about

00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,489
engaging an entire organization there is

00:03:27,329 --> 00:03:31,319
no single migration that should ever

00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:32,880
take place with just a project team

00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:34,319
being involved you need to talk to your

00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,120
stakeholders you need to talk to your

00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,620
other vendors you need to work very

00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,230
intimately and make sure that you're

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,930
you're talking about how you engage with

00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,060
the entire group and get a really good

00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,180
picture of everybody involved in in the

00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,930
migration and who it impacts so we're

00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:54,750
gonna go through a few of those roles

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:56,190
okay so a first role to consider in any

00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,500
migration like this is the content

00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:00,810
maintain errs content maintain errs can

00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,400
take a lot of different forms as these

00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:04,859
projects get larger and larger with

00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,690
Drupal you need to not assume that a

00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:08,940
Content maintainer is someone who is

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,980
sitting there with the Drupal interface

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:12,750
editing interface open and working

00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:14,220
within the WYSIWYG and a lot of the

00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,560
larger configurations that we're working

00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:18,150
with today you've got up stream content

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,340
maintain errs people that are

00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,169
responsible for content channels that

00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,669
they're putting into another system that

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:25,979
are being imported into Drupal or

00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:27,240
large-scale content repositories that

00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:29,639
are sitting behind

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,639
ripple and Drupal is interacting through

00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:34,500
an API with those and you also need to

00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,180
think about these people as owning a

00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,940
channel of content that's potentially

00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:41,039
multi-channel downstream as well so

00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,560
these people aren't just interested in

00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:46,169
necessarily putting stuff into a Drupal

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,460
website that's going up or go ad ripple

00:04:46,169 --> 00:04:49,470
editing interface that's going up to a

00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,210
website they're interested in how that's

00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:52,680
going to show on mobile or how that

00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:55,800
stuff is going to be consumed as through

00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,990
a feat or an API downstream so these

00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,580
people are very concerned with the asset

00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,220
that is inside of our content management

00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,530
system which is which is content in a

00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:07,409
lot of cases they they have a lot of

00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:09,509
consternation about this move to them

00:05:07,409 --> 00:05:11,729
this is a this is moving all of their

00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:13,710
property to a new house and they're very

00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:15,449
concerned about that house and and

00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:17,729
whether their property will be

00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:20,400
maintained well they're so they're very

00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:22,259
important people to consider in terms of

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,430
your you're coddling you need to make

00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:25,740
sure they're comfortable with the

00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,360
process that they understand how this is

00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,620
going to go and at the end of the day

00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,090
you have to deal with the fact that

00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,580
ultimately these are some of the most

00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,800
important stakeholders and they may not

00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:36,900
be entirely pleased with the interface

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,270
that you provide them initially but your

00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,370
goal is to improve their business in

00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:43,620
terms of how that content is going to is

00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,479
going to serve its purpose so they may

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,130
have a little issue up front with using

00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:48,810
the Drupal interface but remember that

00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,849
downstream it's really about improving

00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:56,009
their ability to deliver that content to

00:05:50,849 --> 00:05:58,680
a wider audience so the next group is

00:05:56,009 --> 00:06:00,599
technical owners technical owners used

00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,800
to be the traditional group of people we

00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:04,199
thought about when we talked about

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,560
cycling to site migrations we were

00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:09,150
always all about you know are we going

00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:11,460
to be able to work with the IT

00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:13,050
departments at large organizations to be

00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,789
able to cut over from one system to

00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,009
another that's not really the case

00:06:14,789 --> 00:06:20,009
anymore it's a lot wider than that i T

00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,990
is now the function of IT is more about

00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:24,090
risk mitigation and vetting of

00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:27,090
technology than it is about actually

00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:28,259
owning a CMS project and then most

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,180
organizations that's a really good thing

00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,430
you want the technical people to be

00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:34,319
there to make recommendations about

00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:36,120
technical things and to mitigate the

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,729
technology risk associated with a

00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,009
platform move so you're no longer asking

00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:42,509
these people like do you like drupal

00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:45,180
most of the time they won't even really

00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:47,460
have a strong opinion about Drupal to

00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:49,740
them it's one component of much larger

00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,439
solution and you need to be able to

00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,599
speak to them in terms of mitigating the

00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,339
risk for an organization there are some

00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:58,439
other things here in terms of

00:06:56,339 --> 00:07:00,419
development in nuance if you're dealing

00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:02,520
with an internal project team that might

00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:04,589
be under the IT department we're also

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:06,149
seeing it happen more and more

00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:08,639
frequently the developers are actually

00:07:06,149 --> 00:07:10,050
working for marketing because marketing

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,469
to the people that are controlling those

00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,759
sorts of CMS builds but often times you

00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:16,319
will interface with IT on the

00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,949
development side of things specifically

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,539
around DevOps and pure integration and

00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:23,699
really for IT it's about making them

00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:25,830
understand what is is comfortable about

00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,960
this CMS move and also painting the

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:33,839
broader picture of how this fits into a

00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:36,599
much wider solution okay who's who's the

00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:39,270
sort of the bad guy in this scenario we

00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:41,879
call them the saboteur and the saboteur

00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,949
may may be known or the saboteur may be

00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,289
unknown but rest assured if you're

00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:49,020
working in a large project to migrate

00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:51,449
CMS is there is a saboteur out there

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,370
waiting to stick that little bomb

00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:57,539
underneath your project and blow it up

00:07:53,370 --> 00:08:00,180
so keys to this are understanding who

00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:02,370
those people may be some cases these are

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:04,949
people who have a vested interest in say

00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:06,990
job security if you know in the open

00:08:04,949 --> 00:08:09,240
source world we do a lot of moving

00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:10,409
people off of licensed software well

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,539
guess what those licensed software

00:08:10,409 --> 00:08:15,659
vendors were pretty smart they got

00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:18,870
people trained and certified and those

00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:20,580
people are getting their job security

00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:22,709
out of that old system that you're

00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,269
migrating out of they have a vested

00:08:22,709 --> 00:08:26,399
interest in making sure that your

00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:27,839
project fails so that it stays on their

00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,539
platform that they're certified on

00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,190
that's one type of saboteur a different

00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:34,169
type of saboteur is someone inside the

00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:37,110
organization who might not agree for

00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:38,789
whatever political reason with your

00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:41,550
project stakeholder and they don't want

00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:43,829
to see their career succeed by virtue of

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,630
having a successful projects so they may

00:08:43,829 --> 00:08:47,160
love Drupal but they may hate the idea

00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:49,889
that your projects going to work and

00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:53,490
make make their you know their nemesis

00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:54,870
look good so your job in any internal

00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,029
group as a project manager

00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:58,740
Rose an external consultant particularly

00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:00,630
if you're an external consultant is to

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,760
try to identify these saboteurs early

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,250
and try to mitigate the risk that they

00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,380
that they have on the project how do you

00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,180
do that well you do it by ensuring that

00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,980
you understand what their hot buttons

00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:12,930
are what their issues what their needs

00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:14,910
are and that you're catering to those

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,950
effectively in terms of making them feel

00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:19,140
comfortable your job is to get them to

00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:20,730
buy in it's not to alienate them from

00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,710
the project they can make more trouble

00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,960
from the outside than they can from the

00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,760
inside so what you really want to do is

00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,980
figure out what aspects of the project

00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,570
they would try to sabotage and try to

00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,250
get them to buy into it think of their

00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:37,380
interests it's very important you get

00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:39,450
buy-in from these people as well this is

00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,660
actually my favorite one um the project

00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:45,779
champion is is a really interesting

00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:48,630
concept so a project champion is is that

00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:50,490
person who is usually highly invested in

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:52,230
the project they have a lot of skin in

00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:54,270
the game they're likely either putting

00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:58,830
their reputation or their career on the

00:09:54,270 --> 00:10:00,660
line they've had a lot of input into the

00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:02,670
selection process and they really

00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:04,650
believe they need to believe that

00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:06,660
they've chosen the right people and the

00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:09,660
right technology to implement for the

00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,790
poor business um a project champion is a

00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,230
really great asset to have inside of an

00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,240
organization because they're going to be

00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:17,640
the ones that go and speak volumes about

00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:19,140
you and go and promote you and work

00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,270
through an organization to make sure

00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,790
that there's buy-in but they can also be

00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:25,110
almost as damaging as the saboteur and a

00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,850
lot of it is because they set

00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,150
unrealistic expectations of what you're

00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:32,370
able to accomplish in addition a project

00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:34,080
champion might not actually have buy-in

00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,700
from everybody inside of the

00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,339
organization there could be political

00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,560
risks there could be five tons often

00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:42,900
times i know jeff has had this happen

00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,060
him he's walked in a project ready to

00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:48,240
start developing and the project

00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:49,680
champion says yeah I'm really sorry but

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,190
our board said that we can't do this

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:55,380
project um that that's been known to

00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:57,089
happen and often times these people are

00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,720
running insurgencies right large

00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:01,950
organizations don't think about

00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,540
technology in terms of we're picking

00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,640
Drupal to do every site that we're ever

00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,990
going to do ever oftentimes you have a

00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,430
project champion that's like I'm going

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,260
to take these five handful

00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:12,029
this this handful of five sites that i

00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,010
own is a part of this greater you know

00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:15,600
thousand site company and i'm going to

00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:17,100
make these drupal and they don't often

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,110
times have the x and they need to really

00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,300
make that happen so you have to really

00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,649
be careful of project champions you want

00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:25,410
to build them up you want to make them

00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:26,580
feel like they're doing the right thing

00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:29,670
and then what you want to make them feel

00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:31,649
again comfortable about their choices

00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:35,220
and and the fact that they have skin in

00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:37,050
the game you want to be aware of of

00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,330
being dishonest with them and you want

00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:42,600
to help them set expectations inside of

00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:45,120
a company and by dishonesty i mean you

00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:46,980
want to make sure that you're very

00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,930
upfront about where potential problems

00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,930
might be coming from because these

00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:53,550
people are putting so much of the their

00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:55,170
own investment in it that they're often

00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:57,450
blind to things that might be happening

00:11:55,170 --> 00:12:00,149
in the project and i guess the last

00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:03,089
thing with that is you know when it when

00:12:00,149 --> 00:12:05,459
it comes to these folks they tend to

00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:06,660
have a lot of pride in the type of work

00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:08,310
that they're doing in what they're

00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,600
trying for the company and you want to

00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:12,270
build them up as people that look good

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,130
in the organization um be willing to

00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:16,350
step back and like and let them lead

00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:18,300
when you reach a major milestone let

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:20,040
them present it to their company as look

00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,900
this is my success and you share in that

00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,339
success together and that's a great way

00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,339
to forge a relationship please people

00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:31,740
yeah in terms of setting expectations i

00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,860
want to go back that picture says it all

00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,959
right expectations can be set for the

00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:38,850
better or for the worse and i think the

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,370
most important aspect of setting

00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:43,200
expectations is determining globally

00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,270
amongst everybody in the project what

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,670
the success criteria are and those

00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:49,500
stakeholders need to be accountable for

00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:51,390
those things you need to be able to go

00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,790
back to a list of things and say this

00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:56,850
project will be successful or determined

00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:59,279
to be successful by management when dot

00:12:56,850 --> 00:13:02,040
dot dot these five things have occurred

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,029
and if you have that buy-in then you do

00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,220
a much better job of setting

00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:07,860
expectations amongst the whole project

00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,320
team so the other way we do it is with

00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:12,209
roles and responsibilities so the key to

00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,279
roles and responsibilities is knowing

00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:16,620
the swim lanes of every single person on

00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:19,020
the project and what i need by swim

00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,120
lanes is literally think about who's

00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,810
doing what in parallel with each other

00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,580
and making

00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:26,070
sure that they're not crossing over you

00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:27,480
don't want you don't want roles and

00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:30,360
responsibilities they're ambiguous

00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:31,640
because you end up with project turn you

00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,080
end up with things that are being done

00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,090
maybe ineffectively by more than one

00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,060
person on the team the key to doing that

00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:41,190
is upfront being very very critically

00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:43,170
clear on what everybody's doing a set of

00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:45,180
bullets under each person's name it says

00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:47,040
I'm this on the project these are my

00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,110
responsibilities this is how I will be

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,600
judged in terms of success on this

00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:53,790
project is very very important and

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,370
another key aspect of that is making

00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:59,400
sure that there's a good understanding

00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:01,170
between the stakeholders are the people

00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:02,670
on the project with those roles and

00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:05,370
responsibilities what their deliverables

00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:08,430
are to each other remember dependencies

00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:10,589
within a project are often as damaging

00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:13,890
to the schedule as dependencies outside

00:14:10,589 --> 00:14:15,930
the project so if I'm if I'm the themer

00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:18,240
and I'm waiting on the information

00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:20,580
architect to provide me wireframes and

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,650
it's it's a week late that affects me

00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:25,080
and impacts me and the damage that it

00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:27,060
does the schedule is bad the damage that

00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:30,660
it does to our working relationship in

00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:32,790
terms of how I hold them responsible or

00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:35,130
accountable for my own failure can be

00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:37,310
even worse maybe later on it stirs this

00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:40,080
sort of sense of intra team

00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:41,370
competitiveness or or backstabbing or

00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,260
something like that which can really in

00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:44,700
danger the project so ensuring that

00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,380
those roles and responsibilities are

00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:48,570
defined and actually written down in the

00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,580
project charter a front helps cut

00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:55,470
through a lot of that a lot of that

00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:57,110
tension between those people so let's

00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:59,370
look at some elements of a project team

00:14:57,110 --> 00:15:01,890
you know these are some very high-level

00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:04,380
roles project teams can be of varying

00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:06,390
size but you almost always have at least

00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:07,890
these four roles representing you want

00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:10,410
have a project manager that's capable of

00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:12,089
liaison with clients that does that that

00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,280
management of a client and also

00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:15,870
oftentimes will liaise with a

00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,870
counterpart on the client side of things

00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,610
so you oftentimes I project managers

00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:24,000
that are really the glue of everybody

00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:26,400
within a particular project um they're

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,160
really the ones that own a lot of the

00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:32,550
end work product but they also typically

00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,980
don't have a lot of control over the

00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:35,670
actual development of resources like

00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,810
they're not the ones

00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:39,810
going to be sitting there typing code

00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:41,880
into into a project they're going to be

00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:44,220
the ones that are talking to the client

00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:46,200
about the progress about the updates I

00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:48,690
kind of like the the idea of a project

00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,860
manager being the one responsible for

00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:52,800
everything but the master of none of

00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:55,830
them and that's a very interesting role

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,390
to play in a project the functional or

00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,740
the project manager realized most

00:15:57,390 --> 00:16:02,010
probably on the functional and technical

00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:03,750
architects there's two sides to this the

00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:06,590
functional side is the person that

00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:08,340
gathers requirements that talks about

00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:10,530
the talks about the business

00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:12,570
requirements behind a project they're

00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:13,830
typically in an analyst role or they're

00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:16,050
typically the ones that are engaging

00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:18,300
more strategically with a client about

00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:20,370
the the big picture ideas of what do you

00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:22,320
want to do tell me about your vision and

00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:25,170
let's talk about how that translates

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,760
into technology that feeds very much

00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:29,210
into the technical folks the technical

00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:32,730
folks tend to be the systems architects

00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:34,350
the the people that are saying all right

00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:36,000
let's let's take this vision that we

00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:37,320
have and these functional requirements

00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,200
and let's figure out how we're going to

00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,550
build a system that meets those needs

00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,740
and then the last piece and this is

00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:45,540
often really overlooked is compliance

00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,010
and when we talk about compliance we

00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,350
talk about a lot of things that that

00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:52,290
companies like ah quia offer where

00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:56,610
there's security audits there's code

00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:58,290
audits there's reviews of different

00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,090
aspects of the project to make sure that

00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:02,190
they're actually meeting what a client

00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:04,380
has said user experience design reviews

00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,900
user testing oftentimes there's

00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,430
independent verification and validation

00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:10,050
through a third party company but that

00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:15,900
compliance role has to be filled and

00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:17,340
it's a really key role I think this is

00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,830
supposed to be a mountain Dew but i'm

00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:21,000
not sure yeah well the project manager

00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:28,350
would have a bottle of scotch in that

00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:30,210
case the other side of the coin is the

00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:32,610
stakeholders this can be a really

00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,270
diverse group of people these are the

00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,160
people that you're ultimately

00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:37,290
responsible to and it's it's their

00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,670
domain knowledge that you're there to

00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:41,400
represent they're the ones that have

00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:43,820
that vision in and it's their vision

00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,110
that gets translated into technology

00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:48,640
oftentimes you have people that that are

00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:50,290
independent project owners they're the

00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,420
you're vice president of blood or

00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:54,910
they're the director of technology for

00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:57,730
blee blee there's all sorts of different

00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:58,930
groups that might be represented here

00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,710
but you usually have a senior manager

00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:03,520
that represents that project ownership

00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:05,820
typically you also have somebody in

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,830
marketing or more the business side of

00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:11,830
development this person is responsible

00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:13,450
for ensuring that the business needs of

00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,250
an organization are met and they're

00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:17,620
usually relied upon by the project owner

00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:20,320
to represent things like content editors

00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,940
to represent things like branding the

00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,310
mission of a particular technology

00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:26,140
project and then lastly you have you

00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:28,150
have editorial and editorial means

00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,190
multiple different things editorial if

00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:32,320
it's a new site can mean the content

00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:34,270
owners editorial if it's if it's a

00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,220
simple site or a social site can

00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:38,170
actually be representative of a much

00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:41,890
wider larger group of people on these

00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:43,510
people are community managers so you

00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:44,620
have these different aspects represented

00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:47,620
in the stakeholder group that you're

00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:49,150
ultimately there to have a high level of

00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:52,210
communication with define success

00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:55,630
criteria with and serve as part of the

00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:58,420
development of this project the last

00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:00,040
group you really have to take a good

00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,400
look at as partners and there's a reason

00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:04,150
why the images are the same here um

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,010
partners often times are very

00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:07,750
representative of stakeholder groups

00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:10,120
because there are another piece of a

00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:12,550
project that has domain knowledge in

00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:15,580
very large projects it's really unlikely

00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:16,900
that one single company is going to be

00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,300
able to deliver all the services

00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,590
required of a major organization and so

00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,330
you're going to be working with partners

00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:24,100
and one of the things you want to be

00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:25,960
very very careful of with these folks is

00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,060
not creating contentious relationships

00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,040
you want to nip that in the bud you want

00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,690
to understand that you can't do

00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,920
everything for a particular client and

00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:36,280
you need to have a positive relationship

00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,930
with these people they may have similar

00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,890
project teams to you they may be of

00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:43,750
similar size they may be a subcontractor

00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:45,610
subcontractor to you you might be a

00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,470
subcontractor to them you may have a

00:19:45,610 --> 00:19:49,270
very tight working relationship where

00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:51,670
you may be very disparate in terms of

00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,930
what your responsibilities are but you

00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:55,090
have to make sure that you work with

00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:57,940
them because that holistic vision of a

00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:59,590
project is really important and it gets

00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,440
back to the stakeholders in a large way

00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:04,509
too and then having good vendor relation

00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,519
chips being able to present that unified

00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:08,080
front of we understand the total

00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:10,029
technology picture to a stakeholder

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:15,159
group is going to help ease conflict

00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:17,200
with them as well yeah so let's talk a

00:20:15,159 --> 00:20:19,450
bit about how to prepare for for a big

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,919
migration one of the most important

00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:25,960
aspects is communication and planning so

00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:27,100
it's absolutely essential upfront that

00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,259
you establish some kind of a

00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,960
communications plan amongst everybody on

00:20:29,259 --> 00:20:33,610
the team that stipulates not only how

00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,289
you're going to communicate amongst the

00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:38,049
project team members but who

00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:40,779
communicates with whom now on a lot of

00:20:38,049 --> 00:20:42,909
cases projects in the beginning tend to

00:20:40,779 --> 00:20:45,220
become a bit of a mess communications

00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:47,110
wise the first twenty to forty percent

00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:50,620
of a project is where the vast majority

00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:53,409
of the the miscommunication occurs and

00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:55,690
and that's incredibly important because

00:20:53,409 --> 00:20:57,009
if you end up with the wrong people

00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:59,019
talking to the wrong people in the

00:20:57,009 --> 00:21:01,000
beginning and you allow that process to

00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:02,769
stick throughout you're going to end up

00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,750
with too many communication channels

00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:07,029
that potentially don't keep the project

00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:09,039
going in the right direction so how do

00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:11,740
you do it well first first and foremost

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,950
you rely on tools establish up front

00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:17,769
what are the ground rules around IRC

00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:20,559
chat instant messaging you know do you

00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:22,929
want people project stakeholders instant

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,879
messaging the developers or is it

00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:28,330
crucial to your project that developers

00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:29,669
remain totally independent from those

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,820
people in terms of real-time

00:21:29,669 --> 00:21:34,870
communications for distraction purposes

00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:37,690
we've seen it we run it both ways

00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:39,279
there's pros and cons to both the key is

00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:40,690
that you establish that jointly amongst

00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:43,090
everyone up front in the project before

00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:45,370
it just becomes something someone starts

00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:47,590
doing halfway down the road and someone

00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,509
else isn't it's also incredibly

00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:52,029
important that you don't rely on email

00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:54,100
everybody gets too much email it's a

00:21:52,029 --> 00:21:57,220
really bad habit to have anything about

00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:59,169
a project at all done oh by email if you

00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:01,720
have to send an email about something

00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:05,049
you should be referencing a link in in a

00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:06,970
wiki or in a communications portal or

00:22:05,049 --> 00:22:08,799
something like that where you have a a

00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:10,059
canonical place that everyone can

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,610
reference for that piece of information

00:22:10,059 --> 00:22:14,230
because these days people aren't going

00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:15,909
to go back through their email and look

00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,300
for that thing the project manager sent

00:22:15,909 --> 00:22:18,130
them

00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,480
five weeks ago just snuck its going to

00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:21,250
get lost it's going to get buried

00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:23,290
particularly when people are working on

00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:25,930
projects that are outside their regular

00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:28,510
job so what we recommend what we do in

00:22:25,930 --> 00:22:30,220
our organization we use open atrium

00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:33,430
which is a distribution that we maintain

00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:36,160
on Drupal um which we are by the way

00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:38,050
moving to Drupal 7 since everybody keeps

00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:41,020
asking that question and it's up on the

00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:43,570
website but they don't know it anyway on

00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,980
something like that base camp is is it

00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,140
is a perfectly good tool that does the

00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:48,940
exact same thing very inexpensive you

00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:51,160
can set up an account right away the key

00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,480
to doing this is not necessarily what

00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,920
tool you have or what features it has

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,110
it's about where that information

00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,480
resides and the fact that all the

00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:00,190
information surrounding any one node or

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,590
piece of information is about your

00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:04,480
project it's not mixed in with a message

00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:06,310
from your boss about expense reports or

00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,600
something like that you need that kind

00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:11,020
of clarity when you're working on the

00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:13,930
project other things have a lot to do

00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:16,300
with in person versus phone calls versus

00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:17,800
skype vs google hangouts it's very

00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:19,120
important that you establish the manner

00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,710
in which are going to communicate with

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,570
all the people that Chris was referring

00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,460
to the stakeholders and all those

00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:26,010
partners and all those people establish

00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,300
all that any communications plan upfront

00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:30,430
expected it's going to change but at

00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:32,230
least agree on it and agree to change it

00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:34,690
as as the project proves that those

00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:37,240
aren't the best methods other very

00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:40,540
important tools obviously include ticket

00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:43,300
management so we used we use JIRA from

00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:45,010
at lassen which is a which is a tiny

00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,770
little company here in Australia that

00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:51,940
you may not have heard of but that's a

00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:53,170
joke but nobody lasts anyway um we did

00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,150
start working with chair actually in

00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:58,240
about two thousand three so we watched

00:23:55,150 --> 00:24:00,340
them grow from maybe 15 people or

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,430
something when we were using it and now

00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:05,590
it's it's it's a fantastic tool whether

00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:07,360
you use that or read mine or bugzilla or

00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:09,280
something else you know open source

00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,810
doesn't matter the key is that you have

00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,940
some place in which people can actually

00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:15,910
have some transparency and some

00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:17,860
visibility into what tasks everybody on

00:24:15,910 --> 00:24:20,440
the team is working on and that helps a

00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:22,210
lot with the with the communication

00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:24,700
amongst the team because people tend to

00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:27,190
understand when someone else is swamped

00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:30,230
or busier better when they can see a

00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:31,730
backlog for them then just feeling

00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:33,230
like you know they're picking up on

00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:35,419
their you know their stress or something

00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,520
like that so communications and planning

00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:39,919
probably the most important aspect up

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,660
front communications plans tools and

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,600
team agreement on how you're going to

00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:47,059
communicate with each other and one last

00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,350
thing on the communication front you

00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:51,260
know I talked a little bit earlier about

00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:52,549
stakeholders your communication is your

00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,380
way of reaching higher up in the

00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:55,340
organization to make sure you're not

00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:58,610
working with somebody that hasn't

00:24:55,340 --> 00:25:00,020
secured buy-in from their boss having

00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:01,970
that communication be able to reach

00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:03,290
upward inside of an organization is your

00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:04,760
pathway to making sure that you're

00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:06,679
working on the right project and you're

00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,450
defining success criteria that are

00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:10,570
representative of the organization not

00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:12,679
just the needs of that project owner

00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:16,429
that's that's a really key piece of a

00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:18,770
communications plan estimating

00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:20,540
estimating is a really really big topic

00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:23,150
it could be an entire presentation and

00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:25,070
often is and I would recommend that you

00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:26,510
if you in the position where you're

00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,580
doing project management or you're doing

00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,780
consulting to a client take advantage of

00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,490
some of the great talks that have been

00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:35,020
given it dribble cons and dribble camps

00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:37,970
around this what I will say is running a

00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:40,309
professional services organization for

00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:43,040
the last twelve years that we've been in

00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:45,169
business our ability to estimate as it's

00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:48,020
matured has contributed directly to our

00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:49,880
ability to mature the professionalism

00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,860
and growth to the company and that's

00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,990
because essentially that's how we set

00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:56,450
our price we set our price by estimating

00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:59,630
a project in many ways whether it's time

00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,770
and materials or it's fixed price bid or

00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:03,950
something like that it doesn't really

00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:05,660
matter you're still your currency is

00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:07,400
determining how much time your team is

00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:10,370
going to take to do that work so it's

00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:13,010
absolutely essential I will say that

00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:14,990
even if you're working inside an

00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:17,320
organization I think it's equally

00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:20,169
important one of the things I've seen

00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:23,179
contribute to project failure a lot is

00:26:20,169 --> 00:26:24,770
professional services organizations like

00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:27,710
ourselves come in and we have a high

00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:29,660
degree of rigor and expectation around

00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:31,309
how we estimate everything from the

00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,929
ticket level where we insist that the

00:26:31,309 --> 00:26:34,760
developer or the person doing the work

00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:36,950
is actually doing the estimate and we're

00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:40,100
rolling all these up sort of a ground-up

00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:41,570
process we often also do a top-down so

00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,190
we do two things to meet in the middle

00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:44,179
and get two data points we have a

00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:46,100
project manager do

00:26:44,179 --> 00:26:47,570
the top developers and everyone else on

00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,490
the team do it from the bottom it gets

00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:52,279
rolled up and the third data point is

00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:54,320
often a related project so we go into

00:26:52,279 --> 00:26:55,909
our project repository and say what

00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,100
project could be done in the last five

00:26:55,909 --> 00:27:00,259
years it looks most like this and not

00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:02,929
what did we estimate that at but what

00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:04,669
did it actually take and now we have a

00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:06,619
real data point and those three data

00:27:04,669 --> 00:27:07,909
points if they're correlated around

00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:10,759
something give you a pretty good sense

00:27:07,909 --> 00:27:12,350
of where things are going to end up what

00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:15,049
we've seen contribute to projects

00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:16,669
failure is the internal team the

00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:18,830
internal group that's working on the

00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:21,169
project doesn't have the same rigor and

00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:23,840
customs and culture around doing

00:27:21,169 --> 00:27:25,669
estimates as a result what happens is

00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,919
their estimates tend to be driven more

00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:29,539
by what their project stakeholders and

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,730
their project manager thinks it's going

00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:33,799
to take it's a one it's just a tot it's

00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:35,059
just a top-down so you know that they

00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:36,619
get out the Gantt chart and the project

00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:39,139
manager says we think we can do it in

00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:40,909
this long and they push that down to the

00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:42,470
developers and developers don't get a

00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:44,779
chance to estimate their own tickets and

00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:46,549
bring that back up for reality check so

00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:48,860
if you're dealing with a project where

00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:50,690
maybe your estimation processes has a

00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:53,240
lot of rigor but but the other side of

00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:59,019
the site of the group doesn't watch out

00:27:53,240 --> 00:28:01,249
that's a sign for failure as well so uh

00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:02,299
we need to talk about my creating a site

00:28:01,249 --> 00:28:05,059
what do you what are you talking about

00:28:02,299 --> 00:28:07,070
um there's all sorts of things and it's

00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:10,730
not just content it can be everything

00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:13,570
from you know the actual nodes of a site

00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:16,549
to a bunch of documents in a repository

00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:18,320
it can be multiple different databases

00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:20,269
that are all having to change over as a

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,279
part of a site build it can even be

00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:24,350
something like you know we're moving

00:28:22,279 --> 00:28:27,559
from svn to get and we need to migrate

00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:30,259
all of this this code data from one sort

00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:31,820
of repository to another um there's also

00:28:30,259 --> 00:28:33,499
lots of different proprietary data

00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,820
formats and things that you have to

00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:37,580
think about when you're doing a site

00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:40,009
build you know the other part of this

00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:41,929
that isn't really listed here is social

00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:43,820
so what happens to all those facebook

00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:47,330
comments that are tied to something in

00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:50,570
campfire what are all or wildfire excuse

00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:52,460
me um what about all of the the tweets

00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:54,259
that referenced old articles what about

00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:57,139
all these things that you've done to

00:28:54,259 --> 00:28:58,160
publish this content across the web how

00:28:57,139 --> 00:29:02,270
do you take that in

00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:04,400
to a new site this sort of inventory

00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:06,980
process is really important because it's

00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,690
a two-stage thing you first want to say

00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:10,730
all right let's look at everything that

00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,990
we possibly can move and then you want

00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:13,910
to pare that down to what do we need to

00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:15,410
move to make this successful and so

00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:16,940
that's that's where the inventory side

00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:19,580
of this becomes a really important part

00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:22,520
um once you have that you also want to

00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:24,200
do a second step which is refreshing and

00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,090
reorganizing Jeff actually came up with

00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,490
a really great analogy for this when you

00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:30,440
are moving houses so you're taking all

00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:31,490
your furniture all your possessions and

00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:34,010
you're going from one house to another

00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:35,210
do you arrange the furniture the exact

00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:38,690
same way in the new house as you would

00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:40,640
in the old um you know do you give it an

00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:41,960
opportunity take everything with you you

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,490
give an opportunity to have a yard sale

00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,840
and sell off some of the stuff you maybe

00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:47,570
don't want anymore maybe doesn't fit the

00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:49,250
new house um it's really important that

00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:51,230
you take the time once you do that

00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:52,610
content inventory to decide what you

00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:55,820
need to move and also to make

00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:57,890
modifications to the types of content

00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:04,250
that you want to change when you get to

00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:05,360
the new site so again I'm getting all

00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:08,870
the topics that could be their own

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,340
presentation architecture in and this is

00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:12,440
not a technical talk so keep in mind

00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,940
architecture to us is much about

00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:17,390
business architecture and business logic

00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:19,790
as it is technology stack architectures

00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:21,920
are an incredibly important activity

00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:24,020
that tends to get rushed through or

00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,850
tends to be done by the wrong people the

00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,170
people doing architecture ought to be

00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:29,030
the most experienced people in the

00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:31,580
project if they're not something's wrong

00:30:29,030 --> 00:30:33,200
your tech lead your your most senior

00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:35,150
person needs to be involved and in our

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,950
case all the way to the CTO is going to

00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:38,540
have an oversight and a review of that

00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:40,670
architecture for every single client

00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:43,010
because that's that right there is your

00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:45,050
reputation that is the that is the

00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:47,090
moment of purity that you're providing

00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:49,880
to that client in terms of technical

00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:51,980
thinking and it has to be right and if

00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,660
it's not right that's okay but you have

00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:56,240
to have a process to modify it and fix

00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:58,100
it along the way the way the way I think

00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,840
of architecture is you have to

00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,130
completely understand the future

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,750
requirements as well as the current

00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:04,670
requirements to get it right and that

00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:06,710
means really understanding what aspects

00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:09,170
of it need to be flexible what parts

00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:11,600
need to be modular and don't just assume

00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:12,860
that the toolset that you have

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,570
the way that other people have used it

00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:16,130
is the right way look around and find

00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:17,960
out how other people have used that tool

00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:25,270
set to make sure that there aren't

00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:27,620
better ways to set it up yeah yeah I

00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:31,340
said delivering to the client really not

00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:32,809
selling to the client but yeah so it's

00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,549
it's great to have all these these

00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:35,570
things that we need to think about when

00:31:34,549 --> 00:31:38,780
we're doing it but what's really the

00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:42,049
process for getting from that inventory

00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:44,360
stage all the way to a pre-launch so

00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:46,880
these are kind of a quick series of

00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,110
slides of packaging those things that we

00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,990
talked about in the previous section

00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:54,980
into a more cohesive process for going

00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:57,100
live I think that this sort of speaks to

00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:59,960
very similar topics what we've covered

00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,970
but it will show a way of implementing

00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:06,350
these in a real chain of events to get

00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:08,270
to an end result so moving data and most

00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:10,179
larger Enterprise integrations this is

00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:12,620
going to be an automated process

00:32:10,179 --> 00:32:14,780
hopefully you've got people on the team

00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,970
or a person the team at least who's

00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:18,860
capable of scripting stuff understands

00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:21,049
database schemas and structures and

00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:23,720
understands triple on how to use the

00:32:21,049 --> 00:32:26,659
triple API there are good modules out

00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:29,929
there again I get every topic that could

00:32:26,659 --> 00:32:31,429
be a full taste but this this one no you

00:32:29,929 --> 00:32:34,070
gave it a no this is good i like it

00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:37,010
given the CEO the all the tech tech ones

00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:39,650
so in our shop we we use things like the

00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:42,409
migrated module which which allow you to

00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:44,659
help migrate content into drupal we also

00:32:42,409 --> 00:32:47,120
do a lot of database scripting we do a

00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:49,250
lot of cleansing along the way so

00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:51,530
cleaning up content I'll talk about that

00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:53,150
in a minute but consider this to be a

00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:55,730
vital thing a vital decision that you're

00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:57,770
going to make we have had I don't know

00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:59,450
how many clients tell us you know what

00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:02,270
don't worry about that it's expensive

00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:03,440
it's difficult it's risky we don't want

00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:05,690
to pull that off we're just going to

00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,909
re-enter the content ourselves

00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:09,440
they're not they're gonna they're going

00:33:07,909 --> 00:33:12,590
to end up relying on you to do that

00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,549
anyway so whether or not you think this

00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:15,350
is going to be a part of your process

00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:17,360
plan for it to be part of your process

00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:19,460
if you don't have the skill set in house

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,380
to do it go out and get someone that can

00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:22,610
do this process don't assume that the

00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,200
content owners are actually going to

00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:26,559
re-enter the content by hand they're

00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:29,389
just not going to do it

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,549
again just like Chris said earlier use

00:33:29,389 --> 00:33:32,690
it as an opportunity to clean up a lot

00:33:31,549 --> 00:33:34,249
of times content that you're bringing

00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:35,840
over isn't just coming over from one

00:33:34,249 --> 00:33:38,509
platform it's coming over from three

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,440
platforms ago and that stuff might have

00:33:38,509 --> 00:33:43,789
been late 90s it may have had a lot of

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,499
embedded HTML stuff that you want to

00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:47,690
clean out it could have been scraped off

00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:50,149
of Word documents and been dropped

00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:54,679
through WYSIWYG xin which all kinds of

00:33:50,149 --> 00:33:56,389
nasty nasty proprietary encoding has

00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:58,669
been dropped into the into the database

00:33:56,389 --> 00:34:00,110
that can cause you a lot of problems a

00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:01,730
lot of pain and again as Chris said

00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,350
earlier this is your opportunity to

00:34:01,730 --> 00:34:05,659
clean it up so look at transformation

00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:08,510
processes look at cleansing script out

00:34:05,659 --> 00:34:10,909
javis get the javascript stuff that's in

00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:13,609
there out get any bads tags and things

00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:15,889
that wizzy wegs and word processing dot

00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:18,349
you know programs and stuff put in there

00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:19,970
out during this process and for God's

00:34:18,349 --> 00:34:24,470
sake make sure your client your content

00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:25,669
is just as clean as possible so once you

00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:26,599
have that content up there you want to

00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:29,869
make sure that you take a look at it

00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:32,540
have a keen critical eye to what's gone

00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:34,970
up there a big part of this is context

00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:36,859
right when you have new content in a new

00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:38,450
system in a prototype way you want to be

00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:40,190
able to take a look at this content then

00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:41,960
in context and understand what it's

00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:43,280
going to look like in the new site and

00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:46,399
that's really what the review is all

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,899
about um engagement around the entire

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:49,010
organization is again really important

00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:50,690
at this phase because you don't want

00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:52,099
content to just look good two editors

00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:53,540
you want it to look good to users and

00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:58,099
other folks that are going to be

00:34:53,540 --> 00:35:00,140
interacting the site so it for anyone

00:34:58,099 --> 00:35:01,700
thats Audrey's is keynote you know or

00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:03,560
most of you probably already know from

00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:06,050
firsthand experience drupal has some

00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:08,450
difficulties in terms of the way that

00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:10,010
the deployment process works again this

00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:11,720
isn't a technical talk so I'm not going

00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:14,420
to talk around sort of how Drupal 8 may

00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:17,210
fix that or what tools are available but

00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:18,500
if you are responsible for planning or

00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:20,030
managing any kind of project in which

00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,369
you're going to be using Drupal in any

00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:23,240
kind of large-scale understand that a

00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:25,220
you're going to need different

00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,310
environments so you're going to need to

00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:29,450
direct your content people at a specific

00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:31,579
environment that's dealing with just

00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:33,829
content you're going to have some kind

00:35:31,579 --> 00:35:36,170
of a staging or anime be an integration

00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:37,130
environment for your developers and of

00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:39,200
course you're going to have production

00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,579
which is going to be a sacred place

00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,619
understanding what these different

00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:44,900
environments are how they're used how

00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:46,820
they're procured upfront and educating

00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,680
your whole project team on how to use

00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:50,630
them effectively is a really important

00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:52,310
part of limiting the friction on the

00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:54,020
project can't tell you how many times

00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:55,579
people are just testing on the wrong

00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:57,619
server putting content in the wrong

00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:59,810
server something like that and it's just

00:35:57,619 --> 00:36:01,280
a really painful part of sort of the

00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:03,410
friction of the project that you want to

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,000
try to eliminate it's very important

00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:06,410
that you think about that upfront and

00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,390
you come up with the scheme that your

00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:11,300
project is going to use to manage the

00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:13,609
deployment process that goes as far as

00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:15,320
you know potentially having automated

00:36:13,609 --> 00:36:17,030
continuous integration processes and

00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:18,440
things like that if your project is

00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:20,240
mature and you have that kind of

00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,859
software maturity in your organization

00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,900
you're going to want to do that if you

00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:25,550
don't you need to make that decision up

00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,920
front and decide if you're going to do

00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:29,119
it the old-fashioned way get on the same

00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,800
page so that you don't have those

00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,030
arguments down the road at three

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,030
quarters of the way through the project

00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:52,260
there's another piece of this to a

00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:54,340
social integration I this is a huge

00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:57,430
passionate thing that I have here um

00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:59,650
when you talk about content these days

00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:01,870
you're not talking about consuming

00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:03,370
content in a web browser you're talking

00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:05,080
about consuming on mobile devices in

00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:07,150
mobile apps you're talking about looking

00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:09,220
at it in terms of feeds in facebook and

00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:11,440
linkedin and twitter all of these

00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:14,260
different channels that we look at for

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:15,580
our content now are incredibly important

00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,950
to understand when you're about to

00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:19,330
migrate a site if I'm going to publish

00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:20,860
an article what does that article look

00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:23,170
like when I tweet about it how does it

00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:26,290
get into Facebook do I have Micro data

00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:27,640
and metadata formats you know am I

00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:30,000
needing to consider the semantic web

00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:32,560
stuff when when I look at this um

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:35,050
there's all sorts of aspects of

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,000
integration here that are very often

00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:39,460
overlooked and this is what the web is

00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:42,070
becoming people want social they want

00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:44,980
mobile they want this way of sharing and

00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:46,480
consuming information on their own terms

00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:48,190
and if you don't have a site that

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,840
supports that and you have a test of

00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:52,210
that as a part of your migration you're

00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:53,560
overlooking a huge portion of where your

00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:58,690
users are going to be interacting with

00:37:53,560 --> 00:38:00,700
you can't say enough about the

00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:02,680
importance of code review this is about

00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,510
quality it's about having a process

00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,820
internally within the team to determine

00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:09,910
when code is okay to go into a

00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:12,250
production environment on our teams we

00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:15,130
tend to have a hierarchy so we have

00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:17,410
multiple people looking at code will do

00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:20,350
random checks will do planned code

00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:23,050
reviews we use tools like crucible and

00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:25,000
fish I also from at lassen to make this

00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:26,740
part of our process so this is all

00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,600
integrated with our JIRA tickets and

00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:30,130
things like that it's incredibly

00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,450
important that you establish up front

00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,340
how that's going to happen and you

00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:34,960
filter that down to all your developers

00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:36,340
so that if you're got two or three

00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:38,350
different developers at different skill

00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:40,420
sets that they each understand how their

00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:41,440
codes going to be reviewed and what kind

00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,820
of feedback and what kind of

00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,860
expectations are going to be put upon

00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:49,210
them by more senior people on the team

00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:51,040
more and more larger enterprises are

00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:53,350
dealing with proprietary customer

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,600
information you have various compliance

00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:57,280
laws in the United States we have stuff

00:38:55,600 --> 00:39:01,510
like a

00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:04,570
fisma and and HIPAA and all these other

00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:07,300
large large sets of compliance standards

00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:10,090
that we have to to meet in order to

00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:12,760
protect people's information a website

00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:14,560
hack on a scale that it releases you

00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:16,090
know a tremendous amount of people's

00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,920
personal health care information is

00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:20,830
something that as a business you don't

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,480
really recover from it's something that

00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:25,020
damages your credibility and your

00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:27,910
ability to even work in that space again

00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:29,470
security is a paramount concern for

00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:32,560
enterprise and it's one of those things

00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:35,080
that if you don't have an independent

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,960
verification and validation process get

00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:40,120
one immediately it's incredibly

00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,800
important that you use outside people to

00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:44,560
independently verify your assumptions

00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:47,260
around security I cannot stress enough

00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,210
the need to to understand how to write

00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:51,430
secure code and moreover to have

00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:52,780
somebody else that is not a part of your

00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:55,720
team tell you that yes that code is

00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,770
secure it's a really critical piece of

00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:01,090
making sure that you have a successful

00:39:56,770 --> 00:40:04,150
site launch now we're in talk a little

00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:06,100
bit about the the transition itself so

00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:10,720
how do you go from all these different

00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:12,880
pieces into a new live site the plan is

00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,470
pretty simple you go through all that

00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:17,640
content preparation stuff you have that

00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:20,560
QA feedback verification side of things

00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:23,740
we've talked about most of the pieces of

00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:25,690
those two aspects of this plan what we

00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:28,240
really wanted to focus a little bit more

00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:32,350
on is the people prep side of things so

00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:34,690
once you have this this idea of my

00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:36,700
contents ready my codes ready how do I

00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:38,710
get my people ready for this site to

00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,120
transition and then right leading up to

00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:41,650
site launch what are the tasks that you

00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:46,510
have to do to ensure that you're going

00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:48,040
to have successful launch content prep

00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:50,140
right before launch is an amazingly

00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:52,420
important aspect of making people feel

00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:54,850
comfortable and happy about the launch

00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:57,130
it's it's really actually kind of funny

00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:59,950
when you launched hundreds or thousands

00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:01,540
of websites you you watch and you and

00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:04,330
you think well this thing's going to be

00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:05,980
up here for years and every single day

00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:07,540
there's a there's a decision on what's

00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:10,090
going to go on the homepage but that

00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:10,750
first day oh my god is it important

00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:13,210
because the whole

00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:15,610
old is watching right so be sensitive to

00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:18,010
that understand that that may not seem

00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:19,840
as especially as a technical person like

00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:21,220
the most important thing you know that

00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,080
there's other things that need to happen

00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:24,340
to go live but for those content

00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,470
maintainer maintain errs in particular

00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:27,970
this is a very important first step to

00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:33,430
feeling comfortable with the launch of

00:41:27,970 --> 00:41:34,870
the site you also have to look at a QA

00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:37,270
and feedback process make sure that

00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:39,520
you're still doing your fundamentals of

00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:41,680
development because you've got a launch

00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,750
deadline that's a week away don't

00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:45,130
compromise your QA and feedback process

00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,480
make sure that you have the right people

00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:48,340
reviewing things make sure that you get

00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,840
those final sign offs make sure that you

00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:51,160
look at those success criteria you

00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,320
talked about earlier and that you've hit

00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:55,540
every single one of them it's really

00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,340
important that you not compromise this

00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:58,990
it's much better to move a site launch

00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:01,990
than it is to launch with a site that's

00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:03,940
not gone through the process of QA and

00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:07,510
validation that you've set up as a part

00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:10,240
of the project this is not an official

00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:13,420
statistic but I'd say over the last 10

00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:17,220
years we've launched literally thousands

00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:19,750
of Drupal sites and i'd say maybe

00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:22,030
somewhere between sixty and seventy

00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:25,720
percent of our launches are pushed back

00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:28,330
by the client and I remind my team that

00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:30,550
all the time for not because I want them

00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:32,140
to slack on the deadline but because I

00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:34,840
want them to pay attention to that last

00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:36,550
slide which is don't compromise your

00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:39,040
quality to meet a deadline that the

00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:42,280
client is going to move anyway do a good

00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:44,620
job and if you if you end up going live

00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,970
that day you're going to be happy for it

00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,170
if it ends up getting pushed you're

00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:48,640
going to be glad that you didn't cut

00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:53,650
corners to hit a deadline that didn't

00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:55,420
happen um training oh oh I get talked

00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:58,210
about training cool all right training

00:42:55,420 --> 00:43:01,060
yeah is a huge topic that you could do a

00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:03,370
whole presentation on the training is an

00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:05,380
enormous part of what happens with any

00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:06,880
CMS build a lot of it is about the

00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:10,540
psychology of getting people to

00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:13,030
understand with the new system it's some

00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:15,160
button-pushing we talk a lot about the

00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:16,600
interface and Drupal and how it's not

00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,040
always client friendly but you know

00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:19,870
guess what you can change a lot of that

00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,580
if you have that built in your project

00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:23,950
and you've got the time you can modify

00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:24,430
aspects of the administrative screens to

00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:27,370
be whatever

00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:29,950
you need it doesn't matter at the end of

00:43:27,370 --> 00:43:32,170
the day if people aren't fundamentally

00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:34,570
comfortable with it well before you go

00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:36,610
live so if you start that training

00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:38,200
process and you even integrate it in as

00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:40,480
sort of testing training it's okay to

00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:42,280
mix those two on the content side if

00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,710
you're dealing with containers it's ok

00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:47,170
to do iterative reviews very early on

00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:48,640
and just tell them hey this is me

00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:49,900
teaching you how to use the system and

00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:51,460
you telling me what's wrong with the

00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:54,190
system and we just mix it all together

00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:56,470
we'll just make tickets as we go start

00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:59,110
early do it often don't wait to the end

00:43:56,470 --> 00:44:00,960
and you know have this big training

00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:03,730
process because guess what rest assured

00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,530
guaranteed if you do it waterfall and at

00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:07,810
the very end before you go live you do

00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:11,290
one big set of trainings you will find

00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:13,840
so many bugs so many problems in that

00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:16,930
process you will be kicking yourself so

00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:18,880
hard so it's better to mix them up I

00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:20,980
know it sounds like it's not a good

00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,080
process it's kind of like why would you

00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:24,460
mix testing and training well really

00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,650
honestly it's still that you get

00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:29,080
feedback earlier in the process and you

00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:30,880
get them sort of gradually accustomed to

00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:32,740
it you know it's better to get sort of

00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,240
slowly accustomed to the temperature

00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:36,160
change than it is to sort of do it all

00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:38,170
at once right it's the same philosophy

00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,600
so I think training as many assets

00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:41,890
aspects to it that's the one I feel is

00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,050
most important and relevant for this

00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:45,550
presentation but you know if you want to

00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:51,400
talk more we can talk for days about

00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:52,780
that alone this is a this is one of

00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:55,630
those interesting things because people

00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:57,370
think about launch day as walking into

00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:59,860
Mission Control during the moon landing

00:44:57,370 --> 00:45:01,930
and you know they've got 25 people all

00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:05,020
in rows and check everything's good

00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:07,330
everything's good um the reality is is

00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:09,730
that the planning for that day starts

00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:11,650
well before launch date you want to pick

00:45:09,730 --> 00:45:13,600
a date that's reasonable that's that's

00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:15,310
something that you're sure your team can

00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,800
be repaired on you want to have a launch

00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:23,140
checklist you don't want to get into the

00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:25,000
habit of setting expectations around a

00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:26,170
launch before you have any idea if

00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,360
you're actually going to reasonably able

00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:30,610
to attain that goal lots of people look

00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:32,140
at you know I have a site build that's

00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:36,010
going to take a year and I'm going to

00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:38,140
launch january first 2014 sitting here

00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:40,779
today we would have no idea if that's

00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:42,250
realistic date or not we can say that

00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:44,319
you know we can take the project to a

00:45:42,250 --> 00:45:45,970
point but requirements change things

00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,230
change with clients things change with

00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:50,859
the way that you move forward with

00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:53,559
things I would say very much try as hard

00:45:50,859 --> 00:45:55,720
as you can not to set a launch date in

00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:57,430
stone because if you're building a

00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:59,680
project to a date you're always

00:45:57,430 --> 00:46:02,740
ultimately compromising what you want to

00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,450
deliver um if you're basing a date based

00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,440
on what you're able to deliver you're

00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:07,690
going to have better client satisfaction

00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:13,539
a better launch and things are going to

00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:18,700
go much more smoothly alright so the

00:46:13,539 --> 00:46:20,680
launch itself done easy what do you

00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:21,760
really need to do you know from a

00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,430
technical perspective you need to

00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,289
prepare for traffic but that's also

00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:29,170
that's also a business user things so

00:46:26,289 --> 00:46:31,750
you know having a really good picture of

00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:34,750
what you expect to happen on launch day

00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:37,210
and post launch in terms of visitors is

00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:38,529
really important so you know are you

00:46:37,210 --> 00:46:40,269
going to get a whole bunch of new

00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:42,010
authenticated users because now you're

00:46:40,269 --> 00:46:44,470
offering a login mechanism that wasn't

00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:45,759
there is that the kind of profile that

00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:48,220
you're going to have for launch day or

00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:50,230
are is it going to something that your

00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:52,000
PR department or marketing group or

00:46:50,230 --> 00:46:54,160
somebody's going to manage to get into

00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,109
mainstream media and your spike your

00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,619
traffic spike is going to be two hundred

00:46:56,109 --> 00:47:01,569
percent your normal day and you didn't

00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:03,400
know about that because nobody told you

00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:05,710
that marketing was going to get that out

00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,000
into some mainstream media circle those

00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:08,829
are really important things to

00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,210
understand because you may have designed

00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:12,220
the site to handle a certain amount of

00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:15,039
users but they really really have a way

00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:16,779
of blowing it up on day one some sites

00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:18,910
are quite the opposite you've got a real

00:47:16,779 --> 00:47:20,589
slow launch it's really important to you

00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:23,440
guys but the rest of the world is just a

00:47:20,589 --> 00:47:24,490
random tuesday you know so i think it's

00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,859
very important you understand that

00:47:24,490 --> 00:47:28,450
profile there's a lot of things that you

00:47:26,859 --> 00:47:30,150
need to do technically obviously you

00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:33,130
need to be thinking about caching

00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:36,160
technologies and NC dns and all that to

00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:39,460
manage that but really that launch day

00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:41,980
is the is the most important time to

00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:44,529
handle your traffic because you can go

00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:46,900
down six months from then you know four

00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:49,000
for four hours and you won't get smacked

00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:50,529
as hard by the air client or management

00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,640
as you will if you go down for four

00:47:50,529 --> 00:47:56,470
seconds on

00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:59,920
lunch day and congratulations you've

00:47:56,470 --> 00:48:01,840
made it you've launched a site um you

00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:03,160
know it's it's a great feeling when a

00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,860
project goes well and it's a really

00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:07,330
terrible feeling when it doesn't and you

00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,590
want to make sure that you follow the

00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:10,210
techniques and the things that we talked

00:48:08,590 --> 00:48:12,010
about in order to have more positive

00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:13,930
launch days you want to have that

00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:15,510
confidence to hit that button and that's

00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:19,600
really what this this talk is all about

00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:23,200
you know a successful launch leads to

00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:24,910
client satisfaction referral work more

00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,840
projects down the line in success

00:48:24,910 --> 00:48:26,920
stories that you can tell for your

00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:31,570
company and that's what you're trying to

00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:34,570
build never plan a project that ends on

00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:37,810
launch day think about that for a second

00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:40,030
never it's the it's the absolute worst

00:48:37,810 --> 00:48:42,190
end to a project plan though every

00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:44,620
project plan should end at some point

00:48:42,190 --> 00:48:46,480
after launch day maybe it's two days

00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:49,090
maybe it's a week two weeks to months

00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:50,410
but that what happens immediately after

00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:52,300
launch is just as important as

00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:54,580
immediately prior launch because that's

00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:56,200
when all those new content those content

00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:58,150
editors we're talking about are actually

00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,370
using the system for real and that's

00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:02,530
also when they're going to discover the

00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:04,510
25 things they never understood about

00:49:02,530 --> 00:49:05,950
the training process it's when all those

00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:07,240
traffic patterns that we talked about

00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:10,210
are going to start to become apparent

00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:12,190
it's when the CEO finally looks at the

00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:15,160
website that you've asked him to review

00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:17,500
10 * party going live you know he looks

00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:19,720
at it that weekend on his iPad and goes

00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:22,150
oh this thing doesn't look right you

00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:25,870
know or whatever so you know it's really

00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:27,880
about understanding your true endpoint

00:49:25,870 --> 00:49:29,440
and your endpoint with any website is

00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,840
never right it's always going to be an

00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,880
improving thing but your project can't

00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:35,680
and the day the website lot you know

00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,810
launches it's got to be some point

00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,920
thereafter and I think it's a really

00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:42,460
important thing for all of us to

00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:44,320
remember but obviously it will continue

00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:45,670
from there as well so that's just a

00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:50,760
different part of this and we don't have

00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:50,760
time for it so questions

00:50:16,369 --> 00:50:20,609
so the question for the recording and

00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,490
for those that couldn't hear is um

00:50:20,609 --> 00:50:25,770
having specific I think to phase two

00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:27,900
right having done a lot of a lot of

00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:29,820
builds over the years do we have some

00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:32,880
kind of a custom admin interface that we

00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:35,640
use that handles the way we do the

00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:38,250
content process and things like that the

00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:42,060
answer is no we've done a lot of

00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:44,220
different custom content interfaces we

00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:45,869
don't tend to reuse them a lot even when

00:50:44,220 --> 00:50:47,520
the clients given us permission or is

00:50:45,869 --> 00:50:49,710
willing to contribute them and the

00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,240
reason is that they were typically done

00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:54,810
with something unique to that

00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:57,869
organization we did one for the Thompson

00:50:54,810 --> 00:51:00,020
Reuters Olympic site so on reuters com

00:50:57,869 --> 00:51:03,450
we did the Olympics process they were

00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:05,940
adamant that the users don't have to

00:51:03,450 --> 00:51:07,470
know or think about or understand drupal

00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:09,060
and they didn't want them to see the

00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:11,820
drupal interface they wanted them to see

00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:13,560
in their face that looked Reuters ish as

00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:16,350
if they had built it you know themselves

00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:18,900
so we changed colors and styles we

00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:20,460
change workflow and layout we use the

00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,080
workbench module we tend to use

00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:24,150
workbench that's one answer I guess to

00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:26,100
your question which allows for a better

00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:28,560
content administrator sort of queuing

00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:30,600
process and things like that but we made

00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:33,690
it look more like Reuters and it was

00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:35,760
orange and and they called it drop which

00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:37,980
was a code word for Drupal and it even

00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,410
had the Drupal logo but they didn't want

00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:41,880
their their editorial team you know

00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:43,410
going out on the internet and being like

00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:45,210
oh i'm going to drupal what's

00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:46,650
Drupal you know and then going to that

00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:48,900
process they just wanted to obscure a

00:51:46,650 --> 00:51:51,150
lot of that to avoid the politics in

00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:53,490
other cases we have distributions that

00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:56,369
we use in those distributions have in

00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:57,990
many cases tended to alter the the admin

00:51:56,369 --> 00:52:00,390
interface a little bit for certain

00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:09,960
functions but typically it's different

00:52:00,390 --> 00:52:11,430
for every project other questions we

00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:14,040
didn't we didn't open enough enough

00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:16,650
subjects for for questions it's like

00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:18,630
what it's like like why don't we just

00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:23,150
touch really lightly on a lot of things

00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:23,150
that could be a talk Xena

00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:45,060
um yeah so we we have people in house oh

00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:47,970
I'm sorry your question is um have we

00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:50,580
had a lot of success with getting people

00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:52,380
either internally or externally on a

00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:59,190
retainer basis that can do content

00:52:52,380 --> 00:53:00,660
transition okay right so internally have

00:52:59,190 --> 00:53:04,860
we had success finding someone who could

00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:06,270
do the content migration right we've had

00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:09,300
we've done content migration a lot of

00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:11,100
different ways we tend to have a kind of

00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:14,910
a rotation amongst our development team

00:53:11,100 --> 00:53:17,160
so that no one person is like the go to

00:53:14,910 --> 00:53:19,710
you know always has to be the content

00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:22,800
migration person we think it's a skill

00:53:19,710 --> 00:53:24,810
set that everybody on the you know all

00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:28,050
the developers should have so they

00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:32,430
understand a lot about the content we

00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:36,390
have clients who have trained people in

00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:39,780
house to do it I'll be really honest it

00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:41,010
typically fails I mentioned earlier if a

00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:43,110
client tells you that they're going to

00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:45,330
move the content themselves and don't

00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:46,740
bother with content migration this is

00:53:45,330 --> 00:53:49,500
like a ninety percent chance they're

00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:50,940
going to change their mind if the client

00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,730
says they're going to do it themselves

00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:56,580
and their DBA is going to learn the

00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:59,880
Drupal API and migrate that data there's

00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:01,020
like a sixty-five percent chance they're

00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:03,270
not going to work and they're going to

00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:06,180
come back to us or or call someone else

00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:08,490
in we just don't tend to see people that

00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:10,410
don't haven't done Drupal and haven't

00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:12,420
done large migrations even if they

00:54:10,410 --> 00:54:14,160
understand database stuff and schemas

00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:16,230
and all that they just typically aren't

00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:20,190
successful in doing it it's it's it's

00:54:16,230 --> 00:54:22,380
it's a shockingly technical and tedious

00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:27,740
process I think you know it's it's

00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:27,740
deceptively hard yeah

00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:46,710
okay I guess I get all I get all the

00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:48,180
questions today yeah um yeah the

00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:50,339
question is if we've had any experience

00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:53,819
going from sharepoint to drupal um we

00:54:50,339 --> 00:54:55,740
have and we're expecting a lot more of

00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:58,829
it we're gearing up to have that

00:54:55,740 --> 00:55:03,089
experience it's my personal contention

00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:05,609
that the wave of proprietary CMS is

00:55:03,089 --> 00:55:07,710
being destroyed by drupal on

00:55:05,609 --> 00:55:09,750
public-facing web sites that trees was

00:55:07,710 --> 00:55:11,670
referring to in his keynote it's my

00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:13,410
personal contention that that same wave

00:55:11,670 --> 00:55:15,720
will occur on the internet side and

00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:19,260
eventually SharePoint will be deposed by

00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:21,780
drupal and others we we are steering

00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:24,150
actively our open atrium distribution

00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:26,670
into that space so that it would be a

00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:30,030
flexible replacement to a SharePoint

00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:32,039
instead of more or less a base camp we

00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:34,260
want a tool that will do that because we

00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:36,630
think that that will happen our

00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:40,619
experience has been on SharePoint has

00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:43,020
been good in that users are typically

00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:44,640
more satisfied with what we can build

00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:46,500
these days on Drupal because keep in

00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:47,990
mind it's not a fair it's not a fair to

00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:50,250
fair fight because you're dealing with

00:55:47,990 --> 00:55:52,049
usually a SharePoint implementation

00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:53,940
that's five years old at this point so

00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:56,039
it's kind of crappy to begin with right

00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:58,230
it's not like they just decided it you

00:55:56,039 --> 00:55:59,819
know yesterday but um but when they come

00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:01,980
off of that they typically have a much

00:55:59,819 --> 00:56:05,010
better experience they really enjoy a

00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:08,819
lot of the interface things we can put

00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:12,329
into Drupal the the downside tends to be

00:56:08,819 --> 00:56:13,920
a in any kind of like weird kind of

00:56:12,329 --> 00:56:15,869
custom integration they've stuff they've

00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:33,450
Microsoft's got it it's got its

00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:36,599

American No

okay all right all right uh yeah I mean

00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:04,020
you know at the end of the day share

00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:05,940
points you know probably using like

00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:07,770
sequel server right and you're you know

00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:09,300
you got a relational database scheme and

00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:11,940
you can script it out of there and move

00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:14,040
it um I'm quite certain that the times

00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:15,930
we've moved stuff out we've done it in

00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:18,390
an automated fashion I can't I don't

00:57:15,930 --> 00:57:21,000
remember specifics of a project on that

00:57:18,390 --> 00:57:22,200
but yeah we have um the other thing I

00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,760
was going to point out about that as it

00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:26,250
does come back most places we've seen

00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,660
particularly US government it does come

00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:30,780
back a lot to that sort of job security

00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:34,350
thing and licensing so typically once

00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:36,180
people get all the the bug to move they

00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:39,300
do it but there's a lot of resistance

00:57:36,180 --> 00:57:42,210
internally based on that debt allegiance

00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:44,220
to a platform like DBAs and sequel

00:57:42,210 --> 00:57:51,930
server or people who have been you know

00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:54,000
ms cmsc trained or whatever so now I'm

00:57:51,930 --> 00:57:55,500
