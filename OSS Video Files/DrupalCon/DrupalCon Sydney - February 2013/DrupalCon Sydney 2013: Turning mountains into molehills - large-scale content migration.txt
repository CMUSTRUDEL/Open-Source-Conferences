Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Turning mountains into molehills - large-scale content migration
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	In 2012, I led a major content migration from one CMS to another for a large organisation. While most saw this as a straightforward "lift and drop" - we saw this as an
opportunity to address customer's problems and frustrations that have long since existed. Our challenge was to walk the tightrope between improving what we know needs to be fixed while remaining pragmatic and meeting our deadline.

Could both be achieved? I'll share the lessons learned and the techniques we used to make
this happen, including:

* Designing for the content producer
* Establishing a style guide
* Using content templates to make it adaptable

We knew we could not change the world, but we couldn't let an opportunity to make
comprehensive improvements pass by.

hi everyone my name is Christian lugs

00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:08,370
and i'm a freelance user experience

00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,830
designer and i wanted to start off today

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:13,799
with you know just a bit of a story not

00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:15,330
of the content migration itself but just

00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:20,760
the project that I worked on prior to

00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:23,519
that so in 2011 and 2012 I was working

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,189
at a large telco and you know at the

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,869
time we were tasked with building a

00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:30,330
customer support knowledge knowledge

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:32,309
space and you know we're creating it

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:34,860
using responsive web design techniques

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:36,630
and so you know at the time this was

00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,820
actually quite new and exciting because

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:42,270
the only things or the only major sites

00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:45,030
that were that were responsive were was

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,010
the Barack Obama site and the Boston

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,930
Globe and so we spent several weeks

00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:52,020
learning about you know responsive web

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,300
design trying to be mobile first and

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,780
just generally breaking down our desktop

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,449
centric thinking and so our deadline was

00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,160
tight and many compromises were made you

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,080
know as is typical of many projects

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,470
we're actually quite literally locked

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,090
into a room so there was about six of us

00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,369
given six weeks to produce this thing

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:15,350
and so you can imagine how tight the

00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:18,119
deadline was and so launch day came and

00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,920
the system that we designed you know was

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,729
going to be put in front of users and so

00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:25,049
both the editors sorry not in it was

00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:27,360
going to be put in front of users so

00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:31,170
both the editors who would be creating

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,479
the content and our customers and you

00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:36,570
know it all really fell apart and it was

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:42,000
all because of one word well it was

00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:44,310
actually two words and what we failed to

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,689
realize that our content editors were

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,970
just simply copying and pasting from

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:50,070
word documents you know they were

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,049
bypassing our carefully crafted HTML

00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:56,100
templates and so what we ended up with

00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:59,310
was you know about 200 support articles

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:04,170
with malformed HTML broken content and

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:06,869
no mobile version and what happened was

00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:10,170
basically the project team so everyone

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:13,500
from say the designers up into the

00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:15,780
project leaders so my boss was

00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,600
sort of on the ground floor in the CMS

00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,770
hand editing those HTML pages just

00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:25,470
forget it working so why am i bringing

00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:28,320
this up well for starters I became a

00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:33,030
real expert in you know regex syntax and

00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:35,250
I just had to tell someone but but more

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,110
importantly we were so focused on how

00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:39,390
amazing the experience would be for the

00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,580
end user that you know we're neglected

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,450
to think about the real users you know

00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,650
ie the content editors and the producers

00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,390
so you might be thinking you know this

00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,800
is this could all have easily been

00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:54,660
solved with a single button but I think

00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,940
it goes much deeper than that you know

00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,070
like why would people actively avoiding

00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,900
the tools that we created you know that

00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:05,010
we created specifically to help them do

00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,239
their job so I've been working as a

00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,980
front-end developer for a couple of

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,320
years and more recently as a UX designer

00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:12,180
and in my experience you know

00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,070
implementing a new CMS has always really

00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,170
been about you know technology first and

00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:19,950
less about the poor suckers who have to

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:22,830
use the damn thing every day I know

00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,959
personally I have a tendency to design

00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:27,269
things from the outside in you know just

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,310
I often catch myself building a solution

00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:30,930
in my head you know rather than spending

00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:33,239
time and thinking about the underlying

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,650
problem that I'm trying to solve and

00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:41,220
also the people that I'm trying to solve

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:43,140
it for so I'm also equally guilty of

00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:44,970
putting together wire frames in

00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,459
Photoshop comps you know just filled

00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,660
with lorem ipsum I'm always assuming

00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:50,640
that you know someone else will take

00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,640
care of this they were just fill in

00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,380
boxes and I don't have to worry about it

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,380
so all of this was just really front and

00:03:55,380 --> 00:04:00,690
center in my head as we moved on to our

00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:03,650
next project which was the content

00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:03,650
migration that I'll get to

00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:11,209
and I'm hoping that you know if you're a

00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:12,950
designer developer ba a strategist you

00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,170
know whoever and if you've got some

00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,510
influence or any input into you know

00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:18,889
similar projects that today will give

00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:24,139
you some things to think about so

00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:25,729
regardless of the CMS that you use and I

00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:28,070
also wanted to share this as an example

00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:30,199
of you know it was changed that wasn't

00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:32,360
necessarily grand or ambitious or even

00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:33,770
overly transformative you know our

00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,289
reasons at the time weren't necessarily

00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:38,570
to redo the entire website provide a

00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:39,919
brand new experience but was simply to

00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:42,770
just move away from the system that we

00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:45,590
were on because we didn't like it we

00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:47,660
didn't want to pay for it and you know

00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,330
despite all of that we were still able

00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,710
to create meaningful change and

00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:55,840
improvements to both content producers

00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,840
and editors and also our end customers

00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:04,370
so let's talk about projects so what was

00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:06,800
involved was you know it was

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,199
approximately a thousand pages that had

00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,440
to be manually moved over it was

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:15,410
multiple visual styles some dating back

00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,080
from about 2006 there was outdated

00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:20,870
content and there was bad there was a

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,760
disorganized IA just from years of sort

00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:28,090
of neglect and just any real lack of

00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:31,460
structure the core team was comprised of

00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:33,830
you know one UX designer visual designer

00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,620
a couple of front-end developers our

00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:38,840
back-end developers or two some

00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:41,090
producers one tester and a business

00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,490
analyst and towards the end of the

00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:45,440
project you know as the actual migration

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,240
of pages was ramping up we added a bunch

00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,599
of visual designers and about 10 more

00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,599
editors

00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:57,630
and the project itself was broken down

00:05:55,170 --> 00:06:01,020
into roughly three phases over seven

00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:03,090
months so we had the content audit that

00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,890
ran from January to March there was a

00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:07,800
designer development phase from about

00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:10,530
March to me and the migration the actual

00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,520
migration from april to july and it's

00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:13,230
probably important to note that there

00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,090
was a lot of overlap between the phases

00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:21,660
so you know design work would often

00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:25,320
bleed into the migration fees now

00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:27,150
guiding principle so we knew that this

00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:30,020
was a great opportunity for us to

00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:32,730
improve what was on the website because

00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:35,430
it was it was a bit of issue mazel so

00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:39,330
there was there was things that we knew

00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:41,220
we could tackle and also you know just

00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:44,430
things to improve because we had

00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,560
customer testing done over the years you

00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,950
know we had this raw set of data of how

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,250
people sort of thought of the website

00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:54,810
but the underlying motivation for this

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,610
was you know it was just a straight-up

00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:58,790
migration we were moving from one system

00:06:56,610 --> 00:07:01,860
to another but we couldn't ignore how

00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:03,600
you know the opportunity that we had so

00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,720
we established this guiding principle of

00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,010
you know what must be migrated should be

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,620
equal to or better than the current

00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:13,080
experience so we knew that a lot of

00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,940
people stakeholders product managers and

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,180
so on would see this as their

00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:20,700
opportunity to get a new website so we

00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:23,210
had to manage this and basically manage

00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,210
their expectations

00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:32,190
so what were the challenges well we had

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,930
many but some I'll just pick out a

00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:40,890
couple and talk through in a little bit

00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:43,470
more detail question how do you design

00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:46,050
for a system that you've never seen let

00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,790
alone use now this might sound very

00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,010
strange but so we didn't actually get

00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:51,840
our hands on a sandboxed environment

00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:55,470
until about three months into the

00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,020
project and we had to fight for it we

00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,940
you know were building all these things

00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,590
we're designing all these things without

00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:05,370
actually knowing where it would land and

00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:09,890
how would be implemented and so you know

00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:13,230
we were pushing to basically you know

00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:17,430
get these things walk we're pushing to

00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:20,490
to get these things live and and where

00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:22,920
we started with was seeking feedback

00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:25,680
from the users so you know we were

00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,880
talking to the producer team and given

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,150
the way that the internal team is

00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:33,540
structured meant that me as a UX

00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:36,600
designer you know I had zero exposure to

00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:38,910
the actual CMS so I was designing all

00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,100
these things you know modules pages

00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:42,780
sites and so on without really fully

00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,840
understanding how they would be

00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:47,850
implemented and so we talked to them

00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:49,800
about their experience what their

00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:53,760
workflow was like you know where their

00:08:49,800 --> 00:09:00,530
pain points were and ensure the overall

00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:03,420
feedback that we got from them was so

00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:06,300
our content producers had a tough job

00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:08,730
you know I have to hand it to them they

00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:11,850
were editing raw HTML to make content

00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:14,340
updates so it wasn't exactly you know a

00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:17,910
dreamweaver style of editing but it was

00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:19,020
more like Windows notepad you know it

00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:20,700
was a process that really could be

00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,800
described as inefficient you know

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,080
requiring a certain skill set and very

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,120
prone to mistakes so we started looking

00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,190
at different ways of building these

00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,460
pages and just really addressing the

00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:34,380
producer pain points and no because

00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:37,490
everything was being moved over manually

00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:41,870
we had to stop and ask

00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:44,120
how do we build this and you know we

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:46,850
would start with the producers and often

00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,589
the answer would be well I would just

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:52,370
get the HTML code from the developers

00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:54,320
and we just chuck it into the CMS so

00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:58,430
what we've got here is most recent

00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:01,040
version of pricing tables this is the

00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:03,380
nice version what we had previous to

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,660
that was just inconsistent and generally

00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:08,750
a mess so it was a prime candidate for

00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,790
us to improve to improve this particular

00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:12,230
piece of content during the migration we

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:18,100
didn't want to just move it over one for

00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:20,810
one but we had some things to consider

00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,839
for starters you know this content would

00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:25,250
be reused across multiple pages we had

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,670
to account for the different types of

00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:30,200
content that this module would display

00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:33,470
we also didn't want to spook the product

00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:35,300
managers so the product managers and the

00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:39,560
marketing team had very little exposure

00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:41,990
to our migration project so our thought

00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:45,110
was if we started coming in and just

00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,850
sort of waving our fancy new redesigns

00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:48,110
in their face and saying this is what's

00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:50,089
going to this is what's going to happen

00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:52,760
you know we get pulled into this endless

00:10:50,089 --> 00:10:55,209
loop of feedback cycles and approval

00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:59,690
chains we also had legal implications

00:10:55,209 --> 00:11:01,850
because telco as an industry is very

00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:08,510
heavily regulated you know so we had to

00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:12,560
tread carefully so this is a bit of a

00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:15,040
failure story on my part but he Mia so

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,810
when thinking about the different

00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,260
interfaces that we could build for the

00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:26,560
CMS my first thought was hey let's use a

00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:28,760
spreadsheet you know looks close enough

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:33,140
you know things are being presented in

00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:34,220
table format we could you know do up a

00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,600
couple of spreadsheets for all the

00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:37,730
different pricing tables that we had and

00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,610
just import them you know quite quickly

00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:42,260
and easily so I went ahead and started

00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:44,420
designing a tool that would take a

00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:50,290
spreadsheet of pricing information sort

00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:50,290
of add it to the CMS their work

00:11:51,019 --> 00:11:56,069
the idea really didn't resonate with our

00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:59,129
editors for a couple of reasons for

00:11:56,069 --> 00:12:00,689
starters none of the content producers

00:11:59,129 --> 00:12:04,439
could use excel in their day-to-day work

00:12:00,689 --> 00:12:06,779
or rather they weren't using excel in

00:12:04,439 --> 00:12:09,059
their day-to-day work they were using

00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:14,160
Photoshop they were using this god-awful

00:12:09,059 --> 00:12:15,629
CMS editor but not ax not excel so if we

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,889
force them to change their behaviors

00:12:15,629 --> 00:12:21,869
we'd get a lot of resistance second of

00:12:19,889 --> 00:12:24,509
all we could get the content in very

00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:27,059
quickly no dramas but it was impossible

00:12:24,509 --> 00:12:29,609
for us to get it out you know if we made

00:12:27,059 --> 00:12:31,709
a mistake or we needed to modify the

00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:35,220
data structure and so on it became

00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:37,889
really impossible and lastly while it

00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:40,410
works for numerical content it really

00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:42,269
didn't work for anything else so any

00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:46,470
other text content like legal terms and

00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:48,029
conditions and so on just didn't fly so

00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,249
in the end what we ended up doing and

00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:51,569
apologies for the rough sketch but I

00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:53,189
think this was the standard of the

00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:57,600
documentation that we were producing as

00:12:53,189 --> 00:13:00,749
part of this process I can show you my

00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,220
sketchbook but in the end what we ended

00:13:00,749 --> 00:13:04,589
up going down with was you know

00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,959
relatively simple and structured set of

00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:09,600
data but we broke it down into smaller

00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,139
more atomic bits so for example the

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:15,869
features were sort of their own thing

00:13:12,139 --> 00:13:18,179
you know individual fields and you know

00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:21,059
you could apply those to a certain

00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:23,639
number of plans with a bit of extra data

00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:25,410
on top and if you wanted to combine them

00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:27,119
into multiple plans to say you had a

00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:29,519
variation over 12 months or 24 months

00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:33,360
you could combine multiple plans on to a

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,610
page so you would get this particular

00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:38,039
layer and we also had rules around the

00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:41,850
module that if there was say more than

00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:45,419
four being displayed at one time we

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:48,269
would have this fancy sort of scrolling

00:13:45,419 --> 00:13:51,149
mechanism that would just cut off the

00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:52,529
fifth and six and seven elements just so

00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:56,850
that we would indicate that there was

00:13:52,529 --> 00:14:00,480
actually more there so it wasn't the

00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:02,510
prettiest but it worked and you know as

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:05,450
I said we had to stay true to

00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:08,450
what had already been there because if

00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:11,660
we started redesigning this in you know

00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:14,810
from scratch we would we wouldn't get

00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:20,300
anywhere because we have the product

00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:22,220
guys to deal with basically so this got

00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:25,550
me thinking about other examples of no

00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:29,630
content editing tools and I came across

00:14:25,550 --> 00:14:33,650
this one for ITV News which is a new

00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:36,920
service for a british channel and in

00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:38,750
2012 you know they launched their news

00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,570
service and it was fundamentally

00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:44,660
different from typical news sites so

00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:46,220
without going into too much detail the

00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:48,770
site was structured more around issues

00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:51,860
and events rather than just publishing

00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:53,330
news articles on a given day so for

00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,580
example you could follow the egyptian

00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:58,070
uprising over time from its inception

00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:02,540
right through to you know the aftermath

00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:05,180
with tweets photos and so on the agency

00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,220
that was responsible for this redesign I

00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,650
think they're a British mob called made

00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:12,220
by many they spent a lot of time

00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:15,050
thinking about how journalist worked and

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:17,510
crafted the tools to suit how they

00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:19,520
worked they shadowed the journalists in

00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:23,600
the newsroom and even ran their own test

00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:25,550
feeds for a while they prototyped and

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:29,000
tested these tools with the people who

00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:30,650
would be using them and the tools that

00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,050
they created were designed to allow

00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:35,060
journalists to focus more on finding and

00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:37,370
creating content rather than fighting

00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:40,160
the CMS so what we've got there is just

00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:42,350
a very basic post editor we're the very

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,200
basic styling so you can only do bold

00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:47,720
italic and links what you see underneath

00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:50,270
is just sort of more structured data so

00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,880
you can include multiple posts tweets

00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:55,040
quotes and whatnot you can also drag and

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,770
drop and rearrange them so if you wanted

00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:01,240
to to include a range of tweets or

00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:01,240
reactions you could do so

00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:09,640
this is a prototype of their their

00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:12,220
picture editor so instead of having to

00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,590
find an image you know find out what the

00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,630
editorial size would be because you know

00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:18,910
they don't have that on hands crop the

00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:21,850
image save it in an appropriate format

00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:24,040
make sure it's compressed nicely find

00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:27,040
out where they save the file upload it

00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:29,110
check it to see on screen re-upload it

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,180
if it doesn't look right you know this

00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:37,060
tool took care of a lot of this so they

00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:38,830
didn't have to and they also realized

00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,110
that people who are out in the field

00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,970
didn't necessarily have access to a

00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:45,730
laptop they often just had their

00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:47,560
smartphone on them and so the designers

00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:49,270
created this tool so will our

00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,640
journalists to quickly send content to

00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:54,040
the newsroom where the web team could

00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,530
callate and curate streams of content

00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,290
coming in so there was this idea of you

00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:01,230
know allowing the journalists to go out

00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:03,970
there and just worry about gathering

00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,980
while the guys back at home base would

00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:14,790
put everything together into a sort of

00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:17,550
coherent picture so a couple of thoughts

00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:19,449
for us as part of this project

00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:22,060
understanding how your users worked

00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:24,610
became really fundamental for us to make

00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:27,240
any progress you know we SAT with them

00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:32,950
talked with them sometimes at a beer

00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:34,210
several you know we and as a result you

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:38,170
know we were creating new tools and

00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:42,640
processes and we were trying to change

00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:45,400
how they work often for the better but

00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,070
you know if we were pushing too hard or

00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,170
if we're pushing them in ways which you

00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:51,670
know they weren't used to or it just

00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:53,830
didn't sit you know we would get

00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:55,870
resistance so we had to find out where

00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:59,230
the edges were and I think that came

00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:02,580
down to just listening to how they you

00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:02,580
know what their frustrations were

00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:09,280
finally you know you're creating sorry

00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,480
these content creation tools you know

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,360
can we make them more interesting

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,740
compelling efficient you know can we do

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,010
other things than just simply filling

00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,010
out a form

00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:24,660
question so with many stakeholders how

00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:29,070
could we keep everyone focused and

00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:31,500
moving in the same direction so this

00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:34,950
project was a bit of a bastard actually

00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:36,630
was it was it was a mess but you know I

00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:39,870
think it goes without saying that it was

00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:41,880
a really highly political project we had

00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:44,910
people in multiple parts of the business

00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:48,390
with a vested interest in in the success

00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:50,010
sometimes a failure but this also

00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:52,020
affected people's day-to-day work and

00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:55,560
you know there was also legal

00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:57,570
implications to consider so given the

00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,940
far-reaching nature of this project now

00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:02,400
how could we make sure that everything

00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:05,930
or rather everyone you know that needed

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,930
to be kept in the loop was being done so

00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:14,100
for us physical space was really

00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:16,280
effective in not only getting the core

00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:19,560
team to focus on what needed to be done

00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,480
in any one given Sprint's but also

00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,980
getting external stakeholders and even

00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:28,230
the greater online team on board with

00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:30,690
what we were doing how we've typically

00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:34,080
done things this may seem familiar to

00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:35,280
you guys but you know the UX designers

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,500
would come up with a bunch of wireframes

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,600
who would throw it over to the design

00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:41,760
guys to make it pretty we throw it over

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,460
to the dev guys to build the thing and

00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:48,390
then the backend guys would get involved

00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:49,710
and make it happen testing guys would

00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,230
jump in there and then the production

00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:56,490
guys would make it live you know you

00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:58,950
stand a waterfall process given what we

00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:01,050
had which was three months during the

00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:03,030
development phase just that a sheer

00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:05,550
necessity you know collaboration between

00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:09,660
designer developer today Tesla and

00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:11,280
producer became very important you know

00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:13,080
we had UX designers working with

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,780
back-end designers sketching out

00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:17,940
potential solutions the visual designers

00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,590
were working with producers to try and

00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,510
understand how to upload images into the

00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:24,870
CMS all of this was actually quite new

00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:27,300
for us and and typically how we didn't

00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:28,790
sorry it wasn't how we did things in the

00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,630
past

00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:32,610
we really couldn't afford to have

00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,290
instances where designers or developers

00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,550
would basically say you know I'm not

00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:40,050
going to start work until I see why

00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:41,670
frames sometimes a sketch should be all

00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:44,700
you need to get people to start working

00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:46,590
and if there was another level of detail

00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,410
that was needed so for instance the

00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:51,540
testers needed you know functional specs

00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:54,450
and so on it was called out early and

00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:55,710
often and it also really didn't hurt

00:20:54,450 --> 00:21:03,930
that we were sitting in the same area

00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:07,250
rather than it being siloed out this

00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,250
became a bit of a mantra for us

00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:17,540
so we used a Kanban board to kind of

00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:19,700
keep track of who is responsible for

00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:20,990
each bit of functionality so if you're

00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:24,020
not familiar with this it's just

00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:27,830
basically a whiteboard split up into you

00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:31,430
know the steps UX design dev going down

00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:34,370
the track and using user cards or user

00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:39,260
stories to basically identify what stage

00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:41,900
of the process certain things were so at

00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:44,390
the start of any given Sprint's we would

00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,980
prioritize these user cards we were we

00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:49,790
would identify the goals that we wanted

00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:52,040
to hit and would use daily stand-ups to

00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:53,450
identify any potential blockers and you

00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:55,580
know we had many conversations outside

00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,900
of that it's kind of collectively reach

00:21:55,580 --> 00:22:00,290
agreements on where we would do things

00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:01,490
so was it wasn't uncommon for us to you

00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:03,920
know if I was working on a particular

00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:06,860
module let's say it's Witter feed I

00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,660
would say you know pulling the the

00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:10,910
design guys and dev guys and say look

00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:14,060
here is what I've got sketched out what

00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:15,830
do you think and they would say no

00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,720
that's that won't work or they

00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,640
would say ok let's go with that and they

00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:21,620
themselves would get started on the work

00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:28,190
that they needed to do so that when it

00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:30,050
came to them they were already ahead we

00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,660
also set up design walls and other

00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:35,930
spaces and we use these to get buy-in

00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:37,430
from external stakeholders we use it

00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:39,740
also to keep everyone up to date with

00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:43,100
our progress and we sort of use this as

00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:45,140
a finish line for everyone we printed

00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:49,610
IAS we stuck designs on the wall

00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:51,470
sketches everything we printed out every

00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:53,390
page that we were moving over and use

00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:56,950
this to top managers through how the

00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:59,810
migration would affect their content so

00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:03,260
it wasn't uncommon for us to invite a

00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:05,390
couple of product managers over and we

00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:07,220
basically walk them through the current

00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:09,140
version of their site and also what we

00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:12,350
were proposing as the new ia for their

00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:13,490
site and what became apparent was you

00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:15,620
know as soon as we talked them through

00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:17,360
as soon as you know they saw these these

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,640
pages in front of them they'd start

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:23,690
immediately saying wow that stuffs out

00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:25,130
of date and and this they were

00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,880
responsible for these sorts of things

00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:29,640
like this was their content this

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:33,390
was their product and they had no idea

00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:36,900
on on what their site or their product

00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:38,850
looked to users and you know we found

00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,760
this is a little bit more effective than

00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:43,050
just sending over us a bunch of

00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,030
spreadsheets kind of hoping that they

00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:47,730
would respond and it really also helped

00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:53,520
that we were only just a level or two

00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:55,020
above them physically so we use this as

00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,580
clear agreement on where we would

00:23:55,020 --> 00:24:03,540
improve things and where we would leave

00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:05,670
things as is we also use this as a way

00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:07,590
of you know promoting the project

00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:10,350
internally as there wasn't a lot of

00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:12,330
visibility outwards so you know we were

00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:13,680
trying to be transparent create a

00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:17,790
greater sense of ownership across the

00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:20,460
online team you know it was it was a

00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:22,050
project that was you know it was just

00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:26,820
working the core team was just working

00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:29,910
on this and so what we found was having

00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:31,860
this awareness having this in a public

00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:35,400
place so this was actually in the main

00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:36,930
sort of kitchen area you know it created

00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:40,920
a greater sense of ownership across the

00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:42,660
online team and people were having

00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:44,160
conversations around it you know they

00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:46,080
were working out how this affected their

00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,330
work you know people could see the

00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,830
potential improvements and sort of how

00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:51,270
dramatic it was compared to the old

00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:54,690
version you know there was real

00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:56,250
excitement and often you know they would

00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:57,930
have conversations outside of the team

00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:01,140
which was great because they didn't need

00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:03,510
to talk to me and when it came down to

00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,550
the tail end of the project when you

00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:07,590
know we were getting the migration and

00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:14,730
we're just pumping out pages it was all

00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:17,490
hands on deck so we weren't necessarily

00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:19,020
trying to be agile with a capital A you

00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:25,140
know what we were doing made sense to us

00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:27,390
I admit I'm really not to sort of I

00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,610
don't know a lot about agile methodology

00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:32,300
I appreciate some of the things that it

00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:35,970
promotes so things like you know

00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:39,360
interactions over over rigid specs you

00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:40,350
know being adaptable adaptable and you

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,559
know just

00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:47,880
to focus on communication and by the

00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:49,410
same token you know we instilled this

00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,260
culture of you know communicating it to

00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:54,990
others so if someone needed something

00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:56,490
from me about what I need so what I

00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:58,049
needed to produce to get their job done

00:25:56,490 --> 00:26:02,039
they would call it out early and often

00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:04,110
and finally you know using physical

00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:11,610
space to reach consensus in buyin was

00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:13,470
also a big one for us question now

00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:16,740
what's the best way to get a team of new

00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:18,780
producers up to speed on a project so as

00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,850
I mentioned earlier the project started

00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:22,710
off with two producers but would ramp up

00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:26,190
over time with more producers being

00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:28,049
brought in so these producers wouldn't

00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:29,970
have the tacit knowledge that the call

00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:31,169
team had and often they were just

00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:33,690
contractors being brought in

00:26:31,169 --> 00:26:35,720
specifically for this project so how do

00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:38,760
we get them up to speed in a short time

00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:43,500
for us it was wireframes at a patent

00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:44,970
library so because the core team had to

00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,250
understand how content producers were

00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:49,350
putting these pages together and as much

00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:52,289
as I dislike wireframing you know every

00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:56,669
page that we moved over was had it had a

00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:58,039
an Associated why frame because so much

00:26:56,669 --> 00:27:00,630
of the source content was so different

00:26:58,039 --> 00:27:03,179
we saw this is the only way we couldn't

00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:05,850
get the produced guys to basically look

00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:07,860
at the original file because they often

00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:10,860
could work out how it would be built

00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:12,750
with the new system so we created a

00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:14,669
patent library of reusable elements so

00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:17,730
things like content modules baseline

00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:19,530
grids and page types which meant the

00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:23,880
producers didn't have to think about it

00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:25,890
how each page would be built so just to

00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:30,480
quickly run through the benefits of

00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:33,750
establishing a pattern library shared

00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,549
vocabulary when you say link box and I

00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:38,250
say link box you know we know we're

00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:41,250
talking about the same thing consistency

00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:46,130
of experience when I hover my mouse over

00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:48,929
a link box its operates in the same way

00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:52,290
rapidly train new people here's how to

00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:53,450
create a new link box avoid reinventing

00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:56,010
the wheel

00:27:53,450 --> 00:28:00,180
what if the link box has multiple links

00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:02,940
what if it has no image and finally

00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:05,610
empowering content producers which is

00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:08,280
sort of a little bit at odds with what i

00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:10,800
just said previously but what we found

00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:15,180
was again because the content was so

00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:17,760
varied pre-migration you know we

00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:21,030
basically established this framework so

00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:23,250
that we could let the producers make

00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:25,170
their own decisions about how something

00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,970
could be built and if it was eighty

00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:29,070
eighty percent of the way you know and

00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:31,050
and it did look horribly broken you know

00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:33,390
we were okay with that and often this

00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:35,940
would be applied to say lower level

00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:38,790
pages or stuff that was generally

00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:44,820
considered a low priority as far as how

00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:47,940
useful it was to customers so this is an

00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:52,470
example of pat library that I put

00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:54,240
together so this style is generally a

00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:57,750
little bit more sort of casual in tone

00:28:54,240 --> 00:29:00,360
you know I tried to make it less like a

00:28:57,750 --> 00:29:02,940
piece of statute and more you know just

00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:05,070
a set of recommendations I tried to keep

00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:07,530
it succinct and also wanted to include

00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:09,990
examples in line so people could see

00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:12,000
when I talk about hava States and you

00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:15,830
know clickable label elements you know

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,830
they could see how they worked

00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:31,390
so a couple of other examples the BBC

00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:33,460
gel was for me the inspiration for the

00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:36,220
patent library so when I sort of put

00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:39,520
this thing together I looked to the BBC

00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:42,130
gel and you know when I saw it I thought

00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:45,090
yes brilliant this is exactly what I

00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:47,860
want this is how I want to communicate

00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:49,780
no they're solving the same problems

00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:52,840
that I'm trying to you know it was a

00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:55,690
focus less on actual code but more

00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:58,120
defining the overall language for things

00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:00,550
like carousels typography other core

00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,840
page elements you know it also defined

00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:06,010
how things should work across different

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,510
context you know mobile and TV and when

00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:09,070
you drill down to the individual

00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:11,650
components you know they gave you

00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:14,890
variations based on you know if you were

00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:16,780
doing a carousel with no images and just

00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:18,640
text this is how it works if you're

00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:21,130
doing them of with just images this is

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,580
how it works and so on and they weren't

00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:27,160
sort of being so rigid in their in their

00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:29,770
designs which made sense because they

00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:34,510
had so many so many different types of

00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:36,670
sites to deal with so compare this with

00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:38,860
the starbucks style guide which is a

00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:40,600
little bit more developer centric so you

00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:42,600
can see different page configurations

00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:45,670
you know drill down into specific CSS

00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:47,260
show the grid overlay and demonstrate

00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:55,030
how things would reshape on different

00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:57,310
screens just the reminder I you know

00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:59,200
don't just set and forget' invest effort

00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:03,400
in maintaining the library you know if

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:05,440
you set one of these up work out who's

00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,810
going to be the patent librarian you

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:10,030
know who's going to maintain this over

00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:12,550
time you know start thinking about how

00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:14,620
decisions are made as far as putting new

00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:16,900
things into the patent library and you

00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:19,120
can bet that already established

00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:21,550
patterns may break with either new types

00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:24,880
of content or even new devices so you

00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:26,770
need to be prepared for that and also

00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:30,610
keep it in a centralized invisible place

00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:32,590
so whether or not it's a public URL or a

00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:35,350
place that is say on the internet

00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:37,000
or even just you know hand like printed

00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:39,610
documents that you give to a new person

00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,500
when they start you know it needs to be

00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:45,100
visible it needs to be sort of

00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:46,539
reinforced over time and also never stop

00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,789
selling the benefits of the patent

00:31:46,539 --> 00:31:51,580
library to stakeholders so we found this

00:31:48,789 --> 00:31:53,679
really useful when again God love them

00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:57,100
dealing with marketing people and the

00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:59,140
product guys so they would often come to

00:31:57,100 --> 00:32:01,210
us with you know we need this campaign

00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:03,880
up immediately and so we'd say yeah sure

00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:06,100
absolutely but you should really follow

00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:09,309
it in this format and you know we can

00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:11,649
take care of that for you so for things

00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:15,130
like you know competition pages any

00:32:11,649 --> 00:32:17,049
sales and so on it really helps like you

00:32:15,130 --> 00:32:19,480
know just repetitive content that is

00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:22,450
maybe just created every couple of weeks

00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:31,299
and so on you know it really saved us

00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:34,090
time and yeah and finally how can we

00:32:31,299 --> 00:32:36,429
make things future friendly so the

00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:40,720
company I worked for we sold mobile

00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:42,159
phones so it was been mind-boggling that

00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,559
you know our content wasn't really

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,570
optimized for the devices that we were

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:49,990
trying to sell to people you know all we

00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:52,659
had was it was just some shitty I guess

00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:56,620
website that was probably built for

00:32:52,659 --> 00:32:58,539
nokia phones so at the start of the

00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:00,429
project you know we had high hopes that

00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:03,309
you know we could work in a mobile

00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:05,020
version of the site you know we could

00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:07,330
develop this in tandem make things

00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:10,750
responsive however however you you see

00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:12,340
it but you know unfortunately it was

00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:14,740
described at the very start of the

00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:16,929
project which was a bit discouraging for

00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:21,100
us you know given the previous work that

00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:24,000
we've done but what we could do was lay

00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:28,059
the foundations for future mobile work

00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:31,480
so just a quick reminder mobile does not

00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:34,059
equal lights you know we shouldn't

00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,429
assume intense based solely on the

00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:39,279
device that we use and as a result hide

00:33:36,429 --> 00:33:41,350
content accordingly laptops off and run

00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,940
off 3g connections and smart phones you

00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:46,429
know they're commonly connected to Wi-Fi

00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:49,909
so i'm not going to belabor the point be

00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:51,860
because there's many other fast smarter

00:33:49,909 --> 00:33:54,980
people who have already spoken about

00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:57,110
this at great length but what I will

00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,759
talk about is how we approach the

00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:03,499
project sorry how we approach this

00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:07,249
during the project so for us we limited

00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:10,490
HTML usage or rather WYSIWYG HTML usage

00:34:07,249 --> 00:34:15,679
and we structured content and we started

00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:19,730
identifying page types so we made the

00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:22,970
decision that's we wanted to basically

00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:25,159
avoid WYSIWYG where we could for a

00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:27,679
couple of reasons you know the visual

00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:29,720
designers were worried about the wrong

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,000
styling the wrong look being applied at

00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:33,679
the time of production the developer

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,490
guys were worried about code blue and

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:39,619
performance and I was worried about you

00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:42,710
know this ruining our chances for any

00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:44,510
sort of mobile version so you know we

00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:47,419
were happy that everyone was on the same

00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:52,909
page and you know I was quite happy to

00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:54,530
get rid of the inline ckeditor the

00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:57,440
second thing we did was look for

00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:58,670
patterns in content we identified pages

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,400
that didn't need anything beyond a

00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:04,339
simple edit box so we called these flex

00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:07,790
boxes we started looking at landing

00:35:04,339 --> 00:35:10,190
pages you know bespoke pages that had a

00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:12,530
lot of custom HTML and this allowed us

00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:14,990
to understand you know just how much

00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:16,730
work was involved what areas of the site

00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:18,589
might need mobile specific templates or

00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:21,470
where we could just use responsive

00:35:18,589 --> 00:35:23,690
styling and it also gave us a sort of a

00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:26,450
list of pages that we could just start

00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:31,670
giving to the production guys just to

00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:33,920
start moving them over the last thing we

00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:35,630
did was sort of dive deeper into certain

00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,349
page types and create content rules

00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:41,329
around them so this is a almost a

00:35:39,349 --> 00:35:43,880
functional spec of the pricing table

00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:46,190
that I showed you earlier and we use

00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,549
this to communicate to the developers

00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:50,420
and the producers you know just how

00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:52,900
content would be used in certain areas

00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:56,210
so for example and we use it to define

00:35:52,900 --> 00:36:00,290
link states what could be edited what

00:35:56,210 --> 00:36:03,620
remains static you know and and what

00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:05,930
happened in certain situations and our

00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:08,780
hope was that when a mobile version was

00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:10,190
to be developed you know whoever was

00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:12,620
taken care of though we didn't need to

00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:21,860
second-guess the kind of data that they

00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:25,310
were working with so how do we do wasn't

00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:27,410
too bad so of the four developments

00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:28,910
prints that we had you know we managed

00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:31,610
to hit the targets that we set out in

00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:34,070
each sprint the site went live in about

00:36:31,610 --> 00:36:35,450
August last year and you know there's

00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:38,240
been considerable improvements to

00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:40,430
internal processes and the site itself

00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:44,000
is a little less bloated and a little

00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:46,370
little more robust and as I understand

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,680
it the patent library is being actively

00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:50,450
maintained and you know the beginnings

00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,180
of a mobile optimized version is already

00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:55,460
live and it's drawing from the same pool

00:36:53,180 --> 00:37:00,530
of content as the desktop website so

00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:01,610
this good news and to reflect on you

00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:03,800
know what's happened over the last two

00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:05,600
years I'm really quite proud of what we

00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:07,130
were able to achieve you know this

00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,980
experience challenged the way I worked

00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:11,750
got me thinking less about specific

00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,250
deliverables and more about you know the

00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:15,890
relationships that I had with the people

00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:17,450
around me you know a lot of the

00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:19,280
challenges that we face there's a team

00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:23,660
were more about communication and less

00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:25,640
about you know technical challenges and

00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:28,570
we skipped the typical waterfall

00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:32,090
approach in favor of you know more

00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:34,220
cross-discipline collaboration and type

00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:37,160
feedback loops with the end users so not

00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:39,290
only did we test our ideas and concepts

00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:42,560
with the producers we also did usability

00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:46,040
testing on on the new and improved

00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:47,480
pricing tables that we put out we

00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:50,390
created and established a design

00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,520
vocabulary and enshrine them in a

00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:57,410
resource that was to be used across the

00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:59,600
team we also tried to ensure that our

00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:05,470
content was created and stored in a way

00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:08,030
that could be reusable and adaptable and

00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:10,340
finally you know working in an

00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:13,460
organization like I did on such a

00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:15,530
project meant that as a designer you

00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:18,320
very quickly learn to become very

00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:20,030
pragmatic and take the winds where you

00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,920
can get them you know if you always

00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:24,230
reach for best practice you're going to

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,099
be very disappointed only because you

00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:27,230
know there's so many other factors

00:38:25,099 --> 00:38:33,940
involved and you know you need to know

00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:33,940
when to push and when to yield so I go

00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:56,869
assets in total so I don't know specific

00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:59,060
assets so if you mean things like PDF

00:38:56,869 --> 00:39:03,349
files and so on we have that in a

00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:05,060
spreadsheet somewhere but it was yeah so

00:39:03,349 --> 00:39:11,180
for every page they often had to be like

00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:15,050
specific items about a thousand but that

00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:18,050
also included yeah it also included

00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:24,950
things like the yet images PDFs and

00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:27,040
things like that so what do you mean by

00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:27,040
that

00:39:29,329 --> 00:39:42,029
it wasn't a Drupal site gotcha no yeah

00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:44,579
it wasn't we we basically we had to move

00:39:42,029 --> 00:39:46,680
things over manually so it effectively

00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:49,710
recreating each page in the new system

00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:51,839
we couldn't use anything like you know a

00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:53,700
database drop you know lift and drop

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:56,190
which at the very start of the project

00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:58,829
was what everyone had thought this

00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:00,359
project would be it was just simply

00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:01,920
carrying a database over to the new

00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:04,589
system and just putting the the CMS on

00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:07,109
top but no it was we had to manually

00:40:04,589 --> 00:40:10,700
recreate everything which sort amplified

00:40:07,109 --> 00:40:10,700
the complexity of the project so much

00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:22,850
sure so the question was why didn't we

00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:25,040
know what the the CMS was we knew what

00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:28,010
this is what the system was it just

00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:31,120
wasn't up and operational so we knew

00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:31,120
that we were working on this system

00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:44,960
crikey it's um we went from Stalin to

00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:46,850
fat while so yeah it was funny because

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,830
we weren't from an earlier version of

00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:51,410
fat wire over to Stalin and then back to

00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:53,510
a newer version of that wire so as far

00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:55,490
as the rationale I don't know but some

00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:57,910
the bottom line is we didn't have access

00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:57,910
to it

00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,730
you

00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:28,520
sure so the question was when talking to

00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:29,960
the the product managers you know how do

00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:32,630
we describe the project to them whether

00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,670
or not it was a you know a straight-up

00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:37,400
migration or something like a brand new

00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:40,610
website we were trying to be strategic

00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:42,350
in how we were framing this so for the

00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:45,500
most part we said it was a straight-up

00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:47,840
migration and you know what we said was

00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:50,570
like your content will generally be

00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,550
moved over one for one in particular

00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:55,790
areas where there was actually more

00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:57,680
changes so for instance where someone

00:41:55,790 --> 00:42:00,170
had an old version of say the pricing

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,170
table we were a little bit different in

00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:05,510
how we how we approached it so we said

00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:07,700
you and I both know that this content is

00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:10,400
really old hey we've got this really

00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:12,200
fantastic new module to display all this

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,200
would you wouldn't you like something

00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:17,090
like that so yeah just depended on on I

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:22,990
guess the state of the content that we

00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:22,990
were moving over sure

00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:39,820
so the question was did we get any

00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:43,190
resistance in using the physical space

00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:46,040
no generally speaking it was it was

00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:47,750
pretty great like the the developers

00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,880
themselves they didn't necessarily need

00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:52,580
to use that but they always use that as

00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:55,820
a reference so for us it was primarily

00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:57,500
same myself and the visual designer so

00:42:55,820 --> 00:43:00,349
we would throw up our stuff all over the

00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:02,890
place what was really effective was I

00:43:00,349 --> 00:43:07,099
think back here there was a giant ia

00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:09,349
that we printed up and the so if you

00:43:07,099 --> 00:43:13,040
just see in the corner that was sort of

00:43:09,349 --> 00:43:16,700
a blown-up a zero version of the of the

00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:18,980
ia that we we put together and basically

00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:21,380
the producers use that as their as their

00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:22,790
reference point so they would often just

00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:24,980
get together in the morning and say okay

00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:27,859
you take this section you take this

00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:30,670
section etc etc so I know it was

00:43:27,859 --> 00:43:30,670
generally well received

00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,400
I

00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:56,290
sure I guess we were fortunate that the

00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:58,690
people editing the content were the

00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:59,860
producers so it wasn't the end so it

00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:02,770
wasn't the product managers and the

00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:04,000
marketing guys making the changes so we

00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:10,180
had a little bit of control in that

00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:11,740
sense but also I guess I think the

00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:13,390
people sort of heading up the project

00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:17,440
that at a higher level were really

00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:19,900
concerned about performance and so the

00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,900
guys basically said if you put in

00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:24,220
WYSIWYG you'll get all of this bloat and

00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:28,090
because we were so mindful of how things

00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:29,170
were previously yeah it was just we knew

00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:32,670
we didn't want to go down that path

00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:35,260
because it was almost a step towards

00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:36,400
enabling source mode and then we would

00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:38,790
just have the same problem all over

00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,790
again

00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:53,040
yes yeah that would just that we're just

00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,040
using straight up source code

00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:45,410
so just to make sure I've got the

00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:48,350
question right did the how do we prevent

00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:50,120
you know the decay of the content and do

00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:51,980
we you know as part of you know as part

00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:54,950
of the project did we start educating

00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:57,650
the people like so product managers and

00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:59,800
so on about data structures and things

00:45:57,650 --> 00:45:59,800
like that

00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:20,560
yeah at a very basic level it was to get

00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:23,170
get this off Stalin and I guess the way

00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:26,530
the the the process is tended to work

00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:29,230
was you know the the product managers

00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:30,880
and so on they interfaced with updates

00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:34,090
to the website through the online team

00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:37,870
and so they didn't care how it was done

00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:39,550
often they just wanted it done so you

00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:41,140
know we had to like I think the

00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:43,510
education part wasn't really a high

00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:46,300
priority for us it was just we needed to

00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:48,070
tell them whatever it needs whatever um

00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,750
we needed to tell them just the other

00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:52,420
job done and also let them know of the

00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:53,890
benefits but often they there weren't

00:46:52,420 --> 00:47:04,350
necessarily directly involved in the

00:46:53,890 --> 00:47:04,350
