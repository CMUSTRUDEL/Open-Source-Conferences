Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Turning mountains into molehills - large-scale content migration
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	In 2012, I led a major content migration from one CMS to another for a large organisation. While most saw this as a straightforward "lift and drop" - we saw this as an
opportunity to address customer's problems and frustrations that have long since existed. Our challenge was to walk the tightrope between improving what we know needs to be fixed while remaining pragmatic and meeting our deadline.

Could both be achieved? I'll share the lessons learned and the techniques we used to make
this happen, including:

* Designing for the content producer
* Establishing a style guide
* Using content templates to make it adaptable

We knew we could not change the world, but we couldn't let an opportunity to make
comprehensive improvements pass by.
