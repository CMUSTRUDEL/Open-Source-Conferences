Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Suncorp Group: Growing and Managing a Drupal Team in your Corporation
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	Growing a team in a large corporation is tough. Growing a team with no supporting infrastructure, development skills or roadmap is almost impossible. Those were our challenges when we started down the Drupal journey in Suncorp Group. We are a large diverse company with many well known brands including Suncorp Bank, AAMI, GIO, Bingle, Apia, Asteron, Vero and Shannons.

In Suncorp there was a time before Drupal, when there were large vendor content management systems, bespoke internal sites, agency managed websites and websites running on personal servers. As a corporation, we needed a flexible, secure, scalable and modern system to manage our corporate sites, whether they are external, internal, secure sites or content repositories and Drupal was the chosen platform.

In this talk, you will be hearing about the time after Drupal at Suncorp, specifically focusing on how we built a sustainable team to support over 30 large corporate Drupal sites (and growing). We will be discussing the challenges in starting up the team, what we had to help grow the team, how we kept the team engaged and retain talent, what we did when we became a victim of our own success (too much work!) and why a being a Drupal developer in Suncorp is a hot commodity.

The discussions and case study here will be very familiar to challenges and situations you may be facing with your own company or business when managing your teams.

so welcome everyone hope you enjoy and

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:11,059
rubicon so far this talk is a case

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:14,610
studies about Suncorp group and how we

00:00:11,059 --> 00:00:17,880
sat on the drupal journey a few years

00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:22,850
back so hopefully it's you find it

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:26,670
useful have some takeaways for yourself

00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:31,349
myself I'm chungu team leader for the

00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:33,300
new media team in Suncorp group the new

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:37,649
media team looks after our corporate

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:44,340
websites basically it grew from a team

00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:47,129
of developers to now purely almost group

00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:50,309
of developers who work on Drupal so our

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:52,829
main platform in Suncorp that serves our

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:58,440
group of corporate sites is the Drupal

00:00:52,829 --> 00:01:00,059
platform I started term in Suncorp about

00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,469
four years ago but before that I was

00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:04,260
with another company that we've merged

00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:08,040
so offending numb in the crew for quite

00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,110
a long time 18 years overall but every

00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,439
four or five years arm this new company

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,490
that comes in and pekus over so I didn't

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:18,000
really have to move around too much

00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:20,040
things are moving around around me I

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,229
became a team leader in about two years

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,990
ago and prior to that I was the

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:27,000
developer within the team so I've worked

00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,490
quite a bit on Drupal itself but

00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,619
nowadays more managing then then working

00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,619
on the technical aspects of true pool

00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:40,950
feel free to ask any questions at any

00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:43,979
time you feel like it's quite fluid

00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:47,060
presentation so you have any questions

00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,060
just raise your hand

00:01:48,790 --> 00:02:00,940
a bit about Suncorp itself the Suncorp

00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:04,940
is a very large corporation it's a

00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:06,860
conglomerate of smaller companies which

00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:10,880
we call now brands they used to be

00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:14,120
companies and it has 16,000 plus

00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:17,750
employees and it's a top-25 a XX listed

00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,730
company it's quite unique in the

00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:22,550
Australian market it's really the only

00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:27,980
company we know that does banking

00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:33,500
insurance wealth and life and it is the

00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:35,270
largest second t bank in australia since

00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,610
the merge with pramana which you hear

00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:39,890
about in a minute it is also one of the

00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,390
largest insurer in australia and some of

00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:48,200
the famous brands you can see there's

00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:50,450
Amy Jo APR shannon's those those brands

00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:57,920
are quite large and we have the military

00:02:50,450 --> 00:03:02,239
majority of the market so 2009 was

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:05,290
special for a few reasons that's the

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:10,030
year lat multiple checks and passed away

00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:14,420
of the most biggest popular pop artist

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:16,280
history of music also the Harry Potter

00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:19,970
in ice age was quite popular at the time

00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:23,150
as well barack obama won the nobel peace

00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:26,870
prize at the time and the h1n1 swine flu

00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:31,160
with the pandemic for the year and also

00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:33,110
was a year of natural disasters we

00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,940
couldn't forget the 2,000 homes in

00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:39,049
hundreds industry lives lost in Victoria

00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:40,760
and that on in that year but it was also

00:03:39,049 --> 00:03:44,500
also a year a song called by

00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,340
transformation in corporate strategy the

00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,209
transformation that happened was that

00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:55,040
suncor started to adopt open source so

00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:57,230
prior to that it was very vendor centric

00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,540
so had a lot of large vendors in the

00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:02,340
company themselves such as IBM and

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:05,580
Microsoft but with our sea

00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:08,250
I owe at the time he had a vision that

00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,800
says the future is open source and and

00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,019
that's where we're headed not just

00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,959
withdrew before other platforms as well

00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:18,510
like a boss in the company another

00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:20,820
important transformation that song

00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:23,940
called went through was agile we dajjal

00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,780
methodology in that year and we trained

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:29,490
in that year 3000 people in Suncorp

00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:34,080
virtually in in agile and that's in our

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:36,300
business technology areas only so it was

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,360
a very important year the other reason

00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:41,729
was important was that Drupal was

00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,680
introduced the Sun call that was the

00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:50,370
first time we heard about Drupal and

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:52,139
with that Union these are some of the

00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:56,669
sites that we have now that runs on

00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:59,700
Drupal it's it's a sample of some of our

00:04:56,669 --> 00:05:02,010
popular sites we have 30 sites 30

00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:08,400
corporate sites and we maintain and

00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:10,950
build all of these over the years but

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,280
why Drupal why was it why was Drupal

00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:16,610
chosen ahead of countless other web

00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,080
content management systems out there and

00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:24,539
to tell that story i'll probably have to

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:27,690
go back to a time before 2009 so Suncorp

00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:29,840
group which we are now was made up of

00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:34,889
two very large companies at the time

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:38,490
suncorp was primarily a bank and prior

00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:40,080
to 2006 that was this major business so

00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,470
if you were in Queensland anyone in

00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,380
Queensland run here suncorp is that

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:49,020
probably want the largest employer in

00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:51,360
Queensland pramod on the other hand was

00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:54,030
more arm in insurance and wealth

00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:56,690
business and Amyas probably the most

00:05:54,030 --> 00:06:01,110
famous brand it's probably the gym in

00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:04,470
promise sweet of brands and with the

00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:07,289
merger of the two suncorp became really

00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:12,080
strong in those areas with really strong

00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:15,570
brands and and well-known brands so

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,080
during that period about 2006-2007 there

00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,210
was cleaned

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,939
opportunities for the group's to get

00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:23,039
together pendant opportunities for for

00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:26,430
changes to be made but there were also

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,889
love uncertainty and the reasoning for

00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:31,080
that was each of these companies were in

00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:32,580
their own right very large so if you

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,409
take peach one of them out they were

00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,479
companies in her own right and they had

00:06:34,409 --> 00:06:39,210
their own systems their own processes

00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,759
own cultures and challenge for us was to

00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:45,289
bring it all together and merge it so

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:48,690
that we became one one group one team

00:06:45,289 --> 00:06:51,449
but that took time especially in the web

00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:53,789
systems so they said some of the samples

00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:58,409
of the web systems that were available

00:06:53,789 --> 00:07:00,840
at the time around 2006-2007 that we

00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:05,430
really no content management systems

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:08,370
that was suitable these were all bespoke

00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:11,610
web systems we had systems that were

00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:17,250
running on personal server system that's

00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:19,500
were outsourced to agencies we had even

00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,240
systems running on laptops and you can

00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,319
imagine people run this ellipse on a

00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:30,719
laptop if they take this laptop home

00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:33,949
whoops i'll be down so it's it wasn't an

00:07:30,719 --> 00:07:36,539
ideal situation but like i said

00:07:33,949 --> 00:07:38,940
companies because there was more some of

00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:40,560
them were quite small only make one

00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,449
hundred thousand dollars a year they

00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,759
can't afford to have large system to run

00:07:42,449 --> 00:07:49,020
their their platform so they had to make

00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:52,139
do with whatever was there and as a

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:53,759
result around that time even though we

00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:56,190
knew that online was an important

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:59,750
channel it wasn't really profitable for

00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:03,060
Suncorp most of the sites were actually

00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:05,849
not supportable there was no system to

00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:07,830
actually produce content create content

00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:10,319
maintain content was created once and

00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:12,180
remained for quite a while there were

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,039
also high risk there was no one really

00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:15,960
looking around to see whether the size

00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:18,690
was hackable or not and what kind of

00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,509
security systems were put in place and

00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:24,149
in fact some of those sites were be

00:08:21,509 --> 00:08:25,569
phased in hat and all of that so it was

00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:30,639
quite dangerous

00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:32,349
also on these sites workmate research so

00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,599
you cannot go in there and do a search

00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:36,610
and actually find a product that you

00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,009
want to buy unless you know where to go

00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,300
though if you know Suncorp oil so if you

00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:42,339
know it's certain product that you need

00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:44,550
you probably find it with the URL you

00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:47,680
can actually not actually search for it

00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:50,680
so overall it was expensive to actually

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:54,100
maintain these sites with Suncorp during

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:56,769
that is years and then besides although

00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,600
we're making money when Papa because we

00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:03,880
put so much money into just maintaining

00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:06,339
them so really we needed a flexible

00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:10,120
content management system very very

00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:13,149
quickly mainly because we saw our

00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,889
competitors who were moving quickly a

00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:17,259
lot of the large minutes out there had

00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:20,079
sites out there that were responding to

00:09:17,259 --> 00:09:22,569
the market trends online technology we

00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:25,120
saw was accelerating at a phenomenal

00:09:22,569 --> 00:09:28,990
pace and mobile adoption thanks to the

00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,420
iphone was coming into its own our

00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:35,290
businesses needed a system that they can

00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:37,630
update content independent by T so prior

00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:40,500
to this a change even just a small

00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:43,269
change would have taken about five days

00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:47,589
because you cannot release on a weekly

00:09:43,269 --> 00:09:50,050
cycle so spelling mistake make lasts for

00:09:47,589 --> 00:09:53,889
five days what actually gets fixed and

00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:57,910
that wasn't ideal for us so what's true

00:09:53,889 --> 00:10:00,430
well Savior at the time not quite yet

00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:02,730
because as you can see there we went

00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:05,170
through a very rigorous process of

00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:06,939
evaluating all the different content

00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,319
systems that were there there were more

00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:11,649
than that but these were the mains ones

00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:15,399
that we focused on and with the new

00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:16,990
corporate strategy of open source we

00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:19,089
really focused on a lot of the open

00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:20,649
source of apart from one which is the

00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:24,220
one on the left you see there which is

00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:26,410
IBM wcm and the reason for idea our BMW

00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,839
see em being in the mix was that there

00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:34,110
was still our major vendor in sun call

00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:34,110
at the time and they had a quite

00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:40,959
quite good offering because it was based

00:10:37,569 --> 00:10:43,899
on Java Suncorp had a very big Java team

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,730
and using our core skills actually we

00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:48,670
can do things very quickly by BMW seeing

00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:51,939
him but why wasn't it picked it wasn't

00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:54,879
picked because when you look at their

00:10:51,939 --> 00:10:57,850
roadmap the flexibility and now previous

00:10:54,879 --> 00:11:00,300
relationships with some of the work that

00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:05,439
we needed it wasn't as flexible as

00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:06,639
something that was open source so other

00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:09,279
open source system will all go was

00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:12,459
botnet nuke for based on a.net platform

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:17,499
live raid based on java joomla and

00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:20,949
wordpress and obviously drupal the

00:11:17,499 --> 00:11:25,300
reason why we chose Drupal was not

00:11:20,949 --> 00:11:30,389
because it was better than any of the

00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:33,850
others but adding up all the positives

00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:36,970
out ways I love the other systems that

00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:38,949
you saw there and the the biggest aspect

00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:41,499
of it was that was when we were starting

00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:44,829
it was Drupal 6 triple Siculus was the

00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:46,749
the call triple version the triple 7 was

00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:51,100
just in the works and triple 7 promised

00:11:46,749 --> 00:11:54,009
so much especially for enterprise level

00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:57,100
features things up deployment and all of

00:11:54,009 --> 00:12:01,600
that but also we analyzed some of the

00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:03,189
road maps that Drupal provided and look

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,959
probably the most promising that was out

00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:07,899
there it was the most flexible most

00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:11,079
scalable and the community was very

00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:16,899
active and growing very quickly so that

00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:19,360
made Drupal probably the highest ranking

00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:23,230
system that that we chose but the real

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:27,040
reason why we chose jable was that how

00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:33,029
businesses how managers gave us the

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:36,519
support so it was it's exactly like that

00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:39,100
we they asked what we wanted we said

00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:41,649
dhruva was really good and we want to

00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,379
juice drupal and literally the manager

00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:46,600
said yep okay go for it but that wasn't

00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:47,740
it that wasn't the crux of it the cross

00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,990
it was a once

00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:54,430
okay he actually supported us all the

00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:55,690
way through because if unit large

00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:59,290
enterprise how many people he's in

00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:01,630
enterprise in a large corporation so not

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:04,930
too many but if you're in an enterprise

00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:06,640
trying to get some of these fundamental

00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:09,930
taint changes through can be quite hard

00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:15,070
the number of processes and the and the

00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:16,390
no red tape you have to go through can

00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,400
be quite challenging unless you have

00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:19,540
that support so it's very important to

00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,820
have the support especially of the

00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,950
higher up the better and we did have

00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:25,750
that support the business themselves

00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:27,190
didn't really care at the time what

00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:30,760
platform we chose so long as that

00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:32,860
allowed them to you know to publish

00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:36,220
quickly that was their main primary

00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:39,070
concern but we had we had a great

00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:43,090
support from from our arm he seconds

00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:54,490
manager at the time but Drupal wasn't

00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:57,040
very popular sorry yep so we had him for

00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:59,380
about three months literally look there

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,720
was a lot of changes and when he became

00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:04,030
our manager he said we needed content

00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:07,060
management system so from that three

00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:09,340
month period to when we had something to

00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:14,110
present to him it's just three months

00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:17,290
yeah but not everyone was convinced that

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:19,450
Drupal was the right solution so the

00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:21,250
main concerns with that well an

00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:23,650
enterprise and we're using open source

00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:27,550
open source is not safe right that was a

00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:28,630
I don't know that myth for or the kind

00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,550
of think you know we have but that was

00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:33,160
one of the concerns the other concern

00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,480
was that where the vendors and no

00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,640
there's no vendor support and at that

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,010
time aquia was around but a clear was

00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:41,320
still fairly small and in the United

00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:46,090
States not a lot of presence in

00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:49,060
Australia and in Australia self in 2009

00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:52,510
and now you remember that it's total

00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:55,870
lack of developers out there you may be

00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:57,250
going to a meetup or a group or forum

00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,490
and you might find people there and

00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:01,390
that's what we ended up going but

00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,760
looking in the market on

00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:08,050
equal curry or whatever you cannot find

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:09,880
a drupal developer that you can hire so

00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:12,220
those are the main concerns but we

00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,740
alleviate it a lot of that again with

00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:24,010
the support of the other managers

00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:26,890
because sorry because we had the belief

00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:28,600
that we can achieve this basically and

00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,890
with that support we were able to get

00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,330
through a lot of these questions and

00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:33,460
overcome a lot of these questions

00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:36,240
because of the transformation that will

00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:38,650
going through at the time had we weren't

00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,180
were not in that transformation it might

00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:42,130
have been a little bit harder to do that

00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:45,910
we might have had to go with one of the

00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:49,810
vendor specific systems so I just want

00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:52,900
to make a quick observation if you want

00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:54,850
to push Drupal into your cooperation do

00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,430
your research a lack of compelling

00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:59,260
reasons why you need it but ensure that

00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:01,120
you have very very strong support from

00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:04,770
your leaders for the journey either

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:09,430
business leaders or your managers or

00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:16,180
anyone who has the power to make the

00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:18,340
decision basically so now that we have

00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:20,470
chosen a platform and it's going to be

00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:25,630
Drupal how'd it go about building the

00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:30,190
team so this is what we had when we

00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:34,000
started there's no road map I was no

00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:38,100
infrastructure and our skills in Drupal

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:40,660
word zero nope all we did during the

00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:42,700
when we evaluate it was that due to food

00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:45,340
proof-of-concept sites brought it up on

00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:47,320
local machines and that's all we had but

00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:51,670
everything else was learning from

00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:54,640
scratch what we had a lot was passionate

00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:58,770
people and these people were the ones

00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,770
that were enabled us to become a barrier

00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:03,040
that did not have any skills or

00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,839
knowledge but they had the willingness

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,600
to actually learn I had the willingness

00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:11,949
to just give it a go and just went out

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:14,079
and try things and with that we were

00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:17,529
able to actually start

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:21,399
how do we set up our team to do that so

00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:24,819
basically this was how start so there

00:17:21,399 --> 00:17:26,649
was two two streams it was a platform

00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:30,039
stream and the development stream and

00:17:26,649 --> 00:17:32,679
then some stakeholders in the platform

00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:36,850
stream keeping in mind that these people

00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:40,360
also had no idea how does have a Drupal

00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:46,539
platform what is it that we needed but

00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:48,279
they had the you know the power to take

00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:51,220
the risk because again we had that

00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:53,230
support so architect led the network's

00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:55,960
team that middleware ten mid-range and

00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:57,840
database team and later on we brought on

00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:01,360
security deployment and storage and

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:05,019
finally once we have perform we can play

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,760
with the bcp which is the business

00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:10,299
continuity teams and also the access

00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:11,889
teams in the development area we had a

00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:13,809
tech lead leading our internal

00:18:11,889 --> 00:18:16,059
developers it's only two of them and a

00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:20,049
triple consultant and sheeit see I was

00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:23,740
standing at the back right there but as

00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:25,809
mentioned before we didn't have a lot of

00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:29,139
people who can call on to actually help

00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:32,710
us but with the consultants and internal

00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:37,240
dev ops which are myself and one of my

00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:38,980
tech lead behind there at the moment had

00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,860
a platform consultant so we had two

00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:45,190
consultants in and with the tech lead

00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:47,049
worked on the development space our

00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,639
business partners were kept informed but

00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:50,289
I've mentioned that when tree interested

00:18:48,639 --> 00:18:52,840
at that time I just wanted to see the

00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:54,850
end product we had to keep our legal at

00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,320
risk in our marketing and communication

00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:59,590
seems informed because they really want

00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:02,909
to make sure that what we deliver is not

00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:05,380
going to put some curb at risk again

00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:08,620
reminding that term it was open source

00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:13,539
and it was not something usable and

00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:16,950
enterprise to do so in three months we

00:19:13,539 --> 00:19:21,130
literally worked day and night to

00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:22,750
actually have the platform ready but in

00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:26,230
delivering the platform it wasn't

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:27,260
perfect it had we try to go for a

00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,690
perfect platform

00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:32,360
I don't think we have we would have come

00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:33,770
out so we didn't have continuous

00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:38,090
integration we didn't have a testing

00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:40,190
platform there we did not allow editors

00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:43,400
to edit on the live server which a lot

00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:45,010
of Drupal sites if you worked or build

00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,200
your own size actually allow you to do

00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:50,330
but what we did have was a platform that

00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:53,000
can host sites or multiple regions and

00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:55,190
that were that was the minimum that we

00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:00,890
needed to launch and that was the

00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:04,010
minimum that that we had we also have

00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:05,120
some practices that had anyone who come

00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:07,340
and worked it wasn't there's quite a few

00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:10,160
contractors homework to us that weren't

00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:14,930
best practice such as how we use a

00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:16,580
version or how we use versioning it's

00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:19,640
not best practice but that didn't really

00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:23,210
matter and still hasn't mattered if we

00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:25,040
have ways to and to maintain it in ways

00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:27,650
to be aware of what we're doing is is

00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:32,480
not conforming to best practice but we

00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:36,470
can overcome that so with this platform

00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:39,710
it allowed us to go live and these are

00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:41,600
the regions that we have so it's a very

00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:44,240
simplified one and this is probably as

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,580
simple as it as it got at the time but

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,430
it's much more complex than that now but

00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:53,510
the internal developers work on in the

00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:55,040
in the development region once they've

00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,320
created the side they've booked site

00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,940
running on the server and then migrate

00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,810
it I'll talk about migration a minute

00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:04,640
into the test where the developers and

00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:06,200
sometimes editors sometimes of business

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,590
people come in and actually test the

00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,780
site once it's ready to go up it gets

00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:13,250
pushed into the authoring region what is

00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,330
in author that's where our internal

00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:18,380
editors come in and putting their

00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:20,000
content and from there we push out to

00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:22,670
our live service which are locked down

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,670
and when I mean locked down all the

00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:28,970
services that aren't required are

00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:32,000
disabled so sometimes when you do

00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:33,290
something in test dev test northa then

00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,690
you put to life sometimes it doesn't

00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:38,150
work due to the amount of systems that

00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:39,950
we lock down in our life server so we

00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:42,070
also need to test here before we

00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:44,659
actually launched

00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:49,100
now we have high availability which

00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:51,519
means the sites are basically identical

00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:54,919
to each other in each of those streams

00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:56,690
but that also means we cannot edit in

00:21:54,919 --> 00:21:59,120
production as you see the database is

00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:02,090
actually separate so if yet into

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,679
production then you have disparate sites

00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:06,649
between each of those streams that's why

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:09,289
we lock them down but again that was

00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:13,940
enough to launch our site and have them

00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:16,879
highly available very secure and to this

00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,379
day the platform still runs but we

00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:21,110
realize that we need to move on from

00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:25,580
there and make it more armed add more

00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:27,889
features to it so these were you look

00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:30,139
here some of the first sites that was

00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:32,509
launched this one here and that one

00:22:30,139 --> 00:22:36,309
there were the first two sides that no

00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:40,789
longer exists because they've been sold

00:22:36,309 --> 00:22:43,970
but they have a sentimental value to us

00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:47,690
because they were the two that took us

00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:49,429
quite a while to to build a PR the one

00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:53,899
in the middle even though it was built

00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:56,750
in 2009 still runs perfectly and the

00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:58,700
reason for that was even though this is

00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:02,179
building triple six with building in a

00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:04,490
way that allows us to three themed the

00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:06,080
site without touching the core code so

00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:08,720
the site looks totally different to how

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:13,580
it was in 2006 but it's still relevant

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:18,350
today now the learning curve as

00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:20,539
mentioned before was quite steep drupal

00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:22,429
I don't know if you can remember back to

00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:25,429
one of the first days you've ever

00:23:22,429 --> 00:23:27,289
started ripple but in two thousand two

00:23:25,429 --> 00:23:32,769
thousand nine there was no courses no

00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:35,600
books for three books Burton count and

00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:37,610
it was hard finding Drupal developers to

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:40,039
help us so even though it's more site

00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:44,720
like that took a three months it wasn't

00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:46,230
term wasn't I guess easy thing for us to

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,550
do

00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:52,420
the other reason the other reason was

00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:56,680
that few corporate sites in Australia at

00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:58,920
that time was using Drupal I think I can

00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:02,430
remember one and that was lonely planet

00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:06,640
and they had literally a million pages

00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:07,690
in Drupal but we didn't really couldn't

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,520
use them because it was a totally

00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:13,930
different business so what we did we

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:16,540
took one of their platform expert to

00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:20,860
come and help us set up our platform so

00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:22,930
that helped us a lot Blair but what it

00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:25,870
was it took we took a big risk in a leap

00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:30,720
of faith basically in going with Drupal

00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:30,720
and learning and practice and from then

00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:40,530
we reach now today so starting off with

00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:42,820
a humble beginnings of one small side

00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:45,910
this has been a giant leaf or sun call

00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:51,630
and drupal nowadays is used for anything

00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:55,860
from mobile to content repositories to

00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:55,860
whatever we need to do on the web space

00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:03,970
so i can make a second observation then

00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:05,680
keep the platform simple launch very

00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:07,840
very quickly use the community

00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:11,260
consultants and experts to get your

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:13,600
first win to an ally to grow and the

00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:16,420
most important thing there is you need

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,670
to do it quickly because if you're

00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:21,760
launching as a platform new platform

00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:24,850
honest and a site that it's kind of take

00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:27,070
you months or even a year to do and it's

00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:29,500
imperative that term as i mentioned

00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:31,140
before we needed something quick that

00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:34,060
would have just pushed us back

00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:36,870
straightaway so wasn't popular important

00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,870
to launch quickly

00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:48,020
now from 2009 was just a matter of time

00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:52,169
for the team to grow the business demand

00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:54,809
was huge business was just waiting for

00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:59,330
something out there to enable them to

00:25:54,809 --> 00:26:02,640
actually engage their customers

00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:04,799
basically and drupal was seen as that

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:08,730
platform once we had those three sites

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:10,679
up the more advanced businesses the ones

00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:13,320
that interact the customers the personal

00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:15,780
insurance business of Amy NGO jumped on

00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,390
the bandwagon straightaway and they were

00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:24,660
our largest sites that we had to work

00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:28,169
with even till today but it was still

00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:30,480
hard work we still had to go out speak

00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:34,110
to our businesses we still had to go to

00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:36,150
our board and did a lot of what we could

00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:38,240
selling at the time a lot of

00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:43,010
demonstrations and a lot of farm

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:45,360
convincing because if we didn't do that

00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:48,540
it would not have got out there we were

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,190
still a small team and people were still

00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:53,070
happy running their sites the way they

00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:59,460
were even though we knew it wasn't it

00:26:53,070 --> 00:27:03,600
wasn't supportable so the team grew very

00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:07,850
very quickly in 2009 we had basically

00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:11,090
five developers developed three sites

00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:14,880
and as you can see if double in 2010

00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:20,520
doubled again 2011 this is where we are

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:25,250
now last year we launched 29 sites we

00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:28,470
have about 30 people in the team now but

00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:31,320
that doesn't sound a lot for 30 people

00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:32,850
keep in mind that we also have to

00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:35,070
support all these other things that we

00:27:32,850 --> 00:27:38,280
built previous years but to support all

00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:42,630
these sides as well so we do end-to-end

00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:46,710
work we do projects we support the site

00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:48,740
we do consulting and we basically are

00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:52,100
the front end group

00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:55,480
son call so we do also Suncorp front

00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:58,670
ends for java teams and a lot of that so

00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,650
in last year we did pretty non sides

00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:08,270
with more than a thousand other smaller

00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:10,850
pieces just this team so quite busy but

00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:13,460
we can't do all of that out of justice

00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:17,570
Sydney where we are so our teams

00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:19,640
distributed and the reason why we have

00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:22,250
that is a business is across Australia

00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:25,370
so in Brisbane for example that's where

00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:28,400
I'll call bank businesses in Melbourne

00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:30,920
as well call insurances and Sydney it's

00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:33,860
our life and wealth but we will ask that

00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:36,730
this team here in Chengdu our partners

00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:41,000
and our partners allow us to flex

00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:43,790
without our partners we with the amount

00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,400
of people and developers that we have we

00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:51,800
were not able to support all the amount

00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:53,720
of work that comes through but that

00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:56,000
presents other challenges with such a

00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:58,100
distributed team how do we keep them all

00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,059
engaged how kidding or collaborate it

00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:03,640
and fortunately in Suncorp we invest a

00:29:02,059 --> 00:29:07,520
lot of money and technologies for

00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:09,920
collaboration our Sun core group itself

00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:13,160
is 16,000 people and it's evenly

00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:15,260
distributed across the three states so

00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:17,860
the investment in these kind of

00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:22,130
technologies of video screens and and

00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:24,800
communication mechanisms has been huge

00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:26,510
so this allows us for example to do

00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:30,740
stand up because talk about agile a

00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:34,160
minute to do stand ups via VC not in the

00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:36,100
room just out in the open these are

00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:39,230
these are you can push these anywhere

00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:42,800
and also it allows us to actually set up

00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:45,290
a screen like this and have it on four

00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,840
full days so you can actually see if the

00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:49,309
person is there that you want to talk to

00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,450
you don't have to pick up a phone or

00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:52,700
whatever you can actually just go there

00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:55,070
stand then maybe wave your arm or say

00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,610
hello to actually get their attention

00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:57,610
and

00:29:58,509 --> 00:30:02,649
it's not expensive to set up something

00:30:00,219 --> 00:30:04,779
like this you can get a TV screen a

00:30:02,649 --> 00:30:07,529
fairly cheap camera is a fairly cheap

00:30:04,779 --> 00:30:11,829
and this is just a netbook running skype

00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:17,259
$300 netbook setting something like this

00:30:11,829 --> 00:30:21,009
up is not very expensive and skype is

00:30:17,259 --> 00:30:23,889
our primary tool for connecting with

00:30:21,009 --> 00:30:27,159
other teams at all but we also recently

00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:29,289
invested in technological link which is

00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:31,749
at Microsoft Technology if you use

00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:33,429
Microsoft your way of link and we used

00:30:31,749 --> 00:30:35,529
to link TV which allows us to have

00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:37,869
multiple conversations with multiple

00:30:35,529 --> 00:30:39,729
people at the same time so you may have

00:30:37,869 --> 00:30:41,319
someone working from home so Suncorp

00:30:39,729 --> 00:30:43,209
supports flexible working environment

00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:47,699
and you can be working from home and

00:30:43,209 --> 00:30:47,699
still communicate for your team members

00:30:49,709 --> 00:30:55,719
the other challenge we had was trying to

00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:58,509
attract talent and the way we overcome

00:30:55,719 --> 00:31:00,549
that is with rotations and cross

00:30:58,509 --> 00:31:03,459
training at Suncorp group so pop group

00:31:00,549 --> 00:31:07,599
itself is quite big and opportunities

00:31:03,459 --> 00:31:10,559
for people to move around is a bounce so

00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:13,029
you may be a Java developer you maybe

00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:16,149
have a developer for many years but you

00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:22,569
want to change careers that's when you

00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:24,909
would come to our team we've had doc net

00:31:22,569 --> 00:31:28,629
developers Java developers or even

00:31:24,909 --> 00:31:31,899
people who coming from the graduate

00:31:28,629 --> 00:31:37,929
programs joining our teams our team it's

00:31:31,899 --> 00:31:39,669
quite diverse and quite young and we

00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:41,529
have a training and support program in

00:31:39,669 --> 00:31:43,509
there that allows these people who have

00:31:41,529 --> 00:31:47,679
no Drupal skills to come up to speed

00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:49,179
with people very very quickly now the

00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,919
reason why we do that is again pure

00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:53,319
Drupal developers you heard reach this

00:31:50,919 --> 00:31:55,059
morning and few other talks today talk

00:31:53,319 --> 00:31:58,629
about how pill Drupal develops are still

00:31:55,059 --> 00:32:01,149
very rare in the marketplace even trying

00:31:58,629 --> 00:32:03,569
to find them in current day and age much

00:32:01,149 --> 00:32:06,309
better than when it was in 2009 but

00:32:03,569 --> 00:32:08,709
trying to find them it's very rare you

00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:10,779
can get PHP or juvenile developers or

00:32:08,709 --> 00:32:13,960
WordPress but getting someone with

00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:16,010
rupaul's it's not as easy

00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,700
so what's our draining it support

00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:22,850
program like basically we put them to

00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:26,059
work straight away so this is the 770

00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:29,390
twenty ten percent rule so seventy

00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:32,930
percent of their learnings education the

00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:37,580
way they work is from doing on the

00:32:32,930 --> 00:32:39,950
on-the-job real work twenty percent of

00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:42,140
the time we'll be pairing them with

00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:44,120
another expert another trooper expert

00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,170
and the other ten percent where they

00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,260
pick up the temperature of the knowledge

00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:51,620
is from videos that we have from courses

00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:53,780
from bulk and with this training and

00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:56,300
support program in place we find that

00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:58,100
developers who have no skills in Drupal

00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,350
at all come up to speed in about two

00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:03,260
weeks basically in two weeks time that

00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:06,620
we're afraid of Drupal unable to really

00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:10,880
work on on their own in four weeks with

00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:12,470
this program they are able to build

00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,290
their own site virtually and we've had

00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:16,850
that repeated over and over other we've

00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:21,559
graduates or people who just change

00:33:16,850 --> 00:33:24,710
their their careers and that compares to

00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:26,270
three months when we started is it's a

00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:27,890
huge saving in time and that's how we

00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:32,960
were able to bring our people up very

00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:35,210
very quickly within our team and it's

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:37,340
it's it's a model that term is repeated

00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:44,450
across not just in our team but other

00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:46,460
other teams in Suncorp as well so how do

00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:49,670
we remain competitive then how do we

00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:54,080
keep ourselves up to date and how do we

00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:55,700
actually find your work so what we do

00:33:54,080 --> 00:34:00,700
here is we out focus on our core

00:33:55,700 --> 00:34:03,080
competencies and outsource anything that

00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:05,660
we find it's going to take us too long

00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:09,139
to do or it's not something that we

00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:11,629
wanted to head into for example a few

00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:14,480
years ago we didn't have any ux or

00:34:11,629 --> 00:34:17,720
design skills so we would partner with

00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,820
agencies so i should do that will focus

00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,800
on actually just building sites very

00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:24,919
quickly after we receive the actual

00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:27,139
output from those agencies instead of

00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:29,480
trying to design it ourselves times have

00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:32,000
changed a little bit so we are now

00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:34,909
focusing on those UX and design areas

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:38,720
but when we started we just focus on the

00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:41,750
core competencies we're continually

00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:45,440
monitor the market you cannot stop doing

00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:47,060
this the market is in our space

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,480
especially moves really really quickly

00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:53,450
so we had to try out new ideas and

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,250
implementing at least two new ideas and

00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:57,470
every site that we build and that's at

00:34:55,250 --> 00:35:00,230
least most sites especially cook ones

00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:04,040
have at least ten you of twenty new

00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:05,540
features so it's it's our policy to

00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,730
actually try to implement to new ideas

00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:10,960
and then we reuse those ideas as we

00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:14,900
build a new site so things like

00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:16,760
galleries or click to chat and those

00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,340
kind of things we reuse all those ideas

00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:21,650
as we build new sites and it becomes

00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:23,090
quicker and quicker this allows our

00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:26,780
businesses to be more competitive and

00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:30,850
not and spend less time trying to build

00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:32,960
these features which is reused them

00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:35,120
another very important aspect of

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,570
remaining competitive is to showcase to

00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:41,090
other corporations so we have people

00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:43,400
like Google or optus and those are the

00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:46,400
cool presents visiting our a workplace

00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,440
we showcase what we do to them because

00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,500
kind of things we do are also the kind

00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:53,780
of things that they do and by sharing

00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:56,500
our knowledge sharing what we do we all

00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:56,500
learn from each other

00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:06,800
so core competencies as you see sites

00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:09,740
either what we do the most mobile we

00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:11,630
also do mobile web not mobile app native

00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:14,780
applications this other team that dilute

00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:18,080
the female our corporation content

00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:23,320
repositories and what that means is that

00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:26,180
we use Drupal to stall content if you

00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:32,240
does anyone here work with Java or is in

00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:36,730
the java space the java space tends to

00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:39,260
move to deploy quite slowly so to make a

00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:42,680
change in java and then deploy may take

00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:46,100
you two or three days drupal can do that

00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:48,410
within minutes now we use the content

00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:50,270
repository posit or ease to allow called

00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:51,800
content editors to actually go in there

00:36:50,270 --> 00:36:53,900
make changes to content which is

00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:57,140
displayed on a java applications and

00:36:53,900 --> 00:37:00,470
deploy that within minutes traditionally

00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:02,870
to do that would have required a

00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:05,360
developer in java to sit down manage the

00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:07,670
content and then push it out and that

00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,780
goes through many processes now we save

00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:10,760
them a lot of time by viewing these

00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:14,450
content repositories and exposing their

00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:16,880
content to those job applications and we

00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:20,030
also do our campaigns Oh quite a bit of

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,980
campaigns so these are sites that have

00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:27,320
changed I'd say in the last six months

00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:29,060
or so and the only reason why we can do

00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:34,370
that and some of these sites are fairly

00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:35,570
big amy-jo Suncorp all these sites have

00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:37,190
changed in the last six months any

00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:40,840
reason why how we can do that without

00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:43,130
team is that we reuse a lot of the work

00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:46,250
so the core code that's mentioned before

00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:50,660
is someone was doing to put six someone

00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:52,550
triple seven but the reuse features and

00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:55,250
all of that we were able to reuse and

00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:59,260
change sides very quickly most of our

00:37:55,250 --> 00:38:02,930
sites have mobile versions as well and

00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:07,160
these mobile versions leverage the

00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:09,080
content of the site so Drupal front end

00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:14,930
and the mobile uses

00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:18,980
same content and the thing we've built

00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:23,210
internally was campaigns or Facebook

00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:25,490
Applications here we take away all the

00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:28,820
technicalities of setting up a facebook

00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:30,740
application provide a simple front end

00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:33,530
for content editors to manage the actual

00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:36,770
facebook app itself and then publish it

00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:38,600
to Facebook we have regions that allow

00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:42,470
them to test before they publish it live

00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:44,690
but by leveraging the power of Drupal

00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:49,010
will able to fight published a lot of

00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:51,230
Facebook apps very very quickly and this

00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:54,050
has been an interest in many

00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:55,610
corporations because a lot of time as a

00:38:54,050 --> 00:38:57,800
corporation you don't have the skills to

00:38:55,610 --> 00:39:01,030
build facebook apps look you're normally

00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:03,800
with go to an agency to do that but by

00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:05,750
taking away all the technicalities we

00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:10,870
allow our content attacks you do that

00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:13,430
themselves what we also do nowadays is

00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:15,530
your webtext d so you exits user

00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:18,290
experience the next day's experience

00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:20,120
design their areas that we're trying to

00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:23,540
focus on and build internal capability

00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:28,760
for that analytics it's very strong so

00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:32,300
analyzing data reusing the information

00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:38,150
and building better sites we also do a B

00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:40,430
testing which is um allows you to

00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:41,990
present different versions of sight to

00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:45,410
different groups of people and all talk

00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:47,870
to that in a minute and design so we

00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:49,760
have a little design capability that

00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:52,190
we're trying to build up and consultancy

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:55,670
we consult on everything front-end

00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:59,000
gamification development web

00:39:55,670 --> 00:40:02,530
architecture and in anything to do a

00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,530
front end with the consultancy

00:40:03,830 --> 00:40:11,640
this is a picture of public or clicktale

00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:15,540
basically it gives you a heat map of our

00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:18,510
site so this is an example of Gao winter

00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:20,490
great clicktale into our site to allow

00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:23,220
our user experience and experience

00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:26,010
designers to actually analyze how people

00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,750
using our site this is just one example

00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:34,890
of the tool that we do have integrated

00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:38,640
the Drupal itself this is a/b testing so

00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:41,790
a/b testing we use a tool from Adobe

00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:46,880
Cortez and target Justin target allows

00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:49,230
us to put in rules and parameters to

00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,550
target certain groups of people so as

00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:52,920
you can see if you're coming from New

00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:55,110
South Wales and the bingo site you get

00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:59,610
that look on the right if you're coming

00:40:55,110 --> 00:41:02,130
for the bingo from another state you get

00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:04,050
a different look and this allows us

00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:06,510
after a few months of testing and the

00:41:04,050 --> 00:41:08,130
results that come out to actually

00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:10,890
determine which one of them is better

00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:15,020
and look at on this Republican guess you

00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:18,060
know that was a lot better than that so

00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:22,290
in after the testing once we find out

00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:28,440
which one is better than we apply the

00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:32,010
look that's better the way we work at

00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:35,550
Suncorp is mentioned before during 2009

00:41:32,010 --> 00:41:38,190
with the transformation is agile we use

00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:43,020
agile for almost everything nowadays but

00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:46,290
again to start off it wasn't easy we

00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:49,160
trained 3,000 people in our area

00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:52,200
business technologies in agile in 2009

00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:54,480
really as to bring people up as quickly

00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:56,670
as possible and given people all the

00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,630
support that they need now all our

00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:03,570
projects go through the agile process

00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:05,820
which is a basically concept where we

00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:09,030
sit down and work out whether it's a

00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:10,830
viable project or not to do once we

00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:13,170
consider this viable will go through the

00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:15,360
initiate step which is basically go

00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:17,280
drill down into those details right

00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:21,870
story cards for each of those v

00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:24,360
cheese and estimate sighs them then

00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:26,910
again if it's still viable we still sign

00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:30,230
off then we go into the delivery face

00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:33,660
and that's an iterator face and we

00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:37,560
initially their job practices which are

00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:40,980
things like doing stand-ups or which

00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:45,210
perspectives which is revealing what you

00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:46,590
do and those kind of practices work we

00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:47,940
weren't we weren't doing them we're

00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:50,760
using the principles more so about

00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:53,310
collaboration and teamwork but nowadays

00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:56,400
we actually do a lot of the agile

00:42:53,310 --> 00:43:00,510
practices so we stand ups every day we

00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:03,870
do showcases in retrospective and the

00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:06,260
deployment so we have system set up now

00:43:03,870 --> 00:43:08,400
that we can deploy it very very quickly

00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:13,770
this is just an example of one of our

00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:16,380
Wars basically it's very hard to find a

00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:18,660
free space in the Sun call especially

00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:20,450
where where we work because the original

00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:23,520
wall space is just taken up with

00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:27,170
physical story cards officeworks doing

00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:30,660
very well from us of its cards and and

00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:36,210
bluetec and all that all of that's been

00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:39,060
held up a blue tag so we do iterative

00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:41,160
web development not just for project but

00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:47,610
also for bi you so this is an example of

00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:50,760
LBI you space and because we work

00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:52,560
distributed Lee distributive Lee we

00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:55,860
can't just rely on Wars we also have to

00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:58,740
use some tools and that's Giro and

00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:00,900
confluence that's in to allow us to

00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:03,120
share our views and our cards in our

00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:07,100
status with our other teams in in other

00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:07,100
in other states in other countries

00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:16,690
but recently we've also employed the

00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:21,160
lean startup model so lean startup model

00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:27,999
is about coming together to design

00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:32,289
quickly to launch a product quickly test

00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:36,990
it and let it fail quickly and then

00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:40,299
apply our learnings and then iterate so

00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:43,180
some of our sites that we've done we've

00:44:40,299 --> 00:44:45,430
applied this actual model to our site we

00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:47,859
beautiful quickly was employed to the

00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:49,269
market and then take the learnings from

00:44:47,859 --> 00:44:51,460
there it's not always going to be

00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:52,630
successful because really that's what we

00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:55,690
want to do we want to test to see

00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:57,970
whether it is successful or not other

00:44:55,690 --> 00:45:00,339
things we do within Suncorp every

00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:02,680
quarter is what we have what we call

00:45:00,339 --> 00:45:04,990
fedex or ship at days or dev days

00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:07,599
different terms around the place but

00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:12,369
basically that's if you have an idea you

00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:15,099
take it to your manager or you know need

00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:17,259
to really form a group of people and you

00:45:15,099 --> 00:45:20,259
for two days you two days straight you

00:45:17,259 --> 00:45:22,150
work on that idea and if you after two

00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:24,450
days you have a valid proof of concept

00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:27,220
and you take it to your manager again

00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:30,670
polycom production eyes it so there's a

00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:32,230
few of our systems or our applications

00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:34,329
that have gone for that process very

00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:37,450
successfully one of them you may have

00:45:34,329 --> 00:45:43,420
heard of if you watch TV alarm the Amy

00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:47,519
came zapped with a hook and what's her

00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:52,559
name Rhonda Rhonda in a tux oh that's

00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:58,450
came out from a fedex idea that we had

00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:59,589
our support structure so support

00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:01,119
structure is very important because

00:45:59,589 --> 00:46:04,599
we've been talking about Drupal quite a

00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:06,849
lot but without our in-house specialist

00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:09,579
so they're people like out our iteration

00:46:06,849 --> 00:46:12,579
managers who are who leads our delivery

00:46:09,579 --> 00:46:14,980
for agile our business analysts are you

00:46:12,579 --> 00:46:17,140
x and x d designers of content editors

00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:19,900
system engineers network engineers

00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:22,029
database we won't be able to have a

00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:25,239
successful system so in how specialists

00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:26,769
are very very important to us we also

00:46:25,239 --> 00:46:31,299
have consultants because we partner with

00:46:26,769 --> 00:46:33,670
a few cons are few technology firms out

00:46:31,299 --> 00:46:38,529
there and they provide us with new

00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:42,309
capabilities and new ideas and also

00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:44,440
allow us to flex the community so we are

00:46:42,309 --> 00:46:46,359
involved in community even though we're

00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:49,480
not surprised we don't work in isolation

00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:51,279
we do go out we do share stories and we

00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,410
do learn from other people in the

00:46:51,279 --> 00:46:55,089
community and that's very important

00:46:53,410 --> 00:47:00,339
especially in the open open source space

00:46:55,089 --> 00:47:02,950
and aquia recently we've with part of

00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:05,799
aquia to actually provide us with the

00:47:02,950 --> 00:47:09,339
actual corporate support and and Drupal

00:47:05,799 --> 00:47:12,940
core support and how our engagement with

00:47:09,339 --> 00:47:16,630
them is continues most importantly

00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:19,119
though is we take every single

00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:23,140
opportunity that we can to share and

00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:25,299
learn and Suncorp have fortunately a lot

00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:28,210
of these opportunities so can some of

00:47:25,299 --> 00:47:30,819
these pictures here my team are out

00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:33,700
there constantly sharing and learning

00:47:30,819 --> 00:47:36,430
about Drupal about platforms about new

00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:40,749
technologies and that's how we keep the

00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:48,599
interest and in the worker life with

00:47:40,749 --> 00:47:52,420
these kind of sessions so on observation

00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:55,119
the team if you have one will grow so we

00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:56,829
need a proper training support structure

00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:58,630
you need to focus on your core

00:47:56,829 --> 00:48:04,989
competencies and adopt a sound

00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:07,109
methodology and remain competitive thank

00:48:04,989 --> 00:48:07,109
you

00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:18,380
thanks very much is any questions

00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:46,279
it's a very good question so the

00:48:43,099 --> 00:48:47,930
question was whether different

00:48:46,279 --> 00:48:50,089
developers have different techniques and

00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:53,559
different ways of working how do we do

00:48:50,089 --> 00:48:58,010
of that so so it's a constant constant

00:48:53,559 --> 00:49:02,359
issue that we have and the way we do of

00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:04,160
that is to run workshops because if we

00:49:02,359 --> 00:49:05,510
get contractors in for example they're

00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:08,270
not aware of the process of the way we

00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:10,819
work we normally pair them with people

00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:13,450
that are already in the corporation for

00:49:10,819 --> 00:49:16,369
quite a while so they learn our process

00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:17,839
but there are literally times when we

00:49:16,369 --> 00:49:20,270
couldn't do that was with too busy and

00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:22,940
we have been bitten before where a

00:49:20,270 --> 00:49:24,260
developer may come in does it work go

00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:26,839
away and then we find that we can't

00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:28,869
maintain that site but the way we

00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:33,190
overcome a lot of that is have workshops

00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:35,510
and we call them quality workshops or

00:49:33,190 --> 00:49:37,400
one of our my tech lead running a

00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:39,140
front-end society so that to educate

00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:41,480
people on the way we work to help

00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:45,650
standardize and reduce a lot of these

00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:47,420
differences but that's that's one way we

00:49:45,650 --> 00:49:49,549
overcome it but there's always going to

00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:51,730
be a difference but to minimize that

00:49:49,549 --> 00:49:54,730
difference we have a lot of workshops

00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:54,730
yep

00:50:03,269 --> 00:50:11,200
yep so we still we still have some of

00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:13,089
that frustration so as you know with

00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:16,779
Triple C the way trooper works is you

00:50:13,089 --> 00:50:20,229
cannot just it doesn't provide back with

00:50:16,779 --> 00:50:22,359
compatibility basically so to move

00:50:20,229 --> 00:50:27,700
forward we all have to rebuild the site

00:50:22,359 --> 00:50:32,019
or rebuild some of our modules the way

00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:35,710
we overcome that is for the alcohol

00:50:32,019 --> 00:50:38,950
modules we would rewrite them but for

00:50:35,710 --> 00:50:41,319
the ones that non core which is find

00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:43,239
better ones or other ones that we can we

00:50:41,319 --> 00:50:48,670
can use again but the frustrations

00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:49,960
doesn't really pour out because we know

00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:51,279
that if there's a site that's nature

00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,170
rewrite we're going to do it in triple

00:50:51,279 --> 00:50:54,849
seven anyway so we didn't really have to

00:50:53,170 --> 00:51:03,299
change a lot of group of six into Drupal

00:50:54,849 --> 00:51:03,299
7 yet tipped away comes out yep

00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:16,710
so if we're user-generated content we

00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:21,120
have them internal sites we've built a

00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:23,580
site internally that allows us to allow

00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:26,190
people to edit user generated content

00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:28,080
like comments but other things like

00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:30,210
raising ideas for example when they can

00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:32,190
vote on those ideas general internal

00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:34,980
sites we allow them to do that external

00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:37,470
sites we have to use third-party

00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:42,510
providers like discuss or Facebook or

00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:44,220
those providers it works quite well

00:51:42,510 --> 00:51:45,990
because they haven't really been that

00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:48,780
need for it yet but we know that going

00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:50,580
forward at Street was saying this

00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:52,920
morning it's more about web experience

00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:56,720
now so we do have to move to a platform

00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,720
that allows us to do that

00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,980
no I didn't show that on there and

00:52:06,579 --> 00:52:11,740
ensure the deployment process either but

00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:14,500
we have an integration into our

00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:17,760
directory active directory and we have a

00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:20,290
module that we use ldap that module and

00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:23,859
people use their own credentials to

00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:26,520
login we have roles for editing we have

00:52:23,859 --> 00:52:31,470
roles for approving and we have roles

00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:33,400
for developers standardized yep

00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:35,740
externally we have a different and

00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:38,040
access management system that we use to

00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:40,180
allow external entities to log in

00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:44,319
editor's the external people to log in

00:52:40,180 --> 00:53:04,799
we don't use any Drupal use access at

00:52:44,319 --> 00:53:09,670
all due to security reasons yeah it's a

00:53:04,799 --> 00:53:11,470
it's becoming a common problem because

00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:15,760
it is rare to find crippled developers

00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:17,410
and when we develop and build the people

00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,020
up with these kind of skills they are

00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:23,559
pure Drupal developers so they become

00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:26,109
very attractive to the market and we do

00:53:23,559 --> 00:53:28,540
have I would say it's a problem but

00:53:26,109 --> 00:53:32,020
instances of where you know they're

00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:34,230
people becoming very popular in other

00:53:32,020 --> 00:53:34,230
places

00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:59,760
sure with the alg our way of working our

00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:01,650
teams that are quite small even on

00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:04,500
larger projects so a larger projects may

00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:06,900
have for developers on it and that's for

00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:08,850
fairly large project but those for

00:54:06,900 --> 00:54:12,090
developers are supported by our

00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:15,570
iteration managers of testers business

00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:19,590
analysts so literally a team would be

00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:21,240
four to five or six people for building

00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:23,310
a site like Amy for example or building

00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:25,620
a site like um Sun call that's how we

00:54:23,310 --> 00:54:27,780
would use it for smaller sites we will

00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:30,600
literally have one person or two person

00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:33,570
working on it but again with a lot of

00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:37,890
support yeah anything we build we need

00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:40,890
to look after so we don't dolefully

00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:42,650
basically so we had to be very careful

00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:45,060
when we have to maintain the quality

00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:47,600
anyone who builds her site has to

00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:47,600
maintain it

00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:27,539
yeah yep so we have what we call

00:55:24,359 --> 00:55:31,559
rotations so the way we build that the

00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:35,420
culture is that when a new team member

00:55:31,559 --> 00:55:38,400
joins or won't be on new team members in

00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:40,049
Chengdu for example we want to rotate

00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:42,089
them or bring them over to Sydney or

00:55:40,049 --> 00:55:44,579
Melbourne and Brisbane and bring them

00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:47,689
over get them embedded within the team

00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:51,359
and then you'll get the culture that way

00:55:47,689 --> 00:55:53,549
other ways is having regular catch up in

00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:56,369
regular meetings so every day because we

00:55:53,549 --> 00:55:58,109
work agile that stand up so these team

00:55:56,369 --> 00:56:00,809
members talk together talk to each other

00:55:58,109 --> 00:56:05,759
every single day they know who's working

00:56:00,809 --> 00:56:08,640
on what there's none of the someone

00:56:05,759 --> 00:56:11,039
being lost and not having able to have

00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:12,239
their communication so they do talk to

00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:15,329
each other they do help each other

00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:23,009
remove blockages due to the constant

00:56:15,329 --> 00:56:25,349
communication pardon now we use them

00:56:23,009 --> 00:56:28,890
linked so we have the technology school

00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:31,679
link which is a Microsoft technology we

00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:34,619
use link and link TV to actually chat to

00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:37,880
each other yep and skype a lot of skype

00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:37,880
sorry just someone in the back

00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:52,600
yeah we come up out so how do we manage

00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:55,720
all the different regions we came up

00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:58,570
with our own system for that call it the

00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:00,940
traffic light system so the traveler

00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:03,130
systems tells you whether that region is

00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:05,050
red which means there's a change in

00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:07,450
there please don't do any other changes

00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:09,790
and it tells you who's whose credit that

00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:13,390
and their little comment of what the

00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:15,310
change is if it's green means go for it

00:57:13,390 --> 00:57:17,590
do whatever you want to do it if it's

00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:19,630
amber just be careful but we're going to

00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:21,790
also lock a region down so you cannot

00:57:19,630 --> 00:57:34,620
migrate or move that region until is

00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:34,620
unlocked yep look at so what's right

00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:47,700
okay so moving to a different platform

00:57:45,750 --> 00:57:50,579
which it's not a platform and salford an

00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:52,109
architecture that allows us to meet the

00:57:50,579 --> 00:57:53,339
business needs in the future so this

00:57:52,109 --> 00:57:55,920
morning Theresa is talking about

00:57:53,339 --> 00:57:57,150
experience management so if we're going

00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:59,130
to move to experience management the

00:57:57,150 --> 00:58:01,109
platform we have now it's not going to

00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:03,240
be suitable for it so we need to come up

00:58:01,109 --> 00:58:04,980
with a new platform in the future an

00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:07,440
architecture that allows us to meet the

00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:09,630
business demands moving forward over the

00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:12,690
next few years experience design and

00:58:09,630 --> 00:58:14,519
user experience that's another area a

00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:17,099
colleague of mine is now running that

00:58:14,519 --> 00:58:19,559
that area but that's about building

00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:22,230
there the skill sets internally to allow

00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:23,609
us to be able to manage a lot of the

00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:25,740
demands that comes down to business for

00:58:23,609 --> 00:58:29,519
that those kind of skills now and we're

00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:31,829
working our partners and also training

00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:37,230
our people within those areas to be more

00:58:31,829 --> 00:58:38,700
skilled in those areas yes for the near

00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:41,150
future will be will be saying the drill

00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:41,150
platform

00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:06,230
yeah so with the agile process the

00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:08,790
actual business owners business sponsors

00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:11,640
legal all of them they work very closely

00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:13,980
to collaborate with us as developers so

00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:17,760
we work with designers and use

00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:19,500
experienced people and developers bas

00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,570
they're all collaborate together and

00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:23,940
they all come together enough stand-ups

00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:26,850
and as you see those Wars if we do a big

00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:28,920
project for example ten o'clock every

00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:30,480
morning they're all there so the

00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:33,150
communication happens right at that

00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,950
moment if there's a blockage generally

00:59:33,150 --> 00:59:37,890
we can discuss right then and solve it

00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:40,440
right then because everyone's there so

00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:42,620
we're not not the user situation where

00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:45,510
we make the decision and then later on

00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:47,580
go to someone else and ask them for

00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:51,770
something else it's that's been reduced

00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:51,770
quite a lot with our job methodologies

00:59:59,869 --> 01:00:06,390
the biggest challenge I guess was

01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:08,160
managing the business demands we have

01:00:06,390 --> 01:00:10,589
constant demands and because we do look

01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:13,170
at what I mean we do support what we

01:00:10,589 --> 01:00:15,480
build so little bit different to some

01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:17,760
agencies where you would build and then

01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:19,080
you have another team to support we

01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,359
would build and there's no other team to

01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:24,030
support except us so managing the

01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:26,490
workload the demands and the amount of

01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:28,830
work that comes in constantly that's our

01:00:26,490 --> 01:00:31,500
biggest challenge other challenge is

01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:34,410
having distributed teams even though we

01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:37,349
do have constant connection or

01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:39,710
technologies for us to discuss as

01:00:37,349 --> 01:00:42,359
swimming it's just the distance and

01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:48,869
sometimes technologies causes issues but

01:00:42,359 --> 01:00:50,910
yeah something we deal with all right

01:00:48,869 --> 01:00:54,020
and what questions thanks very much ah

01:00:50,910 --> 01:00:54,020
