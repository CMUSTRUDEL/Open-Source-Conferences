Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Content strategy and the QUT web redevelopment project
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	User friendly content - how we thought we'd do it, and how we did it (our successes and fails).

We took more than 1000 websites and tried to turn them into 3.

Did we meet our deadline? Did we use personas? Were we 'agile' enough? What tools were used? Did we make the best use of the CMS?

Come and find out as Jilly shares her experiences from this project. You'll hear about content strategy, content modelling, auditing, migration, and how helpful an image of a shiny camel can be.

Note: if people are keen, we can organise a BoF session where we will workshop strategy for you to 'take away'.

Redeveloped site: www.qut.edu.au

Comments from previous presentation of this session:

Fantastic presentation and lively presenter. Thanks for sharing your experience Jilly.
-Sylvia

Fantastic insight on a complex project, thanks again Jilly!
-Sally Bagshaw

Thanks so much Jilly & Sally for an insightful look into the workings of a major content project. I was inspired :)
-Leona

Thanks Jilly. This was all very insightful for me. I'm still pretty new to content strategy but it's great to hear tips from someone who has tackled something so monstrous . . . and won!
-Janelle

Jilly - I'm never using Powerpoint again after discovering (from your tip) the Presentation function in Google Docs. Life. Changing. Thanks for a great talk tonight, Jilly.

yeah so i will also going to share some

00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:10,110
of the things that we really stuffed up

00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,840
on during this talk and one of those

00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:14,670
things was scope who's done a really big

00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,740
redevelopment we've got a couple hundred

00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,779
sites or a big site with thousands and

00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,570
thousands of pages and you've got to

00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:24,180
make it better yep okay scope creep say

00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,980
it's really hard to not and i'm not sure

00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:28,680
if any of you have heard of a theory

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,769
called designing wide anyone heard of

00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,590
designing wild designing wide is my new

00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:36,630
favorite theory as a web nerd so what

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,000
designing wide says it's okay to have

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,320
your website you know we need and in the

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,670
web team you look after the look and

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,250
feel and all that sort of stuff of the

00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,170
website but what happens when you get to

00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:49,500
have to log on to the internet or the

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,180
student reporting system or the payroll

00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,010
league system or something like that and

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:55,620
all of a sudden you back in some lotus

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:58,079
notes horrible environment or something

00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,870
like that so designing wide says

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,850
actually look at the big picture because

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,930
your end user doesn't really understand

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,270
the difference between what's the

00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:07,799
website and what's an online system they

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,510
just know it's online it's on the

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:13,439
internet so it's your job as the word

00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:19,619
nerd to fix it we had some success with

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:21,420
this and we had some also fails okay

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,860
I've spoken a little bit about why we're

00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,350
going to redevelop already so i'm going

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:26,820
to skip through this slide but i guess

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,500
the most important thing to know is that

00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,570
we had the vc's ear the

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,369
vice-chancellor's here and we had his

00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:40,619
direct authority to do things yay i

00:01:34,369 --> 00:01:47,520
don't know if it's a good idea to this

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:49,229
is going to be tricky sorry i'm so not a

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,659
mac person I'm just got to go back to my

00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:56,310
USB Drive to play the video Pam can USB

00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:57,780
my beautiful assistant oh yeah this will

00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,850
be the last one I promise after this is

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,700
finished so what I'm going to show you

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:05,250
now is the video that my manager made to

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,500
take to the senior staff conference

00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,300
every year at QUT all the heads of

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,489
faculties and some other really

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,950
important people get together and they

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,420
go on a retreat I'm told they do play

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,540
tar and have a bit of a sing-along at

00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,769
the end and aim and my boss he really

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:26,120
wanted to try and get people to

00:02:19,769 --> 00:02:29,480
understand how bad it was now it should

00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,480
yeah oh

00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:45,710
it's a it's a flash file but it's just

00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:48,620
done as an exit to play straightaway hmm

00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:51,740
oh this will be really upsetting if I

00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:55,100
can't get this to play anyone got any

00:02:51,740 --> 00:03:02,440
ideas any Mac gurus here drag it into

00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:05,440
chrome wheels like that will that work

00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,440
excellent

00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:33,910
oh yeah oh no right clip so anyway what

00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,920
Amon did was he took a screenshot of

00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:37,930
every home page that we could find

00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,590
really quickly and he set it to the

00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:43,120
Benny Hill theme and he took it to the

00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:47,070
senior leadership conference and played

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,070
it I really like to play it for you now

00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,190
yay

00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,350
member

00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:28,170
as you can see we've got multiple styles

00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,860
we've got some that don't even have any

00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:35,900
style some of these sights have you been

00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:35,900
updated since you know 1999

00:04:52,980 --> 00:05:02,470
see that's that's quite a lot right

00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:05,560
there's 178 yards and we found another

00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:08,050
about 400 websites once we started

00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,440
properly auditing things like the domain

00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,820
name registry and things like that

00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:14,380
account because a lot of people hadn't

00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,090
registered their domain on the registry

00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,060
when he went through paid accounts and

00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,530
we you know retrieve people's web you

00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:24,480
know things is like a sign for web a

00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,480
little bit domain names there as well

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,610
isn't it and I this is the worst case of

00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:48,900
website deliberation that I've ever seen

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:50,790
it really was bad and some people really

00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,350
took a bit of this at the senior team

00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,330
leadership meeting I wish we would have

00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:56,160
recommend this unless you know everyone

00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,650
really really well because some people

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,570
got really affronted and any University

00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,919
the more you publish apparently the

00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:03,090
better you are quite often do you know

00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:09,630
there's that real feeling of getting

00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:10,770
stuff out so what I wanted to say is you

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,060
can see that there were a lot of

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:13,680
comparable you might not realize but

00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,110
there were a lot of conference sites up

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,970
there in relation to scope creep we had

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:21,330
to kill those because we just had too

00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:22,919
many so we had this amazing plan and

00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,660
this perfect theory about how we were

00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:28,530
going to make these fantastic sites for

00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:30,090
future students futures staff and it

00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,860
must have you some people said you

00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,990
worked at a university you'll know that

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:35,310
in Australia we're not looking for more

00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:38,190
people to come to uni or below

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,690
universities are full pretty much what

00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,860
we're looking for as universities now

00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,930
because we're very competitive with each

00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:45,570
other is getting the best bums on seats

00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:49,530
that we can and our websites were not

00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:51,930
attracting those bombs okay so what we

00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:53,669
thought we'd use will have some strategy

00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:56,370
you know we'll get some goals going we

00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:58,200
use some personas we wanted to use a lot

00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,910
of best practice if you like we wanted

00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,450
to have a lot of dynamic content that

00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:04,860
was reusable and oh that's right

00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,080
initially we only got nine months I

00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,510
forgot that obviously that timeline

00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,120
extended to 18 months and there's still

00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:16,139
some elements that haven't been finished

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:19,530
right clay sounds peachy right wrong in

00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:21,120
the auditing process we had to determine

00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:22,889
which sites were in and out of skype

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,020
initially according to the

00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:27,720
vice-chancellor all sites are in scope

00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:30,300
but it was just too big a job trying to

00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,410
audit more than a thousand websites feel

00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,760
like out what the Conte even just

00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:34,110
working out with the content owner and

00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,220
he's going to fact check that

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:39,599
information was quite and I've got us

00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:41,430
you know the spreadsheet so we created

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,669
there up to you know ninety thousand

00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:48,570
lines of you know each page we went

00:07:44,669 --> 00:07:51,510
through an ordered at each page so how

00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:52,990
do we even estimate resources well I'm

00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:55,420
not sure how Amon did

00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,130
initially but when we had finished the

00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:58,720
auditing process and we realized how

00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:01,240
much content that was there to go

00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,250
through we worked out that every one of

00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,520
my content editors would have to write

00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:09,100
rewrite 30 to 50 pages every single day

00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,810
that and and as you know when you're

00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,950
rewriting content half the time you've

00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:14,560
got to understand what they're actually

00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:17,470
trying to say before you can you know

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:23,800
convert it to plain language it really

00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:25,480
wasn't possible big ups okay so some of

00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,970
the things that work from russ was let's

00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,850
define content so no one can say oh

00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:37,180
that's an image it's not content so we

00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:39,910
defined content as text PDF all types of

00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:43,750
documents photos graphics videos

00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:48,190
animations audio did I say everything is

00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:53,170
content if it's viewable you know

00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:56,260
language and audio etc we also said that

00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:58,810
our content must do these things it must

00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:00,280
help recruit high-caliber students it's

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,830
got to promote the Uni and all the

00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,140
research that we do it's gotta help

00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:06,970
recruit staff and encourage our alumni

00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:08,770
to stay in touch with us and of course

00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:10,630
we've got to communicate our key

00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:16,030
information and fulfill our legal

00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:18,160
requirements we thought we'll define the

00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:20,500
top tasks has anyone done this for a

00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,990
government or a university site it's

00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,130
generally really easy so I used to work

00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,410
at the Department of Justice and

00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:28,870
Attorney General in Queensland everyone

00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:31,030
came there to get birth Justin marriages

00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:32,890
certificates right that was the main

00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:34,650
thing that accounted for about eighty

00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:36,910
percent of the traffic on that website

00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:38,500
another five or ten percent of it was

00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,730
people looking for a JP or a

00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,070
commissioner someone who could witness

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,240
their legal documents hardly anyone

00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:45,720
wanted to know when the court times

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:48,040
where in which judge was doing what when

00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:50,110
so if your university of course the top

00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,690
tenth a start I want to find a course I

00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:54,760
want to apply for that course I want to

00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:58,770
find a job or something you know and

00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:03,040
then I want to find research ok so we

00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:05,260
identified those and then I have to

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,790
compare it to this what most of this

00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,440
work to my colleague Diana Kia

00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:12,310
she wrote the best tone of voice

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:14,440
guidelines I've ever seen they are

00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:16,210
simple and straightforward we teach

00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,960
complicated ideas and theories but we

00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:21,160
explain them in clear simple language

00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:22,900
supra knows the Einstein quote don't

00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,370
they you don't know something very well

00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:27,760
until you can explain it to your grandma

00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:29,170
yeah the Qt marketing comes team they

00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,850
call it barbecue speak how would you

00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:33,130
explain this to somebody at a barbecue

00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,810
who's appear you know it's not an idiot

00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:39,220
do you know what it means so you're not

00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:41,050
going to use really you know boring

00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,280
language but you're going to explain it

00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:46,360
in barbecue speak you're not going to

00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:48,070
use too much geeky terminology and we

00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,800
had a little test to see are we meeting

00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:57,400
this if I say it out loud do I sound

00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:58,960
like a dog if I do fail rewrite okay all

00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,660
right and we had a little quick little

00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,820
list of do's and don'ts I'll mention

00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:05,980
this again later but the more clear that

00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:08,140
you can be for your content editors and

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,790
your fact-checkers about what you're

00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,460
trying to achieve and how you're doing

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:15,370
it the better be really clear and use

00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:17,770
that web writing for the web skills to

00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:22,150
explain yourself Oh be concise be

00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:23,740
consistent all right here we go strong

00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,540
direction makes editors happy so here's

00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,460
my content team pretending to be

00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:30,820
dinosaurs with the little tattoos folk

00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:34,270
tattoos on their hand so make it crystal

00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:36,790
clear we were really determined that we

00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:38,350
knew what we wanted to do primarily

00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,300
because most of us have worked in the

00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:43,510
web for a really long time and had very

00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:46,120
very little power on how I'm controlling

00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:48,400
the direction of projects most of you

00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,980
will know your boss says we need this or

00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,450
someone complains and so you react or

00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,100
someone says this needs to go up on the

00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:57,130
web but they're not sure why and who's

00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:58,660
it for personal stuff at this time we

00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:01,120
actually had the power to say actually

00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,890
from a Content point of view and from a

00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,890
project point of view these are the

00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:08,380
things that we need to understand so not

00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,960
everyone's the same we split our

00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,630
audiences up into future students future

00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,270
staff future partners so that's our

00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:19,120
external facing public website internet

00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,680
and then we had an intranet for students

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,320
and

00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,230
brit internet for staff now using the

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,640
power of we used with sweet to deliver

00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:28,440
this you'd be able to do the same thing

00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,660
with drupal and many other content

00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,540
management systems harness the power of

00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:36,690
your database all right published once

00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:38,940
appear in multiple spots we had a global

00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,410
section in the database so that was

00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,720
content that was going to appear on all

00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:44,430
three sites it might not have appeared

00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,709
in the same way because we would have

00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:48,720
said for students only show the heading

00:12:46,709 --> 00:12:50,520
and the context sentence or something in

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:55,170
the link back to the service don't show

00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:56,370
the extra information for staff we did

00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:58,610
all of that through content modeling

00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:02,160
I'll talk a little bit about that soon

00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:06,140
okay structure by user task not by

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,140
department faculty or school yay

00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:12,480
everyone's happy about that one yes

00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:14,790
great question actually how did we do

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,160
this we did exhaustive usability testing

00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:18,510
so whenever anyone said to us I'll look

00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,149
Jill you know I really want to use

00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:24,089
pedagogy instead of teach okay actually

00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:26,970
we've tested that and really everyone

00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:28,980
prefers to teach even even academics

00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:30,420
when they're reading online prefer the

00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:34,950
word teach because it's easier for them

00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:37,650
to understand quickly course is easy

00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:41,220
simple beautiful that was our our

00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:43,080
high-level aim to deliver courses now we

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,450
did fairly well with this there's still

00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,790
some tricky bits but we did I'm pretty

00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:50,160
happy with our courses turned out a gang

00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,410
extensive usability testing both with

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,410
Australian students and international

00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,910
students because you want some of you

00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:58,320
might not be aware but all the money in

00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:02,160
education and Australia's from

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:04,500
international students okay so research

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,940
we solve real issues and make others

00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,620
want to be a part of it so that's our

00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:09,959
brand promise as well you know

00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:15,150
University for the real world and to

00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:17,610
live a substance style and our brand ok

00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:19,320
so we wanted to make sure as we were

00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:21,240
traveling through this process that we

00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:23,820
were getting it right so we tested it

00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,700
when we did the usability testing we

00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:30,950
didn't use fake content we used real

00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:34,340
content all right oh no I can't

00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:36,080
you know iterate how important it is to

00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:39,140
use real content when you're doing

00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,610
usability testing your content editors

00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:43,640
can go back straightaway and tweak

00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:45,230
forwards that didn't work very well but

00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,040
you're also your usability testing gives

00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:50,150
you a much more real result I think

00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,560
tricky content that you're not sure or

00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:54,020
this is all not sure if it's going to

00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,210
work or not just test it all right so we

00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:57,980
have the ability for anyone the team to

00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:00,080
conduct testing we would just go and

00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:02,510
find students and pay them 25 bucks we

00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,460
had little kohls vouchers students love

00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:06,590
that do you know what I mean and things

00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:10,760
like that sometimes we did have trouble

00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:12,080
recruiting and you know there was those

00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,550
good days and bad days and usability

00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,900
testing you know you have some days when

00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:16,520
no one turns up and then you have some

00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:20,930
days where everyone turns up and so all

00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:22,790
the tests go over time we also test

00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:24,320
multiple versions to see which one would

00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,580
work better and then when somebody said

00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,110
oh you know again I really think you

00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,970
should use pedagogy here I'm well

00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:31,880
actually I've tested both and you can

00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,710
see that teach works a lot better all

00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:36,440
right so how do we test the normal ways

00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:38,540
show you guys know this stuff if you

00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:42,880
don't feel free to ask me afterwards

00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:44,900
about user testing or usability testing

00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,090
one of the things we had with their

00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:50,780
content was if we're not sure it should

00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:52,700
be there let's test that again to one of

00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:55,250
the things that happened was because the

00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:57,350
project went on for a while we were able

00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:01,040
to publish content that we'd written

00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:03,260
early on the existing site and a lot of

00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,910
that content was to do with applying and

00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:08,150
getting credit for recognition of prior

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:10,670
learning which QT calls advanced

00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:12,170
standing they've got their own word for

00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:15,440
it just to make it that bit easier to

00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:17,750
nail so what we did was we put we

00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,130
published the new content and then a

00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:20,930
couple of months later when we're

00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:22,220
getting student business services you

00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,990
know they're the people the admin people

00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:26,720
that have been doing admin for 25 years

00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:28,220
they live and breathe admin a fantastic

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,630
amount of knowledge but they really feel

00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,460
like the whole policy has got to be

00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,960
published with the procedure and the

00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:35,120
guidelines before you can come and talk

00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:37,610
to me and we just need to say you know

00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,160
what I mean if you don't turn up you

00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:41,780
could get failed for being absent you

00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,040
know let's all really need to say check

00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,840
this policy if you want more details

00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,160
anyway they were sort of free

00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,950
down a bit when we came to them with

00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:50,600
this 5 you know documents they've had

00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,610
and we've turned it into one sentence if

00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,410
you don't turn up all the time you may

00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:57,170
get failed for being an absentee student

00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:58,670
no can't do it and we're actually do you

00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,230
know what we've actually already done it

00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:01,700
this caused some of this content has

00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:05,480
been on your website now for three or

00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:08,780
four months had any complaints no had an

00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:13,120
extra phone calls right oh it's probably

00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:15,380
okay then hey all right so we sort of

00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,910
bye-bye not publishing all at once by

00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,250
having some bits published on the old

00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:21,080
site we were able to prove that plain

00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:24,980
English wasn't a detriment to getting

00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:27,410
University work done we also created a

00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:30,350
to publish test and i'll just go back to

00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:33,640
that one does this content help meet our

00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:37,130
business goals no doesn't get published

00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,720
simple as that admittedly there's more

00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,490
politics involved i'm giving you a very

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:46,580
simplified version i did go home some

00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:49,160
days with no hair big 40 frown I also

00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,870
think in big migrations many of you will

00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,580
have experienced this yourselves it's

00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:56,270
really important to create a Content

00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:57,680
template that's because when you go to

00:17:56,270 --> 00:18:00,410
migrate if you've got a really good

00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,880
template drawn up you can get any monkey

00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,680
to come in and migrate you know what I

00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:07,040
mean you can get students to come in and

00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:09,110
help you you can get you know other

00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:12,200
admin staff I had the directors

00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:14,840
secretary migrating for me when we were

00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,760
at full steam because all she needed to

00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:19,430
do was basically do data entry off this

00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:21,860
template the template include things

00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:25,220
like the user journey so as we wrote it

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:26,720
we were really sentian of how the user

00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:32,420
was going to progress through the site

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:35,300
we hoped we get I can also just see here

00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:38,510
I've got an area there for non-text

00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:41,300
content so people that went even into

00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:43,460
the content template really try to think

00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,230
of everything not sure if you know some

00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:50,450
bits we didn't do so well and I'll get

00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:52,550
to them in a minute you guys all used

00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:54,740
ripple or other different CMS's or use

00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:57,200
all Drupal do you guys do any Content

00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:58,429
modeling stuff like that excellent I

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,889
love you already

00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:05,139
okay you probably won't need too much of

00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:05,139
this thing on content modeling then but

00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:09,919
when one of the things that really was

00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:13,690
great for us when we did the modeling

00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:17,539
was we realized how many elements were

00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:20,119
generic across all models and of course

00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:22,100
that became our global metadata template

00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:25,039
and that note that all of that content

00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:29,779
is meta data driven rather than static

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:32,600
page driven okay this is one of our

00:19:29,779 --> 00:19:36,379
models just an Excel spreadsheet this is

00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:38,749
for events so you can see here I'm

00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:42,350
looking at what's the friendly name of

00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:46,519
the event description attributes all

00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:49,460
those sorts of things this is where I

00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:51,230
get on my little soapbox I think that

00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,570
one of the biggest letdowns in the last

00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:55,669
few years probably the last almost eight

00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,559
years with web content management

00:19:55,669 --> 00:20:00,080
systems has been that people still use

00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:03,289
them like they're using Dreamweaver all

00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:05,749
right so all the pages are static quite

00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:07,700
often people will publish things in more

00:20:05,749 --> 00:20:10,999
than one the same aight information or

00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,679
item in more than one spot whoa you're

00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:16,159
really not harnessing the power of your

00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:18,080
database with that databases can sing

00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,330
and dance they can manipulate data in

00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,059
all sorts of ways so make them sing and

00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:24,590
dance don't fall into that trap of this

00:20:23,059 --> 00:20:26,570
is how I learnt to do web and I'm still

00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:29,869
going to keep doing it the real power of

00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:31,970
a database is in making that content

00:20:29,869 --> 00:20:36,009
that single source of truth published

00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:36,009
once and appear in multiple places I

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,659
want to step further because you know

00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,340
what it's like when you've got lots of

00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:44,869
authors in a university setting or a

00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:47,269
government setting everyone wants to

00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:49,190
write their own way okay and everyone

00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:51,080
has their own version of plain language

00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:53,389
even if you can get them to do plain

00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:55,399
language so I thought well you know I've

00:20:53,389 --> 00:20:57,320
modeled out all of this stuff and I know

00:20:55,399 --> 00:20:59,179
what all the elements are and a lot of

00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:01,100
the answers can come from a drop-down or

00:20:59,179 --> 00:21:03,740
a tick box of radio button box so I

00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,570
built a form i built a form to add all

00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:07,610
sorts of content you can add an event

00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:09,960
you can add

00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:11,690
contacts so that into the contacts

00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,789
directory services and facilities

00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:16,710
scholarships and prizes venues student

00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:19,200
topics for research key dates for the

00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:23,340
academic calendar professional

00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:26,760
development for staff and of course the

00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:28,110
high-level research projects so everyone

00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,929
when they go through i think i've got a

00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:33,570
next page of that form you can see here

00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:35,610
that it's a text box and you can choose

00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:38,510
and you can choose more than one because

00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:41,669
you know some scholarships some events

00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:44,580
some research projects cover multiple

00:21:41,669 --> 00:21:46,529
faculties so we gave people always the

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,120
option to choose more than one then

00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:50,309
we've got some scripting behind that

00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:52,230
which on the page it says if i'm looking

00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,970
at a business akal t of business page we

00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,950
call it school of business actual at QUT

00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:58,350
if I'm looking at a school of business

00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:59,850
page and in the little scholarships box

00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,470
on the side it's just got a script

00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,029
saying call me all the scholarships that

00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,860
are applied a faculty of business and

00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:07,529
then I've got that again on the

00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:09,090
undergrad page and I've got it on the

00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:11,490
post grab page and I've got the special

00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:16,230
ones applying to research and things

00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:18,270
like that I can't express how beneficial

00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:20,370
it was to have these forms because

00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,510
people would go all this content missing

00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,640
do you know lmn and it's like we're

00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:25,230
going live next week no problem fill out

00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,240
the form it'll come to me and a workflow

00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:28,860
will tick it off I know I'm going to get

00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:31,830
really consistent content from you as

00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:36,980
well because I'm only allow you to write

00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:41,399
about for feel like name of scholarship

00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:42,809
all right QA and content you're thinking

00:22:41,399 --> 00:22:44,789
wow these people really did a lot hey

00:22:42,809 --> 00:22:47,490
but we really wanted to make sure that

00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:49,919
it we delivered a good end result this

00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:51,720
was many of us the best opportunity to

00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,700
work with such a really fantastic team

00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,440
and we thought wow do you know what I

00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,880
mean is how many times in our chances in

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,039
a life we're going to give a you know a

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,200
big bucket of money like a really big

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,630
bucket of money to see how good we can

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,799
do so it was critical to us to make sure

00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:06,929
that we were going to achieve good

00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:10,799
results hence all the usability testing

00:23:06,929 --> 00:23:12,690
and a lot of QA if you've got a team of

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,090
seven content editors and you keep

00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:16,020
coming out with spelling mistakes lose

00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:18,690
respect straight

00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,790
way alright so we did a bit of work

00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:22,440
there and as you can see we squeak you

00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:27,120
aid for a number of different things

00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:28,770
when you add for accessibility styles we

00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,300
checked all the links worked well the

00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:33,870
emails you'd be surprised how many

00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:36,630
didn't that came through in content our

00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:38,220
very important all be some of those

00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:39,450
metadata fields that I was talking about

00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,300
before which we developed through the

00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:44,490
content models many of them were

00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:47,370
mandatory so that we could make the

00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:49,380
dynamic stuff work so have they forgot

00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:51,510
the mandatory ones after a while I got

00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:53,790
smart and I just let them made the CMS

00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:56,690
have a validation and it wouldn't

00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:58,770
publish anything that they weren't there

00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:01,770
Julia spoke a lot about a lot of stuff

00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:04,830
but what was about the strategy ok this

00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:07,290
is part of the strategy that we wrote if

00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:09,540
people like I'm happy to do a bit of a

00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:12,120
hands-on workshop tomorrow to maybe

00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:14,100
think about writing some strategy for

00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,050
your organization or also may be

00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:18,750
thinking about tone of voice or those

00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:21,180
types of things little or even a content

00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:23,160
test what are the good business goals of

00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:26,060
my department University whatever and

00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:29,130
then I can test my content based on that

00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:31,080
so you can see here that we said a key

00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:33,360
component of this strategy is getting

00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,800
our content into shape this is the

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,010
higher level strategy the web

00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:40,980
redevelopment project so there were QT

00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:43,290
web transformation strategy and so we

00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,940
added a high-level document contents are

00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:48,270
really important fed down to this lower

00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:51,600
level document and we also change the

00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:54,120
strategy slightly between the public

00:24:51,600 --> 00:25:02,610
site and the two sites for staff and

00:24:54,120 --> 00:25:04,830
students so this is our strategy our

00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:07,080
content is aligned with our customers

00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:10,020
and needs our business goals and our

00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:12,420
brand it meets online communication best

00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:17,010
practice and it's supported by customer

00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:18,990
research pretty clear there I also added

00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:22,830
a little bit of slightly operational

00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:25,320
stuff then this next one the content

00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:27,900
team also aims to stay at once but say

00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,940
it well and only publish content that is

00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:36,260
both needed

00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:39,770
and used their there is a chance that

00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:41,480
when the VC and a few other people were

00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:44,360
approving this they work Felicia law

00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:48,380
what was going on no problem they

00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:50,480
approved it and we could do it we also

00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,460
outlined tried to outline the benefits

00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,930
of a content strategy and of really

00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:58,280
thinking about content in the best

00:25:53,930 --> 00:26:00,380
practice context so it's going to ensure

00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:03,140
that our goals are incorporated into

00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,970
these new websites and it's going to

00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:08,240
support the brand of business goals and

00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:10,100
benefits by meeting these needs ensuring

00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:14,390
we're concise and consistent and

00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:16,700
accurate enabling ease of future

00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:18,680
maintenance how many times they've been

00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,180
part of a web redevelopment project and

00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,160
then you become part of the operational

00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:24,830
team later and you go oh my god what

00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:26,870
have I done I've just built rods for my

00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:28,610
back do you know what I mean crosses to

00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:31,100
bear I could have done that much more

00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:35,030
simply again I'd encourage you to see

00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:36,770
what what benefits you can get from

00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:39,860
using a database instead of a static

00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:42,800
website so one of the things that I did

00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:45,260
for the QUT site for news and events was

00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:48,230
they have an expiry date and they

00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:50,930
disappear once that date occurs I don't

00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:52,340
ever have to the other thing I did this

00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:55,460
is the one of the biggest tips I can

00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:57,230
give you from my shared experience we

00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:01,130
wrote two sets of content for every

00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:03,890
event pre and post at midnight when the

00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:05,960
event finished the poet just reverted to

00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:08,240
the post content and none of my content

00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:11,570
oops none of my content team had to go

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:14,390
back and say change every is to was due

00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:15,860
to did you know that type of stuff that

00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:17,930
type of maintenance that makes you want

00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:20,990
to stab yourself in your eye with your

00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:23,690
mouth yeah see what the database can do

00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:30,170
to eliminate that have much happier web

00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:31,850
staff ok so we also listed what we would

00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:33,410
do how we're going to implement this

00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,240
strategy so we're going to work with

00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:37,430
customers and stakeholders will do the

00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,870
templates or do the testing the auditing

00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:41,540
the primitive but probably most of the

00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:42,680
stuff I've already gone through and we

00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:45,830
included this on go

00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:48,860
element regularly reviewed content

00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:51,650
published in one place only measured and

00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:54,760
analyzed all our top tasks had to have

00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:58,760
google analytics to go with it oh very

00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:01,100
important and of course tweaked over

00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:04,550
time nothing should be no website should

00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:06,860
be final as we all know this is where I

00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:09,110
get to be funny so we've got you know

00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:11,660
ninety thousand pages on a spreadsheet

00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:13,210
and we've whittled it down to 10 or

00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:15,260
something like that and we're busily

00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:17,510
rewriting them and it comes at the time

00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,990
where I'm sending out Sonny send emails

00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:22,250
people asking them to fact check it

00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:25,940
there's a lot of things to say in effect

00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:31,640
checking email the first one was three

00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:34,010
pages long and that is the people had on

00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:36,590
their faces when they got it and quite

00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:41,720
often I'd be sending them 10 20 30 pages

00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:43,100
to review at a time as well okay we had

00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,960
a bit of an evolution with our fact

00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:48,410
checking email I managed to get it a bit

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:58,070
more concise down to two pages but still

00:28:48,410 --> 00:29:02,180
wasn't very good but bit far sorry so

00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:05,030
this is the final one and it is still

00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:07,910
two pages long but only about one and a

00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:09,530
half really okay and the first hitting

00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:13,670
that people see is what we need you to

00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:15,680
do and there's only two three points all

00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:17,300
right so fact check the new content

00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,280
don't you love it when you send fact

00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:20,600
checking for people and they're like I'm

00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,300
really not sure how you've done this

00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,650
sentence itself alone really don't care

00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:26,630
about that can you tell me if it's

00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:28,460
correct do you know what I mean did I

00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:30,590
accidentally change the meaning when I

00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,780
edited it and a lot of our first emails

00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:34,610
were talking about that so really just

00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:37,610
trying to say look just tell me if it's

00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:41,180
right or wrong we can discuss semantics

00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:43,580
about language later all right how you

00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:46,580
can help us out go to the new site have

00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:48,380
a click around can I say it was so much

00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:51,100
easier to get people to fact-check once

00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:53,630
they could see it in a browser as

00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,710
compared to doing it on word or Google

00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:59,279
Docs incredible different

00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:01,860
and in the future I would always do it

00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,929
that way I would always get the dev site

00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,490
ready even if some of the Styles aren't

00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:07,590
quite right in some of the template and

00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:09,630
layouts quite right get the text on

00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:13,260
there and then email those links off to

00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:14,909
people it will really really help ok we

00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:17,700
asked them to make some notes and then

00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:19,110
to send us to them and we just said here

00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,669
just a few little things to remember

00:30:19,110 --> 00:30:22,529
look it's not a hundred percent finished

00:30:20,669 --> 00:30:24,210
yet so you know if you're clicking

00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:25,620
around in those things weird it's

00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:29,880
probably meant to be weird at this stage

00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:32,490
feel free to let us know though flushing

00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,830
camels you see that there's a paragraph

00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:36,750
here about flushing camels one of the

00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:39,149
things that we did if we got to a page

00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:40,710
and a style wasn't ready to add like

00:30:39,149 --> 00:30:42,690
pull quotes we didn't have the poor

00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:44,669
quote style ready or there was an image

00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:47,760
missing or something like that we're

00:30:44,669 --> 00:30:49,649
stuck in a picture of a camel after a

00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,860
couple of months the camel sort of

00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:54,870
became different so at first he just

00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:57,690
sort of blinked and then he walked

00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:59,490
across the page and hit did all these

00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:02,370
different things so the shiny flashier

00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:04,350
camel was an asset ID number that we

00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:06,630
could search for across the entire farm

00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:07,919
and any page or bit of content that came

00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:09,470
back to what's showing there's a camel

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,529
we knew there was something to do on it

00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:15,390
really great tip for a big migration

00:31:12,529 --> 00:31:18,440
alright finally please don't send these

00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:21,809
links around hahahaha that didn't work

00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:23,549
but we got such better success out of

00:31:21,809 --> 00:31:29,159
that third iteration of the fact

00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:33,149
checking email and much better you guys

00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:35,190
probably know these things you know just

00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:36,720
keep with migration just keep going at

00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:40,830
it but don't start too soon and don't

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:43,049
forget to template what worked the two

00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:45,149
published test should we be publishing

00:31:43,049 --> 00:31:46,679
this content before we even start to

00:31:45,149 --> 00:31:49,409
rewrite it is it going to meet business

00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:55,320
goals is there a legal requirement to do

00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:56,880
it not shelf alright the reusable and

00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,649
dynamic content worked really well

00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,510
except for with some pages where we had

00:31:58,649 --> 00:32:06,690
too much dynamic content and we caused

00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:08,809
load speed you know detriment bangle so

00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:12,470
some things initially like the contacts

00:32:08,809 --> 00:32:13,820
log were too big and pages trying to low

00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:15,529
things out of the contacts catalog

00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,299
didn't work really well we ended up

00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:19,039
catching the whole contacts catalog and

00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:21,159
just pulling that from a cage was much

00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,120
quicker so there are ways around it

00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:25,519
sometimes you only realize things when

00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,929
you get there we were really lucky that

00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,509
we've been using Google Docs a lot

00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:32,509
because we got caught in the brisbane

00:32:29,509 --> 00:32:34,190
floods in 2011 floods and two of cuties

00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:35,659
campuses went down of course the one

00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,889
that went down in the city was the one

00:32:35,659 --> 00:32:40,820
that had all the service in the basement

00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:42,980
under the river if we hadn't been using

00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:46,669
Google Docs we would have had two and a

00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:48,440
half weeks of no work and we would have

00:32:46,669 --> 00:32:51,799
you know as you can imagine really

00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:54,919
strung out our time frames shiny camels

00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:58,580
worked really really well don't have a

00:32:54,919 --> 00:33:00,649
strict ia have an IA where the the rule

00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:03,230
we had for Iowa was it had a primary

00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:04,700
home but then it could be linked to or

00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:10,279
displayed in anywhere else it was

00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:12,590
appropriate alright always is the

00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:15,559
template metadata is critical you know

00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:17,059
that but in a database system it's even

00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:19,340
more critical and I would really use

00:33:17,059 --> 00:33:22,639
that metadata to drive some of your page

00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:24,769
content don't lose sight of the goals

00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:26,269
though why am I doing this oh that's

00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:31,340
right I'm doing this so that we get

00:33:26,269 --> 00:33:33,249
better students here not to pander to

00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:37,340
somebody's ego or something like that

00:33:33,249 --> 00:33:39,649
okay and little photo I took in China

00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:43,639
everyone has duty to protect green this

00:33:39,649 --> 00:33:45,740
is in the park that's the same if you're

00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:47,210
a part of a web team everyone's got a

00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:51,019
duty to try and protect that user

00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:52,159
experience meet those goals trying to

00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:53,659
make sure you get a good return on

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:58,570
investment for what you've spent in

00:33:53,659 --> 00:34:02,059
outlaid it's everyone's everyone's wrong

00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:05,059
alright so how good did you go Julie

00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:06,590
well we really did well we had a three

00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:09,829
hundred and fifty percent increase

00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:12,230
within three months of inquiries from

00:34:09,829 --> 00:34:16,730
international students that's that's

00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:18,589
massive you know you anyone who does SEO

00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:21,110
or the dark arts as I still like to call

00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:25,610
it would know that that's an incredible

00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:27,530
right we got a really big decrease in

00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:29,990
questions to the help desk in this

00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:31,760
service center saying I want to apply

00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:33,830
them I'm not sure where to start two

00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,960
more of I'm in the application process

00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:38,780
and I'm at section D and I'm really not

00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:42,260
sure what you want me to stay here oh I

00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:45,740
call those for help desk and for call

00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:48,620
centers less beginner calls and more

00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:50,150
educated calls right and of those

00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:52,250
educated calls you're not getting as

00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:53,690
many as you did at the beginning so

00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:55,910
that's a really good way to test whether

00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:57,860
your website content is having a really

00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:59,510
good impact on your business has it

00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:01,970
decreased the number of calls coming to

00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:04,880
the help desk or the service center and

00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:08,630
are those calls now educated rather than

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:11,420
where do I start you'll actually find

00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:13,730
also too just as a side benefit sick

00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:15,950
leave goes down in your call centers

00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:18,050
because they're not bored out of their

00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:20,060
brains because every I get 100 calls a

00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:21,910
day saying where do I start they get 30

00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:24,790
going I'm really confused about this bit

00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:29,290
much more interesting day at work

00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:31,670
alright so contact matches the brand I

00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:33,650
think we did fairly well with that of

00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:34,790
course some I'm not showing the cutie

00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:35,720
site at the moment I'm know you're going

00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:37,820
to go home and have a look at it

00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:41,330
afterwards see how easy it is to find a

00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:43,550
course for me and we didn't do so well

00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:46,970
in some things I have to admit some

00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:49,670
things we didn't finish building the

00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:51,110
scope crypt yes I CSS OB de miel got

00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:53,630
into a hundred do you know what I mean

00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:55,280
it became bigger than ben-hur and there

00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:57,260
were a few times where as a team we

00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,330
really felt ourselves I think the term

00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:01,160
the kids use these days is thrashing do

00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:03,350
you know another but never actually

00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,780
achieving anything so we had to really

00:36:03,350 --> 00:36:08,000
pull back we ran it on an agile

00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:10,040
framework methodology and we just sat

00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,160
down we look what is the most important

00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:15,020
to get done right find the cause let's

00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:16,850
put our energy into that and we'll worry

00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:18,080
about the rest later and then after we

00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:19,910
do that okay what's the next most

00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:22,420
important thing and we just moved it

00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:22,420
down like that

00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:31,080
and that's it for me but I'm going to

00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:42,330
open it up to questions now we've got ya

00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:44,360
two minutes you hey me yep yes great

00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:47,370
great question we use squeeze sweet

00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:50,060
primarily just because it meets WK two

00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:52,320
point O a little bit better than most

00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:54,570
CMS's at the moment all that everyone's

00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,280
sort of getting a bit better but the

00:36:54,570 --> 00:37:00,630
University it was really clear that they

00:36:56,280 --> 00:37:04,530
had to meet WK two point oh what we did

00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:07,440
was each faculty has a presence on each

00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:09,570
of the sites staff student and internet

00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,150
and they have different confident for

00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:14,250
those audiences so everyone has been

00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:16,860
brought into a single well there's three

00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:19,890
the three sites for each audience and

00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:21,780
then underneath there there's a site you

00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:23,910
know what i mean about each faculty and

00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:27,890
then each research area and things like

00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:27,890
that sort of it drills down quite deep

00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:39,660
I know if we'd have waited for each

00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:43,080
faculty to do it we'd still be waiting

00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:45,180
yeah so in some ways we had to take

00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:48,360
almost a heavy-handed approach with some

00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:50,460
people in the end we realized that we

00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:53,010
couldn't bring all six faculties in at

00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:55,470
once it was just way too big a job and

00:37:53,010 --> 00:37:59,700
we had some faculties not mentioning any

00:37:55,470 --> 00:38:01,860
names education that were a lot less

00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:03,360
mature with their existing web presence

00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:05,130
than other people so they even took a

00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:07,500
lot longer to sort of get on board and

00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:10,530
their business school was the first

00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:12,840
faculty to go and luckily they did such

00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:14,550
a great job and we did put a lot of

00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,410
energy and effort into making sure they

00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:18,900
were smik hours that all the other

00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:20,070
faculties like really want that do you

00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:23,490
know what I mean and we've got them all

00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:24,990
in within about eight months yeah but

00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:26,970
when we went live it was just creative

00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:29,190
industries and business school that we

00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:31,830
had in for the rest of the time we were

00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:33,980
still linking out to their old sites to

00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:36,150
the other way to make them go kill free

00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:39,090
migrating you know because their old

00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:41,640
site looks quite tragic in comparison to

00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:43,050
the new one yeah one thing we did do

00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:45,960
though was even though we hadn't

00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:47,520
migrated their content in fully yet we

00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:49,860
had their courses we had their

00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,810
scholarships we had their contacts all

00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:54,360
of that stuff was all ready to go it was

00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:56,190
just a matter of trying to get rid of

00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:58,620
the Welcome message from the you know

00:38:56,190 --> 00:39:00,480
head of school and things like that yeah

00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:04,100
where we couldn't get rid of those we

00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,100
buried them yep

00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:26,270
I think yep yeah that was the longing oh

00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:28,460
sorry yes I meant to be repeating the

00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:29,840
questions back for the recording so the

00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:33,860
question was how do we go about

00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:37,610
determining what the top tasks were we

00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:39,560
looked at search terms we looked at top

00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:41,960
top what's the Conte currently the top

00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:43,220
content that was really a struggle

00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,840
though because as you can see there was

00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:49,070
a thousand sites there wasn't one search

00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:53,450
rule that they each had their own some

00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:56,270
of them didn't even have one so that

00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:57,620
data we had to have a bit of a gut

00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,970
feeling with it we knew it wasn't a

00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:01,430
hundred percent but it was just an

00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:02,660
indicator from there we went back and

00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:04,850
looked at the business well what does

00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:06,410
QUT really want to achieve from the

00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:09,070
internet site again do you know what I

00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:11,840
mean they had these clear business goals

00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:14,060
then we did some usability testing with

00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:16,280
people and from that we determined you

00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:17,840
know that clearly the most top task for

00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,540
the external website was to find a

00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:27,830
course next one was to apply now the

00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:29,630
third one was to was it yeah fine I

00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:31,250
might have been find a job or something

00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:33,770
like that believe it or not one of the

00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:35,930
top 20 it didn't quite make the top 10

00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:37,730
but we ended up including it anyway was

00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:39,740
I want to give money to the University

00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:41,150
and I'm not sure how or I want to

00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:43,520
partner with the University and some

00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:45,410
research or I want to get some of your

00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,150
cool people to help me you know your

00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:49,460
grads or something like that well

00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:52,520
actually that's a really important so

00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:54,170
even though it's not quite a top 10 we

00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,880
still really want that money we want

00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:57,590
that research partnerships and things

00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:01,390
like that and it's really helping so we

00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:01,390
we sort of included that one anyway

00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:11,560
I have seen it yes have I seen the xkcd

00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:13,599
below that cartoon yes we all saw it and

00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,400
most of us headed over our desks yeah we

00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:16,660
often even sent that on to people do you

00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:28,540
know what I mean who had a good sense of

00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:30,070
humor in the University yeah yeah great

00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:33,880
question so the question was how to

00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:36,460
design come into this process our

00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,710
initial designs were paper prototypes or

00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:41,170
hand-drawn we had grid books where you

00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:43,210
know we do the seven columns online

00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:45,460
columns I think we had and we were sort

00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:47,530
of you know juggling those around yeah

00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:50,589
we did them ourselves and then about

00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:55,240
five months into the project we employed

00:41:50,589 --> 00:41:56,560
a dedicated designer and he has done a

00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,500
great job if you go and look at the

00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:04,900
three the suite of three sites they do

00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:08,050
look really funky and none of it's too

00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:09,250
tricky you know like one of the things

00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:12,160
we did have trouble was getting the

00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:13,270
service to use the font we wanted yeah I

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,920
don't know if you guys have come across

00:42:13,270 --> 00:42:18,550
that so in the end we were with our real

00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:20,109
envy Daniel like everyone yeah so some

00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:21,640
of our design things didn't come through

00:42:20,109 --> 00:42:25,800
we know they tested well just because

00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,800
they were technically too difficult yeah

00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:30,839
anyone else got a question no

00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:47,700
great questions so the question is now

00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:49,140
how's the Qt web presence managed is all

00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:51,000
of the web stuff done within a

00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:52,580
centralized web team or do the faculty

00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,430
still get to have some control and input

00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:57,900
some we squeeze sweet like drupal and

00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:59,160
many other content management systems

00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:01,740
allows you to have a distributed

00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:03,930
authorship system what we did was we

00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:06,720
allowed certain people to do certain

00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:08,550
things so the marketing comms officers

00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,360
and the events offices in the faculties

00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:15,680
we allowed them the rights to update

00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:17,940
their pages they can't make a new page

00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,710
maybe one or two people can that were

00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:21,930
quite web savvy that we really felt they

00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:24,750
could do it really all they can do is

00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:26,250
edit existing content and a lot of the

00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:27,330
Kanye content that they'd wanted to be

00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:30,540
adding would go through one of the

00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:32,250
beautiful forms as well so one of the

00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:34,110
benefits of having those forms is that

00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:36,030
anyone can add content to the website

00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:39,030
doesn't need to be a specific person

00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:41,490
with a specific role students can go in

00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:43,380
add news if they want you know I can go

00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:45,120
and add something about for a faculty

00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,380
even though i'm not in that faculty just

00:43:45,120 --> 00:43:48,360
cuz i might have heard that someone's

00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:51,360
done something I go I congrads

00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:54,780
you know lecturer rod jones on your

00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:58,530
thing there is an approval process for

00:43:54,780 --> 00:44:00,810
some of it the we have decided not to

00:43:58,530 --> 00:44:03,300
approve Student News let them just have

00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:04,530
their own news on their own site because

00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:08,250
we can always pull it down do you know

00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:09,510
what I mean if we need to but that's one

00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:15,480
of the few things that hasn't been

00:44:09,510 --> 00:44:17,310
delivered yet oh yeah but yeah most of

00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:21,600
the web development still in that team

00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:23,280
to retain the design the brand and not

00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:24,840
get that two week and by having it to

00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:27,030
distributed because there's a think

00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,380
there is a line there I've just been

00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:31,200
doing some contract with Griffith

00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:32,730
University and have 5,000 distributed

00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,980
authors who can do whatever they want

00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:39,720
and it's a mess yeah and there they

00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:41,940
really struggling with a single point of

00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:44,190
truth and all of those things that they

00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45,450
shouldn't be struggling with from if

00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:48,890
they're using web content management

00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:48,890
system yeah

00:44:49,529 --> 00:44:59,769
last question no oh look I would like to

00:44:54,430 --> 00:45:02,619
say something oh yeah no girlfriend on

00:44:59,769 --> 00:45:04,900
the I was hoping someone didn't ask this

00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:08,019
so the question was how did the team

00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:10,420
recover about half of the team or maybe

00:45:08,019 --> 00:45:14,829
two-thirds stayed on in an operational

00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:16,450
context and about a third of us moved on

00:45:14,829 --> 00:45:20,950
from QUT I was one of the people that

00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:22,660
ended up moving on there was about six

00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:25,089
months where I thought some of those

00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:27,430
people were just going to go home and

00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:28,450
never get out of bed do you know what I

00:45:27,430 --> 00:45:30,099
mean because you know what it's like we

00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:31,539
never doing this fantastic project and

00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:33,700
then all of a sudden your inbox is full

00:45:31,539 --> 00:45:36,930
of can you change the date on this page

00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:39,849
and can you do that and blah blah blah

00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:42,670
gone was the usability testing gone was

00:45:39,849 --> 00:45:44,529
the content rewriting gone was the let's

00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:48,039
make up a fantastic rule to guide this

00:45:44,529 --> 00:45:50,049
in the future stuff how they've managed

00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:52,239
that a bit better now so they started

00:45:50,049 --> 00:45:54,640
doing a bit more usability testing they

00:45:52,239 --> 00:45:56,140
set some time aside to keep going with

00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:58,749
the other things from the project that

00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:03,959
hadn't been finished yet and that really

00:45:58,749 --> 00:46:07,109
improved morale as well but yes I think

00:46:03,959 --> 00:46:09,339
any manager should really click

00:46:07,109 --> 00:46:11,440
carefully think about how they are going

00:46:09,339 --> 00:46:18,339
to make that transition from project to

00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:20,109
operational team yeah all right well

00:46:18,339 --> 00:46:22,809
