Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	South China Morning Post (SCMP) launched a rebuild of their website SCMP.com previously built on Vingette, now on Drupal 7.

The 15 month long project took a team of 4 Drupal developers, 2 Themers, 3 Sysadmins and 3 project managers to complete.

As an architect and lead developer of this project I'm proud to present this session as a case study into using Drupal for News & Media reflecting on the SCMP.com project. This session will highlight:

A brief background of the project.
Distinctive characteristics of a news site/portal and how Drupal handles them.
Numbers and statistics regarding effort, size and scale of the project.
Scalability and performance troubleshooting.
Lessons learned building a media portal in Drupal.

Josh works for Catalyst IT in New Zealand as a senior developer and architect in Drupal projects.
