Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: News & Media Case Study: South China Morning Post
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	South China Morning Post (SCMP) launched a rebuild of their website SCMP.com previously built on Vingette, now on Drupal 7.

The 15 month long project took a team of 4 Drupal developers, 2 Themers, 3 Sysadmins and 3 project managers to complete.

As an architect and lead developer of this project I'm proud to present this session as a case study into using Drupal for News & Media reflecting on the SCMP.com project. This session will highlight:

A brief background of the project.
Distinctive characteristics of a news site/portal and how Drupal handles them.
Numbers and statistics regarding effort, size and scale of the project.
Scalability and performance troubleshooting.
Lessons learned building a media portal in Drupal.
Josh Waihi has been a Drupal developer for the past 5 years and has been a regular contributor to Drupal core and contrib. Josh is maintainer of the PostgreSQL Driver in Drupal.

Josh works for Catalyst IT in New Zealand as a senior developer and architect in Drupal projects.

200 people now worldwide and I work in

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,970
the Drupal team which there's about

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:18,060
probably about 40 of us worldwide so

00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,689
today I'm going to try and give you guys

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,909
a case study on a project that we did

00:01:20,689 --> 00:01:27,390
started actually back in 2011 and we

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:29,450
just went live in August last year and

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,520
so it took it took a while and it was a

00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,229
feat for us and so today i'm here to

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,780
present to you guys and talk to you

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,909
about what we did was drupal and how we

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:42,750
did it and some of the lessons and

00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:44,790
things that we've learned from it so i

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,259
would want to start off actually before

00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,659
we go any further I wanted to find out

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,820
by a show of hands what kind of people

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:54,540
are here so could you raise your hand if

00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:57,090
you're a developer about the majority of

00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:02,040
them did you raise your hand if you're a

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:04,469
business owner give you around put your

00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:08,489
hand up if you are just here out of

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:09,910
interest I didn't meet you cool I see

00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:14,140
that hand hey

00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:15,820
sitebuilder yep ok cool first listen I

00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,790
don't think you better bill bill bill to

00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:20,770
the focal but there's a lot of other

00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:24,310
reasons for that but that's a cool thank

00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:28,120
you for coming cool so a little bit of a

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:30,280
background about is CMP SCMP they have

00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,760
been a newspaper company in Hong Kong

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,860
since 1903 so it's a really old company

00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,260
they're English speaking even though

00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:40,360
they're based in Hong Kong they target

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,580
the English majority in there and

00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,820
there's quite a strong presence of them

00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,880
there and they are incredibly paper

00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:51,700
focused kind of country country company

00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:54,160
so when I first went to the scmp

00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:57,430
officers normally when I'm working in my

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,800
desk I have you know my computer my

00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,540
laptop a cup of coffee and and that's

00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,060
really about it some headphones and a

00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,910
Philly you know clean disk these guys

00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:09,160
have stacks and stacks and stacks of

00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,810
paper issues and issues of issues of

00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,690
magazines and newspapers all around them

00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:16,300
the officers are covered in paper these

00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,740
guys are completely paper focused which

00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:19,030
was kind of a surprise to me I don't

00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,010
really think that a newspaper company

00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:23,650
would be like that but maybe it was just

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,630
some sort of silly thinking of my part

00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:29,230
but they had an incredibly strong paper

00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:31,000
culture back and the times of the

00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:34,060
dot-com boom they kind of got a little

00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,160
bit hurt as well so the whole lot pom

00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:37,480
boom happened and America and Hong Kong

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,209
were charging out putting everything

00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:41,590
online and making it happen and they

00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:42,850
tried to go along with that culture as

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,800
well and found that the model that they

00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,830
presented to the online web didn't work

00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,720
for them and for a number of reasons

00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,640
they they kind of wait a bit fair around

00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,140
online and so paper was still working

00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,970
for them and they continued on strong

00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:58,930
with that and so there was an awesome

00:03:54,970 --> 00:04:02,520
mentality that online isn't good and as

00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,520
we know that's kind of a silly think in

00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:10,270
telling a tender they went out and

00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:11,950
researched the web they decided that

00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:12,940
they needed a new website they decided

00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,950
that they needed to give this thing

00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,460
another crack they head out all the

00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:20,620
website that was built on vignette and

00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:23,680
they literally could not hold traffic

00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:25,840
that they wanted so every day

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,389
site would be a slow hog during the

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,320
morning traffic as it happens with with

00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:34,180
me media websites and when real news

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,940
came along and people floated to the

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,930
website it would just crash and that was

00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,699
really interesting because they actually

00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:42,850
have a business model in place whereby

00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:44,800
you can't view the actual article until

00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,970
you've paid to be a subscriber so there

00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,440
are people who actually come into the

00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:49,240
website just to read the headlines and

00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,220
still crashing the website there wasn't

00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,360
that much traffic going through it so

00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:54,460
they realized they needed something

00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:57,130
bigger and better to help them grow

00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:59,560
their online strategy as a company and

00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:02,020
they decided after looking around at

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,729
different solutions on the web there

00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,830
Drupal was a good fit for them and they

00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:07,479
decided to go and find people in the

00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,030
Drupal community that they could ask to

00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:11,830
build the website and so they looked and

00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,690
they found us they found a number of

00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:16,630
other companies and they asked them to

00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:20,590
tinder for building their website in

00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:22,990
Hong Kong and they gave it to us not too

00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:25,060
sure that the complete reasons we do

00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:28,030
have as I mentioned experience in

00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:31,330
building media portals back in New

00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:33,460
Zealand we together with stuff that

00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,440
credit in Zed and our Tiger Daily Times

00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,090
probably do about certainty percent of

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,250
the mission online media in New Zealand

00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:43,240
with user and Harold being the other the

00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:44,530
other player we also have a fairly large

00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,539
Drupal team for one of the bigger ones

00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:48,669
in New Zealand and we're kind of

00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:52,150
considered the enterprise guys in that

00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:53,889
space in New Zealand and we part ended

00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,870
up partnering with rackspace in Hong

00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:58,479
Kong they wanted to have a solution that

00:05:55,870 --> 00:06:01,810
was hosted in Hong Kong and they could

00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,130
for performance reasons so we had to

00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:04,780
wouldn't have office there didn't have a

00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,060
data center there so we we parted with

00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:10,479
them and we ended up creating

00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:14,440
relationship together this photo here is

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:16,659
a photo of us at the Media Awards in

00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:20,289
Malaysia which was in December last year

00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:24,210
and scmp took away four golds and a

00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:24,210
bronze from from the awards

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:31,560
okay so let's move into the challenges

00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:32,789
firstly explain the next number of

00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,370
slides are going to have some pictures

00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:36,720
up on their behind the background these

00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,300
are all photos taken off the website

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,830
from photographers and they have

00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,990
captions on the on the inside there

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,910
which are completely unrelated to the to

00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:48,090
the presentation they just here to

00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:50,310
explain the picture okay so challenges

00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:54,050
as I mentioned before I see if he had a

00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:58,229
incredibly powerful paper based culture

00:06:54,050 --> 00:07:00,300
and so they worked in a print by design

00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:02,789
kind of mentality what that meant was

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:05,400
they had software called CCI newsdesk

00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:09,030
which would build their pages for the

00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:11,280
newspaper and then pushing that content

00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:14,520
out to other sources was an afterthought

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,620
so paper was the priority and then you

00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,870
would try and push that paper content

00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:21,720
out to other devices like unto a tablet

00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:24,960
or on to our website and that was a real

00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:28,259
challenge because a newspaper one single

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,880
page got pushed out into XML and that

00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,050
one page could have one article or could

00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,150
have two articles could have five

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,740
articles it could have half an article

00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:37,080
in a second article the second half of

00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,760
that article in another XML page it

00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,349
could also have like little teaser

00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,780
pieces that actually aren't real

00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:44,400
articles that you should ignore and

00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,169
there was also images and things that

00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,810
were associated with that which came in

00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:51,060
sort of a zip file so it was incredibly

00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:54,900
hard to try and understand how papers

00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,889
work and how they don't work and how how

00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,240
do we have to sort of pull that

00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:00,000
information and of course it went out in

00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,800
XML and they tried to describe the data

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,389
as well as they could but journalists

00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,190
being generalists kind of decide to

00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:06,720
change things and they decide not to say

00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:08,190
you know this is supposed to be a buyer

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,240
line text instead that's where they put

00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,650
their name to say that they're the

00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,539
author instead of putting it in the

00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,250
author field and things like that so it

00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:15,780
became incredibly difficult to

00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,090
understand it and figure out things so

00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,560
there was a lot of changing culture that

00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,970
happened at the same time to say

00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,070
journalists you have to use the system

00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:27,750
correctly we can't just sort of do it

00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:31,770
willy-nilly a second challenge that we

00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:34,320
faced was scaling for viral news one

00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:36,029
thing about news media sites especially

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,790
when you're on dedicated hardware is

00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:41,100
that you need to build an infrastructure

00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:44,000
that will last when you have viral

00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:46,770
events you know Michael Jackson dies or

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,750
earthquakes in Japan these big events

00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:50,280
everyone flocks the new sites and you

00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,770
have to make sure that you can deal with

00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:54,590
that amount of traffic but the

00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:56,970
infrastructure that you need for that is

00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:59,430
significantly more than when you're just

00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:02,880
operating in a sort of be a you format

00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:05,160
and so historically companies have

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,080
bought excessive amounts of hardware try

00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,870
and make that work and then you end up

00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:11,400
just sucking away power as you know

00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:14,010
eighty percent of your infrastructure is

00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,820
not really being utilized so we had to

00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,840
figure out an infrastructure that was I

00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:22,200
didn't have to use so much of a

00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:24,840
structure and it could scale and deal

00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:27,900
with the traffic an interesting thing we

00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:30,750
launched scmp.com in August they Google

00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,100
Analytics showed that the mount traffic

00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,350
instantly doubled the day that we

00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:37,740
launched and I don't think that was

00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:39,090
actually because it was so impressive

00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,650
that it went viral and we instantly

00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:43,230
doubled I me because it maintained that

00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:44,820
level permanently I think what ended up

00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,100
happening was that their system was so

00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,590
old and couldn't handle their actual

00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,030
current amount of usage that for half

00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,500
the traffic they weren't actually

00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:54,240
getting stiffed pages where they were

00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,380
trying to go to the news website because

00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,270
it because the system couldn't even

00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,740
handle it so for the first time when we

00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,360
went live they could actually see and

00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:02,190
get a clear idea about how many people

00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:05,520
they actually get into their website and

00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:08,790
since then we've actually gone I think

00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:11,730
400 times over that amount of page views

00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:14,040
in a day and we haven't gotten llort

00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:21,030
adore being you know there's been no

00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:24,870
real problems third challenge was hey

00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:27,750
walls hey walls are kind of a big thing

00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,400
at the moment and news media they're

00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,830
trying to figure out ways that they can

00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:35,370
make newspapers work online and still

00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:37,110
make money out of them and so paywalls

00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,370
everyone's looking and it's about to see

00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,370
if that's the answer if that's going to

00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:42,990
give them traffic if it's not going to

00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,700
give them traffic and figure out how

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:47,010
what's the right model for them so they

00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,810
have consultants who will come in and

00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:51,209
tell them this is the kind of paper you

00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:53,189
are this is the kind of pay wall or the

00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:55,829
a commis model that will work for your

00:10:53,189 --> 00:10:58,319
website and the way the SCMP were told

00:10:55,829 --> 00:11:01,679
to make their their paywall was to

00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:03,689
provide a kind of meat a trail system so

00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:06,089
you'd see one article and it would be

00:11:03,689 --> 00:11:08,279
able to read it see the next article and

00:11:06,089 --> 00:11:10,499
a notification will come up saying you

00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:12,540
have read two articles you have six

00:11:10,499 --> 00:11:13,860
remaining this month and then you can

00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:15,209
exit out of that and you read the next

00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,279
article and then you reach to more

00:11:15,209 --> 00:11:18,569
articles you have now read for articles

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,790
you have to lift remaining this month

00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:23,189
until you get to the end this tentative

00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:25,199
sorry you can't read anymore you need to

00:11:23,189 --> 00:11:27,420
subscribe to scmp here's how much it

00:11:25,199 --> 00:11:28,980
costs you know step through the next

00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:31,290
step and you can read it and the idea is

00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,029
to get people engaged and keep four

00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:35,339
people enjoying that website and then

00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:37,470
they want to subscribe and for the most

00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:39,899
part it's work they have a lot of

00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:41,249
subscribers that come through and for

00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,110
people who are just sort of passes by

00:11:41,249 --> 00:11:44,759
they can use the site and not really

00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:47,639
notice that there's a pay wall in front

00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:52,379
of it and they took that concept from

00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:55,100
New York Times and they didn't quite

00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:59,549
have the same budget as New York Times

00:11:55,100 --> 00:12:01,829
so York Times paid I come from research

00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:05,249
they paid 25 million dollars for their

00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:09,029
pay wall alone on the website they paid

00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:12,809
us forty six thousand dollars us to do

00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:14,399
the exact same thing in 40 days so we

00:12:12,809 --> 00:12:17,339
had a lot of challenges both from a

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:20,119
project perspective and also figuring

00:12:17,339 --> 00:12:22,019
out how you can make this work without

00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:25,439
making it too easy for people to get

00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:28,049
around the paywall and the big lesson

00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:30,179
that I think the client really had to

00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:33,660
learn to understand is that if you want

00:12:30,179 --> 00:12:35,610
anonymous viewers to read your paper and

00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:39,540
apply and meet a child to anonymous

00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:40,679
users well you simply can't do it or you

00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:43,259
could only just make an obstacle

00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:45,240
obstacle for people to get around it so

00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:47,790
for those business owners out there for

00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,769
thinking about doing a paywall if you

00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:52,589
want anonymous users to hit that pay

00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:55,049
wall they we have to as developers and

00:12:52,589 --> 00:12:57,379
plant something on their computer that

00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:59,939
makes gives them a marker right and

00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:02,519
that's usually a cookie or you could use

00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:03,870
flash or you could use local storage you

00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,030
have to have a way of identifying with

00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,760
that person is for the next

00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:10,130
they come back but because you haven't

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,700
asked them to have any investment in

00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:15,980
that cookie ie login then they can clear

00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:19,010
that and you they just get as if they're

00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,900
a brand new user so there's a problem

00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:23,600
there fundamentally with this concept

00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:25,280
which is clear your local storage clear

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,820
your cookies removed flash you give them

00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:31,070
for free so that's still a fundamental

00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:33,800
flaw and problem you have to have users

00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,970
invest some way into that session make

00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,200
them want that session to be able to

00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:38,270
retain the amount of views that they

00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,650
have but they found it that it was just

00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,690
too much over here to have people

00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:43,220
logging in that they would just go away

00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:46,850
they leave the site ever had to do that

00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:49,340
and therefore we couldn't enforce it

00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:51,620
they did however create a reward system

00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:55,130
sort of gamification if you will inside

00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:56,630
of the of the format so if you you could

00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:59,420
now think now you can read three

00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:01,640
articles as anonymous user then if you

00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:03,590
register you get an additional free for

00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:05,030
free and then they try and put the

00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:07,520
Congress model on you so now you can

00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:09,410
sign it and once you sign on there we've

00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,510
got your email address and we can email

00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:13,250
you and say well why don't you do this

00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:15,080
and do that and if you don't come back

00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,280
we can send you an email and offer some

00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:22,490
more free articles or something like

00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:26,800
that the other major challenge in this

00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:26,800
project was got a question

00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:44,470
yeah so as I mentioned we implemented it

00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,710
and it works but it still has that

00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:50,410
fundamental flaw so as long as being an

00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:54,370
anonymous user as if you know how we did

00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:57,130
it then you can get around it and that's

00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,870
that's the but I mean that's

00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:01,750
unfortunately the case for New York

00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:03,580
Times and you know who spent yeah and

00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,650
magnitude of hundreds of times more

00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:09,610
money than we did and it's still a

00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:12,250
fundamental flaw didn't use the first

00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:16,660
clip free module no no I do have another

00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:21,970
slide about using modules the slide cool

00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:24,670
moving on so yet the the next challenge

00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:25,900
will start a migration as I said they

00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,980
had a previous website it didn't work

00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:30,940
out so well from them they had been

00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,960
running since 1992 I think and so that

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,090
was kind of a cool thing they had

00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:36,250
actually been archiving data since the

00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:37,840
day they went online and that was

00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:40,420
something that they wanted to bring into

00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,100
the new system in the old system in the

00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:43,810
vignette system they could literally not

00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:47,020
have more than 10 days of news articles

00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:51,880
on the website and then it was too full

00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:54,070
so they had to every day purge the 11th

00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,440
day of content and they'd put that into

00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:58,630
an archive system and so they actually

00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,850
had this thing called the they were

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:02,350
seven date index where there was like

00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,790
here's all the news on the site

00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,170
essentially and you go through it and

00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:07,630
read it and that was kind of how they

00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:08,920
they did things but ended up turning

00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:10,750
into a feature what was originally a

00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,760
constraint turned into a feature and we

00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:16,180
ended up having to re-implement that for

00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:18,100
them was interesting but what I also

00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:21,700
wanted in this new solution was to bring

00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:24,250
everything since 1992 into Drupal and

00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:25,570
that included over 800,000 nodes and

00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:28,120
three hundred thousand users and eighty

00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:29,950
five gigabytes worth of data which is

00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,140
incredibly hard to restore in your local

00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:34,150
environment when you want to you know

00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,950
bring everything back up and try and

00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:38,410
work on a new feature because there's

00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:40,690
anyone tried restoring a you know 20

00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:43,270
gigabyte my sequel database that's a

00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:44,560
nightmare because you know and if

00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:47,730
something goes wrong you've got to start

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,020
again I he goes for hours of your day so

00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,460
that was a trouble but that wasn't

00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,870
actually the hard part of the migration

00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:55,089
the heart of the migration

00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:58,060
was things like subscription data where

00:16:55,089 --> 00:17:00,279
you know between 1992 and 1998 they had

00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,680
this model and they use the database in

00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:04,750
this way and then after that date they

00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,760
had a new model but they kept the same

00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:09,309
schema I just considered the data in a

00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:10,449
different way so you ended up with all

00:17:09,309 --> 00:17:13,000
these kind of conditions as you're

00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:15,550
trying to migrate data and and you're

00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,990
dealing with basically crap data and

00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:19,209
figuring out how you can import it and

00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:22,750
so the biggest problem that we had with

00:17:19,209 --> 00:17:24,550
what data migration was exactly that it

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,660
was that there was inconsistent data and

00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:32,080
a tech that course he likes some

00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:38,490
problems questions on the back what

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,490
database techniques no

00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:59,020
right so the question was if I heard of

00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,930
a particular module forgot the name of

00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:04,180
already temporal databases and the

00:18:01,930 --> 00:18:06,130
answer is no I haven't and I didn't

00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:10,000
tried that effort what we ended up doing

00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:11,950
was moving all the data into a separate

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,390
sequel database was actually a separate

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:16,750
set of tables that weren't dhruba lights

00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:19,450
and then because the other thing is has

00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,030
anyone tried using the Drupal API things

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:24,430
like node load and nodes save over

00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:26,920
800,000 nodes that takes a weekend so

00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:29,710
you you know and if it fails you if you

00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:32,260
want testing it really isn't flexible so

00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:34,600
we ended up writing sequel queries and

00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,950
statements so we had a bunch of we've

00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,200
got all the data into a sequel database

00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:40,720
then we did manipulation to make the

00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,950
data consistent and then finally we had

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,560
a set of sequel statements which

00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,520
inserted it into Drupal and that's kind

00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,810
of the way that we had to do it so we

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,480
had to basically go through the back

00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:51,220
door because it wasn't anything any

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,260
other way that we could do it faster

00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:56,560
there was just a lot of helix because

00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:58,600
you know we would go through inter

00:18:56,560 --> 00:19:00,760
amounts into the data migration project

00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,860
and we go look at the stutter it doesn't

00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,900
look right and then you know the guy

00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,000
from the project team will publish it up

00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,490
and go oh yeah that's because of this

00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,560
requirement we didn't tell you about and

00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:16,180
and that's the kind of problems that you

00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:18,880
eat that he did so i was going to give a

00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,290
demo of the site perhaps me to their but

00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,020
later on if we have some time just like

00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:25,930
to move on to the lessons that we had so

00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:28,540
continuing on from that migration yet 10

00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:32,050
years of data is not consistent we

00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:33,880
literally had 99 problems logged in the

00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:35,800
data migration process and we had a guy

00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:38,590
on our team cordarrelle fix all of them

00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:41,790
and it was a complete nightmare for him

00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:45,160
which I'm surprised he's still smiling

00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:48,070
so I would I would also recommend if

00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:50,050
you've got a lot of data like that try

00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:52,390
and plan it as if you can get away with

00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:53,980
a ton of materials thing because we

00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:55,720
found your 99 problems they weren't

00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,790
identified at the beginning of that

00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,460
phase of work they happen throughout the

00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:01,930
phase and it was that at that stage it

00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,880
to go through change quests and things

00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:04,470
and we actually ended up just going to

00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,780
tie my metier

00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:09,419
feels because they realize that the data

00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,520
had issues and we couldn't possibly

00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:13,530
scope for things we don't know about so

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,049
it just worked better if we could work

00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:19,409
that way and once we had that that

00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:21,030
freedom then we weren't constrained by

00:20:19,409 --> 00:20:22,890
time you know I we can't do this until

00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:25,020
it's been approved and all that kind of

00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:31,190
stuff so move much faster once we winter

00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:33,570
timer materials face to face is better

00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:35,669
it's really awesome that we can work

00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:38,039
internationally and do things we have

00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:39,450
some advantages like we can work in the

00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,830
morning before they wake up and get

00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,659
there and we can do deployments before

00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,640
they arrive so they can do a full day of

00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:46,020
testing and not wait for us to do a

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,179
diploma because we've already done it a

00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,250
lot of time they come online we also

00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:51,720
leave early which is not so good for

00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:54,960
them sometimes because they want us to

00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:57,360
continue working or doing something and

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,549
we can also do deployments at their

00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,250
outage times not they're not in peak

00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:05,190
times and they're our prime times are

00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:09,390
working hours so it kind of worked quite

00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:11,490
well but in terms of the project moving

00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:12,960
forward and moving at speed we always

00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:15,000
move the fastest when we were together

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,470
so times when we went over to Hong Kong

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,330
where they come over to New Zealand and

00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:20,549
that face-to-face environment kind of

00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:21,630
like enough you're in an agile project

00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:24,330
and you're on the sprint room together

00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:26,010
it just moves faster because you can ask

00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,360
a question get the feedback get the

00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,720
approval that you need to go ahead and

00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,429
do it and you can think on on your feet

00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:34,530
instead of having to analyze something

00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:36,780
put it in an email send it across log a

00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:38,700
ticket that kind of thing becomes kind

00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:40,500
of tedious and you end up more in the

00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:42,179
project management space than you're

00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:46,919
doing actually doing work in the project

00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:48,900
so face-to-face was always better we

00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:52,980
also had things in the cultural aspect

00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:56,130
they kind of change things if you either

00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:58,140
do work in Hong Kong the coding system

00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:59,460
over the air is like like your new

00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,409
zealand you sort of say here's our price

00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,750
that's that's what honestly it's going

00:22:01,409 --> 00:22:07,650
to take for us to do the work and they

00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:09,750
say okay or no in Hong Kong they they

00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:12,299
say well we're going to pay this price

00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:13,980
and they sort of counter you and one I

00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:15,840
like so we put out our price that this

00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,840
is actually what takes and then they go

00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,870
but we want to be less we're like

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,640
that's what taxi and they're not used to

00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:25,039
that so like we had to kind of learn

00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,720
this because if they pay what we

00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:29,240
originally said then they feel like

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,830
they're getting ripped off and if we if

00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,970
we blow our prices then we feel that

00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:33,320
we're getting ripped off so you to

00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:45,289
figure out a way of like coming to a

00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:49,850
good agreement yes Oh question we ended

00:22:45,289 --> 00:22:52,190
up going with discount models so we said

00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:55,070
look this is our price they said no we

00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:57,710
want pay less and we said this is our

00:22:55,070 --> 00:23:00,260
price will give you a discount and then

00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,580
the next time they understood that we

00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,049
discounted them for the last one and

00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:04,640
it's not going to happen for the next

00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:06,679
one and so where you sort of mended the

00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,240
relationship that way rather than over

00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:14,360
quoting because it can that's not really

00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:16,429
ideal I guess yeah we we but in saying

00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,559
that coming into the project there was a

00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:20,630
lot of unforeseen things there was a lot

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,210
of change requests logged and we did

00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:26,330
come over budget with a go over budget

00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:29,390
so we probably lot you know lost out on

00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:30,860
a bit but an actual fact we still I mean

00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:37,429
we still made profit we're still

00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:39,230
successful in there okay so listens know

00:23:37,429 --> 00:23:41,450
when to write a custom module was a big

00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:43,850
one we the ground running when Drupal 7

00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:45,260
just came out and if everyone can

00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:47,000
remember back to when that happened

00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:48,500
there was still a lot of modules out

00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
there that weren't ready I mean they

00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,830
kind of had releases but the head bugs

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,539
and that just kind of happens when

00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,640
you're using a brand-new version of

00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:57,289
Drupal right because until people start

00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,779
using it people can't identify bugs

00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:01,820
people can't fixed up so we were willing

00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:03,679
to wear that we wrote when I we decided

00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,059
to contribute to that and help make

00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,299
things a bit more stable and we did that

00:24:05,059 --> 00:24:11,210
in the process but unfortunately along

00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:13,159
the way when we reviewed custom module

00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:15,799
and decided to try and use it it often

00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:20,140
called us cause more problems than it

00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:23,330
was worth views was one of them

00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:25,010
unfortunately i know that this community

00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:29,030
really loves views so much so it's in

00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:30,740
Drupal 8 but in this context it was

00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,590
actually bad and the main reason was

00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:33,360
because we were you

00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:35,400
in views the way that you would use them

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,830
in Drupal 6 right which is you build

00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:39,090
your query and in the UI you place all

00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:41,159
the fields and you render or the fields

00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:43,470
independently and you don't use view

00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:46,740
modes or node templates because they

00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:48,240
kind of sucked in triple six but what

00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,529
they ended up happening is that while

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,900
the query time could be kind of quick

00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:53,750
the actual rendering time would be

00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:57,179
really slow and we ended up with

00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:59,610
probably about 30 views on the front

00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:01,169
page which is huge right no one has 30

00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:02,250
views on the front page and when you're

00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:03,870
doing that many queries in that much

00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,760
rendering time it actually takes a

00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:07,320
really long time to get that out and so

00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,429
we had a lot of problems there and in

00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,690
hindsight would probably use something

00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:12,330
like a few modes which would be much

00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:15,419
faster in actual fact there were views

00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:17,549
was doing stuff like you want to render

00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:19,830
this field well I'll load the entire

00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:23,669
entity before I render it which is kind

00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:25,500
of seems pointless to me so as adding

00:25:23,669 --> 00:25:27,630
the entity Keysha module instantly

00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,309
improve performance because we weren't

00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:31,140
loading things over and over again we

00:25:29,309 --> 00:25:35,370
could just blow them out straight out of

00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:37,110
cash but panels was pretty awesome so it

00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:39,779
was really lightweight we pretty much

00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:41,340
removed blocks and use panels and that

00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:43,860
meant that we were able to do dynamic

00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:45,720
layouts for every single page and there

00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,760
was probably about 70 different

00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,860
templates that they handed over to us to

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,600
build and so we did that all panels that

00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,520
were able to consolidate a bunch of

00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,220
those templates into a single panel in

00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,529
it that was a great one so would use

00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:00,480
those again and would probably build

00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:05,240
some custom pains instead of using views

00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:09,029
in place of it also another one module

00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:11,549
they wanted to do well one thing about

00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:13,320
paywalls and one thing about having a

00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:15,360
subscriber model means that you have

00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,270
predominantly authenticated traffic in

00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,770
very little anonymous traffic and that's

00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,940
really important to understand when

00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:23,789
you're looking at from a performance

00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:25,890
perspective because in Drupal core and

00:26:23,789 --> 00:26:28,500
ripple seven out of the box you can get

00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:29,850
varnish caching for anonymous traffic

00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,890
for free but you can't get that for

00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:33,330
authenticated traffic as soon as there's

00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:35,270
a cookie involved with the sessions

00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:37,110
attached to it that becomes a problem

00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:39,029
that wasn't going to be good enough for

00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:41,220
us since the majority of our traffic was

00:26:39,029 --> 00:26:42,539
going to be authenticated we didn't want

00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,440
Austin indicator traffic to take the

00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:48,080
site down so instead we have to

00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:50,600
great creative ways of making a finicky

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,399
terrific cacheable and that means doing

00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,809
things like abstracting the things that

00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:56,210
are specific to the user will like you

00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:58,220
know hello user name and putting that

00:26:56,210 --> 00:27:01,789
into something else like a JavaScript

00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:04,330
ESI or financial something like that and

00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:06,169
then that created additional problems

00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:08,059
because there are other modules out

00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:11,750
there that would do things like creating

00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:13,159
sessions you know when you didn't want

00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,230
them to do it and it would slow down

00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:17,299
sites and stuff so we ended up having

00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:19,220
that single constraint and placement

00:27:17,299 --> 00:27:20,659
that there was a lot of hundred modules

00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,830
out there that we couldn't no longer use

00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:24,529
because they were just poorly written

00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:26,960
and so we ended up rewriting a bunch of

00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:27,919
them to make the better but the

00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,929
maintainer didn't want to commit the

00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:37,820
patches because they were too big so we

00:27:29,929 --> 00:27:40,429
sort of just roll alone megamenu mini

00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:43,269
panels so there's an extension that

00:27:40,429 --> 00:27:46,370
allows you to embed a mini panel onto a

00:27:43,269 --> 00:27:49,600
menu item and use that as the mega menu

00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:52,159
for hover over 'he's what it does is

00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,019
print renders all the many panels and

00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,379
page load and beds them at the bottom of

00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:59,269
the page and then send you the page back

00:27:57,379 --> 00:28:01,009
now I don't know if you've looked at

00:27:59,269 --> 00:28:02,600
media sites recently but they're all

00:28:01,009 --> 00:28:05,299
about really long pages they want you to

00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,649
scroll forever so as it is you're

00:28:05,299 --> 00:28:09,320
already putting out a really large page

00:28:06,649 --> 00:28:10,879
now you're about to put panels markup at

00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,039
the bottom of it but each menu item

00:28:10,879 --> 00:28:14,929
might select five or six additional ones

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,090
and render everything that's inside of

00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:18,950
it in there as well which was kind of

00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:20,990
cool but the faster way to do that was

00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:23,389
actually to load them with javascript

00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:25,639
instead as an AJAX call back so that

00:28:23,389 --> 00:28:27,769
when you want to see it then it does it

00:28:25,639 --> 00:28:29,179
and you could actually do a late loading

00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:31,279
thing we did a lot of lazy loading so

00:28:29,179 --> 00:28:33,649
you hover over it and if it's not

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:36,409
already loaded because it loads and HX

00:28:33,649 --> 00:28:37,700
whether you want it or not it'll just

00:28:36,409 --> 00:28:39,710
give you a buffer and then it will show

00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:42,200
up and that was a much faster thing

00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:44,960
because not only you're not spending the

00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:47,090
processing time and your page too to

00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:50,710
generate that but you're also not

00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:50,710
sending that down the pipe hole

00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:59,760
no because that module exists and the

00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:03,270
way that we changed the code is so

00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,620
significant where he work that pets just

00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:07,409
wouldn't fly in that module because we

00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,279
wrote most of it out and rewrote it does

00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:09,659
sound like something that we could

00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:11,880
differently contribute back in some

00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:14,150
space I've used it already and other

00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:19,980
projects locally so it's a good point

00:29:14,150 --> 00:29:21,240
yeah give a question the question for

00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:24,090
that was what other modules he'll be

00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,700
rewritten another one and I wouldn't

00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:29,850
recommend using this module ever one of

00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:31,919
the requirements was a great way to

00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:35,460
reduce today one of the requirements was

00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:38,690
the user can only have one session at a

00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:41,610
time think about this for a moment so

00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:44,309
you log onto the website you can only

00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:46,380
have one session so that user ID that

00:29:44,309 --> 00:29:48,720
you ad can only be on that one device

00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:50,760
one of the old rule problems they had

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,020
right as they pay for a subscription and

00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,399
then give their username and password

00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,260
out to all their friends and family and

00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:57,960
they can all log on to the site and and

00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:59,929
use that subscription so what they want

00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:02,850
to do is lock it down to a single device

00:29:59,929 --> 00:30:05,340
but that is actually quite a challenge

00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:07,230
to do because what happens when someone

00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:10,080
else tries to log on do you kick them

00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:12,330
off and let them go on or do you deny

00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,950
that login or you know what's what's the

00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:15,539
logic that happens there and then they

00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,429
also extended that and said actually you

00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:19,020
want to allow three because what we were

00:30:17,429 --> 00:30:20,850
when we launched people started

00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,409
complaining saying oh but I've got a

00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:24,090
tablet I've got my mobile phone I've got

00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:25,799
my desktop computer at home I've got my

00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:28,649
work environment I don't like what I k

00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:30,330
we can reuse X number of those on on

00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:33,240
that website I suppose and so they

00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:36,179
wanted to expand it but the overall

00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,520
problem was that the session logic

00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:40,590
required you to and the module we used

00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:43,590
was session limit required you to create

00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:45,690
a session which seemed to cookie which

00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:49,470
prevented caching and the way that we

00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:51,360
were doing caching and so it basically

00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,679
meant that the user as soon as they

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:55,049
logged in will even visited the website

00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:58,110
would just slow them down and it became

00:30:55,049 --> 00:31:01,380
a real problem so we ripped that module

00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:04,970
out and rewrote it I rewrote it I don't

00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,970
remember what I did but it works

00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:14,800
yeah we should catch up later on we also

00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,980
did some cool stuff with sharpie does

00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:20,830
anyone use chat beat before chart beat

00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:22,810
is like if you've used Google Analytics

00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:25,150
recently you'll notice is now a real

00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:27,070
time widget board and you can see

00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:30,730
traffic hitting your site in real time

00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:32,080
chart beat does this feature only and it

00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:35,230
extends us using something called

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:37,600
Newsbeat and that's specifically

00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:39,790
targeted towards newspaper sites and so

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,260
scmp they really wanted this the speech

00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:45,280
here in there and they made us integrate

00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:46,630
it and then we took a stance when it was

00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:48,250
too when we were talking about analytics

00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:50,050
and things they want for analytics and

00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:51,880
said we will not track analytical data

00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:54,910
because we've already got 85 gigs of

00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,590
data we don't need anymore so what we

00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:58,960
did instead is we went back in query

00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:00,730
chart beating we've queried do analytics

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,530
for that statistical data and then

00:32:00,730 --> 00:32:04,690
showed that on the website so if you go

00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:06,310
to scmp.com and you scroll down the page

00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,230
and look at the most popular widget

00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:11,740
that's coming directly from chart beat

00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:12,730
in real time and I originally had a bit

00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,110
of JavaScript denier that it would

00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,300
actually update it on the page while

00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:17,770
you're on the page but I realized a it's

00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,690
not really that useful because it's not

00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:21,760
on underneath the fold most of the time

00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:23,800
so you can't really see it changing and

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:31,320
I also happen to crash the server the

00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:34,570
same day release date change whoops cool

00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:36,850
i'll move on to some stats that we have

00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:39,070
about our projects so it went from major

00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:40,270
thousand eleven to August 2012 we're

00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:42,430
still doing work with them and doing in

00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:45,790
a row of releases but it wasn't until

00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:48,490
August 2012 that scmp.com went like the

00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:51,940
new version of it we squashed over

00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:53,830
almost 1,700 bucks so we had a bugzilla

00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,570
system setup and whenever there was a

00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:59,230
bug either from our QA team or from them

00:32:55,570 --> 00:33:01,150
that log it and would fix it over eight

00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:04,000
thousand emails exchanged back and forth

00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:07,840
between the project managers 18,000

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,000
hours spent on the project 198 features

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,880
delivered so these aren't requirements a

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,350
lot 100 98 requirements 198 features

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,250
which contain requirements inside of

00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:20,040
them that we work through and deployed

00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:22,980
70 pages of client documentation what we

00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,840
did was we hardly ever used the book

00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,670
module so what we did is in store the

00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,590
book module and built the book under the

00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:31,290
administration section of the site and

00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:33,450
that's in line documentation for the

00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:36,140
whole for the editorial team and for the

00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:40,020
project management team and they're the

00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:41,400
digital team themselves I would did some

00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,380
better training over at Hong Kong as

00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,610
well showed them how the CMS works from

00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:48,870
the back end and how they can run it

00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:50,460
what ru catalyst that were involved in

00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:52,890
the project in some sort of capacity

00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:55,940
although there's probably about 12 core

00:33:52,890 --> 00:33:57,870
team members ten trips to Hong Kong

00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,520
three to eight hundred articles are

00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:01,410
imported daily so there's not just

00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:03,030
newspaper there's also magazines and the

00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:04,590
newspaper and some newspapers are bigger

00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:06,840
than others so that's why the number of

00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:10,800
articles are very we also bring in feeds

00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:13,560
from LA Press and Bloomberg and these

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,690
other news agencies as well quite a few

00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:17,909
get commits in there and our

00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:21,360
infrastructure runs 21 virtual servers

00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:23,220
on sex physical servers I mentioned some

00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,840
people might ask me why we used physical

00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:27,149
infrastructure and stead of going to the

00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,370
cloud and the key one went there was

00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:32,010
that we signed a service level agreement

00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:34,290
where this EMP to guarantee performance

00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:36,480
of of the site and if you're running on

00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:39,120
cloud hardware you can't guarantee the

00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,200
resources underneath you so we wanted to

00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,550
be able to ensure it and if there's a

00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,010
problem that we could actually deal with

00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:46,919
it at the hardware level so we went with

00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:52,889
physical servers and put our own virtual

00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:56,040
layer on top there's over a million

00:34:52,889 --> 00:34:57,720
lines of code that that we wrote but

00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,610
there is predominantly features and

00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,350
views and things like that it sounds a

00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:02,700
lot more bigger than it really is there

00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:04,320
were a lot of modules that were enabled

00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,150
again that was a choice of how we

00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,120
decided to roll our features and a lot

00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:11,550
of those modules were feature modules

00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:15,630
and we did 255 releases to staging

00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:19,320
before we went live pretty epic so

00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:21,930
that's the majority of my presentation

00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:24,770
like to open up the floor to questions

00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,770
hello

00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,890
yep

00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:41,790
so the question was there originally a

00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:44,460
print paper and when they go online do

00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:47,030
they keep the content from paper online

00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,030
as well

00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,900
you

00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:16,750
right

00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:24,460
sure

00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:24,460
okay right

00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:31,140
okay so how about work how does the

00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:33,480
workflow process work in s simply i

00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:38,520
think is well i can provide it as an

00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:40,080
answer which is they use CC I news gate

00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,690
that's their product for producing the

00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:44,730
paper and journalists will have their

00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:46,410
own desktop they will open up the

00:36:44,730 --> 00:36:49,200
software which is a desktop application

00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:51,960
and they will type in their story and

00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,030
send it to the editor the editor and his

00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:56,010
team are then responsible for choosing

00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:57,570
the articles to create editing the

00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:00,750
stories and placing them in the paper

00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:04,530
they send out to typeset their exports

00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:07,200
to XML that XML gets sent over is if TP

00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:09,510
to us and we import those stories and

00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,030
they all sit unpublished and dribble

00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:14,490
then what happens is they haven't a

00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:16,680
digital editorial team there come on

00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:18,300
board they look at the articles and they

00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,650
start promoting some of them to no

00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:21,660
queues to put them into the different

00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:24,660
sections but to order them around the

00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:26,190
page and they published you know the

00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:28,740
publish the ones they want and they will

00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:31,680
alter because what happens is something

00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:36,180
that's a title and honor article and

00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:37,410
print is sometimes ambiguous because I

00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:39,570
want you to read the article and find

00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:41,340
out more information if you put that on

00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:43,530
the web it's not what you're looking for

00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,240
so you won't find it so what they end up

00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:47,640
doing is they have a print head in a web

00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:50,040
head and so they'll change that around

00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,840
and fix up grammar and things like that

00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,240
so they have a dedicated team for doing

00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:56,070
that and they're kind of responsible for

00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,930
they have the freedom I think to do that

00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:59,730
with the direction of the editor but

00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:02,030
they still responsible for doing that

00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:05,070
and they have a team of about 21 guides

00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:07,500
that put the paper together so that I

00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:10,860
think one thing that I appreciate about

00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:12,630
scmp was even because they asked her

00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:15,030
paper focus they do really care about

00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:16,200
content which something else someone has

00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:18,480
a slight border I should probably know

00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,280
more about that but kind of i'm

00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,620
interested in the technicals and don't

00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:24,120
really care about the content they you

00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,890
know put a teen it's bigger than us who

00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,180
built the site to be able to manage the

00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:29,450
content on it which I thought was really

00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,450
cool

00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:41,780
they used CCI newsdesk there's CCO news

00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:44,240
gate which is a different product for

00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:45,560
like I'm selling them now they actually

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,600
and that's probably the better product

00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,560
it just as really expensive and licensee

00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,840
fees and they don't want to go down that

00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,420
path but that will actually export

00:38:50,840 --> 00:39:02,330
articles in XML format rather than use

00:38:53,420 --> 00:39:04,160
pipe papers into XML format yeah yeah so

00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:05,960
journalists go there let I go on to

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,320
Drupal so that it's not actually the

00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,320
authoring environment

00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:19,560
oh that's interesting

00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:24,240
I'd say if you go to Drupal 8 that

00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:25,530
sounds good because you can actually

00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,810
have the authoring environment on your

00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:30,000
phone but then Drupal 7 at least you can

00:39:27,810 --> 00:39:33,600
get an M and interface that does

00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:38,040
responsive that'd be cool okay in the

00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:39,510
back it's not a multilingual site so

00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:42,870
SCMP even though they're in Hong Kong

00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:46,140
actually are only English paper and

00:39:42,870 --> 00:39:48,240
anything that's in chinese mandarin it's

00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:52,310
actually usually an image because it's

00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,310
something that they're advertising yeah

00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,940
look

00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:04,840
No

00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:06,580
so what they yeah back when we started

00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:09,910
actually responsive was actually around

00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:11,350
so it wasn't in the design and so when

00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,730
you go to it on your iPad you'll find

00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:14,950
that you'll get the desktop website and

00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:19,840
if you go to it on your phone you'll get

00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:21,640
the mobile website MGMT calm and so

00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,800
that's the strategy at the moment in but

00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:26,440
your simple combos incredibly compact

00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,300
doubts headlines and actually fear it

00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,760
because it's much smaller and works a

00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:33,010
bit faster and I think on Android it

00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:35,140
goes to invite us to be calm they are

00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:39,430
currently working on etiquette native

00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:41,800
apps to download and work it's yeah it

00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:44,619
changes a lot with these guys they don't

00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:49,150
care so much about accessibility they

00:40:44,619 --> 00:40:51,280
care more about papaya tree ownership so

00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:53,290
because because it's so important to

00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,440
hide content from people and makes it

00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:58,119
more less less accessible so for example

00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:01,960
we have the paywall that will pop up and

00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:04,869
high content and there's these

00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:07,570
interesting things like a few use I

00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:09,369
think Apple has a ereader type device

00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:10,510
where you can choose to extract content

00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:13,060
out of a website that doesn't support

00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:14,619
mobile and present that in a way that's

00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:17,410
a bit easier to read and understand and

00:41:14,619 --> 00:41:19,390
that was for a while a loophole to

00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:21,369
abstract the content and not go through

00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:23,350
the paywall so we had to figure out ways

00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:25,150
of blocking that out and then there's

00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:27,760
all these kind of crazy things you end

00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:29,650
up having to to change the content and

00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,140
make it hard to access unless you access

00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:33,880
it and the way that you can control

00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:37,200
which means you have seen access to be a

00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:37,200
accessibility at the door

00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:47,599
we looked at open published it wasn't

00:41:44,569 --> 00:41:49,720
dribble sex at the time and we didn't

00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:52,250
want to build on dribbble sucks because

00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:54,349
it's not future-proofing no by tumblr

00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:58,640
release they get a year of support and

00:41:54,349 --> 00:42:02,150
secure again so that was a immediate no

00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:04,940
and the size of the project really meant

00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:06,890
that it needed to be bespoke in the

00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:10,990
sense in terms we couldn't really use it

00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:15,260
the base distribution to kick us off

00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:22,510
should I be integrating with unionpay as

00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:25,099
a Commerce gateway know so they wanted

00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:29,030
to integrate with the payment gateway

00:42:25,099 --> 00:42:31,190
called Asia pay and in Hong Kong and all

00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:33,650
pay dollar was there their product that

00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:37,010
we used and so we we use the commish

00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:38,530
module and drupal and you build out all

00:42:37,010 --> 00:42:40,520
of the products and things and

00:42:38,530 --> 00:42:42,619
integrated that into it and then we

00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:46,220
built a custom pay dollar integration

00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:48,020
module to the Commerce module to talk to

00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:51,609
it that was the only payment gateway

00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:51,609
that they wanted to work

00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:07,640
did we get any extra support and from

00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:11,380
the government or for some other entity

00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:16,040
to help the relationship in the project

00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:18,530
not for SC NP calm but there was a trade

00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:21,170
and enterprise group cut remember if it

00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:24,430
was government or not that were

00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:27,740
interested in helping us out develop a

00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:30,170
business in the Asian market and so we

00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:35,060
are currently pursuing options were

00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:37,609
going to help do that i'm not i'm not

00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:40,579
working at that level so i can't say but

00:43:37,609 --> 00:43:42,470
i think so yeah we're continuing the

00:43:40,579 --> 00:43:45,609
relationship so it must mean that's

00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:45,609
something worthwhile yeah

00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:10,930
there's a lot of data fees that go in

00:44:07,299 --> 00:44:12,910
and out of drupal site and yeah they've

00:44:10,930 --> 00:44:14,440
had this system in place or a very long

00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:16,539
time they remember obviously there are

00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:19,119
paper since 1903 and they've moved from

00:44:16,539 --> 00:44:21,400
having everything on file to into a

00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:22,779
computer system and they have already

00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:24,759
had their infrastructure setup and

00:44:22,779 --> 00:44:26,890
dealing with paper-based subscriptions

00:44:24,759 --> 00:44:29,619
and so they wanted us to integrate into

00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:30,940
that and the way that they've been doing

00:44:29,619 --> 00:44:32,789
it in the past in the way they wanted to

00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:35,279
continue doing that was through

00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:41,710
synchronizing data feeds which was

00:44:35,279 --> 00:44:44,680
terrible be painful yeah yeah they may

00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:47,890
use Oracle finance as one of them so if

00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:50,170
we if we sold the print and digital

00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:52,119
package together we'll give them the

00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:54,400
access on the website and then it would

00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:57,880
be a feed that were at nighttime run and

00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:59,529
send everything from the day over and in

00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,359
that reconcile that and they know they

00:44:59,529 --> 00:45:03,039
see everything over from us that had

00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:06,130
other ways of getting to the visual site

00:45:03,039 --> 00:45:08,200
and would reconcile that and yeah so you

00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:09,309
ran into race condition problems and

00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,289
what happens if someone does something

00:45:09,309 --> 00:45:13,960
over here and over here and all that

00:45:11,289 --> 00:45:15,430
kind of stuff we just have to kind of

00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:20,259
deal with it so yeah it's not a

00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:25,890
prettiest solution that works that's

00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:30,779
your question cool do any other

00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:30,779
