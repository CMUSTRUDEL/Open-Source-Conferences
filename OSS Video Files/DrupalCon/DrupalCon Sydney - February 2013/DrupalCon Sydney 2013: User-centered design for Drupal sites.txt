Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: User-centered design for Drupal sites
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	Drupal gives us a range of powerful tools for structuring and presenting content, but relying on these can produce bland, list-driven websites. How do you structure a site to get the benefits of Drupal's content-first tools, while still producing a first-class user experience?

This session introduces an approach to planning Drupal site build's based on techniques from user centered design, marketing and consumer research, and content-first development principles. This approach has been evolved over seven years of Drupal projects, and can be followed by anyone with a basic knowledge of Drupal.

but what I am going to talk about is is

00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,950
how you can create a process that does

00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:10,230
that employees use this into design and

00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:13,349
other techniques to to create really

00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,059
great Drupal sites in doing so I did

00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,580
grapple a little bit with with what user

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,770
centered design actually is what it is

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,119
in our current context and I had a

00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,640
couple of different names for this talk

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,650
so it's been at various stages in my

00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,830
work called user experience techniques

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,359
for Drupal sites and and after dress

00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,940
this morning I also considered calling

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,630
it building better web experiences for

00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,920
Drupal sites but anyway I think it

00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:38,940
covers any of those and all those so

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:42,000
we're going to talk about some feeling

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,920
nebulous concepts today and if you think

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,640
that your definition is different to

00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,020
mine that's totally cool so know what is

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,570
user experience well it's kind of an

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,160
umbrella term for different for the for

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,410
an individual's interactions or the

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,710
website or a a nap or at all whatever

00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,449
you want as a discipline it's mostly

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,640
concerned with making the process of

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:07,049
using a service engaging and interesting

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,100
and relevant but in itself it draws on a

00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,170
range of other disciplines and

00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,090
techniques I don't think user experience

00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:16,500
as a discipline really it draws on

00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:21,030
marketing usability interaction design

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:24,060
visual design all sorts of areas human

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:26,189
centered design and if you're engaged in

00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,020
any area of site planning or interface

00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:29,820
or visual design or any part of kind of

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,560
stress strategizing and putting together

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,930
the way it site works for users you're

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,100
doing user experience in some way if

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:36,240
you've come to the previous session

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,799
you've probably had a good introduction

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,320
to that so I won't i won't go into it

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:44,430
too much did my explanation gel with

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,899
yours clear more or less yeah good so

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,700
what I'm going to talk about today well

00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:49,799
we're going to look at why traditional

00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,899
user centered design and ux techniques

00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,970
can actually fail when applied to a

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,000
drupal build the areas in which those

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,409
processes can go wrong what might happen

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,020
we're going to look at how you can

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,180
resolve that by combining user centered

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,549
design content modeling techniques

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,129
interaction design and I'm going to step

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,879
you through a process for doing that and

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:11,459
we going to look at a worked example

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,170
while we do that as well just so you you

00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:15,510
know kind of what I'm talking about

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,530
um if you don't understand anything at

00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,880
any point stick your hand up I'm

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,230
perfectly happy to take questions while

00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,120
we're talking hopefully we might go on

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:23,610
for too long we'll do questions at the

00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,099
end as well anyway we're going to look

00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,510
at is something called UX spaces we're

00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:29,130
going to be talking about a methodology

00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,580
for bringing disparate processes and

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:34,680
elements together and this this is a

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,900
method that I've worked on and developed

00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,280
over my seven years of building with

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,620
Drupal and a few years before that

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,290
working with other systems as well so

00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,440
it's evolved from various practices it's

00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,239
not prescriptive if you decide to

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,920
implement this or take elements of this

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,870
you know you should take it away and

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,040
make it work for you not just go away

00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:56,310
and do it because I said you should do

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,540
it so I'm going to start with a general

00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,489
discussion about some of the approaches

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,590
you can take to site design some of the

00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:02,910
pitfalls you can think about where

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,720
you've had similar problems in your own

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:09,390
builds how you might have solved them

00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:11,190
how how the way I'm thinking about them

00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:13,440
might have helped you in those contexts

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,850
or how it might not and whether you've

00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,120
had other similar solutions of different

00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,049
solutions house of them as well while

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,989
we're going through we're going to be

00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:23,370
looking at a project called Park file

00:03:20,989 --> 00:03:25,019
Park file doesn't exist as a project

00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:28,350
I've invented purely to work through

00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:29,970
today with you Park file is a is a

00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,640
website in which people can find parks

00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:35,459
and gardens that they're really into to

00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,870
do exercise or because they're tourists

00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:39,840
and then one can see Versailles or

00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:42,959
something all right we're going to be

00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,430
looking at how Park file is set up this

00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,989
is a wife Rome I see you should know

00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:48,239
what that is and we're going to look at

00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:52,680
how we can relate user spaces to

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,850
wireframes and the build process hmm all

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,950
right so quick diversion little bit

00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:57,510
about me and my background I'm currently

00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:01,650
a Drupal consultant with previous next

00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:05,459
Australia's premier Drupal firm I first

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,390
used Drupal 4.5 but I recently have

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:08,010
recently been feeling around of the

00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:13,220
Drupal three perhaps because I'm some

00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:15,209
kind of masochist don't do it mm-hmm

00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:18,329
I've been working exclusively with

00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:22,169
Drupal since 2007 for better or worse I

00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:24,270
also helped run Drupal ICT I wrote a

00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:26,250
theming engine for Drupal five and then

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:28,440
threw it away when Drupal 6 came out

00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,660
I'm the maintainer and co-author of

00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,670
display suite for Drupal 6 not Drupal 7

00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,460
so if you've got any problems with the 7

00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:37,640
version don't talk to me and I have

00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,660
about 25 other modules on drupal.org

00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:45,540
apart from displace week no one's using

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:47,310
any of them so go figure I know what

00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,260
that means I'm not selling them hard

00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:53,040
enough clearly I'm quite interested in

00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:55,620
the linked data and a Semantic Web high

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,810
availability Drupal and I'm also i'm

00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:02,010
also looking at things like MongoDB and

00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:04,110
other layout tools and various other

00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,000
bits and pieces in my own Drupal

00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:07,410
research all right so let's some stop

00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,570
talking about me and talk about the

00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,240
problem what is the problem well we

00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,040
learn how to build Drupal components hmm

00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,710
you've all done this you've sat down you

00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,880
learn how to build bits of a Drupal site

00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,740
you've learned how to arrange organize

00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,210
and design websites probably entirely

00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,250
separately from how you've gone about

00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:26,730
learning to do drupal but probably

00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:30,229
before in most cases but sometimes

00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:34,200
bringing these two together has problems

00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:36,750
um I've used the word design in here

00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:38,880
arrange organize and design websites I'm

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,830
using this in a fairly general sense I

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,080
don't mean design in a visual sensor

00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,630
purely when I say design I meant it kind

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,950
of in a craft since so design is the

00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:49,500
process of thinking about how to build

00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:51,120
something how to make something so just

00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,690
if I say design don't take it too

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:58,580
literally anyway I kind of think there

00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:58,580
are three approaches to website design

00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,760
some of these are fashionable some art

00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,979
some of them some of them work well some

00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,270
of them don't the first one and the one

00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:09,690
that I'm sure you've all seen is the

00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:12,690
business centered design approach this

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:14,070
is where the website is basically based

00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:15,960
around the structure of a business or

00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:17,580
the businesses business model sometimes

00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,110
not strictly the structure the business

00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,500
but it's model the way it thinks about

00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:24,060
itself and does business this approach

00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:26,610
focuses on the structure needs of the

00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,020
business the design is really strongly

00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,540
driven by the model and the requirements

00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,950
of the business as opposed to the users

00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:36,450
the high-level side architecture tends

00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:39,210
to map fairly well to the business user

00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:40,350
needs fairly subservience and it does

00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:42,660
tend to produce fairly bore

00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:44,280
sites unfortunately most of the time

00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,820
sometimes they work but they don't tend

00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,170
to be very interesting then of course

00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,490
there's user centered design and that's

00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,130
why you've come because I put user

00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,900
centered design in the title and user

00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,630
centered design focuses on the needs of

00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,760
users primarily designers driven by the

00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:01,350
requirements of those users the

00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,050
informational content structure is

00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:04,950
subservient to those requirements

00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,720
business structures are relevant and

00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:08,730
this can produce really nice outcomes

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:13,080
that can produce great sites but it can

00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:14,250
be hard to implement in Drupal the final

00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,280
type which I'm going to talk about today

00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,860
is content centered design now if you've

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,910
gone to an accurate training course you

00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,160
will have been taught how to do content

00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,980
centered design because that's the way

00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,680
dribble tends to work design is driven

00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:30,270
by content structure we hope that

00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,960
content structure is driven by user

00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:35,280
requirements but it may well not be

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,520
Drupal excels at this architecture it's

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,200
based on this architecture nodes that

00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,980
provide this architecture for you it's

00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:45,420
really easy to build sites like this but

00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:46,470
they have the same kind of issues as

00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,780
other side they don't always produce

00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,430
great sites the Drupal site that just

00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,940
lists lots of content under taxonomy is

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:57,030
a prime example not that that's

00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,890
necessarily bad but it can be any way

00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,750
the question is how can we bring them

00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,610
together without favoring one approach

00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:03,720
over the other because I think all of

00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,130
these approaches are perfectly valid

00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,510
ways to build websites it's just that

00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,790
you don't want to do one of them and

00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:10,110
forget the others basically you want to

00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,370
know how to how do you get your content

00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:15,180
to match the requirements of your

00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:17,370
audience so let's let's digress for a

00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:20,010
second talk about the elements of user

00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:22,040
experience has anyone heard that phrase

00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:26,370
before the elements of user experience

00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:30,380
well one hand here's a harder question

00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,380
for you does anybody know who this is

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,660
very good it's written on the bottom

00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,660
Jesse James Garrett

00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:43,290
Jesse James Garrett came up with this

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:45,320
it's called the elements of user

00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:50,250
experience this is about ten years ago

00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:55,140
rent about the year 2000 this was his

00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:56,850
explanation for how user experience

00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:59,640
works in the process of building a

00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,800
website he started at the top with user

00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,690
needs and then over time he's worked

00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,910
through requirements interaction design

00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:08,120
and architecture interface navigation

00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:15,680
design and finally a visual design

00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:23,210
alright fine whoops sorry wrong slides

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:25,260
yeah yeah it could have been yep yep

00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:30,240
frequently we get a shorter version and

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:32,070
this emits the user needs step and it

00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,110
executes visual design prior to or in

00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:37,050
tandem with the information and

00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:40,380
interface design this is about the worst

00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:44,520
kind of site build you can do oh it

00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:47,340
happens a lot but anyway that's what he

00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:51,390
did user needs spec interaction design

00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:54,540
visual design etc but this is a

00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:56,130
distraction he also said as much as we

00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,020
want to withdraw into a world of pure

00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:00,240
problem-solving we have to acknowledge

00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,860
that the most successful architectures

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,020
are the ones you can actually convince

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:07,770
someone to implement in other words if

00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:10,440
you can't build it in Drupal it's no

00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,430
good it's not useful if you can't build

00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,600
it effectively in Drupal you're not

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:15,750
going to have a good sites no matter how

00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:17,310
good any of these other processes are so

00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:19,890
let's discuss the pitfalls of user

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:24,360
experience specifically when applied to

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:25,680
dribble the first one and if you've ever

00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,840
tried to implement somebody else's

00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,180
design and Drupal you'll know this one

00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,880
is that drupal's markup doesn't match

00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:35,010
the design Drupal provides its own

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,210
default markup for everything so if you

00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:39,000
have to use other markup things get

00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:41,550
complicated now this is a qualified

00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,640
problem sometimes that's quite solvable

00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:46,260
with other tools and it is a common

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,710
problem with many CMS's this is not a

00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:51,630
Drupal problem but Drupal does provide a

00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,430
lot of default markup a lot of custom

00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:56,680
marker

00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:59,210
hmm so that is something that you strike

00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:02,390
another issue you get and this is harder

00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:05,630
to solve as the provided design mixes

00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:07,910
Drupal components a really good example

00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:12,260
might be a menu that contains a text

00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:15,380
resize link to the user's home page and

00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:18,500
a skip to content now you can't do that

00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:23,300
in Drupal at the moment without writing

00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:24,560
it yourself but not necessarily an

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,070
incorrect way of doing it's just a

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:29,180
Drupal doesn't support it very well

00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,830
another problem can be that the design

00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:34,190
itself is fairly and consistent in its

00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:35,779
use so Drupal structure is more or less

00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:37,640
fairly uniform most of the components

00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:39,170
that you get in Drupal a structured much

00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:41,360
the same way and the further forward we

00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:43,910
go in time the more the more structured

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:48,470
similarly structured they become if you

00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:51,350
have ia or designs that don't take a

00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:54,050
fairly consistent approach then you have

00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:55,700
to selectively override things and that

00:11:54,050 --> 00:12:00,920
becomes more difficult and creates more

00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:03,200
more issues another problem is that a

00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:08,270
design or UX can favor interactions not

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:12,020
met by the controls this might be a

00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:14,600
situation where somebody wants a special

00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:16,459
kind of ratings widget and you know

00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,410
you've got five star handy but it just

00:12:16,459 --> 00:12:20,690
doesn't quite do what what is required

00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:22,310
of the design so what do you do well

00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:23,870
you've got to implement your own or

00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:29,060
convince them that it that it needs to

00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:30,350
change in a similar problem is that you

00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,940
can end up with complex interactions

00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,760
that are based on third-party JavaScript

00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,839
libraries with broad ripple support so

00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:40,160
these are some of the pitfalls that you

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:42,529
can encounter the results of these

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,600
pitfalls are that ultimately your Drupal

00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:46,250
site isn't as good as it could be or it

00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,589
has higher maintenance costs or it's

00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,690
just generally harder to build so this

00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:52,820
takes time for everybody produces

00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:54,350
outcomes that are harder to test or just

00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,790
don't quite meet the requirements say

00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:57,440
you implemented five star instead of

00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,720
this other thing maybe they weren't

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,160
happy with that anyway we're going to

00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,100
talk about maybe a way in which we can

00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:05,870
get around that problem and this this

00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:08,029
particular solution is called user

00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:10,250
experience spaces I didn't actually make

00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:12,529
this term up I've heard this somewhere I

00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:14,300
can't remember it is I can't find it on

00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:16,220
the internet so this is somebody else's

00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:19,640
idea it's not mine but I don't know

00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,960
whose anyway what are you x places UX

00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,520
spaces are a way to represent the

00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,160
interaction between the user and the

00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:27,290
content in a way which has practical

00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:30,980
outcomes and can be the basis for an

00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:33,440
actual build or implementation in a

00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:35,330
really theoretical sense aux space is a

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:40,940
set of bounded interactions between an

00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:43,490
actor or a user and the content model we

00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:45,380
define aux space by the intended

00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,350
audience the type of content and the

00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:50,390
interactions that are required and then

00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:53,060
we can make this matchup with website

00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:55,779
sections pages widgets applications or

00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:58,460
task spaces so we can actually define

00:13:55,779 --> 00:14:00,290
what a user wants to do what needs to do

00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:04,029
all the things they need to work with in

00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:04,029
a particular space and then build that

00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,010
by way of a fairly simple example here's

00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,200
a really typical representation of a

00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:13,940
website this is a wireframe there's a

00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,300
menu at the top section 1 section 2

00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:19,040
section 3 section 4 in a really simple

00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:21,200
sense you can make ux spaces that

00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:25,820
correspond to these sections of your

00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:27,830
site but you can also nest your UX

00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,560
sections you can create reusable UX

00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:34,370
spaces you can place them in different

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,630
sections move them around I think you

00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,279
can probably already see that this is

00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:38,630
starting to correspond to components

00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:42,890
that Drupal gives you like panels or

00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:45,800
blocks or other systems finally UX

00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:47,930
spaces are easy to document this is

00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,190
pretty important because you need to be

00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:50,120
able to share these with other people

00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:52,130
you need to be able to talk to other

00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,270
people about them you need to be able to

00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:55,910
work through some of these ideas with

00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:58,910
the users as well potentially here's an

00:14:55,910 --> 00:15:02,650
example we've talked about parklife very

00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:06,410
briefly and this is a really simple

00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:09,320
documented UX space for a park a park UX

00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:11,240
space it contains the entity Park parks

00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:14,329
represent a physical park or garden and

00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,350
a task a user can search for parks I'm

00:15:14,329 --> 00:15:16,850
going to talk more about this example

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,259
later so just to show you what it looks

00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:21,120
like

00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:23,040
it's similar to uml or entity diagrams

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,360
if you're familiar with those you'll

00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,920
notice one of the differences we don't

00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,420
draw relationships between objects we

00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,339
actually put a bound around them instead

00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:31,829
this allows us to do things like overlap

00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:36,540
bounds you can also hand draw these

00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:39,059
which is quite nice this is just taking

00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:40,170
some of the content out of that one is

00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:42,029
just showing you the components the

00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:43,889
entity and a task I've used a little

00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:45,899
folding document for entity in a little

00:15:43,889 --> 00:15:47,069
stripe box for a task you don't have to

00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:50,009
do that if you don't want to it's just

00:15:47,069 --> 00:15:52,079
the way I'm representing them today we

00:15:50,009 --> 00:15:55,259
can also do things like employ

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:58,009
relationships with other entities so

00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:58,009
let's have a look at another example

00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:05,490
this is for a project that hasn't been

00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:09,300
built yet that allows users to add motor

00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:10,439
vehicles to their garage the idea here

00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,639
is that a user can track their motor

00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:12,779
vehicles and what they're doing and when

00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:15,779
they need to be serviced in various

00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:18,569
other components this is the garage UX

00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:20,249
space this has another vehicle has a

00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:22,290
relationship with a user we might want

00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:23,970
to draw on that later and it has a task

00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:25,740
a user can add and remove vehicles from

00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,660
the garage it's really not fleshed out

00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:29,160
at this point and it's we can start to

00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:30,360
ask questions about what a user's going

00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:36,540
to want to do what else do they want to

00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:39,240
do in their garage UX space UX faces can

00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,790
be nicely overlapped as well so when

00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,829
you're documenting them you can start to

00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:46,139
put individual entities into different

00:16:43,829 --> 00:16:49,279
spaces and see the overlaps start to

00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:52,009
draw relationships between them that way

00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:54,899
we can also document users fairly simply

00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:56,309
and we can make them entities as well if

00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:58,079
we need to if you need to search users

00:16:56,309 --> 00:16:59,790
so it's quite flexible you can do what

00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:01,050
you like anyway I'm going to give you a

00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,790
quick test because we looked at it now

00:17:01,050 --> 00:17:04,110
while I have a glass of water have a

00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:08,360
look at this one see if you can tell me

00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:08,360
what it is which site is this

00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:19,260
very good Twitter I had to pick

00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:20,970
something easy right because they're

00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,819
really complicated UX spaces are quite

00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:37,940
hard to work out backwards what about

00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:40,080
this one what gave it away was it sure

00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:44,160
all right so I think you've got the hang

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,230
of it cool so UX basis for Drupal and

00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,670
this is kind of the key here we've we've

00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,200
talked about a methodology that's fairly

00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:50,280
general you could use it on any site but

00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,679
why we actually talking about it in the

00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:54,780
context of Drupal well this is not a

00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:55,620
situation where I can up with the idea

00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,960
and thought hey this had worked really

00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:59,130
well for Drupal she ended up combining a

00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,990
whole lot of different ways in which I'd

00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,970
built sites in the past to come up with

00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:06,360
a system that was that was workable and

00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,830
could be implemented in Drupal UX basis

00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,580
give us an opportunity to bring Drupal

00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:12,600
strong content model to the four without

00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:17,280
without dropping off some of these other

00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:19,230
processes which are important it's

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,420
really easy to translate some of the the

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:24,030
UX base concept into Drupal content is

00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,410
entities act as the users and then the

00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,720
behaviors of the specific things that

00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:29,160
that users need to do behaviors kind of

00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,770
break down into two areas you've got

00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:33,270
tasks which can be things like filters

00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:34,770
sorts and flags things users actually

00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:36,059
need to do in order to complete

00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:38,370
something and then you've got

00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:40,860
interactions these can be things that a

00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:42,330
user might observe or might have the

00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:48,929
opportunity to interact with such as a

00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:50,520
slider or a video or something else once

00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:53,010
you've actually done some UX spaces once

00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:56,840
you've completed some diagrams you can

00:18:53,010 --> 00:18:58,710
translate those really easily into

00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,630
individual components that you can

00:18:58,710 --> 00:19:03,450
deploy on your site panels mini panels

00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:04,950
view modes views blocks it's all sorts

00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,900
of different ways in which a UX base can

00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:12,480
be represented a section of a site

00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:15,780
through a menu also works so the first

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,739
one of these things is content how do

00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:22,319
you get your content structure well

00:19:18,739 --> 00:19:25,409
drupal responds really nicely to content

00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,849
modeling you can derive content from a

00:19:25,409 --> 00:19:28,919
Content modeling exercise really easily

00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:30,569
writing down the properties of your

00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:33,749
content what sort of fields you need

00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:35,459
it's quite easy some content may already

00:19:33,749 --> 00:19:37,849
exist in your project or some may emerge

00:19:35,459 --> 00:19:40,139
from any user requirements that you do

00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:42,989
typically the content structure exists

00:19:40,139 --> 00:19:45,389
prior to the user requirements quite

00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:49,319
frequently sometimes user requirements

00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:50,639
exist prior to content structure content

00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:52,229
types can also be defined from your

00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:54,269
product and that can be a saleable

00:19:52,229 --> 00:19:56,279
product and information product service

00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:58,199
product you might draw additional

00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,249
objects in your business structure I'm

00:19:58,199 --> 00:20:01,499
not going to go too deeply into these

00:19:59,249 --> 00:20:03,989
subjects they relief for a different

00:20:01,499 --> 00:20:05,849
time in the case of Park file we have

00:20:03,989 --> 00:20:07,259
one type of content and that is a park

00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:08,909
it's the only type of content we're

00:20:07,259 --> 00:20:12,779
really interested in we'll come back to

00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:14,519
that in order to make this process work

00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:16,589
you need to have segmented your audience

00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:18,079
in some way you need to worked out what

00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:20,339
the actual needs of your users are

00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:22,079
there's lots of ways to define your

00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:23,579
users there's an entire discipline

00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:27,299
called marketing which is about this

00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:28,199
particular process and if you don't know

00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:30,029
anything about I strongly recommend

00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:31,829
picking up something like the principles

00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:33,359
of marking marketing by philip kotler

00:20:31,829 --> 00:20:35,459
which is a university textbook and

00:20:33,359 --> 00:20:38,099
reading the stuff on segmentation

00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:39,509
because it's really really useful will

00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:41,849
help you work out some stuff about your

00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:43,949
users even if you never touch it again

00:20:41,849 --> 00:20:46,109
anyway lots of different ways to do it

00:20:43,949 --> 00:20:49,069
behavioral demographic information needs

00:20:46,109 --> 00:20:52,019
service requirements geographic

00:20:49,069 --> 00:20:56,279
demographic relates to things like a age

00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:57,869
sex religion anyway an audience is

00:20:56,279 --> 00:20:59,669
basically the smallest group of people

00:20:57,869 --> 00:21:03,689
who you can communicate with through the

00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:08,129
same channel and message so those are

00:21:03,689 --> 00:21:10,349
the ways you break them up now you might

00:21:08,129 --> 00:21:12,659
come out of this process with personas

00:21:10,349 --> 00:21:13,949
or user groups are stakeholders or

00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:17,279
whatever however it is your defining

00:21:13,949 --> 00:21:18,929
this but you'll find it hard to do good

00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,279
site design good user experience design

00:21:18,929 --> 00:21:21,449
without having done some sort of

00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,819
breakdown of your audience and what you

00:21:21,449 --> 00:21:26,009
need you need to test it you need to do

00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:29,509
all sorts of stuff to get that right but

00:21:26,009 --> 00:21:29,509
there are there are ways you can do it

00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:36,910
Park file has three audiences that we're

00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:38,980
concerned about in particular an AR the

00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:40,570
tourists the sightseers the ones you

00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:43,980
want to find parks and gardens for their

00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:46,600
historical or or interest or beauty

00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,130
we've got families families interested

00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,810
in places where they can take their

00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:53,200
their kids they want they're concerned

00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:55,480
about safety and barbecues and things

00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,070
like that and then there's people who

00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,340
want to exercise so they're going to

00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:01,930
want to know about which parks have

00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:03,010
running tracks which parks are good for

00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:05,260
jogging which parks aren't good for

00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:06,430
jogging where can I go for those funny

00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:11,230
parks or the little wooden set up

00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:13,300
machines those kinds of things and the

00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,290
final item there was behaviour I've

00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,580
talked a little bit about this already

00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:20,070
behaviors are things that can be broken

00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:22,150
down to tasks and interactions I've

00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:23,650
toyed with this one a bit I think it's a

00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:26,380
fairly arbitrary distinction but

00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:28,450
something to think about examples of

00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:31,090
behaviors things like flagging content

00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:34,600
for book-marking exposed sorts to target

00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:35,980
searches social sharing links and my

00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,120
feeling is that behaviors will tend to

00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:41,470
emerge from user stories so I've taken

00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,570
there was a section on user stories

00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:46,270
which I think I've taken out and user

00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:50,260
stories are a way of describing things

00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:54,520
that a user needs to do as a as a family

00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:56,230
I want to find safe parks so that I can

00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,360
let my kids run around while I have a

00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:01,720
glass of wine that's the user story and

00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,560
you can define you can sort of

00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,210
extrapolate a whole lot of information

00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,590
from that you can place it in your UX

00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:07,840
space so let's look at how we do that

00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:11,890
we're going to do a worked example we're

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,930
going to do parque file so as we said

00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:17,140
before pop foul as a guide to parks and

00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:19,270
sporting grounds users can find parks

00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,160
which max their interests or needs they

00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:23,680
can write parks and gardens they can add

00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:27,220
parks to it so let's talk about who our

00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:29,530
audience are we've got our sports and

00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:32,890
fitness crowd they're looking for the

00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:35,140
best parks for sports for running got

00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:37,290
our families they're interested in

00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:39,730
picnics barbecues kids activities

00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:42,370
concerned about safety

00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:45,310
we've got tourists they want to know

00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:48,610
about sightseeing opportunities probably

00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:49,990
also things like public transport good

00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:51,600
chance the tourists don't care about

00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:56,350
whether or not they can take their dog

00:23:51,600 --> 00:24:00,130
unlike families so we can represent that

00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:09,340
fairly easily we're just personally but

00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:11,950
sorry we can basically just draw four

00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:14,410
boxes three boxes three Gatland account

00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:16,000
Chris three boxes the family audience

00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:18,490
the tourists audience in the sport and

00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,660
Rec audience we've sort of said what

00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,970
they're interested in family adding

00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:23,530
sightseeing places to stay we've also

00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:24,520
documented what entity type they are

00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:29,890
because we're going to build it in

00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:33,010
Drupal next we've got our content and

00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:34,300
now we're looking at parks so a really

00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,830
rough description of a part because it's

00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,320
got a title and a description and a

00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:39,850
location because we know a little bit

00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,800
about our users we can also say it's

00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:44,770
going to have some way of classifying it

00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:46,120
we need to know whether it's good for

00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:48,130
sporting activities or sightseeing

00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:49,240
opportunities or family activities we

00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,350
haven't really defined their taxonomy

00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,270
yet but we kind of know what these are

00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:55,030
going to be anyway let's try and put

00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:58,210
this into a user space we start with a

00:24:55,030 --> 00:25:00,040
really basic Park you expose we're going

00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:02,980
to stick in our Park parks represent a

00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:05,320
garden and then we're going to add a

00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,120
task this is a user story this is kind

00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:10,900
of the glue that holds it together the

00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,310
behavior a user can search for parks hey

00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:16,180
I do have a bit on user stories how

00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:20,800
about that the user story is as a role I

00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:22,810
want gold desire so that benefit as a

00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,640
member of a family I want to be able to

00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:27,850
find safe parks so I can have a glass of

00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,100
wine so there it is there's a user story

00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:31,330
if you're doing agile development this

00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,380
ties in really nicely with our job

00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:35,470
because all of a sudden you've got user

00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:36,820
stories to find however there is a bit

00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:39,430
of an assumption here there's an

00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:42,130
assumption implicit in this task what

00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:44,620
does the user searching for why is the

00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:47,560
user searching so far all we've really

00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:49,530
done here if we translate this into part

00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:51,670
of our site is described a search page

00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:53,549
so we need to go back to our users and

00:25:51,670 --> 00:26:00,610
really find out what they're looking for

00:25:53,549 --> 00:26:02,110
so let's just recap on our audience here

00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:05,370
are the identifying characteristics of

00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:08,830
those groups family adding sightseeing

00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:10,419
sports or exercise these can map really

00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:13,120
nicely to a Drupal vocabulary we can

00:26:10,419 --> 00:26:17,620
call interests so let's add that to our

00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:19,720
diagram so now it's changed a bit a user

00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,070
can search for parks by interest we've

00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,840
added the interest an interest

00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,879
represents an activity to be undertaken

00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,120
at a park and we've just noted that it

00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:31,269
set taxonomy term we've also renamed our

00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:33,970
space find by interest and because we've

00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:35,259
done it this way because it's Drupal we

00:26:33,970 --> 00:26:36,570
can start to see the way in which we're

00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:39,070
going to build these relationships out

00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:40,929
so the park is a content type the

00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:48,850
taxonomy is an interest and really

00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:50,320
simply that's a term reference find

00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:53,259
parks point should interest makes a

00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,639
really good section for our website we

00:26:53,259 --> 00:26:56,620
might change the name of the menu item

00:26:54,639 --> 00:26:58,269
ultimately because maybe that's not

00:26:56,620 --> 00:27:00,970
quite the right term for what we're

00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:02,950
trying to do but given the basis of

00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:06,580
hammer so it works what to me to do this

00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:07,570
makes a pretty good home page I'm not

00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:11,169
going to go into too much detail about

00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:13,570
how you might implement this but once

00:27:11,169 --> 00:27:18,519
you start fleshing it out you might

00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:19,960
decide on a list of teasers and an

00:27:18,519 --> 00:27:21,399
interest drop-down that's pretty

00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,929
simplistic and I realized that probably

00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:26,919
wouldn't solve the problem that we're

00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:28,240
trying to solve here but with that UX

00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:32,019
space you can go and develop something

00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,669
more fully there's other potential user

00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:35,230
spaces we might want with Park file as

00:27:33,669 --> 00:27:37,240
well we probably going to look at

00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:39,340
geographic search geolocation finally

00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:40,720
parks near me get the information from

00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:43,419
the browser will get the user to put it

00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:46,480
in we want to look at user spaces for

00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:48,159
contributed parks we might want and look

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,919
at user spaces for social touch points

00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:52,779
or favorites or ratings we can determine

00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:56,529
some of this stuff from from what we've

00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:59,309
got out of our user research so there's

00:27:56,529 --> 00:28:01,769
the user centered design part coming in

00:27:59,309 --> 00:28:05,360
you can go back and iterate over the

00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:07,370
this process anytime you like

00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:10,730
anyway i fleshed it out a bit more for

00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:12,890
you so here are for user spaces find by

00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:15,049
interest find by location view parks and

00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:19,040
manage parks it's not a complete diagram

00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:22,100
but it's getting there find by location

00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:24,350
uses location taxonomy it's similar to

00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,480
find by interest maybe we should combine

00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:28,880
them looking at this look looks to me

00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:33,440
like they could well be combined that's

00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:35,330
good combine them and drug in we've got

00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,610
a specific user space for viewing a park

00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:40,160
this is like your node view page for a

00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:42,260
park you can see details of the park you

00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,790
can rate the park a user can review

00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:45,980
details of the park and a user can share

00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:47,690
the park through social media alright

00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,760
we've got some more questions we can ask

00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,500
what is the ratings axis what are we

00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:56,990
writing we probably need to do more work

00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:59,299
here that's fine go into it add to

00:28:56,990 --> 00:29:02,750
favorites potentially implies five-star

00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:05,150
social toolbar who knows finally you've

00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:07,400
got managed parks here is where you can

00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:09,679
add a new park you can claim an existing

00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:13,669
park you can look at parks that you've

00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:18,350
already worked on can both of these be

00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:27,260
done from the same screen maybe maybe

00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:29,000
not try it out with aux space like that

00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,980
you can start to translate those into

00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,970
wireframes or site sections or builds

00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:36,950
fairly easily building it and rippled in

00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:42,890
is the hard part and that's for you to

00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:44,419
work in another session alright so quick

00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:46,850
review you make strategy for Drupal

00:29:44,419 --> 00:29:48,770
sites there's some common pitfalls and

00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:50,059
user centered design and you can

00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:52,070
overcome these if you really take a

00:29:50,059 --> 00:29:53,090
unified approach to it and the trick

00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:54,530
here is to make sure that you're

00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:56,840
including the way Drupal works in your

00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:59,419
process so you can start with the user

00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:01,970
centered design activities I a research

00:29:59,419 --> 00:30:03,740
content modeling and then try and move

00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:07,400
to these together by documenting them in

00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:08,780
UX spaces I find turning the UX places

00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:12,500
into wireframes is a really good next

00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:14,929
step because that results in a and a bit

00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:16,640
more of a clear build idea but you don't

00:30:14,929 --> 00:30:18,440
need to do that if you've you can relate

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,400
them in your mind your head

00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,300
then you can just build it you can sit

00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,190
down with the Drupal site you could

00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:26,370
start building maybe you've decided

00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:28,530
you've got four sections you need to

00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:29,850
build so you build the sections you make

00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:30,800
sure you can accomplish the tasks and

00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:34,110
the sections of the tools you've got

00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:35,820
cool maybe you decide you want find by

00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:38,220
location to do a whole lot more break it

00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:43,110
out into a separate space put new UX

00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:47,390
spaces inside it make them blocks that's

00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:47,390
it thank you very much 33 minutes

00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:22,700
hmm yeah so your question was when do

00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:27,350
you add the authors you mean the authors

00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:30,980
of the content as an audience well it

00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:32,120
depends I guess your authors are either

00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:34,040
going to be creating content for the

00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,240
audience or it'll be user-generated in

00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:37,580
which case they're part of the audience

00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:42,830
so I generally wouldn't personally

00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:45,320
include an authorial concept unless i

00:31:42,830 --> 00:31:48,520
was looking at working on the the user

00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:51,260
experience of the authoring process yeah

00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:52,400
which was probably perfectly valid but I

00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:54,230
haven't actually come across a project

00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,450
yet where that was a really strong

00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:59,150
requirement and I think partly because

00:31:56,450 --> 00:32:02,210
as time goes by Drupal's authoring tools

00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:04,820
slowly get better so even though people

00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:05,960
complain about them a bit every time

00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:12,650
there's a minor improvement it kind of

00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:18,920
shuts them up for a while yeah

00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:19,940
absolutely yeah and I think if you if

00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:22,190
you look at this particular diagram

00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:23,420
there's a managed Park section now

00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:25,520
there's that is kind of four authors

00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,140
we're sort of assuming in this site that

00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:28,640
we're going to have authors creating

00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:32,120
content they're going to be the actual

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:33,650
users editing our parks so there is some

00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:36,980
consideration of that there but only in

00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:40,120
terms of them as an audience with

00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,120
authorial capabilities

00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:11,800
yeah so the question was basically if

00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:13,960
you're making changes to you to you to

00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:18,640
design or your your implementation to do

00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:22,420
a B test it in a perfect world yes you

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:24,730
probably should i'm fairly data-driven

00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:26,410
when it comes to users i like to

00:33:24,730 --> 00:33:28,990
actually see what they're doing and i

00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:30,250
like to know that some that are the

00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:34,090
assumptions we make about them are

00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:37,030
actually true because i usually find

00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:40,060
that they're not almost uniformly

00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:41,410
they're not one of the one of the first

00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,090
things that I usually find by the site

00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:45,190
is that the audiences that are defined

00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:47,290
by the people who who are making the

00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,790
site or commissioning the site are

00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:50,080
actually completely different from those

00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:52,570
people who use it the way people

00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,010
self-identify is different and a/b

00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:56,140
testing falls into the same same

00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:57,790
category you might think a change is

00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,440
really good you might decide that

00:33:57,790 --> 00:34:02,110
combining interest in location is really

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,240
good but if you're actually able to test

00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:05,920
that properly when you do it that

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,020
definitely tells you with your right or

00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:10,360
not which is ultimately more important

00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:12,480
in this process does that answer your

00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,480
question

00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:34,539
I think both a valid also a lot of tests

00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:37,119
produce inconclusive results in my

00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:39,069
experience especially on sites that

00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,649
don't have a lot of traffic it's very

00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:45,579
hard to get does everybody here know

00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:47,829
what a standard deviation is if anyone

00:34:45,579 --> 00:34:49,929
doesn't it's basically a standard

00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:52,869
deviation on a set of results from a

00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:54,249
test tells you whether or not the the

00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:57,220
result that you got was actually

00:34:54,249 --> 00:34:59,380
significant in terms of the group and

00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,819
with very small groups of people you

00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:06,130
tend to get really wide standard

00:35:00,819 --> 00:35:08,049
deviations so you find that the lot of

00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:09,579
the time you can't draw conclusive

00:35:08,049 --> 00:35:11,249
results from your tests even if you

00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:13,089
looked at a graph and it looked like

00:35:11,249 --> 00:35:15,160
everything on you know there was a

00:35:13,089 --> 00:35:16,900
certain thing they might all be inside a

00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,460
standard deviation which means no

00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,839
statistical difference between them in

00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,950
actual fact maybe you've made a change

00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,420
and it hasn't made any difference at all

00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:26,769
you might retest in three months get a

00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:28,180
different result so that's my experience

00:35:26,769 --> 00:35:30,599
with it anyway other people might have

00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,599
different experiences

00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:23,170
so the question was how do we decide

00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,849
when when to use which part of Drupal or

00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:29,080
custom development based on the design

00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:33,150
yeah I think we have a lot of arguments

00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,150
about that definitely where I work

00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:38,650
previousnext uses a uses an affiliate

00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:41,440
I'll development method where developers

00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:45,790
get a high degree of input into the way

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,320
in which they solve problems so we

00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:50,320
frequently have arguments about how best

00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,790
to actually implement something I think

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,830
the thing with Drupal is there's often a

00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:56,080
simple solution to something and you

00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:59,440
should always try the simple Drupal

00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:02,859
solution first before you before you go

00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,390
off and try and do it yourself but

00:37:02,859 --> 00:37:05,859
there's kind of a gray area in the

00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:08,109
middle where the simple solution almost

00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:09,670
works and that's when you have to start

00:37:08,109 --> 00:37:11,500
making business decisions and get the

00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:13,630
business owner in to work out whether

00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:17,680
they want to spend a week doing the

00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:19,570
custom thing will get the get the thing

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,130
that's almost what they wanted but it's

00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:23,440
a bit different that's the only real way

00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:24,640
I know to solve that problem because

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,200
you've got to find a way of decide to

00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:28,270
signing it some way if it's your own

00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,560
time maybe if it's my own time I might

00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:31,510
sit there and write the custom thing

00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:33,180
just for out of interest but people

00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:36,180
don't tend to want pay for that sadly

00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:36,180
yeah

00:37:56,030 --> 00:38:00,810
yeah good question the question was how

00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:02,580
do you how do you actually make the

00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:04,500
relationships between UX Pacers work

00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:06,360
from a from an end-user perspective when

00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,550
they're on the site or in the app I

00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:10,110
think it comes down a lot to sort of

00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:12,840
create a problem solving in that case

00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:14,640
sometimes an overlapping user space in

00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,710
the case of the diagram is up on the

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:19,770
screen really just represents that that

00:38:16,710 --> 00:38:21,000
Park is featured in all of them what

00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,560
that might mean is that when you're

00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,360
looking at a park you might provide a

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,500
set of contextual tools that link

00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,570
through to all the things you might want

00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:30,360
to do in a park maybe filtered down by

00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:32,880
what the user wants to do if the user

00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:35,340
spaces are wholly contained then you can

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,260
look at maybe having a block that fits

00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:40,110
with another user spaces so you can

00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:42,090
correspond to user space to a block you

00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:44,010
might define a whole kind of ratings

00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:46,680
user space which you can then insert

00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:47,670
into other spaces there's no real I

00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,970
don't really have a shorthand for that

00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:52,440
at the moment but it'd be easy to do but

00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:56,070
I think it's a creative problem-solving

00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,300
task when you see an overlap sometimes

00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,220
the reason for the overlap in my

00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:03,900
diagrams is merely to keep everything on

00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:05,070
one page because it's easier to see

00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:13,760
everything on one page than it is on

00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:13,760
five pages or for any other questions

00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:33,950
sorry before i go i'm just going to do a

00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:36,309
quick plug for 42 buffs there's a link

00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:38,539
data Bob 345 in the lady penrhyn room

00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:44,390
and Drupal government tomorrow morning

00:39:38,539 --> 00:39:49,299
and rape my session on Sydney 2013

00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:49,299
