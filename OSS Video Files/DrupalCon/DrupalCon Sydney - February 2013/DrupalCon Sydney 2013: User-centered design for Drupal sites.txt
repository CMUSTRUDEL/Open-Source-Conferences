Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: User-centered design for Drupal sites
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	Drupal gives us a range of powerful tools for structuring and presenting content, but relying on these can produce bland, list-driven websites. How do you structure a site to get the benefits of Drupal's content-first tools, while still producing a first-class user experience?

This session introduces an approach to planning Drupal site build's based on techniques from user centered design, marketing and consumer research, and content-first development principles. This approach has been evolved over seven years of Drupal projects, and can be followed by anyone with a basic knowledge of Drupal.
