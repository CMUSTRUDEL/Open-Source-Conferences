Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Improving your responsive workflow with style guides
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	Whether it be responsive web design or new emerging techniques that allow us to create experiences for multitudes of new devices, one thing is certain... our workflows need to change.

Many of us have started adapting our processes by doing things like scrapping mockups and designing in the browser, but there is one step in the process often left unconsidered. Style guides.

Traditionally style guides have been considered time consuming "nice to haves" only delegated to the biggest of projects. But as we shift from designing "pages" to designing systems, the way we communicate our designs need to make this shift too. By designing with living html/css style guides we can present all the elements of our systems, without creating multitudes of time consuming mockups. They not only help clients visualise the components of their systems but also help designers and developers to work together in creating truly future friendly experiences. You may be thinking "this all sounds all well and good, but that's an extra tedious, costly step in my workflow". Don't worry, these days they can be automated.

In this session we'll look at:

How style guides can improve your workflow
What are the different uses of style guides
The difference between style guides and pattern libraries and what we can learn from projects like Bootstrap and Foundation.
How your current workflow may need to adapt to make the most efficient use of style guides
How designers and developers can work together using style guides (hint: it involves acronyms like OOCSS/SMACSS/BEM)
How this can mostly all be automated and add no extra time to your projects (it might even save time).
This will be based on previous work I have talked about including:
Future Friendly Style Guides: Blog Post
Future Friendly Style Guides: Presentation from "What Do You Know"

It will be updated for the current state of the industry and go into more detail.

thanks for that um so yeah welcome to

00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:13,410
improving your responsive work play with

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:16,890
style guides it's a mouthful the reason

00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:20,039
I'm focusing specifically on style

00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:21,720
guides today is I think I gave it who is

00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:24,990
here at last dhruba down on the last

00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:29,519
year yep that's cool so not too many but

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:30,689
I am did overall talk about responsive

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,910
design but as actual code future

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:37,430
friendly design and I caught him went

00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:39,540
into how to do it like the sum of the

00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,980
slightly technical things but they're

00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:45,600
mostly an overview and then I went into

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:48,360
some of my workflow about it um i think

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,730
i've seen over a year a lot of people

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,020
doing that sort of stuff and I hadn't

00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,760
started seeing people start to go a bit

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,860
deeper into the parts of techniques that

00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,210
they were doing so one of the things

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,600
that I was doing that hadn't been

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:03,690
talking much of style guides so this is

00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,030
kind of just around that topic and how

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,280
I've kind of iterated through the year

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:09,810
and since i've been using them and the

00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,439
different challenges I've come across

00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:16,970
and different things so just a bit of a

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,799
background of me I'm work at glo digital

00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:22,860
if I sound a bit tired or groggy it's

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:25,200
probably cuz I've spent the last week up

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,829
late nights getting that launched by two

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,810
nights ago we've sort of been doing

00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:32,700
responsive sites for almost two years

00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:37,310
now so we've got a bit of a background

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:41,490
in trying new things I mean this is very

00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:43,530
quicken and sort of hash together we cut

00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,180
down a lot of features so if you do go

00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,259
on to this and see any bugs let me know

00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,670
because we're trying to like iterate

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:49,470
really quickly on it but we want to just

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,509
get something out there that's kind of

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,130
what I'm seeing a lot of people do in

00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,259
responsive design is making it more

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,090
collaborative more iterative and agile

00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,930
sort of focused whether or not you get

00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:04,040
it out early or not so I guess I think

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:07,680
we'd all believe that the web is

00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:10,849
inherently fluid I think we've kind of

00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,550
all started to understand that um

00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:18,860
responsive call that

00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:22,270
or adaptive or flexible I mean you can

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,270
come up with so many different names but

00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:28,430
basic factor is we can't control web

00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:29,660
pages and if you're in Jason's talk ESO

00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,630
morning you kind of would understand

00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:34,850
that he's had started to talk about that

00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:37,370
sort of area we I think we kind of get

00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:39,890
that now but um designers don't really

00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:43,220
like this it's sort of mock-ups as the

00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:45,890
liberals don't really work unless you're

00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,150
a masochist in terms of you have to

00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,190
actually create if you're going to do

00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,870
mock-ups for everything to say like six

00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:54,350
different screen sizes you're creating

00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,550
them all up and then you can't take them

00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:58,070
all the quiet and then they're like I

00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,760
don't like this font or this color and

00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:00,800
then you got to go back through all

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,300
these PSD's and different things and try

00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,910
and change them all I think we're

00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:07,370
already getting to that point but the

00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:08,810
other thing is from the technical

00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:12,200
perspective people still just thinking

00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:15,140
of those responsive web design but it's

00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,720
more than just that sort of thinking

00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,310
it's not just our works them desktop and

00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,350
kind of would just make it adapt a

00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:24,410
little bit feech sort of thing it's more

00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:29,239
than just fluid grids flexible images

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:32,090
and media queries I think it goes back

00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,650
like sure you've heard all this sort of

00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:35,570
stuff before but it goes back to the

00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:38,270
side of the web and there's a really

00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:41,150
good quote on the power of the web is in

00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:43,040
its University universality accessed by

00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:46,459
everyone regardless of disability is an

00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,709
essential aspect now in eases were there

00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:54,190
universality does anyone know where who

00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:59,930
this made this quote right it was sorry

00:03:54,190 --> 00:04:01,610
he's been around last few days yeah so

00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:03,830
yeah he said that from the beginning

00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:08,780
like it's it's about using this verse

00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:12,140
ality so I'd rather think of what we're

00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:14,030
doing with design and web as a universal

00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:16,070
system that we're building with a

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,250
consistent and experience it pulls that

00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:21,260
all together so we're designing systems

00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:25,130
not pages it's exactly what Jason said

00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:26,790
yesterday and the other part of

00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:29,490
designing systems

00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:32,400
and it's what so we're not controlling

00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,980
the pages but we are creating the part

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,930
that we can sort of bring together is a

00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,510
consistent experience and I Jason

00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:42,240
mentioned giving things meaning and

00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:45,690
hierarchy and things like that but I

00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,880
think there is a sort of a method to

00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:51,330
creating this system and creating this

00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,040
consistent experience and so there's two

00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:55,970
main things that are at the core of

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,220
creating just like a system what I think

00:04:55,970 --> 00:05:01,980
part of it is content and Eaton's talk

00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,330
did anyone go to that yesterday yeah so

00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,740
if you haven't seen that go check that

00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:10,410
out as well that was this is like maybe

00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:11,910
one other part of to do with that like

00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,750
so here you cover the content I'm kind

00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:14,610
of going to go on the design side

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:17,520
creating a system but that was really

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:19,350
good in terms of content I'm so you need

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,590
to create useful structured consistent

00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:24,510
data that's sort of I mean that's all

00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:26,100
part of like I'm doing usability a user

00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:27,240
experience stuff all through that

00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,060
content as well because if you've

00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,410
structured your content well that's what

00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,640
it provides the meaning and everything

00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,680
as well and then you know what you're

00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:36,480
meaning you need to get across in your

00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,850
design you don't just come straight out

00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,740
of it with design you've thought a lot

00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:44,430
through of your content before you sort

00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:48,600
of doing too much with you design now

00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:50,610
mention design here the second major

00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,620
thing with the system it's not just

00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,230
typography and color and layout but

00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:57,660
actual visual hierarchy of things and

00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,430
that all top of typography color and

00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:01,800
layout also to come together as part of

00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,480
visual hierarchy and then the

00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,160
interaction with between different

00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,890
devices and things as well as also going

00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:12,900
to change but you still want it to be

00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:15,000
sort of very similar like people these

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,970
days like they've talked about we've

00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,770
talked about on people going looking at

00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,630
for a holiday on an iPad and then going

00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,160
to booking in on a computer if they go

00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:24,930
to between the two things and they're

00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,400
completely different experiences they're

00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:28,140
going to find that a lot harder whereas

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,880
if you can create consistent of

00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:33,330
experiences they go between the two or a

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,540
phone to a desktop or vice versa that

00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:38,460
they kind of if you can already know

00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,729
like what you're expecting from

00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:44,519
different things it's a lot easier

00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:47,610
so in terms of my design process I just

00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:49,529
give you quick overview I sort of start

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:55,529
with one of the things I start with is

00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:58,289
atmosphere I have like the deliverable

00:06:55,529 --> 00:07:00,300
is style tiles but I kind of experiment

00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:02,279
with a lot of things pattern sheets is

00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,749
what i would call developing little

00:07:02,279 --> 00:07:05,129
components that were going a website in

00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:07,379
photoshop or something like that just to

00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:09,239
try and try things out and then I'm I

00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:11,069
say don't create mine up mock-up

00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:12,539
sometimes I'm just like I really want to

00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:14,629
figure out what it might everything

00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:16,649
might look like in this one thing I

00:07:14,629 --> 00:07:18,599
don't show any clients any of this stuff

00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:23,129
but I do it for myself just to be able

00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:25,529
to like get my head thinking right so

00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:26,849
that's kind of a way around it it's very

00:07:25,529 --> 00:07:27,959
dangerous so if you go and start showing

00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:29,729
clients that because and they kind of

00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:31,229
expect is that things but then you can

00:07:29,729 --> 00:07:33,239
pull out the patterns from that and pull

00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:34,529
out things from those things the colors

00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:36,689
and stuff you like and put them into a

00:07:34,529 --> 00:07:39,360
start-up and then that's what you can

00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:41,669
present to a client as an atmosphere now

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,529
the design structure now those

00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:47,689
structuring the screen and the

00:07:43,529 --> 00:07:52,469
components of your website so through

00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:56,219
all your content strategy and usability

00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:58,110
stuff earlier you kind of would already

00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:59,279
have an idea of how users going to flow

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:01,439
through website what sort of content

00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:04,229
they're beginning to but then you need

00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:07,110
to like start structuring like possibly

00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:11,669
layout or different like wireframes and

00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:13,649
things like that I kind of go off start

00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:15,539
with sketches of things and then if

00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:19,229
deliverable to a client i'll give them

00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:22,019
sort of a gray box HTML wireframe that

00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:24,479
they can actually see at different sizes

00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:25,829
i might send it to them in say one of

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,029
those like responses ideas or something

00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:28,589
like that so they can sit there and

00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:31,769
because they don't really do the whole

00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:34,349
browser accordion we all do they kind of

00:08:31,769 --> 00:08:36,149
can find it easy if they go they want to

00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:40,550
just hit the iphone or ipad which is

00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:43,550
horrible but that's what they do and

00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,550
then

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:51,009
when they are then combining them all

00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,509
together with prototypes so you taking

00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:54,610
the atmosphere you taking that structure

00:08:52,509 --> 00:08:59,649
and it sort of combining it all together

00:08:54,610 --> 00:09:01,660
but at this stage you kind of it can get

00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:03,189
a bit messy you sort of I do a lot of

00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:04,209
designing the browser that's because

00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:06,279
I've got all these other things that

00:09:04,209 --> 00:09:08,170
I've done before this that can help me

00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,790
design in the browser I'm not designed

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:11,199
from scratch I've got like an atmosphere

00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,240
I've got structure and then I start

00:09:11,199 --> 00:09:16,420
pulling it together but then trying to

00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:19,120
keep things efficient and consistent

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,649
like once you can sort of create a

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,649
couple of pages in a prototype but if

00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:24,819
you have to start replicating stuff out

00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:30,399
sometimes if you're not careful it can

00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:32,860
get a bit messy so I've thought how do

00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,290
we design efficiently and how do we keep

00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:41,499
it sort of consistent and that's where

00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:42,939
I've come across style guides so I think

00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:45,730
a lot of people would have heard of

00:09:42,939 --> 00:09:47,379
style guides but they're not just like a

00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:49,029
cut-and-dry thing like I'm going to make

00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:52,689
a style guide like what sort of style

00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:54,069
guide are we going to do like so a lot

00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:59,160
of people would have just be thinking if

00:09:54,069 --> 00:10:01,839
so does is like for brands so say

00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,490
MailChimp has a really good one it's

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,579
just their brand and it's got the logo

00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:09,459
how to use their logo typography and

00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:11,259
stuff but more so just as their brand

00:10:09,459 --> 00:10:15,430
not like how to use all across the web

00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:18,430
sites just specific basic stuff and like

00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:20,170
what people have sort of who has the

00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,699
idea of like a style guide is kind of

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,470
like this is what their idea of a style

00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:25,300
guide has been in the past or print from

00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,920
print or anything no that's good because

00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:29,649
well most of us are from the web so this

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,660
is kind of like even those website sort

00:10:29,649 --> 00:10:34,360
of branding books and things become from

00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,639
sort of the print side of things and the

00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:39,370
other type of style guides is editorial

00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,980
a list apart has this and this is kind

00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:46,240
of where style guides came from it was

00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:47,589
like late eighteen hundreds i think they

00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,170
actually came up with style guides book

00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:53,259
how to write content and rules about

00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:56,439
actual language and how we have right

00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:58,270
things and it's good these are really

00:10:56,439 --> 00:11:03,490
useful even today on

00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:06,130
um websites for sort of specifically for

00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:08,470
editors for like just content it is and

00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,910
makes you with a web one though you

00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:12,340
would include like how to use certain

00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:16,330
tags but also the language you should be

00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:19,890
using tone of voice things like that and

00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:22,150
then there's coding ones as well which I

00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:24,220
sabar has a really good example they've

00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:26,470
included like their javascript CSS HTML

00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,510
or their coding standards so if people

00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:30,130
come onto the team they can sort like

00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,630
it's sort of saw gods for developers

00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:34,600
that they can come in and understand how

00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:37,630
to do that um you might have even seen

00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:38,860
our own one the Drupal we have our

00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,510
coding standards and that's that's

00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,360
basically a star go for all that code

00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:45,970
and I think for most of it we that works

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,790
pretty well but that's still not the

00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:50,110
type of style guides I'm talking about

00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:55,600
what I'm actually talking about is unit

00:11:50,110 --> 00:12:01,270
easier interface style guides so has

00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:04,360
anyone seen the bbc's gel this is

00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:06,940
probably like the most thrown out there

00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,550
like everyone uses this example as a

00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:12,730
year user interface style guide it's

00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:14,650
because it's really good like it is they

00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,090
cover a lot of stuff they even put touch

00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:19,150
some kind of boy stuff in there their

00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:21,130
goals like a lot but it's also the thing

00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,510
that stops other people creating style

00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,040
guides because they're just like holy

00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,570
crap like how am I going to create

00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,750
something like that my size to nowhere

00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:30,340
near that big I don't need this so I

00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:34,080
thought what are some other examples

00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,080
that people are sort of more used to

00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:39,940
actually there's another point the other

00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,020
thing I thought about that was they

00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:47,560
caught at a global experience language

00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:50,680
and so I thought about what I was very

00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:53,410
earlier and sort of global that kind of

00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,690
sounded it's very similar to Universal

00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:59,320
same sort of meaning and got we're

00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:03,850
looking at a universal experience and

00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:05,350
it's also language and system by Oxford

00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:07,440
Dictionary language is a system of

00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:11,630
communication used by a particular

00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,740
country or community so

00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:15,870
when I was thinking about style guides

00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,240
to a design system it's kind of like the

00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,580
dictionary for a language is sort of you

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,740
to sort of understand how language works

00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:24,150
if you want to find out a word go look

00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,560
in the dictionary but if you want to

00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,510
understand how a component of the

00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,670
website works what if we had somewhere

00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:34,230
to go to understand what its purpose was

00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:36,420
and what it was useful so the other

00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:38,660
examples of these that people are sort

00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:42,089
of more used to is things like

00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:44,400
foundation has anyone heard of span

00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:46,260
Dacian for anyway yes so it makes it

00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,240
really easy to put together like a

00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:51,990
responsive a basic responsive website

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,820
and they've done really well and

00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:56,339
documenting it all but they've got

00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,440
they've also thought through how to pull

00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:01,110
apart all these components how do people

00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,400
can reuse them and it makes it does make

00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,290
it really easy to build stuff quickly

00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,790
and sometimes I've in the past have used

00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:07,980
this for doing the wire framing stage

00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:10,140
it's really useful for if I still try

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,050
tend not to use it for my any actual

00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:16,200
site there's one I don't know people

00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:19,410
have heard of this one before bootstrap

00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:22,380
is anyone does anyone yeah this one's

00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:25,020
it's just crazy and I like both of them

00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:27,900
are both massive libraries that people

00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:29,040
get a lot of use out of but I daresay if

00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:32,040
you went to the site and there was just

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:35,640
a bunch of stuff on page like use this

00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:37,560
library and go look at the CSS and try

00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,410
and figure it out not that many people

00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:41,550
would have used it it's not sort of that

00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:43,050
easy to use without all the

00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:44,760
documentation that they go through and

00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:47,480
explaining how to use things and why

00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:51,780
they use it so what can we learn from

00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:53,820
bootstrap and foundation so the main

00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:56,610
thing they do is they abstract these

00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:58,380
components and then they like sort of

00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:01,770
decouple them from the layout there's no

00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:04,470
hash sidebar block there's no like

00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:07,320
actually tying components with their

00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:08,580
containers or with their layout and this

00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,610
is what you really need to do with

00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:13,440
responsive design or designing a whole

00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:16,620
system is being able to build components

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,510
that can be used all throughout wherever

00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:20,940
you put them so you don't have to keep

00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:22,740
repeating code and you actually

00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,480
understand how these components are work

00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:27,389
in different situations

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,880
so it's also a thing that's come across

00:15:27,389 --> 00:15:33,089
in these sort of methodologies of smacks

00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:36,079
our CSS and BM I'm sure it has even

00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:38,100
anyone heard of any of these acronyms

00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:42,630
anyone been using this sort of

00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:45,510
methodology yeah if you guys any of like

00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:47,459
these aren't like really rigid sort of

00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:50,699
methodologies at least that's not what I

00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:53,610
take them as but they're basically

00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:59,279
flexible sort of dry or don't repeat

00:15:53,610 --> 00:16:01,230
yourself systems they kind of all have

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,209
slight similar methodologies as baked

00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:07,560
which is basically being able to reuse

00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:09,389
stuff and try it out just kind of good

00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:12,000
looking at your designs breaking them

00:16:09,389 --> 00:16:14,579
down seeing rather than creating a

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,350
teaser and an event teaser or something

00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:17,699
and just checkin creating whole new CSS

00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:20,070
for each of those how can just extend

00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:21,240
that out and reuse most of what you've

00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,610
already done and just do slight

00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,310
variations things like that it's how you

00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:27,660
can use it so the advantage that you

00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:30,630
have of building these systems and

00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:34,139
things like well the actual using

00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:36,180
bootstrap and foundation is they solve a

00:16:34,139 --> 00:16:37,589
lot of the basic problems that you would

00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,040
come across and develop like so I need a

00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:44,060
button for this I need you know i need a

00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,079
hero unit or something like that and

00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,120
then it's like really easy for the

00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:50,069
designers to mean sort of developers to

00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,649
just go in and grab bit since and build

00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:54,750
things really quickly it's predictable

00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:56,399
and it's consistent like people that all

00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,980
use it it's like yeah just go use

00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:01,500
bootstrap and use this little component

00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,410
there and be able to do it which is what

00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,850
makes collaboration easier like I say

00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:10,350
you can test ideas quickly you can

00:17:05,850 --> 00:17:15,319
people build sort of whole apps just on

00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:17,699
bootstrap but the problem with it is

00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:19,350
they are because they're built for

00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:22,230
everyone there are very general or

00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:25,110
originally they were very close to watch

00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,760
Twitter sort of ideas were but they're

00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,950
not there's not a lot of meaning behind

00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:34,710
some of the things they don't know what

00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:36,090
your content could be and they because

00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:37,679
of this this is why I probably classed

00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:38,250
some more as a pattern library then a

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,220
star

00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:43,170
because they're not there's no purpose

00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:45,330
like no specific purpose to each of the

00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:47,580
components likes like yes a navigation

00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:50,010
element but or a navbar or there's

00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:53,370
certain things like that but a lot of it

00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:55,020
doesn't really always come across well

00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:58,670
if you're just trying to create good

00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,670
experiences for your particular product

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,810
the designs you pretty much know when

00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:06,240
you've gone to a site made by bootstrap

00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:09,090
unless they've customized it a lot in

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,850
which case usually I have to co2 they're

00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:13,890
sort of standards and like keep similar

00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:15,330
or you kind of just hack at it and then

00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:17,040
a lot of people don't really understand

00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:18,450
what's going on behind there the kind of

00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,650
disco I need this to work and then

00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:22,860
there's add their own little bits on at

00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:24,210
the end and it's those bits of the bits

00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,470
that get sort of harder when people try

00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:26,760
and come in and go why isn't this

00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:28,380
working and there's like lots of all

00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:34,350
right so it still has a lot of problems

00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:38,040
to bootstrap so what if we could create

00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:41,580
our own bootstrap so I thought about

00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:43,530
this and then the main when a lot of

00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,970
people think about their like well that

00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:46,880
documentation took a long time to write

00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:49,920
they had to figure all that stuff out

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:53,180
and you know my project isn't big enough

00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:59,430
for that sort of thing like you might

00:18:53,180 --> 00:19:01,440
like say anything I don't know say most

00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:03,180
of us here wouldn't be making like one

00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,320
page marketing sites or if they are then

00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:07,080
that's like a whole different thing but

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,880
most of the time we are building what is

00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:13,320
usually considered a system where we're

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,580
using Drupal which but the thing is it's

00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:16,770
not usually the project isn't big enough

00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:21,630
it's probably just that Skyler style

00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:23,370
guides take too long to create and so I

00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,500
thought how can we build one quickly and

00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,820
this is kind of my process that have

00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:30,630
been going through all through a year

00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:33,630
I've been trying a lot of tools and a

00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:35,280
lot of them we tried and what you would

00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:38,300
expect happen that they either were too

00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,840
slow to create in the first place or

00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:45,450
once we did create them that were really

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:47,580
hard to update or didn't stay updated so

00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,290
things like static image based our

00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:51,630
guides they're just not going to happen

00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:54,930
like creating shared screen shots

00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:56,190
doing anything in Photoshop having to

00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:58,410
manually do all that sort of stuff it's

00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:01,200
just not going to work and something

00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:03,750
like a pairs or a pattern REE I mean

00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,700
pairs with musicals WordPress but patent

00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:07,530
or something like that you sort of go to

00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:09,480
a website you put in your code and you

00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:12,300
save it and then you sort of build these

00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,040
libraries by kind of pasting it all in

00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:17,040
but then you've got what if you want to

00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:20,130
use it across things and sort of have

00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:22,020
your base stuff interact with it it kind

00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:23,250
of it's more like a copy and paste job

00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,840
as you it's almost like including

00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:29,370
snippets but you get to see what they

00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:31,050
look like then nice style sheets was

00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:33,080
like the first one that really sort of

00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:38,310
struck me is this could be really useful

00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:40,830
but mean it involves steps of your

00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:43,680
creating a template for one component

00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,610
and then you're creating the actual CSS

00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,050
for the opponent then you creating

00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,520
documentation and they all have separate

00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,530
sort of areas then you've got to manage

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,260
them all and that was actually created

00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:54,210
for use for github and works sort of

00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:57,300
well for them because I think they're so

00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:58,830
huge and they can sort of take the time

00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:01,170
to go through that but if you're trying

00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:03,570
to build a site really quickly it's not

00:21:01,170 --> 00:21:06,240
as useful and also it kind of had a

00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:07,620
build process and it was a lot of sort

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,600
of barrier entry for some people and

00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,940
that's why I kind of went across with um

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,380
patent primer which is something Jeremy

00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,690
Keith graders just a PHP script that

00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:17,130
look into file of HTML files and then it

00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:19,380
would create put them all on a page for

00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:21,450
you I kind of did my own little version

00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:23,250
of that could pattern response and then

00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,780
I made it so it actually got those files

00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:26,310
and created a menu structure so you can

00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,620
never get to it really well and have a

00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:30,390
few extra features and search it but

00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:32,700
that was sort of what I use for a little

00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:33,810
while but then even that was still

00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:38,700
getting a bit cumbersome because I was

00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:41,730
creating extra HTML files so what I sort

00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:44,550
of came to is I needed to just remove as

00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:47,010
much friction as possible but those two

00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:51,590
tools that i found that could actually

00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:54,090
do rapidstar guides and the ones that

00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:57,180
sort of came up the most where's

00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:58,680
stardock oh I use this for a little bit

00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:02,600
and I still think it's a really good

00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:05,340
tool it can actually generate stuff from

00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:09,090
Sasson unless

00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:12,780
and it actually generates a very similar

00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:14,430
way or the next one I'll show you it

00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,820
kind of creates its navigation structure

00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:19,080
of files and i'm still like that's the

00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,940
sort of thing i'm trying to work off is

00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,970
I want this system that's going to be

00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:26,990
really flexible as well so the second

00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:30,870
one of came across was Cal a star guide

00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:35,070
so that's actually just that like cali

00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:36,660
style guide com I think and this is

00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:42,000
probably the this is what i'm using now

00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:43,860
and so closest I've come to I'm actually

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,570
work the other developers also in

00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,070
Brisbane so I'm actually working with

00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:49,560
him now to try and would build off this

00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:51,780
redesign it all adding all these things

00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,160
I'm thinking about but for now this is

00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,750
probably the best thing I've thought of

00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:58,080
I still don't like the structure of how

00:22:54,750 --> 00:23:01,310
it pulls in files but the reason I like

00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:04,050
these tools is I'll give you an example

00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:05,970
so we wanted to create this part on our

00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:08,880
star guide this is straight out of

00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:11,040
Twitter bootstrap it's got the name of

00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,170
the component then it's got like the

00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,940
heading of that one particular area of

00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:17,760
component and then it's got an example

00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,170
and then it's got some code what if so

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,820
to create that you would think I'll go

00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:24,240
create either just put all that into

00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:27,510
HTML and then actually create it as a

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:32,700
separate file whereas with something

00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:35,040
like Caillat i can actually if uses what

00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,050
it uses is just straighten your CSS just

00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:40,410
above whatever you're writing you put in

00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:45,180
CSS comments and then in markdown you

00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:48,810
can write just like you could just put

00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:53,340
whereas mine else yeah so you can just

00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:55,890
write in Mike down like a h2 h3 put in a

00:23:53,340 --> 00:24:00,300
sort of description and who knows mark

00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:03,450
on here yep so it's sort of a lot easier

00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:06,570
and to sort of read and then you can

00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:10,650
kind of put in actual HTML code straight

00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:13,380
into CSS and it does make your CSS way

00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:15,630
more verbose but you would never

00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:19,080
actually use this in production CSS I

00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:22,169
use sass we just do a sort of

00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:24,269
pletely compressed version at the end

00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:25,860
and so it just stripped out all these

00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:28,460
comments so we don't use any of these in

00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:32,220
production but this can be this is what

00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:34,769
is referenced by these star draakonian

00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:37,620
and Calais and so you've got your

00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:39,210
information you've got your actual

00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:40,710
element in HTML and then you just put

00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,120
your stars below it and then you do that

00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:46,830
for all your different components and

00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:52,380
areas and so what it actually creates

00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:54,690
then is back like the example before is

00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:58,409
it sort of will output exactly that sort

00:24:54,690 --> 00:25:01,769
of information on a page I know star

00:24:58,409 --> 00:25:03,630
docker actually puts the SAS or CSS next

00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:07,740
to it I don't think that's really useful

00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:09,389
in a style guide but Cal I just will you

00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,639
don't even have to build anything you

00:25:09,389 --> 00:25:13,409
just point it at that file and it'll

00:25:11,639 --> 00:25:15,600
generate it on the fly with javascript

00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:17,309
in the browser straight from CSS so you

00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,710
can actually start loading you can save

00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:22,519
ucss reload your style guide and all

00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:25,519
your stuff will be there with components

00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:25,519
editing

00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:37,640
yes which I will get to so I thought I'd

00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:40,280
try and explain a bit more practical

00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:42,500
stuff then go back into sort of how the

00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,480
theory because it was hard to figure out

00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:48,799
the structure of hell they could make it

00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:51,260
understand it so in terms of the

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,929
advantage of this is you create you're

00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:55,280
creating energy code there's like no

00:25:53,929 --> 00:25:58,280
extra file PP not going between

00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,540
different files which means like you CSS

00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,309
is easy to read but then if developers

00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:03,020
come back in and like i like i want to

00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:04,700
just change this thing even if they've

00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,620
forgotten about that there is a style

00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,179
guide they go in and they go oh that's

00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:10,340
right and then they can see the HTML

00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:12,200
element there they can see the code that

00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:14,090
using it you can see your description of

00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,919
what it's used for and then they can

00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:17,360
understand like oh maybe I should just

00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:19,730
maybe I shouldn't change that maybe I

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,320
should create something like a sort of

00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:23,030
sub component of this or maybe I should

00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:26,990
just this is how I should use it and

00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:29,540
just remove this element you can kind of

00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:31,760
start testing things out in terms of if

00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:33,169
you're building a prototype sometimes

00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,120
you don't want to start chucking a bunch

00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:36,950
of components in there because kind of

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,480
gets messy and then it sort of doesn't

00:26:36,950 --> 00:26:41,000
always make sense where is you can add

00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,010
new components straight into a star

00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:45,890
guide refresher paid and you just design

00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:47,630
and component by itself like without any

00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:50,059
of the other stuff around it you can use

00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:56,240
the sort of style guide test out things

00:26:50,059 --> 00:27:02,140
like screen sizes and other sort of

00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,140
context which I'll go into later and oh

00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:08,960
that's a bit this is the parts also that

00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:12,080
I've been using I've sort of design all

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,940
the way up to theming sometimes I do the

00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,940
theme in which then I don't wear as much

00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:18,650
about it but if I'm passing it over to

00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:20,990
somebody to do somethi mming and we sort

00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:22,940
of start collaborating together we can

00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:24,410
kind of use the style guide he'll be

00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:26,570
like I need to make this element that we

00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:29,360
haven't sort of created yet I'll just

00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:31,340
sort of create that save it and he can

00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,950
just update it on his style guide

00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:35,690
straight away he can sort of see what

00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:37,340
I've been creating he can just grab like

00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:38,960
just like in bootstrap you'd be like oh

00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:41,030
I need that little bit of HTML here

00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,720
let's grab the HTML put in output that

00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,580
in the template

00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,530
and it all starts working sort of

00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:47,240
together to make it really easy to sort

00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:49,550
of collaborate and he can give me other

00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,890
ideas and he can go in there change the

00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:53,750
style guide just with CSS and you know

00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:56,170
if you've got a whole get sort of

00:27:53,750 --> 00:28:01,160
workflow it works really well as well

00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:03,830
and then in terms of that we're using

00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:06,050
SAS or any sort of preprocessor if

00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:08,540
you've got all these partials I mean if

00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:11,180
you just if you haven't unlike learnt

00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:13,040
any sass stuff yet John albums talk

00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:17,380
yesterday was like actually awesome at

00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:21,230
this and he sort of talk about most of

00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:22,640
SAS stuff but you can kind of see where

00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:24,620
partials come in real handy when you're

00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,540
creating separate partials for different

00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,640
components and then say you want to

00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:31,430
create that editorial style guide for

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,890
your editors rather than redoing all

00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:35,270
this stuff you can actually be writing

00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:37,400
in a separate style sheet or something

00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:39,620
all the documentation they need to know

00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,390
for them specifically and then when you

00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:44,060
need to pull out elements from this one

00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:45,440
as partials just import them and then

00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,910
it's pulling in zactly the same code

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,220
that your developers are editing so

00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:50,630
every time they change it updates on the

00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,400
editorial one as well so they know how

00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,810
they can see the different elements if

00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,920
they needed to use them which really

00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:57,530
probably shouldn't be if you're

00:28:54,920 --> 00:29:01,880
listening to ins anyway which is

00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:04,070
basically just HTML elements um so yeah

00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,920
before I more the things i want to

00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:09,620
change with this is the usability of

00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:11,270
them is still not great but that's still

00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:15,560
usable but i want them to be a bit more

00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:17,260
navigatable easy to find things I want

00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:20,120
to be able to start designing more

00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:22,370
components in the browser separately

00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:25,940
from a whole design so things that I

00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:27,080
don't see a lot of yet is contact sort

00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,880
of altering what I mean is like

00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,310
obviously screens liars and people have

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,720
been doing a lot of that but actual like

00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,980
things like modern eyes are being able

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:35,810
to turn on and off like modernizing

00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,070
classes like touch and no touch and swap

00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:40,610
things off like that so you like what

00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:42,290
can this do when it changes context I

00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:43,880
want it to be file agnostic so you can

00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:45,980
just it's all based on markdown creates

00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,630
a structure from that and then I want to

00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:49,070
be able to when i'm getting a component

00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:50,960
be able to see i just want to try it

00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:52,070
look at this one particular component

00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,200
and then you could just sort of hit a

00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:55,490
little target this component it'll go to

00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,809
another screen and only the

00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:59,570
component on the page you just keep

00:29:56,809 --> 00:30:01,490
saving you CSS sort of designing with

00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:03,650
that component give you some sort of

00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,570
things to drag and play around with it

00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:10,540
almost like a canvas is in Photoshop but

00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:14,390
with a component that's the technical

00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:16,970
like has a bit more too that's the how

00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:18,980
to document it but then it is sort of

00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:20,750
like a bunch of that's still just

00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:28,400
bootstrap they're still not alone

00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:29,510
meaning and rules around this so sort of

00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,240
start with settings and that's kind of

00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:36,050
where you base all your design

00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:38,600
atmosphere so things like typography

00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:40,010
colors base base line and then your

00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,140
comment breakpoints you can set them all

00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:44,570
in a settings file then put comments in

00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,040
with them so other developers can come

00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:48,920
along and see in the style guide like I

00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:52,010
use this variable for these colors when

00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:53,390
I need to like redo it or you like we

00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:55,160
use the elements all this sort of stuff

00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:57,770
you can put in as variables so they're

00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:01,010
accessible to developers to use further

00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:04,100
on the stove the elements anything

00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:08,080
that's just a pure HTML tag yes you can

00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:09,830
document these things you sort of I

00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,630
start with maybe on some sort of

00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:14,420
normalize if you need to comment that do

00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:16,190
that but mainly adding all this

00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:19,100
atmosphere from the settings then into

00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:20,809
these sort of elements and then you can

00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,400
actually I reuse a lot of this stuff

00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:24,500
basically from project to project

00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:26,960
because they're basically HTML elements

00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,190
and then you start your next project you

00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,260
just load up your style guide and be

00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:31,820
like oh crap i just want to fix up all

00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:34,280
this typography like you you've sort of

00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,900
changed your atmosphere and you've

00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:37,010
already got all the elements a lot of

00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:38,720
the time you start creating prototypes

00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:40,790
there's no content or something and

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,110
you're doing certain elements and then

00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:43,429
you might launch a site there put in a

00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,620
table I put something in there like oh

00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:47,179
crap we didn't even star that it sort of

00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:48,890
gives you a big inventory of everything

00:31:47,179 --> 00:31:50,240
you need to style before you do and if

00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:52,820
you've got basic stuff that you've

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,559
already included it kind of helps as

00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:56,470
well and you can just by changing some

00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,970
of your theme variables at the beginning

00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:05,370
I'm getting a bit technical and sass

00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:08,040
everyone should use sass the

00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:12,120
then the next thing I go to is let layer

00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:15,880
so stuff like grid structures and then

00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:17,440
anything besides grid maybe just like

00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:21,370
different classes that would actually

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:24,610
affect layup but mainly they all really

00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:27,040
still need to be completely separate

00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:28,390
from any sort of visit like components

00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:30,820
or elements you shouldn't really be

00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:32,350
mixing them together because that way

00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,240
you can actually it's the best way to

00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:36,460
create sort of a universal sort of

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,960
system where it doesn't nothing relies

00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:40,000
on anything you should be able to chuck

00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:43,000
a component in anywhere and it will

00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,550
adapt to its own situation not just the

00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:51,250
whole website adapts like pieces of it

00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:54,040
need to be able to do it down so this is

00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:55,680
this kind of ads in other context as

00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:58,180
well rather than just being screen sizes

00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:04,060
well how does a component adapt to

00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:05,620
different containers and sort of your

00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:08,590
kind of using the wireframes that you

00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:11,560
created earlier to create these sort of

00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:13,600
layouts or allow for you to create these

00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:17,470
sort of layouts which you'll do mostly

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,940
in prototypes and things like that now

00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:20,320
the components part is the biggest part

00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:23,470
that I work on this basically where I'm

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:26,430
adding most of my code and if you

00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:29,980
probably yet this is a very smacks like

00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:31,540
structure I know there's a buff after

00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,800
this on smacks if anyone wants to like

00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:35,320
talk about more and that sort of thing

00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:38,580
but it's really sort of helps you

00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:40,870
decouple code and build things better

00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,160
but it's really sort of where things

00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,450
start to get interesting because it's

00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:45,700
where you need to think about a lot of

00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:48,190
your meaning in your design is in these

00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:50,980
components so you were using everything

00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:54,130
we learn from content strategy stage and

00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:57,190
the sort of how the user should do

00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:58,150
things what they need from sort of

00:33:57,190 --> 00:34:00,100
different opponents like if you're doing

00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:01,810
wireframes is like big boxes if you're

00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:04,000
in gray box things is sort of saying

00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:05,380
what components need to go there but you

00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,830
haven't explained really what they need

00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:10,120
to do yet so you're kind of getting

00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:13,060
bringing down that meaning and trying to

00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:14,770
put it into specific components and then

00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,300
I'll actually sketch them out before I

00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:18,340
if I haven't already done that earlier

00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,550
like actual individual components I

00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:20,080
might

00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:25,210
sketch them out and actually put them

00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:26,470
into code so navigation elements I'll

00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:28,360
try and figure out how it's going to

00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:39,220
work at all these different contexts and

00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:40,600
then change that in terms of the first

00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:42,850
thing I sort of work out what i'm

00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,870
looking at a component is its purpose so

00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:45,970
that what does it need what's this

00:34:43,870 --> 00:34:47,620
component going to be useful and sort of

00:34:45,970 --> 00:34:50,800
what tasks will need to perform like a

00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:53,230
really obvious one is navigation so this

00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,670
is really basic broad sort of stuff but

00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:58,840
you can get very specific when it's a

00:34:54,670 --> 00:35:00,580
specific project but say navigation

00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,200
needs to allow easy usable way for users

00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:05,200
to access the content the need but it

00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:06,670
also needs to convert convey the sort of

00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,710
where they currently are on the site so

00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:10,480
they actually get a sort of context of

00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:14,290
what page there on and how they can

00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,490
navigate away or go somewhere else so

00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:19,110
that's kind of the first thing I would

00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:22,600
include in my comments at the start and

00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:24,760
then I would include I'd start thinking

00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:27,900
about context like where could this

00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:30,880
component be put where should it be put

00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:34,510
what how what sort of screen sizes does

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,800
it need to adapt to like say where

00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:38,050
should it be put like does it always

00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:40,450
have to sit like only ever put this in a

00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:43,120
banner in the banner or only ever put

00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:46,510
this summer should it have different

00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:49,030
interactions for touch devices or four

00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:50,650
if it doesn't have CSS transforms should

00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:52,630
there be no animation should be a

00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:53,980
fallback for this like all these

00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:56,410
different contexts we need to think of

00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:59,740
not just width of the screen size and

00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:01,930
like the container like say you put

00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,610
something in a sidebar but then also it

00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:05,620
could go in the footer in another block

00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:08,980
or something like that rather than doing

00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:11,200
specific by IDs for these areas be like

00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:12,640
there's like that the standard size and

00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,320
then it's like when it's I have a

00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,620
constrained class or something like that

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,960
so it like adapts to that class and then

00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:22,720
you create you like sort of allowing it

00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,580
to do all these different things and the

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,220
adaption part is like what is it going

00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:29,260
to do when it reacts to a context like

00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:31,210
how is it going to sort of change what's

00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,349
the structure going to change how the

00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:34,420
size they're going to change

00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:38,140
has a content going to change which

00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:40,210
could be simple things like maybe the

00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:41,769
teaser text gets a little bit shorter

00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:44,229
there's still a way to get to it but

00:36:41,769 --> 00:36:45,339
it's like to allow a bit more room but

00:36:44,229 --> 00:36:46,479
you've got to be really careful with the

00:36:45,339 --> 00:36:48,279
content side of things you don't want to

00:36:46,479 --> 00:36:51,670
be hiding things and not allow them in

00:36:48,279 --> 00:36:53,349
arm smaller devices and then the

00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:59,380
interactions will definitely change say

00:36:53,349 --> 00:37:02,170
on navigation so you're sort of context

00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:03,819
causes adaption and that's where you

00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:06,279
sort of thinking about as you design all

00:37:03,819 --> 00:37:08,739
these components rather than thinking of

00:37:06,279 --> 00:37:10,059
it as they like earlier on you might

00:37:08,739 --> 00:37:11,380
think of as a whole page but then you've

00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:15,400
got to think about these components and

00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:16,690
how you can build these systems and when

00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,069
you're thinking about the actual penance

00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:21,940
is it patterns that I exist safer

00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:23,589
navigation and then kind of break them

00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:25,359
like I early on when responsive design

00:37:23,589 --> 00:37:28,390
people were using select menus for a

00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:30,220
menu and it was people start using more

00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:32,200
and more but it was never really a best

00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:34,809
practice but they saw it happening until

00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:37,059
people say going no that's just crap way

00:37:34,809 --> 00:37:38,410
of doing it change how it does it like

00:37:37,059 --> 00:37:39,940
you don't always have to keep to the

00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:43,839
same convention just see try new things

00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:46,749
and try them out and so in terms of an

00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:48,880
example that I might have used with all

00:37:46,749 --> 00:37:52,119
this stuff in it it's kind of going to

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:55,119
be hard to read all that but then I've

00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:58,599
got an actual rendered an example let's

00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:02,170
say the nav bar you've got the purpose

00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:04,210
at the top and then you've got sort of

00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:06,190
few points on how all the different

00:38:04,210 --> 00:38:07,420
contexts and how it reacts this is a lot

00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:08,769
of content usually I wouldn't have this

00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:11,469
much but the nav bar is probably one of

00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:12,999
the fundamental things that you use on a

00:38:11,469 --> 00:38:14,890
website that needs to a lot of thought

00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:17,729
about it because it's going to be used

00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:21,430
differently so that's got although I

00:38:17,729 --> 00:38:23,739
left out the actual CSS there but the

00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:25,930
next and so this is how it would render

00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:28,630
so just from all that it's just basic

00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:31,450
mark down and then now above my actual

00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:36,009
navigation I've got it so you can kind

00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:37,930
of see that I've got the purposes right

00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:41,920
there and it's like on small screens or

00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:44,000
items are hidden and toggle link is

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,400
displayed and

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:52,260
and I can fund as an icon fine unless

00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:54,450
font faces not detected in which menu

00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:56,460
text is for back and then it kind of

00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:57,990
goes on to explain more stuff that's

00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:00,000
happening on the small screens but I'm

00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:01,830
sort of I you can choose whatever you

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,840
want the one one thing I've sort of

00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:05,460
started doing is bolding things that are

00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:08,100
contacts and then like italicizing

00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:10,140
things that how it adapts and then you

00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,430
can kind of go back there and understand

00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:17,480
you're thinking about how you created

00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:17,480
that sort of component hope this isn't

00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:31,200
cool and so after than that I kind of

00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:32,730
start thinking about the dependencies on

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,900
things so you might want to put as loan

00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:38,430
notes at the end of things that they do

00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:40,500
can depend on JavaScript for dropdowns

00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:44,490
or something like that you or you want

00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:47,369
to put a link to the actual partial file

00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:48,570
that it actually was created in so

00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:51,770
people can find that easily because

00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:57,780
sometimes I will create a whole nother

00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:59,190
style sheet just for the UM just for the

00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:01,680
style guide and it will actually be one

00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:03,750
big stylesheet separately with all the

00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:05,550
comments in it because that's and then

00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:06,840
you've got all your um sort of headings

00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:13,619
and it's the easiest way to sort of get

00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:15,270
it into something like that Caillat so

00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:18,140
if you even fonts or images that relies

00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:21,690
on you sort of can document in there

00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:23,400
yeah there is I'm not that concerned

00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:26,250
about because usually is not a big thing

00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,500
but in terms of smacks there's states

00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:31,080
and theme or skin or whatever you want

00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:34,710
to call it but I have a very minimal

00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:36,450
state sort of partial and it sort of

00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:38,850
just mainly includes some JavaScript

00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:41,100
classes and how they react and you can

00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:43,200
document them in however you need but

00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:46,369
not as sort of important as your

00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:50,640
component documentation sort of thing so

00:40:46,369 --> 00:40:53,130
from all this we kind of get a more

00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,440
agile workflow it sort of helps you

00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:56,430
optimize your code by giving designers

00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,390
and developers are sort of great

00:40:56,430 --> 00:41:00,780
understanding of what

00:40:57,390 --> 00:41:02,280
happening it's kind of a really big

00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:04,200
advantage is document with the site as

00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:07,800
well as like coding standards if you can

00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:09,720
do all this together and then you sort

00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,550
of file that slide away you need to come

00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:12,990
back to it to a client you can pull up

00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:14,580
the style guide that was created with

00:41:12,990 --> 00:41:16,250
that site even if it's year later and be

00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:20,370
like oh that's what we were thinking

00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:21,960
what the hell we were thinking and then

00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:24,540
you can cut but you can sort of get back

00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,890
into it or if you like build a site a

00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,210
year later you're all new developers

00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:29,100
they can come back in and see these are

00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:30,750
the coding sins we had at the time these

00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:34,020
are like the style guide for this whole

00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:36,630
UI and understand how it was built and I

00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:40,500
mean even for small sites if I create a

00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:43,470
small so I straightaway can take all

00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:45,450
those HTML elements sort of all may

00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:47,610
automatically start generating a style

00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:50,220
guide maybe it doesn't have that many

00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:51,540
components but it's got like a star guy

00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:53,580
there that you can sort of reference

00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:55,620
even like clients can reference if they

00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:58,170
want to be able to start looking at how

00:41:55,620 --> 00:42:00,710
what you're designing and then sort of

00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:02,820
seeing the purpose of different things

00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:05,940
so basically from all this we just need

00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:09,360
to know that we're designing consistent

00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:11,460
systems and experiences you sort of

00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,380
using the atmosphere in structure that

00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:16,230
we sort of came up with earlier in the

00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:17,100
design phases and the biggest thing is

00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:19,410
trying to create a collaborative

00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,790
workflow for responsive design because

00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:23,490
designers really need to work with

00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:25,080
developers a lot designers really need

00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:29,870
to know how to curb and I probably don't

00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:31,860
have to tell anyone here that we need to

00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:33,150
make the system's easy to build a

00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:35,760
maintained because otherwise that won't

00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:38,400
happen a lot of the time people just get

00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,670
impatient I find developers usually a

00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,770
very impatient with designers sometimes

00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:46,290
so being able to build these things in

00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:49,920
quickly and not have to go on and on

00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:51,780
about it is good and by building it as

00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,430
well like a lot of components I'll reuse

00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,140
across projects but then you slightly

00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:58,680
adapt them and I don't have to keep

00:42:55,140 --> 00:43:00,390
going in and changing things I'll use

00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:03,090
variables at the top of a component to

00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:04,260
like certain things if I think I might

00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:05,370
want to use it again I'll put some

00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,360
variables at the top of the things I

00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:08,010
might want to change and then I don't

00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:11,040
actually have to change any that CSS and

00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:12,660
then I'll put that all in

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,550
the style guide and so easy to just go

00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:16,950
in change it and then you've got these

00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:19,950
new components like I think the form

00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:23,220
styles on glow digital we did that so

00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:24,450
quickly and I put in I pulled some of

00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:26,550
that across from a new project I

00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:28,470
completely forgot about the forms we

00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:30,330
were about to launch site and went to

00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:32,070
like the contact page created the stuff

00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:34,080
and then it was like oh that looks good

00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:36,000
and I just I didn't have to actually do

00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:38,250
anything yet but because it all the sort

00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,750
of theming variables have been put in

00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:41,070
the colors had changed it didn't look

00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:44,100
like anything I'd done in a previous

00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:48,960
site but the sort of everything was

00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:50,550
there already done um and sort of yes so

00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,170
just remember to sort of abstract these

00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:54,390
components and think about the purpose

00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:56,750
and the context and its adaption and how

00:43:54,390 --> 00:44:00,420
they will work in your whole system and

00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:03,450
that's everything I have and it's like

00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:06,530
node 843 and that's the slides on github

00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:06,530
that you can get now

00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:48,640
yeah the theme yeah so that what theme

00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:52,180
are using to implement this stuff um we

00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:53,470
basically we tried even some base themes

00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:55,720
at the beginning when we're doing

00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:57,310
responsive stuff and everything just

00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,349
seemed to sort of stop us doing what we

00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:00,609
wanted so we basically just right stuff

00:44:59,349 --> 00:45:02,920
from scratch every time now we might

00:45:00,609 --> 00:45:04,780
pull in like template functions and

00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,930
things that we reuse or specifically to

00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:10,180
rewrite classes in Drupal but a lot of

00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:12,400
week yeah maybe we just sort of we build

00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:14,050
off a past whatever the last site was we

00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,150
pull stuff out of that it was a new one

00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:17,589
it's kind of otherwise it just it's

00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:18,670
never going to keep up with because if

00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:20,619
you're building stuff if you're not

00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:22,109
annoyed with what you built six months

00:45:20,619 --> 00:45:28,740
ago you probably not moving fast enough

00:45:22,109 --> 00:45:28,740
so it's a help yeah

00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:15,370
yeah yeah so actually I didn't mention

00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:19,240
that in terms of where how I am put in

00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:20,800
the context into the actual CSS so I'm

00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:22,420
mentioning it all in the top in the

00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,010
describing what I'm going to do with

00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:27,670
these break points but then in the

00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:30,370
actual CSS I i use the break point

00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:34,030
module with compass for each component

00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:37,450
it's usually like every time I open a

00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:39,130
nesting sort of area I will do all the

00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:41,470
back the default stuff from mobile up

00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:43,330
and then I'll start doing context so

00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:45,010
then I might do the moderniser classes

00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:48,100
and I'll do them as parents electors so

00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:50,530
dot no touch and then an urn symbol and

00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:53,020
then after that i will start going from

00:46:50,530 --> 00:46:54,540
small medium large huge screen or

00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:57,280
whatever like that but i'll put them all

00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:59,110
related to that component within it so

00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,640
I'm not creating whole style sheets for

00:46:59,110 --> 00:47:02,470
each different screen size or I think

00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:05,340
they're all in the component see kind of

00:47:02,470 --> 00:47:05,340
see them all

00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:22,420
yes

00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:39,160
yes no yeah let's go it's not a service

00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:41,650
you just it's just the github project

00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:45,610
it's just kelly starr guy yeah it's just

00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:47,200
local yeah it's written with like I

00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:50,140
didn't write it but it's live hidden

00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,970
with them like underscore and a few

00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:53,980
other different lines like a crapload of

00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:55,180
libraries in there he's used but I don't

00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,590
know how he's doing it but he's like

00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:59,320
rendering it on the fly in the browser

00:47:56,590 --> 00:48:14,040
just going looking at the CSS file and

00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:20,950
ah yes so I actually have 1 i'll try and

00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:25,240
figure out like yeah so zoomed in was it

00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:28,960
hang on sorry i think there's a zoom

00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:36,869
thing on their think this thing zoomed

00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:36,869
in and what's going on

00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,340
you

00:48:50,619 --> 00:49:00,999
yeah okay sorry go back to that page so

00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:04,269
we're still building this as well so

00:49:00,999 --> 00:49:05,410
this is actually some of our so things

00:49:04,269 --> 00:49:07,420
that you see it's loaded loaded the

00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:08,499
Stars there and see this down the side

00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:10,359
is what I'm trying to improve because

00:49:08,499 --> 00:49:14,289
it's actually only loading in all the

00:49:10,359 --> 00:49:15,460
h2s or in H ones is one big list what

00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:16,990
I'm trying to do is make it all into

00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:18,369
parents so that's what I'm trying I

00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:20,529
don't like the look of it at all but

00:49:18,369 --> 00:49:23,579
things like this colors thing that's

00:49:20,529 --> 00:49:25,900
where i start at I've actually created a

00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:27,430
sort of little classes that I put in the

00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:29,170
CSS oh that's in the comments that's

00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:33,220
actually an example that I put in and

00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:47,079
I'll be can actually open it up in that

00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:48,819
setting of my directory yeah so that's

00:49:47,079 --> 00:49:50,799
just like basically it's just in another

00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:52,720
folder of the project and it's called /

00:49:50,799 --> 00:49:54,519
style guide or whatever and then it's

00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,109
that's where that i put the actual

00:49:54,519 --> 00:49:58,930
project off github I put it in there and

00:49:56,109 --> 00:50:02,259
then there's a config GS file I go in

00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:03,940
there and I just change what CSS file

00:50:02,259 --> 00:50:06,160
it's looking at it usually it's based

00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:08,769
off I know it's got its own line so you

00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,880
do you have to go in to change it but

00:50:08,769 --> 00:50:12,039
basically you just tell it what ever see

00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,989
says fire you want to look at and it

00:50:12,039 --> 00:50:15,940
will do it at the moment you can also do

00:50:13,989 --> 00:50:18,339
like at imports in the CSS files and

00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:20,499
that's how it'll do these extra menus

00:50:18,339 --> 00:50:24,309
but I want to change the whole structure

00:50:20,499 --> 00:50:26,019
of that but so I keep out if you want to

00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:27,940
follow me on twitter already but i'll be

00:50:26,019 --> 00:50:30,430
working on this hopefully I've already

00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:32,079
designed part of it and passed it on to

00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:35,049
him so we're trying to like work more on

00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:36,940
it but you can sort of start at least

00:50:35,049 --> 00:50:39,220
using this part of it now we'll see even

00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:41,380
things like you sort of type I've got

00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:42,849
like font family base heading and then

00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:44,440
you start including things like headings

00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:45,789
I don't have a lot of meaning behind all

00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,749
this sort of stuff yet but it's sort of

00:50:45,789 --> 00:50:51,309
you've got other things like classes for

00:50:48,749 --> 00:50:52,839
they look as I put them with like say a

00:50:51,309 --> 00:50:54,249
heading 1 heading to look exactly the

00:50:52,839 --> 00:50:56,680
same because every time I've had it

00:50:54,249 --> 00:50:59,559
client was to use like I want to page 2

00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:02,259
I want to look like a h4 but I want I it

00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:04,280
should be h 2 you can do things like put

00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:05,570
that in there and just use that but user

00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:08,180
class to make it look like it but it's

00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:10,640
actually still semantically correct and

00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:13,970
things like that you can kind of put

00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:16,100
them in there and that's the sort of how

00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:18,710
generates it's got when hover over here

00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:20,990
it's got the actual HTML so you can kind

00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:22,670
of select that out I'm sort of one of

00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:25,550
the design that I've done is sort of

00:51:22,670 --> 00:51:29,600
changing that to be you're hiding this

00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:31,010
menu um and it's hiding all the code and

00:51:29,600 --> 00:51:32,420
it's just so you can start it looks like

00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:33,830
a really nice style guide and you go

00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:37,960
through and just got tabs to code and

00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:37,960
then it's got little elements across but

00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:49,670
yeah it was it sorry that was sort of a

00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:51,530
lot of yes now yeah i have seen i

00:51:49,670 --> 00:51:54,710
downloaded that actually and i was

00:51:51,530 --> 00:51:57,470
trying to look into i sorry yes I our

00:51:54,710 --> 00:52:00,050
toolkit by snug UGG oh yeah i saw that

00:51:57,470 --> 00:52:02,870
github and i download it and looking at

00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:04,370
it i I don't know if I looked at it

00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:12,710
thoroughly enough to know i think was it

00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:14,180
based off Ruby or yeah yeah it was one

00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:17,900
of those ones it kind of looked felt

00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:20,720
like it was starting to do to specific

00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:24,100
stuff will be at least for me be too

00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,100
hard to set up every time

00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:40,359
oh okay yeah yeah yeah so yeah it's sort

00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:42,369
of it's interesting how everyone's doing

00:52:40,359 --> 00:52:44,260
I mean that's what like the style doc oh

00:52:42,369 --> 00:52:46,450
he's itself running off node and you

00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:47,740
have to do a build and tell it which

00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:48,970
files to look at every time it bills so

00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:51,160
you have to go save you CSS then you

00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:52,510
build again and then reload it's just

00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:55,359
another step that I didn't like doing I

00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:58,900
mean i'm using grunt j/s as well and

00:52:55,359 --> 00:53:01,269
that's generating i just using running

00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:03,609
grunt and it's been accusing compass

00:53:01,269 --> 00:53:06,880
inside of grunt and that's giving me

00:53:03,609 --> 00:53:08,410
sort of two different settings instead

00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,029
of using configure be I'm doing two

00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:12,700
different settings in grunt and then

00:53:10,029 --> 00:53:15,069
it's creating a fully compressed CSS and

00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:16,539
it's also creating the style guide one

00:53:15,069 --> 00:53:19,990
as well and putting in a different spot

00:53:16,539 --> 00:53:21,789
so it's a bit more automated in that

00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:23,829
sort of way which are like which is what

00:53:21,789 --> 00:53:30,670
also keeps it up to date on production

00:53:23,829 --> 00:53:32,980
as well after you go yeah normally it's

00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:35,470
live it might be an older one on the

00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:37,269
glad you do to one at the moment but so

00:53:35,470 --> 00:53:39,599
you could go and have a look at that may

00:53:37,269 --> 00:53:43,829
be but don't tell anyone I said that and

00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:48,130
they stopped recording this right um

00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:49,750
yeah so what I kind of see is what I

00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:51,910
want to do with these sort of steroids

00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:54,970
is not just be for CSS either you could

00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:56,470
go create like that's why I want to base

00:53:54,970 --> 00:53:59,019
a purely off mark down and heading

00:53:56,470 --> 00:54:00,809
structures you could go create in like a

00:53:59,019 --> 00:54:06,579
markdown format just your whole

00:54:00,809 --> 00:54:08,920
documentation with code examples yeah

00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:10,630
yeah yeah well at the moment there's

00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:12,670
some weeds sort of CSS I'm doing to do

00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:14,410
that as well with like buttons and

00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:17,200
things start like oh you can do that

00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:19,660
with you do put a class in your examples

00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:21,700
with like a semicolon like hover or

00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:22,779
something like that it'll do that you

00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:25,240
can kind of go and put it in your own

00:54:22,779 --> 00:54:26,920
style guide with like this like a / 30

00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:30,039
day or something some sort of thing you

00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:31,660
can do to make it actually the star

00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:33,819
Tucker one does that I think we're

00:54:31,660 --> 00:54:36,940
trying to implement that in this Caillat

00:54:33,819 --> 00:54:38,109
one as well but yeah effectively I would

00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:39,519
like it to work on anything it doesn't

00:54:38,109 --> 00:54:41,019
have to be on CSS comments but you could

00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:42,289
point at a javascript file with comments

00:54:41,019 --> 00:54:43,880
in it possibly

00:54:42,289 --> 00:54:46,099
and I don't know it would comment you

00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:48,199
just create Starbuck JavaScript if you

00:54:46,099 --> 00:54:50,239
wanted to UM do it for anything really

00:54:48,199 --> 00:54:51,679
if you got to that sort of stage and

00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:53,029
it's because it's only gets the

00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:54,259
structure from mark down where at the

00:54:53,029 --> 00:54:57,529
moment it doesn't do that it gets it

00:54:54,259 --> 00:55:00,380
from semi file header sort of weird

00:54:57,529 --> 00:55:03,019
thing but it's getting there like

00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:03,890
hopefully if he doesn't do it and he

00:55:03,019 --> 00:55:05,119
doesn't want to do it that way i'm

00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:24,349
likejust trying find someone else and

00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:26,599
build it myself that way yeah yeah yeah

00:55:24,349 --> 00:55:28,609
anything that's sorry i sorry yeah can

00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:30,919
it does it is it tied to SAS or does it

00:55:28,609 --> 00:55:32,449
need to be or can it be used with

00:55:30,919 --> 00:55:35,719
straight CSS or less or something like

00:55:32,449 --> 00:55:37,789
that that's part of the reason i do like

00:55:35,719 --> 00:55:41,150
using it i mean and this is why i use it

00:55:37,789 --> 00:55:43,249
syntax I know style Rocco can work with

00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:45,439
all of them but like it will use it'll

00:55:43,249 --> 00:55:47,900
look at partials as well whereas a think

00:55:45,439 --> 00:55:51,380
they just started making less work in

00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:53,689
Calais but it doesn't work straight with

00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:55,429
pure sass anyway I actually generate the

00:55:53,689 --> 00:55:56,659
CSS file that's why you use grunt and do

00:55:55,429 --> 00:55:58,579
a few different things to create

00:55:56,659 --> 00:56:00,529
different CSS files but I kind of prefer

00:55:58,579 --> 00:56:02,029
it that way because who knows what

00:56:00,529 --> 00:56:04,099
preprocessors and different things would

00:56:02,029 --> 00:56:06,409
have but I want it to be as universal as

00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:08,209
possible so anyone can use it and you

00:56:06,409 --> 00:56:10,729
could just use CSS you can use SAS a

00:56:08,209 --> 00:56:12,859
more the SAS side of it is about

00:56:10,729 --> 00:56:15,739
designing components and the most max

00:56:12,859 --> 00:56:17,390
methodology but it doesn't mean that you

00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:20,059
can't do it that way and that's also why

00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:22,400
i don't use silence or comments in my

00:56:20,059 --> 00:56:24,439
SAS because i want it out put in the CSS

00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:26,449
and then if i actually want to do any

00:56:24,439 --> 00:56:27,890
specific comments that I don't want in

00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:29,119
the style guide I can use silent ones

00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:31,159
then and then they won't go into the

00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,569
style guide which is what I found some

00:56:31,159 --> 00:56:34,069
others they put everything that's in

00:56:32,569 --> 00:56:36,319
science electives in the style guide and

00:56:34,069 --> 00:56:40,880
then I'm like what the hell is like all

00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:57,930
this crap in my style guide yeah

00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:59,880
cool I know so yeah attempt two what am

00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:03,420
i showing to the client in terms of the

00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:05,099
design process um this could be a whole

00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:07,589
nother talk in itself but I've actually

00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:09,930
found it really useful I've got hardly

00:57:07,589 --> 00:57:11,609
any sort of back and forth I don't know

00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:13,230
us because like mock-ups generally they

00:57:11,609 --> 00:57:14,580
go they think of their gets one idea in

00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:16,890
the head and then they stick with that

00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:19,770
whereas I sure them bits and pieces

00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:21,150
along the way and I kind of I do a lot

00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,109
of the content strategy stuff and

00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:23,640
usability stuff with them and I'm

00:57:22,109 --> 00:57:26,040
talking through it all and a lot of the

00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,300
ideas are going into what I'm building

00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:31,020
and they're seeing bits and pieces every

00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:32,670
time it's very iterative but then i'll

00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:34,140
show them like the style guide so they

00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:35,970
see oh here's a desire atmosphere then

00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:37,290
on till you show them gray box sort of

00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:39,990
wireframes and they'll be like oh here's

00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:41,849
sort of how the structure might work and

00:57:39,990 --> 00:57:44,820
we don't even sometimes always stick to

00:57:41,849 --> 00:57:46,920
exactly that but they can kind of get an

00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:49,260
idea of what we're trying to do and then

00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:51,300
we'll show them maybe a couple of pages

00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:53,099
of prototypes if it's a bigger site we

00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:56,790
might have to show a lot of prototypes

00:57:53,099 --> 00:57:58,020
but generally I like to go if they're

00:57:56,790 --> 00:57:59,220
sort of agreeing with what we're

00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,810
starting to do and prototypes that's

00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:03,660
kind of like your mock-ups but a couple

00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:06,599
of pages and then because it's already

00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:07,770
in code we start like I mean doing the

00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:09,270
style guides to do all the extra

00:58:07,770 --> 00:58:10,920
components that work that aren't in the

00:58:09,270 --> 00:58:13,410
prototype anyway like we can create put

00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:15,780
those in as well I'll also still be

00:58:13,410 --> 00:58:17,520
working on the style guide and creating

00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:19,950
components as we start theming it up

00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:22,080
because he's the sort of from the

00:58:19,950 --> 00:58:24,720
structure phase and like content

00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:27,510
strategy even we're starting to build a

00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:29,280
Drupal site as well with not with no

00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:32,010
theme or anything because we've got the

00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:34,380
UM that data model there of how should

00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:36,540
you start be worth working and then we

00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:38,339
can bring in the theme he can start

00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:41,280
putting in all this sort of CSS from the

00:58:38,339 --> 00:58:42,750
star guide that I've been building into

00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:46,770
the prototype at the same time sort of

00:58:42,750 --> 00:58:50,280
thing yeah and then once it goes into a

00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:53,520
theme that's kind of where it also has

00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:54,250
been a bit of a downfall in the past

00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,020
with

00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:57,430
guys once we start putting into a theme

00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:59,770
and then we switch the CSS from the

00:58:57,430 --> 00:59:01,180
prototype of the theme the sort of style

00:58:59,770 --> 00:59:03,400
guide sometimes wouldn't be getting

00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:04,420
updated anymore because we'd have to be

00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:08,980
doing all this weird thing where is this

00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:12,790
way I've got like I don't know you could

00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:15,580
probably figure out something that guy's

00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:18,340
drunk and that's why it's got I'm still

00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:19,930
generating the prototype CSS style CSS

00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:22,900
and a production CSS that goes straight

00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:24,310
into the theme all in one go I'm like

00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,990
saving and it does it to all of them

00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:27,460
reloads the page and does all the

00:59:25,990 --> 00:59:29,680
different stuff and I have like my

00:59:27,460 --> 00:59:31,120
browser they're reloading it as I'm

00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:33,640
doing it I'm so it's almost like

00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:36,720
Photoshop for me but encoded so that's

00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,720
kind of how I'm doing but yeah sorry

00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:54,580
yeah yeah sometimes like smaller stuff I

00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:58,300
don't show clients much of the star guy

00:59:54,580 --> 01:00:00,220
it's usually the bigger ones where they

00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:02,620
kind of missing some things from their

01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:04,720
site that they need to see and if before

01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:06,070
if it's important to do it before we go

01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:07,360
into Drupal then they'll do that but

01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:08,620
sometimes we can we start building up

01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:14,890
Drupal and then we show them that as

01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:17,200
well but I generally the I have not had

01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:19,510
a client yet after going through the

01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:22,060
whole style tiles then go through

01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:23,890
wireframes and then a prototype there's

01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:25,420
been no major changes that happen along

01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:28,210
the way they change layout stuff at

01:00:25,420 --> 01:00:30,130
wireframe time they change design stuff

01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:31,990
at atmosphere time and they only meet

01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:34,840
tend to make very small tweaks at

01:00:31,990 --> 01:00:36,130
prototype time and so I don't usually

01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,660
have to restructure a lot of code but

01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:39,730
then even the way I do it with all the

01:00:37,660 --> 01:00:41,410
variables and components they do change

01:00:39,730 --> 01:00:44,170
things it's so easy to just pull stuff

01:00:41,410 --> 01:00:47,640
out things fill gaps and you can because

01:00:44,170 --> 01:00:47,640
it's a system it kind of builds it

01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:11,000
no no no mock-ups but the yeah like this

01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:12,320
stop yeah the atmosphere star yeah but

01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:19,760
atmosphere in the structure and the

01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:21,800
wireframes yeah yeah yeah pretty much

01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:23,690
and at the other thing that I do in the

01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,730
kind of strategy stage is I will

01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:27,800
document screens I'm sort of going into

01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:31,100
my whole workflow thing here I've

01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:33,080
actually got slides up online yeah I've

01:01:31,100 --> 01:01:34,460
talked about like the the thinking

01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:37,040
behind this on I've got to dot that

01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:40,420
magazine article that was about future

01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:44,000
friendly workflow if you look that up

01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:45,710
but that's a very basic / broad a thing

01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,720
and then I've done a presentation I

01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:50,450
think last August it's on SlideShare and

01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:52,640
on speaker deck of like a future pending

01:01:50,450 --> 01:01:54,740
workflow but I do all this content stuff

01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:56,540
which involves screen description

01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:58,490
diagrams so figuring out all the content

01:01:56,540 --> 01:02:00,470
that goes on different screens in like

01:01:58,490 --> 01:02:02,570
sort of order of meaning like priority

01:02:00,470 --> 01:02:06,080
and different things like that and then

01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:09,530
that sort of is deciding things there as

01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:11,720
well so I'm not deciding the content so

01:02:09,530 --> 01:02:13,100
that's even the wireframes is not so

01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:15,950
much a contents like rap it's like

01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:20,780
containers for content in the wireframe

01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:22,310
part of it so yeah I've just been you

01:02:20,780 --> 01:02:24,050
have to just really communicate the

01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:25,910
client on all these little points and

01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:27,020
I've found that they've had because

01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:30,110
they've had that interaction all the way

01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:31,430
along and they can I don't know if this

01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:34,820
is the way I explain it to them but I

01:02:31,430 --> 01:02:36,530
haven't had any massive problems like

01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:39,080
and then if they want to change a front

01:02:36,530 --> 01:02:40,550

01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:44,870
those different stages they usually do

01:02:40,550 --> 01:02:47,000

01:02:44,870 --> 01:02:47,900
actually being we've been ever since we

01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:50,150
been doing it we've been doing

01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:51,890
everything way faster we're still

01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:53,420
there's a project we started before we

01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:56,230
did any of this and it's still going and

01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:56,230
