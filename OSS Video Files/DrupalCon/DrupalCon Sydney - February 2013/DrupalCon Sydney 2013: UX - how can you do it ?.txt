Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: UX - how can you do it ?
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	We have all heard the term "UX" or "User Experience design" and we also know that if you have great UX, then you''ll have happy users, if you have happy users, your going to have a succesful project. But we don''t live in a perfect world, and we don't have unlimited resources. Therefore, with this in mind, we must prioritise and identify the areas that stand to gain the most from UX activities and roll up our sleeves and give it a go !

This session will give you a tool box of knowledge to get you started with your own UX activities to apply across your work.

Session highlights:
* Outline of the key UX activities
* A few case studies assessments
* An outline of the key UX project outputs (by the various activities)
* An overview of some "helpful" & "cheap" tools to make your job easier and quicker
* Discussing the traditional challenges (project methodologies, budget, team buy in) and what you can do about it.

This session is based on the presenter's own experience with UX over the last 12 years, particularly through working on sites like www.nzx.com, www.health.govt.nz, www.sorted.org.nz.

Goal: You will walk out of this session with an confidence understanding of UX, set of tools and concepts to undertake your own UX activities!

Target: BA's/solution creators, content editors, project managers, curious developers, marketing & communications team, themers, interaction designers, SEO providers.

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,310
our industry she's designed built and

managed many performative sites in the

00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:24,420
public and private sectors this makes me

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,740
consider where the user experience

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:31,320
specialists are really generalists and

00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,329

whole hour we're right ok so my session

00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:57,510
today is an intro talk about few weeks

00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,760
it's not focused particularly on Drupal

00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:03,690
but it's focused on actually getting you

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:07,290
to and seeing what UX is why we do it

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:10,140
and hopefully some tips and tricks and

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:15,600
tools actually get you started with some

00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:20,040
UX does that sound good excellent you

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:23,700
are in the right place so to get us

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,830
there today we're going to explain what

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:30,780
it is i'm going to give you an example

00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:32,939
of ux problem just to resonate actually

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,890
water does we're going to have a look at

00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:37,500
the different steps and you it's because

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:41,009
it's just not one activity its many

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,490
parts and many activities also I think

00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:47,750
it's really important to say that it is

00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,750
challenges with you eggs

00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:54,229
so Who am I who is this funny lady

00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:57,860
standing up here in front of all of you

00:01:54,229 --> 00:02:02,150
with a Kiwi accent well up and in this

00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:05,540
industry 12 years now over 12 years I've

00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:08,600
kind of bounced around a bit I formally

00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:12,350
trained as a developer and in see in the

00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:15,070
90s and also did graphic design found it

00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:18,290
quite boring then natural progression

00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:20,720
project management and then also into

00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:24,920
analysis and kind of dabbled a little

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,870
bit in data and data mining I was really

00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,600
lucky to be able to work in the private

00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:32,150
sector and the public sector to really

00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:36,080
understand different users and different

00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:39,260
needs also I think that helps me in this

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,750
role as have actually worked as you know

00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:45,620
in customer service I stood behind a

00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:47,269
counter for every set a and sunday in my

00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,510
you know and I was doing my uni degree

00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:55,630
so I understand what people want around

00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:58,760
customer service also i really love

00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:00,829
academia I've got a degree in computer

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,810
science and I've just finished a

00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:05,720
master's so I'm really interested in

00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:07,940
research and why we do these things and

00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:12,260
actually how other people have found

00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:17,360
research improving and ID theories so

00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:21,380
that's me in a nutshell also in my spare

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,579
time I am a deed keen mountain biker you

00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,140
can see on the left ear there's my

00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:27,110
mountain bike kind of purchaser an ice

00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:31,670
cliff face and my two beautiful cats

00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:34,880
queen Tash and stumpy key key supporters

00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:38,030
in my career those two cats now let's

00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:41,510
get on to something more serious now use

00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:43,010
experience and its design now what is it

00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,470
I know we've all been to this term

00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:46,730
around you eggs you know it's just

00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:51,530
another Fed is it

00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:54,110
something else well really simply it's

00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:57,590
how we feel about something you know

00:03:54,110 --> 00:04:01,280
when you go to use a website go to a

00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:05,269
shop and have that a stink oh when that

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:08,780
was really awesome that is the nutshell

00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:11,690
of UX so really simple diagram you know

00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,069
you kind of thought is terrible or and

00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:17,239
then you have an experience and you feel

00:04:13,069 --> 00:04:20,329
happy about it that's the feeling about

00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:22,820
user experience that is the feeling of

00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:24,919
where the products are still service now

00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,680
I know it's kind of a holistic and high

00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:32,930
level so we just take that down too

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:35,240
until I digital and it's simply a

00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:37,370
person's experience with the system

00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:41,449
might be a website may it be a bit of

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:45,560
software it's every aspect of that but a

00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:49,460
software though it's the interface it's

00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:51,979
the visual graphics the colors it could

00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:54,050
be a cultural using the wrong colors and

00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:57,139
it makes somebody feel not so happy

00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:58,729
about what they're doing actual physical

00:04:57,139 --> 00:05:00,440
interaction he making the click on a

00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:02,960
button here and there in the next

00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,979
buttons over here and then you're giving

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,950
them bad instructions or you might have

00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:11,660
designed a system for a desktop and

00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:15,490
you're making them use that on a mobile

00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,490
phone it's just not the same

00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:25,470
also I wanted to just look at this idea

00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:27,830
of it's about how a person feels about

00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:30,870
interacting with a product or system I

00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:34,050
think it's also important to point out

00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:37,980
that this is actually just a little bit

00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:41,430
of a bigger problem originally when I

00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:44,520
started out in the 90s I did quite a lot

00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:48,060
of work academically in human

00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:51,990
interaction and this diagram up here

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:55,460
kind of gives you the wider circle of

00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:58,050
our human interaction beyond technology

00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:02,610
see if you look at the bottom half of

00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:04,290
that circle our focus is digital and so

00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:06,150
you can see there that's like customer

00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:09,240
service and reading a line some of the

00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:11,130
examples we talked about but gaze your

00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,830
eyes up to the middle and up to the top

00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:15,930
there I think we can all resonate the

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:18,720
fact that you've rung up somebody on the

00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:22,620
phone you know maybe text apartment or

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,479
you know maybe a travel company and you

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:28,350
might not have a good experience because

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:30,479
you you know pushing please push one for

00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:33,720
this please speak what your problems

00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:37,440
about it's not quite digital but it's

00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,030
still about the experience my favorite

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,400
is door handles actually right at the

00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:46,200
top there I've had you know them is it

00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:47,639
push there is a pool so let's circle

00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:50,340
there you know what we're dealing with

00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,950
is a part a little bit it's just as a

00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,210
wider wheeled out there so it's also I

00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:56,010
think it's important just to remember

00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:58,410
that when you're dealing with your

00:06:56,010 --> 00:07:01,830
little UX problem they actually the

00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:05,630
world around us has got many usable

00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,630
there's many many problems out there

00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:13,849
now boarding on the fact that's about

00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:18,069
feelings and building the fact that it's

00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:23,090
a big world out here there are many

00:07:18,069 --> 00:07:26,630
parts to UX that you kind of need to

00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:27,979
know about so even up here I was

00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,630
building the slide and actually had

00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:31,639
other ones I want to put on there like

00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:32,990
customer service actually know how to

00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,669
deal with people and it's really

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:39,139
important but you just look up here

00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:41,090
library science information architecture

00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:43,430
what I'm meaning there is how we put

00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:46,789
them information together that's a part

00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:50,539
of us if we go to if we've got any

00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:53,419
marketers in the room market research

00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:56,150
and analytics that's really important

00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:58,069
what users have previously done on a

00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:02,650
website you know what's the behaviors

00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:05,199
can we track back and if we've got any

00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:07,460
communications project managers

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,319
directors we all know that

00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:11,300
Communications is really important

00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:14,180
because we need to communicate this to

00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:17,030
clients and then in users and then the

00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:21,169
person has to pay the bills so there's a

00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:23,419
lot of aspects to UX that you kind of

00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:25,880
need to just have a handle on just I

00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:29,180
think for my background I'm very lucky

00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:33,079
because of an able to work and some of

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:35,990
these areas but it's something you can

00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:38,500
always build on and read on and ask

00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,500
Google

00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:44,840
so I want to move on that we know what

00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:48,680
it is now we know that as many

00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:50,950
components to you eggs but why should we

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:53,360
do it when the biggest things I've found

00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:58,580
the last couple of years is actually

00:08:53,360 --> 00:09:02,930
selling you x2 product owner a project

00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:05,150
manager a client even sometimes other

00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:07,100
members in your team why do you want to

00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:09,470
do that you eat stuff it's kind of like

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:14,300
yeah we know what we're doing god I know

00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:16,220
how to build their buy books online so

00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:19,520
this slide I've actually used quite a

00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:22,520
lot externally and internally to just

00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,670
say hey guys it's about customer loyalty

00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:27,230
if you've got a happy customer are they

00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:29,900
going to use your product and service

00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:31,970
again pretty much and they might even

00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,500
tell their mom and their friend to do

00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:36,200
you know hey there's this really good

00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:39,740
site really easy use I've done it I've

00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:43,160
done it myself and for more of the money

00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:45,500
minded aspect of selling return on

00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,490
investment conversion rates if they're

00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,960
happy with the site they're going to

00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:51,790
come back and they're going to probably

00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:53,750
make the order bigger online site

00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:57,920
conversion rates you have you know

00:09:53,750 --> 00:10:00,650
building up your client base 3 I think

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,140
this is a two-way street productivity

00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:05,810
and efficiency so what I mean there is

00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:09,260
keep it online so you've got this triple

00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:12,110
site and people have maybe buying books

00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:14,930
on it and they don't need to use the

00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:16,610
feedback isn't that so you know I can't

00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:18,560
do this book transaction because the

00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,450
site has really hard to use so they

00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,839
email you well they might bring you and

00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:27,620
say oh I can't manage to get XYZ I can't

00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,110
add shipping if your site was easy to

00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:34,730
use and you understood by the user you

00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:39,410
might see a drop in those calls and also

00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:41,410
flip side for me as a user if you hit

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:44,470
the site that was easy to use

00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:47,620
it saves me time so I'm a busy person

00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:50,920
I'm off mountain biking and if the

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,949
site's really quick and easy yes that's

00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:56,319
going to be the site i'm going to use

00:10:52,949 --> 00:10:58,540
and finally happy customers well what

00:10:56,319 --> 00:11:01,839
can I say about happy customers keep

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:05,680
coming back happy heavy team that's what

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:07,209
we want we want to retain our clients so

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,000
I really recommend that that's actually

00:11:07,209 --> 00:11:12,370
worked really well those four points

00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,370
really can help you get a little bit

00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:22,290
more UX in that project and then support

00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:26,649
its importance now on change gear I

00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:29,290
actually want to talk about our problem

00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:34,689
you know let's have a look at a classic

00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:36,430
UX problem now Wellington I'm from

00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:40,240
Wellington schiphol in New Zealand we've

00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:42,879
got 400,000 fantastic City and summer we

00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,300
have events and we have music and we

00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:49,839
have wine festivals and it it's just

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:53,350
absolutely stunning it's all across the

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:55,420
city it's very diverse but I have got a

00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,550
really busy calendar and I've got lots

00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,709
of friends oh I want to go to these

00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:02,699
events with my friends and I don't know

00:11:59,709 --> 00:12:05,380
where they're located but lucky me

00:12:02,699 --> 00:12:08,889
Wellington City Council has put out a

00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:13,209
phone air to tell me where all the

00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:15,939
events are what they're about lucky me

00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:17,380
it's not i was so excited about two

00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:19,240
months ago when this came out i could

00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:21,670
put it on my phone my android I was like

00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,930
yeah I'm gonna know where to go and I

00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,930
can share my friends choice

00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:31,360
here's the bone it it's called summer

00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:36,070
city we do have fine weather in

00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,810
Wellington and you know kind of tells me

00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:40,630
the dates and kind of scroll up and down

00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:42,850
like this so oh that's quite cool i'm in

00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:49,690
date order it's kind of a bit of a plus

00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:53,490
isn't it I can refresh it oh ok I like

00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:55,750
lost bird ok I clicked on one of the

00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:58,930
when the offerings from the first screen

00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:03,120
it's telling me there is the only this

00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:06,880
is a screen like yet there's no location

00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:10,980
on there how long it's going to be okay

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:13,510
it's kind of cool just tells me about it

00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,490
I'm thinking about I might find out with

00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:18,250
a location as I might share of my friend

00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:23,140
or see how busy it's my calendar well

00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:26,980
I'll that might have a top so I kind of

00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:29,980
came up a week it's a favorite ok uncle

00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:35,140
Quebec later and compared to other event

00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:39,100
so like she by emo bad i share my

00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:42,820
friends but in facebook not all my

00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:48,460
friends are on facebook twitter movie

00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:52,120
and then miss a day what hmm how do I

00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:55,150
know where the event is how could I

00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:58,800
maybe save it into my calendar you know

00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,800
just to see if I've got a new us on

00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:08,230
mobile phone app location so i don't

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:11,680
feel like i got the best user experience

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:14,290
out of this application from the council

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,149
I was a bit disappointed I had all these

00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:20,899
high hopes

00:14:16,149 --> 00:14:23,240
this is a classic kind of example for

00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:26,500
you x it's like they didn't think about

00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:29,660
this is a mobile thing you might want to

00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:32,570
actually use it on location and as

00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:37,570
you're walking around and for me this

00:14:32,570 --> 00:14:37,570
this lovely machine is also my diary

00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:47,660
so just move on to our project stuff now

00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:50,510
that we understand what your ex is why

00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,070
we do it and we've got an example I just

00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:54,500
want to move into making this quite a

00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:56,870
practical kind of session looking at

00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,490
different activities and hope you you

00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:02,600
guys are going enough knowledge to give

00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:05,630
some stuff a go before we start there I

00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:07,910
just want to that's all not rose-tinted

00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:11,210
glasses it's actually a bit of a

00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:13,750
balancing act we'll have a look at some

00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:15,950
of the different activities but I know

00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:18,260
everybody out there we do have to

00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:20,510
balance things you know got user needs

00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,010
without technical requirements and what

00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:24,710
business constraints so know when you're

00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:28,460
in a project you've got these kind of

00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:30,980
things betting around so you need to fit

00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,560
an activity to the size and scale with

00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:36,280
your project and also to three three

00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,280
aspects

00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:45,989
so the moving parts of you x this is

00:15:41,249 --> 00:15:49,110
quite a famous concept that was brought

00:15:45,989 --> 00:15:55,799
out in the early 2000s by a guy called

00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:58,499
Jesse go now I really like this way of

00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:00,959
thinking about you x just because of a

00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:03,629
few things how it says abstract to

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,610
concrete so you kind of like the woolly

00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,589
stuff this end so left sighs the woolly

00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:12,230
stuff the concrete stuff is on the

00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:15,179
right-hand side also I like how it

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:17,189
builds on itself and this is really what

00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:20,879
you exits all the different activities

00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:22,920
and UX build on the previous activity so

00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:26,519
you kind of got a strategy we want to go

00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:28,709
let's go how big is this monster in a

00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:31,529
structure how we're going to take it and

00:16:28,709 --> 00:16:33,179
how what's our plan then a skeleton

00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:36,899
where we start building stuff out and

00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:39,929
then a surface what what's it is you're

00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:41,730
going to look like I'm not going to

00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:43,649
cover all these areas I'm going to pick

00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:47,519
a couple that I think are going to be a

00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:49,740
good starter and also they say that not

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:52,949
every project actually does all these

00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:57,720
steps it's all to do a scale in size and

00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:59,720
time and probably the only correction

00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:02,490
i'm trying to find the last two years

00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:04,829
see navigational design down the

00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,319
skeleton with the rise of things like

00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:11,130
responsive design and mobile computing i

00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:13,020
do feel that needs to come a bit down

00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:16,140
the track

00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:18,450
even move into structure because the way

00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:20,339
we design our navigation is merely

00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:22,790
fundamental it was going more

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,140
fundamental and how we do projects now

00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:28,290
but this is stood the test of time

00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:34,350
that's now what 13 years old so it's

00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:38,700
pretty a lifetime and IT also another

00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:41,490
way to think about it I've been an IT

00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:45,300
for a while now and another way is to

00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:46,740
thinking circles so some project

00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:48,540
managers and some business owners and

00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:51,570
some clients might struggle with the

00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:55,170
idea of actually strengthen your cokes

00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:57,210
go structure skeleton surface they might

00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:00,180
actually resonate more than these kind

00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:03,090
of groupings like the old kind of let's

00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:04,980
do some requirement and let's do some

00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:06,840
architecture you might actually see

00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:10,470
these tunes might work better but

00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:12,660
covertly you're actually on a war going

00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:15,390
on the strategies scope structure path

00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:21,090
but the step language might just help

00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:24,830
you start adding UX tool projects ok

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:27,360
let's have a look at our left hand side

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:30,630
so this is all the fluffy stuff the

00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:33,840
fluffy stuff is important because we

00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:36,240
need to know what the client or what the

00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,190
client really wants to approach it I've

00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:40,560
worked on a few projects now and this

00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:42,510
gets missed out and the project just

00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,860
blows up because we actually don't know

00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,360
what we're doing so you got all these

00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,250
like really inadequate people running

00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,250
around trying to deliver a project but

00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:52,570
you actually do not the purposes and

00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:54,490
then us or what money

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:57,549
and you can make this quite a short

00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:59,559
exercise so what I try to really do here

00:18:57,549 --> 00:19:03,700
is to understand what this projects

00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:06,220
about a step one you really need to get

00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,779
the right people in room and actually

00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:10,600
understand why they want to do this

00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:11,950
project what what success looks like

00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,470
that sees you might one of my key

00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:16,299
questions to ask them so what's this if

00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:18,970
this is going to be the perfect projects

00:19:16,299 --> 00:19:21,340
and you want the perfect product give me

00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:24,879
a description and this will help you

00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:27,460
right throughout your project some of my

00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:31,529
techniques is I meet with project

00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:33,549
stakeholders maybe little mini meetings

00:19:31,529 --> 00:19:36,549
work quite well if you've got big

00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:37,899
organization face-to-face look very

00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:40,360
important you can't really do this one

00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:44,289
over phone and also the government

00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:46,059
client get this statement of intent get

00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:47,889
there that's what we call in New Zealand

00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:49,330
but basic the plan what their agencies

00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:51,519
me to be doing and delivering for the

00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:54,759
next three or five years there will be

00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:56,440
the purpose in that document also their

00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:59,740
business cases they usually quite good

00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,299
to both of you so they make on top tips

00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:03,159
for actually getting that down on paper

00:20:01,299 --> 00:20:05,080
and usually it's like about five

00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:08,649
sentences what they actually want to

00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:11,580
achieve and make that know until your

00:20:08,649 --> 00:20:11,580
whole project group

00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:20,360
one of the bigger areas is user needs

00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:22,010
now the next session after me chris is

00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,130
going to be focusing on that more but if

00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:28,100
it is important to start such a big area

00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:32,150
to start thinking about it and the way I

00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:34,160
do it now the goal it's very simple then

00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,780
you need to understand the audience of

00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:40,549
what you're building for you know a vein

00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:42,470
mothers they construction workers they

00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:44,570
somebody have a really busy social life

00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:47,230
and doesn't know the locations that are

00:20:44,570 --> 00:20:50,419
of both of means that she wants to go to

00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:53,120
and the only way you're going to do that

00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:55,000
is actually talk to your users are not

00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,799
scary they won't bite your head off and

00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,559
it does sound like a lot of work but you

00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:03,590
can make it easier in cell so techniques

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,450
I've use and horses the courses sighs a

00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:07,610
budget you've got a lot of options here

00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:09,730
and I've got a few tools they're really

00:21:07,610 --> 00:21:12,710
helped to next couple of slides

00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:16,429
interviews are you talking to your end

00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:20,120
user focus groups where you get a small

00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:24,320
number of people maybe for four to six

00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:26,030
or eight and get them in a room for say

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,919
an hour ask them some questions about

00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:31,669
the experiences that's quite nice they

00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:34,250
bounce off each other it's good watching

00:21:31,669 --> 00:21:38,570
people use sites that's a very easy one

00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:39,919
to do and you serve ways now there's a

00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:42,590
few things that can help you get started

00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:44,809
here in action with the user surveys

00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:47,780
annual user surveys as you can usually

00:21:44,809 --> 00:21:49,100
when I have a client we do one try and

00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:51,620
encourage them to do it the following

00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:55,280
year and they might have a how you find

00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:57,350
the site some of the things I use his

00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,510
research these three products here

00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:02,090
doodle is a really nice online

00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:04,010
organizing tool you can just get heard

00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:06,170
those cats your

00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:09,500
newsgroups so giving them a section of

00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:12,110
times great tool skype I've use at

00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,670
several times in New Zealand is quite

00:22:12,110 --> 00:22:16,250
long as fast there so that Wellington

00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:18,890
crash at Auckland I've had some users

00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:20,660
down and Christchurch so actually you

00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:23,120
know got mom skyping with you two

00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:25,490
viewing like that the product to the

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:28,400
right is a really interesting one I just

00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:30,740
wanted to mention it is when you

00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:33,740
transcribe say an interview or user

00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:36,020
group this here is an open source with a

00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:38,060
software where you put your words in

00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:41,090
basically and it comes out with themes

00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:42,740
so it's a really nice open source tool

00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:45,530
that I've used a lot and research now

00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:46,990
and it's really delivered that hard to

00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:50,500
get installed sometimes but you know

00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:54,230
persevere you'll get a really good

00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:56,600
results but there are many many many

00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:58,910
tools like I I haven't really settled on

00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:59,900
one good voice recording tool so if

00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,910
you're not interviewing you want to

00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:06,710
record and I've got one on my phone I

00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:10,610
got laptop so these many out there he

00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:16,940
found that I liked using surveys well

00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:19,610
hey what can I say drupal after you use

00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:21,200
the survey form module many many times

00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:23,990
before and I find it absolutely

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,970
fantastic

00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:30,500
a survey on the site you might be

00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:31,840
replacing or in a community site that's

00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:34,400
the audience you're trying to target

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,940
you're looking to actually have a look

00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:41,720
our submissions about the sidewalk the

00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:43,190
process and basically you could leave it

00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,660
then rerun at the next year so the

00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,940
client really like stuff like this it's

00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:48,800
a hot survey for this project but then

00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,559
they can rerun it in beach market

00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,940
following year again is other products

00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:54,920
out there I would have mentioned that

00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:58,240
one because that's also one of these in

00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,240
the past two pretty good

00:24:03,399 --> 00:24:07,479
okay so we're just going to move along

00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:10,479
from scope a little bit and we're going

00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:15,129
to look at kind of requirements area now

00:24:10,479 --> 00:24:18,729
I know requirements is kind of like it

00:24:15,129 --> 00:24:21,339
has to be done I'm going to pick on

00:24:18,729 --> 00:24:22,989
content requirements in technical

00:24:21,339 --> 00:24:24,460
requirements I'm going to pick on

00:24:22,989 --> 00:24:26,649
content requirements because I think

00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,690
it's quite overlooked and it could be

00:24:26,649 --> 00:24:30,669
quite good for Drupal 8 to those are all

00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:33,099
the improvements that I've just seen

00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:35,019
this morning from the keynote is content

00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:37,450
requirements is about those poor people

00:24:35,019 --> 00:24:41,849
that have to put the content in the

00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:44,589
system mainly focused around them and I

00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:46,570
want to focus on it as I find that's one

00:24:44,589 --> 00:24:47,979
of the sticking points of projects you

00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:50,109
know you get to a point where abouts

00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:52,509
giving you what they seemed it seems

00:24:50,109 --> 00:24:55,479
you've seen through a project and then

00:24:52,509 --> 00:24:57,070
business major problem with adding you

00:24:55,479 --> 00:24:59,049
know a content type or something like

00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:01,659
that or better content or videos for man

00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:04,299
apart or going to store these files and

00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:08,859
how's it going to work so i have found

00:25:04,299 --> 00:25:10,779
that's been quite a problem and way of

00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:12,190
doing that sort of them actually again

00:25:10,779 --> 00:25:14,979
you want to talk to the people

00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:17,469
face-to-face but this is going to get

00:25:14,979 --> 00:25:20,499
quite complex it might be about workflow

00:25:17,469 --> 00:25:22,749
you might publish a bit of contents and

00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:24,909
these reviewers and it needs to go live

00:25:22,749 --> 00:25:27,580
and then it's gonna have to be embargoed

00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:30,940
and then it needs to be archives and

00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:35,710
let's go back to the graphs think about

00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:37,690
doing diagrams that's a really easy way

00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:40,979
to start even just get a piece of paper

00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:40,979
and sit down

00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:51,380
nude but diagram is a really good way to

00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:55,460
level the playing field like techniques

00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:57,440
I've you firstly writing down the user

00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:01,160
requirement doesn't usually work to the

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:04,840
developers the right pictures there's a

00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:08,000
technique for uml which has unified

00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:09,260
modeling language it's a serious as with

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,950
diagram so I've got a couple to show you

00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:15,170
and then actually describing getting

00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:17,900
drawing out those people that use the

00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:20,810
content you can describe what they do so

00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:23,420
it's got to use a case and then

00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:26,780
developing stories which of your edge

00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:30,700
our edge your background you basically

00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:30,700
write a little summary of what they do

00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:38,920
have a look at technip requirements then

00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:43,230
I won't show you some tools I've used to

00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:45,820
help me document so its technical

00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:48,400
specifications it requirements feature

00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:51,760
set is basically they're having a look

00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:54,370
at what group of features that you want

00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:57,280
in the site a feature could be over the

00:26:54,370 --> 00:27:01,030
log in on a buy a book I want to look at

00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:03,810
my house on a map I want to add an event

00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:07,180
to my calendar so it could be a feature

00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:09,880
so that's actually looking in describing

00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:11,560
it enough to get developed if I get put

00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,140
up an idea enough to get the design of

00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:15,520
SAT thinking about its how long is a

00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,620
piece of string when you're writing

00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:21,700
requirements that we don't know /

00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:25,230
overdue documentation so how do you do

00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:27,760
it well again workshops you can see this

00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:30,010
iteration and importance of actually

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:33,790
communication workshops talking to the

00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:35,860
end user also building on what you've

00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:38,770
just done so that user research adjusted

00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:40,240
and that business workshop you then

00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:43,420
you're going to go back and have a look

00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,930
at that too so business owner said that

00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:48,160
that met was really important you know

00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:49,990
you're really going to have a look at

00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:52,360
how what the requirements are around

00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:53,830
that this is really important you can

00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,760
see that coming through an agile now

00:27:53,830 --> 00:28:00,520
toad is building up the needs the

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:04,980
priorities will show through let's have

00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:08,100
a look at some examples so that's that

00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:10,690
unified modeling language so I know

00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:13,000
dunwall bit technical but basically this

00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:17,050
diagram here you've got a person on the

00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:19,820
left hand side and he's going to vent he

00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:22,760
doesn't have been mixed event occurs

00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:24,950
second line third line for line between

00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:27,800
the different events can see the arrows

00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:29,480
going back so from a programmer or

00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,390
trying to explain to your client what

00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,540
happens a simple diagram like this

00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:39,200
person a types the username and user

00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:40,790
name message appears it's a message

00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,800
saying that it's not not the right

00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:53,720
password you can see how you can easily

00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:56,690
explain the diagram so again this one

00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:59,000
here is about a customer and it's a

00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:01,220
telephone catalogue and as sorts of

00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,800
things a customer could do in this

00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:06,740
certain website telephone catalog check

00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:10,220
status place order full orders establish

00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:14,960
credit there's another one again quite

00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:16,970
similar this website all the activities

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,730
got a shipper a salesperson a supervisor

00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:21,950
and the sales person can place the

00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:24,170
recurring order kind of you can build up

00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:27,890
them and see from the diagram what one

00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:31,220
actor's going to do again you don't need

00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:35,300
one flesh software these through here

00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:38,150
I've used these in the past xscape is an

00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:42,620
open-source graphics often it's quite

00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:45,260
all rounder microsoft visio has been

00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,680
around for a really long time again it's

00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:49,690
very good for doing

00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:52,000
my favorite at the moment because I seem

00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:54,640
to change her a little bit in my pal

00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,360
cermak it does this sort of diagramming

00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:02,560
a new wife raining you can easily get it

00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:04,540
online by packages also the thing I

00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,700
really enjoy about us my client can log

00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,960
in and leave me comments so she wants to

00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:12,810
do it three o'clock in the morning and

00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,810
review boyfriend she can

00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:17,690
and for all the project managers in the

00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:20,810
room you know where you're going to put

00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:22,880
all these requirements love to project

00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:25,940
project management tools I've been using

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:29,210
over the last two years Trello nice

00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:31,430
lightweight product as you can see I can

00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:35,450
spread up one of our projects and it's

00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:41,990
kind of edgeley and then read mine is a

00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:44,240
very big piece of software it takes

00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:46,429
right my favorite information

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,460
architecture probably one of the more

00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:50,780
famous activities of UX basically we're

00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:53,710
trying to do is organize the information

00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:57,320
and presented back in a logical way

00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:59,920
there are many many techniques and

00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:03,620
outputs to this area this is quite a

00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:05,300
well-developed so I've got a few here

00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:08,870
and I've got some really good tools that

00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:12,140
can support you and this analytics again

00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:14,300
going back to the website seeing how

00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:16,340
somebody's use the website before what

00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:17,809
are these sutures what's the top team

00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,780
searches of this website you're

00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:23,960
rebuilding so if it's a book website are

00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:25,820
they always going to find categories is

00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,260
even popular categories you might want

00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:30,650
to look at that and how you can resent

00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:33,470
that better your new site card sorting

00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:35,360
again you might have a whole lot of

00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:37,730
topics and going back to the book

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:42,650
example you have a lot of categories

00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:44,720
cars animals fruit and then automobiles

00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:48,230
bikes and you might want to get all

00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,910
those pieces all those topics on pieces

00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:51,320
of paper and get people to start

00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:54,470
grouping them it's really interesting

00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:56,090
exercise and then seeing what your

00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:59,030
computers are doing it's also another

00:31:56,090 --> 00:32:02,470
interesting way of seeing how other

00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:05,809
people organize information outputs

00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:09,350
sitemap evidently we all the information

00:32:05,809 --> 00:32:13,610
sets and maybe a Content model how bits

00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:15,320
of content relate to each other there's

00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:18,410
a really nice tools this one here

00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:22,419
optimal sort on the left hand side

00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:25,450
there's those cards with topics on

00:32:22,419 --> 00:32:29,980
you can see drag so this one who

00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:32,769
put out and drop the cards and that for

00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:35,230
us as weeks people we get all the stats

00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:37,299
so we know in a person's drag did we

00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:39,159
think and we get all and it's really

00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:42,789
easy to send out two groups of people

00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:44,590
like you can set this up send it out so

00:32:42,789 --> 00:32:46,480
leave it three days he mop talk through

00:32:44,590 --> 00:32:49,409
Twitter you might go via the company's

00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,399
Facebook account what if whatever or

00:32:49,409 --> 00:32:53,679
through your user group that you've

00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:55,210
obviously already interviewed and you'll

00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,809
get results in a couple of days it's

00:32:55,210 --> 00:33:00,789
brilliant and again you might have a

00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:02,889
sitemap you know you've organized your

00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:05,590
content and you're arguing over it this

00:33:02,889 --> 00:33:08,980
is a great tool this is true jack this

00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:12,940
basically takes your sitemap you set up

00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:15,249
five questions can you find the

00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:17,739
information about the bike we send it

00:33:15,249 --> 00:33:19,989
out and again a couple of days you have

00:33:17,739 --> 00:33:25,539
results and you get an idea of your site

00:33:19,989 --> 00:33:28,299
map Center work interaction design or

00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:31,389
getting there folks basically this is

00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:33,519
looking at how somebody uses an aspect

00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:36,220
or feature of the site for example

00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,559
logging in so you're going to drill down

00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:42,399
they actually see how person logs into

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:43,809
the site and this is an area that you

00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,509
really build on everything you've done

00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:49,840
before the user research whether this is

00:33:46,509 --> 00:33:52,619
one search and again it comes back to

00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:56,529
talking to those users and again I think

00:33:52,619 --> 00:33:59,049
one of my real secret says get my mum to

00:33:56,529 --> 00:34:00,850
explain it so it might be log into

00:33:59,049 --> 00:34:04,210
something so ma'am how would you do this

00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:05,919
and you sit with her and it's gold or

00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,710
might be the flatmate or might be the

00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:10,250
neighbor but it's good to see how other

00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:13,190
people think about

00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:15,440
problem there's many many outputs the

00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:18,440
Syria games it's quite a mature activity

00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,030
Inuits flow diagram story of winning

00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:23,510
you've probably heard of wireframes and

00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:26,090
quite commonly used and again email so

00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:29,740
let's just have a look at two products

00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:32,389
this here pencil it's an open-source

00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:35,720
wireframing tool and i'll show you what

00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:37,940
a wife rather than a second and again

00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:40,790
mobile cermak and i just put this year

00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:44,659
out at the bottom this is fantastic this

00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:46,070
is already half built pre-built bits of

00:34:44,659 --> 00:34:47,810
wire frames that you can just download

00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:50,600
and start using so you can actually

00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:54,020
build frames will show you right now and

00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:55,610
the matter about 10 minutes so this one

00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:58,220
here is one from a project that did

00:34:55,610 --> 00:35:00,110
about a year ago and this is a pencil

00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:03,200
one and basically you can see that

00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:05,750
you've got a mock-up of a screen this

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,340
was a video catalog and then i'm

00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:11,360
explaining what each of the parts of the

00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:14,120
screen does so this one will be back let

00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:18,260
mock up to go already has a whole bunch

00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:20,540
of elements search boxes already in

00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:24,020
there so you could be signing away in a

00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:26,390
matter of minutes this again this is a

00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:28,810
balsamic one just to show the different

00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:28,810
styles

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:35,079
now I put information design in here

00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:37,270
because I think it's pretty important

00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:39,940
and it's quite overlooked and what it

00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:41,410
means in know you when you get a website

00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:45,310
it's just not quite working you're not

00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:49,089
whether you know is it about how pretty

00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:51,220
it is or how the flowers actually might

00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:55,089
be about the information you're trying

00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:57,460
to show we all love the tube map you

00:35:55,089 --> 00:35:59,560
know the Wellington I mean Wellington

00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:01,780
the London tube met before that's line

00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,670
how simple it is it's a key example

00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:05,710
brilliant example actually of

00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:07,990
information design if you saw the

00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:11,349
original mix of the language of it would

00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:12,849
be able to learn about to read it but

00:36:11,349 --> 00:36:15,490
they came along with this is an

00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:18,130
information design problem so I just

00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:20,820
wanted to point out that if you really

00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:23,410
come to log heads it's just not working

00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:26,530
get you a visual designer get you UX

00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:28,420
designers and say hey guy is this really

00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:31,530
more of information design problem than

00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:36,490
actually anything else infographics

00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:38,549
design guideline that sort of area again

00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:41,140
as a whole topic insane right

00:36:38,549 --> 00:36:43,390
right we're getting right down the fire

00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:47,950
in now we're kind of like at the at the

00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:49,869
skeleton interface design again Wars the

00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:52,630
difference between this and interaction

00:36:49,869 --> 00:36:57,520
design this is actually bringing it all

00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:59,020
together this is actually about getting

00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:00,640
into a prototype getting all those

00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:02,680
different exit aspects together and

00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,059
making it cohesive you know how you get

00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,039
some sites and there's one but that's

00:37:04,059 --> 00:37:08,200
really really cool and then there's

00:37:06,039 --> 00:37:09,760
another but that's totally different you

00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,130
can I go on using this but that's really

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:16,329
really good excellent in the flows

00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:19,720
orbital face to me that I don't quite

00:37:16,329 --> 00:37:21,309
done this area quite right and I do find

00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,750
one of the if you go and this is

00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:24,190
actually quite hard to get time and

00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:26,740
money in a project because it's near the

00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:29,319
end and or you know this seems like a

00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:31,750
lot of money to do a prototype get that

00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:34,500
kind of pushback I really think about

00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:38,530
prototyping I've got a few ideas there

00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:40,119
these two here introducing IQ as a new

00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:42,750
zealand companies from wellington called

00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:44,589
boost and you can actually do

00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:48,520
screenshots and run people through

00:37:44,589 --> 00:37:51,670
things so kind of a market-based idea by

00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:54,880
both irmak you can use another product

00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:58,200
on top of it and actually do run through

00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,400
some things with using wire frames and

00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:02,950
then there's also this product here

00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,869
again a different way of thinking about

00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:06,190
it again but if you still get feedback

00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:08,920
so it's good in a couple of days /

00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:10,420
nights sort of thing in chalk Matt so

00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:16,119
basically you can give the user a task

00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:18,279
go and wants to press that button signup

00:38:16,119 --> 00:38:20,970
say to banana com you can't you track

00:38:18,279 --> 00:38:20,970
the users behavior

00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:27,950
navigation design the game she's not

00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:30,920
quite sure if Justin's got it right now

00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:34,160
with all this new technology but this is

00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:38,000
actually looking at how everything fits

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:40,910
together so how many little feet from

00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,670
navigation to the phone have should he

00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:45,410
even have navigation should be a

00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:49,580
drop-down menu should we just search

00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:51,830
those big questions I think user testing

00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:53,600
is quite important in the suspect and

00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:57,200
again mock-ups so going back to chalk

00:38:53,600 --> 00:39:00,190
mark going back to this sort of product

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:03,440
that will help you solve this problem

00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:06,380
right now coming to the end I hope

00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,630
haven't bored you to death but got you

00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:13,610
too excited I've got to let you down

00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:15,880
easy your are some challenges I've found

00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:18,839
with you it's

00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:21,160
some challenges but not to put your

00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:25,529
project with the dollar jeez teambuy in

00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:29,680
in working in a multi-vendor environment

00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:31,990
project methodologies everybody here you

00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:37,150
know the herd of air joel this iteration

00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:39,339
is waterfall they all attack your ex in

00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:41,769
a different way so for example edge' is

00:39:39,339 --> 00:39:43,539
quite good for you x what I founders

00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:46,329
that those project managers and business

00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:47,859
owners kind of get a bit confused why

00:39:46,329 --> 00:39:50,829
are we paying for you except the backing

00:39:47,859 --> 00:39:51,819
of a project so usually kind of start

00:39:50,829 --> 00:39:54,400
the project oh this is a really good

00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:56,829
idea yeah us it's still it right through

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,720
the project but about seventy percent

00:39:56,829 --> 00:40:00,069
eighty percent mark they don't really

00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,859
want to pay for it anymore and it's like

00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:05,650
running over and they wanted you know

00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:09,150
features so I find that hard really

00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:13,480
really hard and just where it fits in

00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:16,359
team Bayern again you know you got your

00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:18,579
internal team some people might not

00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:20,529
really understand what you eat says so

00:40:18,579 --> 00:40:22,750
they're kind of like oh what's this new

00:40:20,529 --> 00:40:25,630
darker going on here don't know about

00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:28,450
this so I find that you do spend a bit

00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:30,250
of time educating even your internal 10

00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:33,789
going hey is about the users and it's

00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:35,200
about this so to help that I'd actually

00:40:33,789 --> 00:40:37,210
do a little session at the start of a

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,490
project if you are taking on that UX

00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:42,460
well it's really explain it use a couple

00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:46,779
of these kind of slides easy and then

00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:49,329
finally multi-vendor funny huh big

00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:51,789
project and you've got your weeks

00:40:49,329 --> 00:40:53,680
involved you might have a digital design

00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:55,660
agency you might have somebody special

00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,960
and search eyes and search engine

00:40:55,660 --> 00:41:00,269
optimization then you got a developer

00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,870
everybody's got their own idea about it

00:41:00,269 --> 00:41:05,340
it's really

00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:07,350
and some other challenges I've kind of

00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:09,240
brought this up already responsive

00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:11,730
design there's many different

00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:14,480
breakpoints and all these different

00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:18,050
sized screens and different purposes

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:20,880
mobile phones is about being on the go a

00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:22,590
desktop is about doing lots of work you

00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,350
know you're writing an essay you might

00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:27,000
be writing up your presentation there's

00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:31,020
different needs and different user

00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:34,080
experiences how do we document it how we

00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:36,480
fit into a project cycle correctly how

00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:38,130
do we support the developers to get all

00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,950
those different requirements and user

00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:43,920
experience documented it's been very

00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:46,710
challenging and just some other ones I

00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,960
just want to throw in there technology

00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:50,610
around the Internet of Things and how

00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,430
that's progressing and how the user

00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:54,720
experience would be evolved from that

00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:57,450
and basically what i mean by Internet of

00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:59,730
Things is you know my calf is going to

00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:01,110
talk to that the beaker in the end my

00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:03,960
fridge is going to talk to my shopping

00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:06,480
list on my phone how is the user

00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:09,510
experience going to be evolved such a

00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,600
different sorts of items relating to

00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:17,400
each other so ever design that's more

00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:19,770
the intend bless us for IT we might not

00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,020
control the very first contactor

00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:24,300
userheads or the company we kind of get

00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:28,050
sandwich in the middle so that's kind of

00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:29,580
hard and then gain accessibilities we

00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:31,320
know it's all important but it kind of

00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:35,670
this kind of gets shoved down here

00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:37,530
somewhere and at some point that's going

00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:40,050
to be more of a problem I think with

00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:44,900
laws changing government's making it

00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:48,470
more of a mandate so in conclusion

00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:51,270
likely gonna sad note but in conclusion

00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:52,560
you're designing experience remember

00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:55,620
let's go back right to the beginning

00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:58,650
it's about that feeling you try to make

00:42:55,620 --> 00:43:02,460
that customer happy just remember that

00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:05,370
happy customers and there's many steps

00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:07,920
and the UX process now don't beat

00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:09,690
yourself up if you don't do all them but

00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,060
I hope of pepto

00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:13,890
day that I feel I'm really essential

00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:17,040
especially user needs and know where

00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:18,900
you're going and just start and grab one

00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,700
of these tools and have a go you know

00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:24,180
trying to get a few people you work to

00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:26,700
buy in to you weeks to really help start

00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:30,150
a little group at work or just with your

00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:31,980
other peers and I really do want to say

00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:35,700
there are some challenges but they can

00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:38,070
be overcome you know maybe five years

00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:40,560
ago you know there were other challenges

00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:44,070
they were really little phone you know

00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:45,600
that weren't smart so over time we have

00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:50,340
different challenges and will overcome

00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:56,480
them now I have got some time for

00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:59,250
questions how's my time keeper oh good

00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,880
okay has anybody got any questions was

00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:01,880
everybody asleep

00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:27,220
a very good question I how the question

00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:29,530
is what are the critical you week's

00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:37,500
activities you should do it's number

00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:44,770
right okay will do go back to come on

00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:47,520
slide here right for me I think the

00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:50,650
creaky kind of activities are always do

00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,810
your most strategy you need you need a

00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:55,900
plan you need to understand what the

00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:58,990
wider holistic direction of the projects

00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:00,880
going that's a really small exercise it

00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:02,460
doesn't need to be terribly elaborate

00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:04,869
I've got about five questions at work

00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:07,330
they are kind of even if I don't do it

00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:10,270
myself like project manager you need to

00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:12,850
do this and you document it I think

00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:16,960
that's a critical easy tick box each

00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:19,510
size I really love the idea of user user

00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:21,490
research but I know it's really hard but

00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:24,010
do push for it and it could be easy as

00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:26,050
getting a few customers in a room for an

00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:29,859
hour and bribed them with somebody's

00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:31,510
baking that's really so here to be a

00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:33,720
good Baker so I think that's the next

00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:36,520
one I think that's really important i

00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:39,130
think one will really bite you in the

00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:42,100
bum if you don't do it sorry to be so

00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:43,900
crude but the interaction design if you

00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:46,690
kind of just leave it over here and

00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:49,060
don't worry about it you'll spend so

00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:52,660
much time and picking problems later in

00:45:49,060 --> 00:45:54,190
spending so much money to try and fix

00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:56,530
those problems that he kind of doesn't

00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:59,320
look at originally it's worthwhile

00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:00,550
having a look at it even if you really

00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,920
have to stick your heels and then say

00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:04,180
project manager business owner can i

00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:08,530
have a couple of days just look at this

00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:10,480
problem and then information added

00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:15,460
texture the old card sort maybe use

00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:18,040
their those programs and interface

00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:20,440
design probably it

00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:24,840
so overall let's prove how I'd never

00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:24,840
gate that is it out to your question

00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:37,750
good question I have a question is how

00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:40,240
to cost out you eggs to a customer I

00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:41,770
think first thing is you do is get the

00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:45,460
buy-in from the customer before you give

00:46:41,770 --> 00:46:47,440
them the budget and i'll have to keep

00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:50,130
analyzing past projects to have a look

00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,570
how much you x has been costing and

00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:53,740
because i do a little bit of project

00:46:52,570 --> 00:46:55,690
management so that this might be

00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:58,230
ballooning a bit high but you can say

00:46:55,690 --> 00:47:01,600
about fifteen percent the total project

00:46:58,230 --> 00:47:07,500
you could cover a new x so you might

00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:07,500
have 100k budgets around 15 seemed

00:47:10,230 --> 00:47:15,400
that's a good question to us because

00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:17,950
some projects require quite a lot of

00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:21,130
visual design and some don't so if it's

00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:22,930
quite a basic one yes but i have been in

00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:24,790
situations where you know real glossy

00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:27,130
sites and you're going to have lots of

00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:29,290
that kind of it could blow it out to 20

00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:32,130
you know easy it also depends what

00:47:29,290 --> 00:47:32,130
designer you have to

00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:49,630
yeah so with the actual question we've

00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:53,060
been doing last couple projects edgeley

00:47:49,630 --> 00:47:55,100
so this is just some this for everybody

00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:57,670
else it's basically looking how you

00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:59,870
break down the costing about ride eh

00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:01,100
probably not to the detail of buttons

00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:03,020
and things that's usually groups of

00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:05,920
activities so the last project I just

00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:08,180
stood we went to the client said right

00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:11,090
what what activities would you like to

00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:13,280
do and then we I what's that for that

00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:15,680
some of that lots of user research so I

00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,420
was really happy it's great and we

00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,310
costed out on the types of activities

00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:21,890
and then they actually worked quite well

00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:23,240
which is quite happy in the end because

00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:24,680
she's like are lots of research looked

00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:26,750
really good for her boss she got some

00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:28,570
really good results visual design was to

00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:31,040
slump there's a visual design cost and

00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:33,110
really because it was so much upfront

00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,400
work visual designers and you exactly

00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:41,600
what they were doing and actually the

00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:43,250
cost hit town yeah yeah and it makes

00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:46,880
them quite happy the visual designers

00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:49,810
you know that kind of stumped off you

00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,810
got it yeah

00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:10,770
ok the question is in my projects do I

00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:13,560
consider usable is no accessibility

00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:15,690
sorry accessibility issues right through

00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:20,520
the project now for me personally I've

00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:23,400
got an uncle that's blind so personally

00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:25,680
I tried my best to always do has already

00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,480
know what has needs oh so that

00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:31,070
particular user case is quite close to

00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:33,750
my heart we have many government clients

00:49:31,070 --> 00:49:35,790
foreign catalyst IT so actually

00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:38,220
accessibility is quite important and

00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:41,370
it's really nice to be able to do those

00:49:38,220 --> 00:49:43,230
requirements private clients not so much

00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:46,740
they usually wanted to spend on other

00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:48,420
features so I find it really hard but

00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:50,730
there are some things you can really
