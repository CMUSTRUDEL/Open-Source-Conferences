Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	3 PreviousNext developers, Jack Taranto, Christian Biggins & Nick Schuch, will deliver a detailed technical insight into the huge development effort that went into NovaFM's new website.

We will be providing an overview of the project, focusing on key elements such as its responsive implementation of advertising & media, the enormous data migration task of some 100,000 nodes, extensive hosting network and geolocation.

The website itself has been an amazing success, receiving millions of page views per month, and big increases in user engagement and mobile access. Drupal has helped empower Nova's content creators into having unrivaled control of what they are able to produce.
