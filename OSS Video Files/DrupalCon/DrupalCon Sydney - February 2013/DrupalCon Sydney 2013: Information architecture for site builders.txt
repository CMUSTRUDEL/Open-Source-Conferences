Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Information architecture for site builders
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	The aim of this presentation is to make you a better site builder. By thinking clearly about the data you need to capture and manage, you will be more easily able to meet your website architecture goals. The talk will be fast moving and touch on a number of different areas including aspects, types, relationships and facets. Traditional data modelling concepts will be introduced and then related to Drupal concepts.

The talk is aimed at an intermediate audience who:

is familiar with the basic building blocks of Drupal (content types, nodes, vocabularies, terms, fields) and
would like to learn more about how they can be best put together.
Aspects
Exploring different ways of thinking about site building.

Separation of concerns.
Horizontal vs Vertical components.
Implications for content types, presentation and features.
Types
Schemas on the web are multi typed.

Inspiration from Schema.org and Freebase.org.
Modelling multi typed things in Drupal.
Field groups, field reuse, entity relationships.
Relationships
Building complex entities with Nary relations.

How is it done on the web: RDF and Topic Maps.
EntityReference vs Relation approaches.
Building other structures with EntityReference.
Faceted classification
The use of facets

Taxonomy hierarchies and their problems.
What are facets?
Tips for facet design.
Facet candidates.
It'd be great to start a conversation about other patterns from which we can draw inspiration. Bring your ideas along and we can talk about them in question time or after the talk.

hi there everyone I think it's about

00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:07,980
time we can start so yeah please come in

00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,960
and take a seat if you'd like to see

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,250
this session welcome everybody to

00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:17,160
information architecture for site

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,830
builders my name's Marie Woodman and

00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,840
I've been working with Drupal for about

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,779
four years now I've spent a lot of my

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,980
time as a site builder but I also do my

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:31,529
fair share of module development as well

00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:34,680
in a former life time I have been

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:37,320
involved with the Semantic Web and and

00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:41,160
with technologies such as RDF and topic

00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,989
maps and I've got an interest in sort of

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,410
data modeling and basically that the

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:48,480
patterns around data so what I want to

00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:51,719
do today is you know introduce you guys

00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,940
to a few concepts a few sort of diagrams

00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,699
and graphs and basically ways of

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,800
thinking about the objects you have in

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,160
your system and how you can then best

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,920
represent that in the site building

00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,450
experience so we're not really going to

00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,450
be going sort of deep into any

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:11,100
particular module or code but what we'll

00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:13,830
be doing is largely having a look at

00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,869
data structures and how we can sort of

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:19,619
use those ideas to to build out our

00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:22,590
sites if we have a look at the three

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:25,890
circles of information architecture just

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:29,070
to just to start off proceedings every

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,540
site you build is deployed with a

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,130
certain context in mind and that

00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,540
includes things such as that the

00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,119
business goals and what you want to

00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:39,030
achieve with the site you also have

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,310
users in the mix and the things you want

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,869
your users to be able to achieve the

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,360
paths you want them to take throughout

00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:48,090
the site and the goals the actions you

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,060
want them to take and underpinning all

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,250
of this we have content and and that is

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,500
you know how much content is there what

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,990
is the nature of this content how much

00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,520
does it change and basically how you're

00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,810
going to manage and structure that and

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,570
that's what I'm going to be talking

00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:06,540
about today basically how we can build

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:10,860
out the structure of this content in the

00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:12,840
site building content context so when

00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,740
you sit down to build out a Drupal site

00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,900
you know

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,700
it is a creative process working out how

00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,880
you're going to be modeling your

00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,890
entities and fields and and whatnot and

00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,120
in that sort of design process where

00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,730
you're working out how to structure your

00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:28,590
content you bring to the fore these

00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:30,930
various patterns that I'm going to talk

00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,580
about today and then during the site

00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:34,470
building process of course that's when

00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,170
sort of the data model actually becomes

00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:40,500
apparent in the underlying structures of

00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:43,170
Drupal so the four patterns I want to

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,660
talk about today is firstly aspects and

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:49,490
that is dividing out the horizontal and

00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:51,720
vertical components within your website

00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:53,670
secondly I'd like to talk about types

00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,380
and how you can have sort of multi typed

00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:59,150
objects and how you can best represent

00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:01,380
that within your website and

00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,570
relationships is another big one there's

00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:05,130
a couple of modules such as entity

00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,200
reference and the relation module

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,490
they've both got their pros and cons and

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,190
we'll be looking at how you can build

00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:14,160
out data structures using those and

00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:15,900
finally we have faceted classification

00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,960
and for me that's where the rubber hits

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:21,360
the road where you have these sort of

00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,140
structures being reflected in search

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:26,490
interfaces and things like that so

00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,920
moving on to the the first part of the

00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:31,410
talk aspects here we can see a lovely

00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,570
picture of some cake some vertical

00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:36,270
slices through with some horizontals

00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:38,460
structures in there when when you're

00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:41,960
solving problems one of the the concepts

00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:44,100
that is in computer science is basically

00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,920
decomposing a problem according to

00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:49,290
separation of concerns by focusing one's

00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,270
attention on a single aspect so instead

00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,250
of having a massive problem and trying

00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:55,350
to solve that problem in one go you

00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:57,210
break it down into different parts come

00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,850
up with simple solutions and then have

00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:02,730
those solutions apply across other areas

00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,440
of the site if we have a look at Drupal

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:06,020
and the way it's structured we can see

00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:10,470
that there's you know a whole massive

00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:13,260
these horizontal cross-cutting aspects

00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:15,390
if you like to the system so Drupal is

00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,359
sort of made up of a number of these

00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:20,700
layers that are independent but operate

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,620
together so this really isn't so much of

00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,270
a concern for site builders but it's a

00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,650
good thing to keep in mind and we can

00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,300
apply these principles when we're

00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:30,060
building out our site

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,310
so what's the secret of drupal's success

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:36,360
well I think we've probably all got our

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:39,479
own ideas with this but for me I think a

00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,849
large secret part of the secret is that

00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:43,740
the core and contrib modules are largely

00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:46,409
concerned with these horizontal aspects

00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,479
that is that the solutions that you know

00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:50,099
contrary modules throw up often are

00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,740
there to apply across all the different

00:04:50,099 --> 00:04:55,800
content types that you have so all of

00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,680
our you know favorite sort of parts of

00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,389
Drupal and these sort of contrib modules

00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,229
are all concerned with these horizontal

00:05:00,389 --> 00:05:05,610
aspects however when we're acting as

00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:10,319
site builders we are solving specific

00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:12,569
problems for for our clients so we tend

00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:14,490
to just sit down and crack out the you

00:05:12,569 --> 00:05:16,530
know creating some new content types and

00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,810
we solve those problems by you know

00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:20,159
building out our content types however

00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:21,870
what I really want to emphasize is that

00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:24,330
we probably should be thinking about

00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,550
some of these horizontal aspects as well

00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:29,069
so we should be trying to get reuse out

00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:31,349
of fields out of taxonomy terms and

00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:33,360
vocabularies as well about thinking

00:05:31,349 --> 00:05:35,190
about presentation and metadata because

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,060
all of these things are horizontal

00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:41,039
concerns see if we have a look at the

00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,710
kind of process we go through when we're

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,750
building out content types we I've got a

00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,180
few examples here of page article place

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,680
and event we can see that immediately

00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,120
see that a lot of these horizontal

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,659
concerns are actually sort of the

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,360
dominating thing for example thumbnails

00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:59,789
and descriptions the image styles that

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,889
we get reuse with the view modes that

00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:03,930
can operate across the site and you know

00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:07,169
vocabularies of course all these things

00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,840
are horizontal so I'm just suggesting

00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:11,699
sit down and think about these concerns

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,580
before you crack out and getting stuck

00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:16,259
into your vertical aspects the vertical

00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:20,219
aspects we can see here are things such

00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:21,900
as you know the author and the event

00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:23,789
location and date and things like that

00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,710
but these things really are the minority

00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:28,830
when it comes to building out your

00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:31,349
content types so just coming down to a

00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:33,779
few little quick tips thinking about

00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:35,880
these horizontal concerns basically if

00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:37,680
you have fields that are semantically

00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,479
the same across your various content

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,740
types just call them the same thing

00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:43,440
don't namespace

00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:46,080
them with the content-type that way

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,550
you've got a common index and that's

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,069
going to be very helpful for when you're

00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:53,430
using vuze filtering on that sorting on

00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:56,550
that as well as when you're sort of

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:58,830
using search interfaces as well so if we

00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,569
we have a look at these these fields I

00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:03,930
think Jeff Eden calls it's the concept

00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:06,030
of chunking information across your your

00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:07,889
content types and this is basically a

00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:10,970
similar idea where you you're getting

00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:13,440
reuse another really interesting

00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:17,400
horizontal sort of pattern I've run into

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:20,039
is with various view modes and how you

00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,349
can use those across the site so if you

00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:25,289
say every single one of my content types

00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:27,630
must implement these say three or four

00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:28,979
view modes you're guaranteed of being

00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:31,169
able to render those things out

00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:33,240
consistently across your whole site so

00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:35,550
when you're using views you don't have

00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,880
to you know break down and sort of start

00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:41,340
using fields you can reliably use

00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:43,590
rendered entities and view modes to to

00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,509
get that consistency and so once you do

00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,770
this you know it really frees you up to

00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:48,990
build interfaces that are going to be

00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:51,000
very consistent and it's going to be

00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,440
quite easy to add new content types in

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,009
and not really have to worry so much

00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,210
about the presentation if if you're

00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,919
interested in this I thoroughly

00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,139
recommend checking out in a display

00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:05,039
sweet module which allows you to

00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:07,199
customize your view modes the metadata

00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,810
is a pretty obvious cross-cutting one

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,139
but I just like to draw attention to the

00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:17,940
open graph standard and schema.org

00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:20,699
schema.org is a consortium of Yahoo Bing

00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:23,520
and Google and they've sort of come up

00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:25,710
with a bunch of schemas on the web and

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,229
both of these standards that sort of

00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:32,550
just focusing on name description image

00:08:28,229 --> 00:08:33,990
and URL to describe resources so I would

00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:35,610
recommend thoroughly you know making

00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:37,950
sure all of your content types have a

00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,750
description and an image so so that's

00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:41,490
working consistently across your content

00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,740
types

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:46,290
now all these horizontal aspects that

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,649
we've been talking about a reflected in

00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,790
the way you build out your features

00:08:48,649 --> 00:08:53,490
originally when I suppose that the

00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:55,170
concept of features was mooted at least

00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,779
this way I thought of them they would be

00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:59,880
sort of little silos of functionality

00:08:57,779 --> 00:09:03,029
and configuration that you could drop

00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,680
into your website but you know reality

00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:07,110
is a lot more complex than that and

00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,940
they've got two features when you use

00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:12,450
them have to sort of contend with all

00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,250
these these horizontal concerns so I

00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:16,529
think when you're trying to plan your

00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:18,029
website and these various structures

00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:19,260
you've got to sort of think about how

00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:22,589
they're going to be reflected in your

00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:25,470
features so you know one of the basic

00:09:22,589 --> 00:09:27,600
patterns i use is to you know have have

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,339
a feature for each content type and then

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,770
maybe your vocabularies which are

00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:34,380
cross-cutting are then uses dependencies

00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:36,950
and then you're getting reuse across it

00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,420
your image styles and view modes as well

00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:41,760
another interesting one is rolls rolls

00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:43,050
is a pretty sort of curly thing that

00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,910
that's going to be set different for

00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:46,260
every website you do but that is a

00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,120
cross-cutting thing that works across

00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,610
your permissions and and your text

00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,560
formats so one of the patterns I've use

00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,390
there is to you know just have a little

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,520
feature for your rolls and then that

00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:59,459
becomes a dependency further for these

00:09:56,520 --> 00:10:00,990
other components what I've got here is

00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:02,520
not necessarily going to work for you

00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:04,620
but I'm just trying to get you guys

00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,000
thinking along the lines of how you can

00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,279
design this thing these things out

00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,060
without sort of running into sort of

00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:13,560
dependency problems so yeah take away

00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:16,290
for this section is you know let's plan

00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:17,880
for the horizontal it's so good for two

00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,320
reasons it's great for you as site

00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,360
builders because you're going to be able

00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,950
to be building more simple flex systems

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,720
that are going to be more flexible and

00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,940
ultimately they're going to be more

00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,560
expandable in the future because it's

00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,000
much easier to drop in vertical

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,970
components once you've got all the

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,070
horizontal stuff sorted in terms of

00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:36,660
information architecture for users it's

00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:39,660
it's great for them as well they're

00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,970
getting consistent interfaces and having

00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,070
to think about sort of the structure of

00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:45,899
your site in a consistent way that's

00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:50,010
going to make things more predictable

00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:52,490
and understandable for them all rights

00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:55,080
the next stage it's a young Bob Dylan

00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:57,510
Bob's a very talented

00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,850
man with with many different facets and

00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:04,770
we'll be using him as an example for

00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:08,160
this next section what is a type it's a

00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:09,750
fairly simple definition a type is just

00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,630
a category of things with common

00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:15,630
characteristics and in Drupal of course

00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:17,730
that means entities with fields if we

00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:20,220
sort of have a look at how PHP sort of

00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:22,590
does things we can see that any one

00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:26,160
class which represents a type can only

00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:27,690
ever extend a single class there are

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,150
ways to get around that through things

00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:31,410
such as interfaces and the example I've

00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:35,040
got here as you can see a theme again

00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:36,540
and a developer can implement well the

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,580
class person can implement themer and

00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,490
developer so it is possible to get more

00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:43,290
types in on that person class but you

00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:47,780
still have that basic idea of single

00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:50,220
inheritance and drupal is very similar

00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:52,770
we can see that we can have multiple

00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,890
entity types and the one I've got here

00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:58,620
is a node you can see that there are

00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:01,530
several bundles at any content type can

00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:04,440
support article page and event for

00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:07,170
example but an event can only ever be a

00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,600
can only ever support a single type so

00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:11,970
an event cannot be an article on a page

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,560
and this is it's a little bit limiting

00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:17,640
because you know we're only sort of got

00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,990
these single faceted sort of nodes out

00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,060
on the web things are a lot more

00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,520
complicated and in real life things are

00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:25,140
a lot more complicated people perform

00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,330
many different roles in their lives they

00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,500
have many different facets and so for

00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:32,310
example Bob Dylan he's a

00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:36,660
singer-songwriter and an author freebase

00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:39,510
is a as a as a site on the web that it's

00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:41,130
a massive semantic database of pretty

00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,440
much everything in the world and the way

00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:45,330
that they get around this is by giving

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,460
each of their content types a different

00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:50,670
facet or a different set of properties

00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:53,670
so we can see say Bob Dylan in the

00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:55,770
freebase view of the world is a songs is

00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:58,940
not only a person he's a songwriter a

00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:02,100
composer an artist and a book author

00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:04,980
over at schema.org and with the scheme

00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:08,440
is there build out there they've got a

00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:10,790
type hierarchy but each one of the

00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,130
object sort of classes in their system

00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:15,770
also support this multiple inheritance

00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:19,370
sort of approach so we have a hospital

00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:21,910
is not just a hospital it is actually a

00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:24,470
civic structure a local business an

00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:26,570
organization a place as well as being a

00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:28,070
thing and it's this compositional

00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:31,010
approach to objects that we can move

00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:33,140
across and use this in Drupal and there

00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:38,380
are three main ways I see of being able

00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:40,820
to do this that's called reusing fields

00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:43,580
using a field collection or perhaps

00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:46,220
linking in another object with an entity

00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:48,380
reference each of these three approaches

00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,630
I'm going to describe sort of follow

00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:53,450
have a fairly similar UI which you can

00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:55,790
see they're basically the edit form of

00:13:53,450 --> 00:13:59,150
the node or the content is adorned with

00:13:55,790 --> 00:14:01,100
these extra fields so in the case of

00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:03,460
just reusing fields it's very simple

00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:06,260
quite obvious it's just a case of

00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:08,540
plugging those extra fields into the

00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:10,550
content type and just by adding these

00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,770
extra fields and you can sort of be just

00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:15,020
extending your your objects out with

00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:17,240
these different types so that is the

00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,550
most lightweight way and it's probably a

00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:22,310
thing that we all do naturally without

00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:24,380
thinking about it a second approach

00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:26,030
would be to to use a field collection

00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:28,040
and this is where you have an entity

00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:30,680
that is just a collection of fields and

00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,710
then you can plug that into the subject

00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,330
by embedding that field collection in so

00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:37,180
if you haven't checked out the field

00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:39,560
collection it's a really handy way of

00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:42,350
building out objects with just a

00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,450
collection of fields the other really

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:46,190
cool thing about this is that because

00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:48,920
it's an entity you're also getting your

00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:50,690
view modes associated with that and it's

00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:53,060
possible to plug in different displays

00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,830
for this field collection and so you're

00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:58,550
going to be getting reuse across that if

00:14:54,830 --> 00:15:00,800
you're reusing that field collection I

00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:03,260
don't really recommend this approach I

00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,990
think it's a little bit sort of heavy to

00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:10,280
be using another sort of throwing

00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:12,170
another entity into the mix if we have a

00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:14,300
look at the third approach and that is

00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,550
with entity reference I think this is

00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:19,310
more of an interesting model because not

00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:20,270
only are we plugging in the extra fields

00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:22,060
through an entity

00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:24,290
but we're also getting the goodness of

00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:26,780
business logic and the view modes that

00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:28,700
can be associated with that entity so

00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,830
like the classic example of this in

00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:34,430
Drupal is say with the Commerce module

00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:36,680
where you have a product and then you

00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:39,110
have a display product node and that

00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:41,180
product is linked in with an entity

00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:43,310
reference field so you're getting that

00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:45,560
the fields and you're also getting all

00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,030
the business logic so if if you want to

00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,280
sort of have this multi typed approach

00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:51,140
with with logic the entity reference

00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:55,700
module is it certainly a cool way to do

00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:58,520
it the inline entity form is also a nice

00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:02,150
way to to plug this stuff in into the UI

00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:04,730
when editing so yeah the takeaways here

00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:06,140
is a Drupal is a flexible system it is

00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:08,930
possible to get over this single

00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:12,050
inheritance sort of limitation by by

00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:14,780
mixing in these different types using

00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:17,930
shared fields is perhaps the easiest way

00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:20,990
and entity reference is is the most

00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:26,470
powerful if you want to be building in

00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:29,240
some logic as well okay third section

00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:33,950
Kevin Bacon can anyone guess why I've

00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:35,690
got him up here on the screen yes it's a

00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:37,250
six degrees of Kevin Bacon I've got to

00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,570
get a bit of audience participation here

00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:41,360
I don't want to see too many people

00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:43,870
going to sleep but day yet this is a

00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,500
cool part of the talk Kevin Bacon

00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:49,730
relationships that that game is about

00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,590
trying to link up different actors in

00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:56,300
Hollywood according to the movies that

00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:57,890
they've they've been in and for

00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:01,060
information architects it's a really

00:16:57,890 --> 00:17:04,100
important thing to do is to to relate

00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:05,300
content in interesting ways because it's

00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:07,010
basically the thing is going to be

00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,050
providing the navigation pilots your

00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:10,910
users take throughout your system and

00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:13,010
the better those paths the more chance

00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:16,400
they've got of discovering interesting

00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:17,839
information there the basic foundational

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,810
concept i'm going to be talking about

00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:24,260
here is a triple and this kind of idea

00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:27,020
is found in rdf but it's also got its

00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:31,130
analog in drupal with you know fields

00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:32,240
hanging off entities i want to talk

00:17:31,130 --> 00:17:33,650
about something a little bit more

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,900
complex than that and

00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:37,790
is the concept of NRI relations and

00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,430
that's where you have a number of

00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:42,350
different entities sort of orchestrated

00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:44,240
together to to come up with another

00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:48,260
entity that that stands for something as

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,360
a whole the example I'm going to use is

00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:52,010
the one used by the relation module if

00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,810
you go to the homepage of the relation

00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:57,410
module you'll see they've got an example

00:17:53,810 --> 00:18:00,680
of a donation where company a donates to

00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:02,450
party B by a bank see a certain amount

00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,040
so what we want to do is we want to

00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:08,020
somehow represent that these

00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:10,930
relationships in the most succinctly I

00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:13,580
mentioned the start of the talk that

00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:16,220
sort of in early 2000s I was involved

00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:18,890
with the topic maps community and that

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:21,500
was a specification that sort of modeled

00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,970
a lot of these relationships and and one

00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,250
of the first class objects in that

00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:28,610
system was a concept of an association

00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:30,980
and the association allowed you to sort

00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:33,710
of relate several different objects

00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:36,950
together and in this case we have the

00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:40,040
company party and the bank and you can

00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:42,320
see each one of these relationships is a

00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:45,200
is an edge on it on the graph that's

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:47,390
that's labeled and the cool thing about

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,570
topic maps was that you could plug in

00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:52,160
any number of these sort of objects that

00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:53,960
were joined it wasn't just a binary

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,700
relationship you could have any

00:18:53,960 --> 00:19:01,370
relationships where you were relating a

00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:03,590
lot of things in the RDF world we have a

00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:05,570
very similar sort of structure as well

00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:08,510
although this has been done by sort of

00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:10,760
building things up so we come up with

00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,650
the concept of a resource which is that

00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:15,650
the center point and then each one of

00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:19,580
these triples is then built out to to

00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:21,170
represent this entry relation so you can

00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:23,540
see that if you just go back to topic

00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:25,310
map and then go forward they're both

00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:27,500
pretty much the same kind of structure

00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:29,570
and if we come across the Drupal you can

00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:33,920
see we can model this in exactly the

00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:36,710
same way using entity reference so we

00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:39,860
can come up with a an entity such as a

00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:41,900
donation that could be a node or a being

00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:43,820
or a field collection or any other

00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,950
entity you want to create and just by

00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:47,280
using entity references you're able to

00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,590
build up a structure

00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,920
that is very similar to the the two

00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:54,900
we've seen looking at the way the

00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:57,660
relation module does it the relation

00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:59,280
module is meant to sort of model this

00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,780
kind of thing as well and you can see

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,550
the relation model module introduces to

00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:06,900
sort of relation entities here so you

00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:09,150
can see this structure is a little bit

00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:11,370
more complicated and that's because it's

00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:14,610
basically joining only sort of two

00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:16,590
things at once if we dig a little bit

00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:20,010
deeper into the database we can see that

00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:22,500
the relation module is using endpoints

00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:26,250
as the name of the field rather than

00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:28,260
sort of semantically named somatically

00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,850
name field so you can see this structure

00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:34,310
is just a little bit more complicated

00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:37,020
than the anti reference approach and I

00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:38,460
suppose the main my main idea here is

00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,100
that I think entity reference is a

00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:43,560
better way to model these enery

00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,500
relationships it's a simpler model it's

00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:48,060
much more flexible and it reflects the

00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,920
resource centric approach that we have

00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,900
on the web so for instance if you want

00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:53,760
to implement linked a linked data

00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,310
strategy where you wanted to have a

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,930
restful web service you're actually just

00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:00,200
talking about a single resource that can

00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:02,640
be can be used in those approaches so

00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:06,720
yeah I really like the way entity

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,760
reference tackles this stuff moving on

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,640
to some other relationships that you can

00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:14,070
you can have I'm just going to look at

00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:16,830
sort of reverse links here so you've

00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:18,900
seen subject object and predicate let's

00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:21,390
saw in the reverse link and talk about a

00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:23,700
link going back the other way for

00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:26,610
example with the example with Hillary

00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,500
and Chelsea we can see that Hillary has

00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:31,230
a child called Chelsey and Chelsey has a

00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:34,290
has a parent called Hillary so the

00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:36,900
reverse link there is an inverse of link

00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:38,640
and another sort of exam more

00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,490
specialized example of that is the

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,530
friend of relationship where the reverse

00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:46,050
link is named the same thing as the

00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:49,800
forward relationship and that's called a

00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:52,200
symmetric property in Drupal it's

00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,000
actually quite a difficult thing to map

00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,460
that reverse link back there's no sort

00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,610
of natural ways of doing a reverse link

00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,290
in

00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:03,470
in Drupal but there are ways to work

00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:05,840
around it I'll just go back there the

00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:07,880
relation model module handles this

00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,640
explicitly by having that the forward

00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,860
and and backlinks but if you decide to

00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,780
go with the entity reference approach

00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,730
you can use another module called the

00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,560
the corresponding entity references

00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,750
module which allows you to manage that

00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,210
backlink and you can just see there on

00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,680
the configuration screen you can see

00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:26,570
I've just basically mapped a forward

00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,220
link to a backlink and then once you do

00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:31,400
that this module will keep both of those

00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:33,890
links in sync so they have a look at

00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,630
bill and Monica if bill is no longer

00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:37,790
friends with Monica and the

00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:40,160
corresponding and the references module

00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:41,900
will make sure that moniker is no longer

00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,490
friends with bill so you can see you

00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,710
kind of got a bit of replication of data

00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:47,930
there but it's this moose module will

00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:49,160
keep those two things in sync and I

00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:51,140
actually quite like this approach

00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,790
because it once again it's this reflects

00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,750
kind of the RDF sort of view of the

00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:55,910
world where you've just kind of got

00:22:53,750 --> 00:23:00,380
these small little pieces and and you're

00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:01,820
coordinating them collections this one's

00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:04,340
pretty trivial I don't really have to

00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:05,900
talk about this but because it's

00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,900
probably a pattern that you're using

00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:10,820
very frequently you can use the anti

00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:13,640
reference module just to with say

00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,800
unlimited numbers of nodes or whatever

00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,860
you want to link to build out various

00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:21,680
collections so here both ill and lynette

00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:25,510
are both awesome authors so yeah that's

00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:28,580
a pretty simple relationship to model

00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:30,080
this is a really interesting one I find

00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,490
this interesting when I when I was

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,260
looking at the relation module when it

00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:34,940
came out there's a lot of excitement

00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,800
about it I really wanted to work out

00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:40,160
what was what was going on with it

00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:43,580
especially with this symmetric relation

00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:45,560
that have modeled if you go to the home

00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,840
page there you'll see there's the

00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,850
siblings relationship that that you can

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,370
model and in this example we've got

00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:55,400
Kourtney Kim Khloe and Rob who are all

00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:57,050
siblings and the thing with the relation

00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:59,630
module what it says is that this

00:23:57,050 --> 00:24:02,720
particular relationship joins things in

00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:05,390
all directions so each one of these

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,520
siblings is related to the other one and

00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:10,550
this is a this is quite an interesting

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,270
thing because the way this structure is

00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,910
represented

00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:15,500
inside Drupal it kind of looks a little

00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:17,660
bit like a collection to me you know

00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:21,200
you've got these endpoints with with

00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:23,930
various deltas but the arcs are really

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,030
not related to the relation entity all

00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:27,680
the relationships are going on with the

00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:29,330
things without with the actual siblings

00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,190
and this is quite a bit of a

00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:33,110
mind-bending thing for me to get around

00:24:31,190 --> 00:24:35,600
because what the relation module is

00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:37,610
really modeling this it's not looking

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,650
something like that as it appears in the

00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:41,450
database and that's because like the

00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:44,000
relation module is basically managing

00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:47,810
its own layer of metadata to map these

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,370
various endpoints so yeah the relation

00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:51,260
modular it does have a good use case

00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:53,930
here because this is like just a

00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:55,640
shorthanded notation for relating a

00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:59,000
whole collection of things together but

00:24:55,640 --> 00:25:00,760
I would say it's quite maybe an unusual

00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,200
thing to want a model but it's certainly

00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:08,270
you know a an efficient way to to do it

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:09,620
okay conclusions about relationships you

00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:11,630
can see I'm a big fan of entity

00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,760
reference I think it's simple it's

00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:15,680
flexible when it follows the basic

00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,140
understood field semantics with inside

00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,790
outside Drupal it's also follows a

00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,010
resource centric approach and that makes

00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:24,080
it very sort of web ready for for

00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:25,610
restful web services and just basically

00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,030
when you want to deal with a single

00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:31,880
entity the relation modulars has made

00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:33,650
some good steps in trying to be explicit

00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,070
about the nature of the relationships it

00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:38,750
wants the model but overall I think the

00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:41,360
simplicity of the entity reference

00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:43,580
module is is is probably a winner

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:45,260
although with the the shorthand for

00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:50,090
those symmetric relationships that could

00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:52,250
be a use case for you you okay so that's

00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:54,620
that's the relationships it's dealt with

00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,390
and we're moving on to the final section

00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:59,300
now and that's start to do with faceted

00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:00,860
classification and I've got this laughs

00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,420
because I think it's really where the

00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:04,580
rubber hits the road a lot of the hard

00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:06,830
work you've done with modeling your data

00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,930
I think it's reflected in how you can

00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:13,520
build out facets to to search across

00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:16,580
your website as information architects

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,970
we all no doubt familiar with hierarchy

00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:22,130
it's quite a simple sort of concept to

00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:23,340
grasp that of a tree structure with with

00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,830
broader and now

00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:28,670
our categories and it works particularly

00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:32,490
well when you have type and subtype

00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:34,680
relationships whole and part containment

00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:36,000
relationships as well as class and

00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,740
instance where you may have a list of

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,920
things that are instances of a

00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:43,740
particular class but hierarchy is not

00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:46,260
great for everything say for example

00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,570
with the jury decimal system we can see

00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:51,690
how difficult it is to to slot a book

00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:53,130
into a single slot into that system it's

00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:54,780
also very difficult to come up with a

00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,970
classification system that's going to

00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:59,900
apply and make sense to every does

00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:03,750
everyone sort of using that system on

00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:05,520
the web we've had dmoz the open

00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:08,460
directory project in yahoo they've both

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,150
flourished and and fallen away as sort

00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:14,070
of alternative navigation and searching

00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:17,700
methods have arisen so we've seen the

00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:19,920
rise of tagging and focus on ax me rise

00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:22,710
of search and using labels instead of

00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:27,360
nested folders as well as faceted search

00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:29,790
and self-organizing interfaces so what

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,100
is faceted classification well it's it's

00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:35,520
basically where you divide up a set of

00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:37,410
content into various dimensions and that

00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,510
is using multiple characteristics that

00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:42,480
can be applied to every single member of

00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:44,370
that set of whatever you're looking at

00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,370
so instead of using a single

00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:49,380
predetermined hierarchy we're actually

00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:51,180
using sort of properties that are

00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:52,950
intrinsic to those those objects that

00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:56,160
you're looking at and this brings a lot

00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:58,170
of advantages so I noticed a funny

00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,150
example but it's the way it way it

00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,950
worked out in the end I'm searching for

00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:08,280
a blonde woman but I don't know her name

00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:09,540
now stop smiling John if I if I didn't

00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,130
know the name of that person it would be

00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:13,980
a very difficult thing to search for

00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:16,260
because I don't know the magic string to

00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,000
enter into the search engine but using

00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:20,910
facets it's possible to this you know to

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,430
narrow down down the field to find the

00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:25,380
object you're looking for so using that

00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:28,950
this guess who name we can apply the

00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:31,920
facets to find out who who the person is

00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:35,960
I'm looking for so this is everyone this

00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:37,610
is me filtering by the gender facet

00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,190
and so we're just selecting all the

00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:42,560
women here and this is me searching by

00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:44,690
the hair color facet for blonde women

00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:47,420
and lo and behold we've got an eater and

00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:49,370
this is the basic principle that can be

00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,230
used with facets so it could be used in

00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:53,210
conjunction with search or it can just

00:28:51,230 --> 00:28:55,670
be used on its own and it's very good

00:28:53,210 --> 00:29:00,160
for slicing and dicing up large data

00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:00,160
sets that that are difficult to search

00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,910
using facets is cool because it you know

00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:06,710
we can be a little bit more rigorous

00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:11,030
about the way we want to define our

00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:13,490
facets each of the the terms should not

00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:15,260
be should be mutually exclusive that is

00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:17,600
that they shouldn't intersect at all and

00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:19,340
when you add up all of the terms they

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,650
should be collectively exhaustive and

00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:23,180
cover the whole field and so once you've

00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:26,900
done that you're kind of doing a bit of

00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:29,000
a mathematical sort of sort of

00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,560
intersection when when you are sort of

00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,210
dividing these sets up and you're going

00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,460
to have more efficient use of if your

00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:37,760
facets if you organize things like this

00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:39,920
a little design tip I've got would be

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,330
not to be aware of sort of big big

00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:43,520
aggregates of things which sort of

00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:46,460
mix-and-match stuff that's that's not

00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,530
the same so for example in this case do

00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:50,930
away with this hierarchy and break it

00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:52,670
out into these two two different facets

00:29:50,930 --> 00:29:54,740
and you're going to be getting much

00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:59,210
better reused from from your faceted

00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:02,120
search what kind of stuff is makes good

00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:05,120
for good candidates for facets in Drupal

00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,830
it's all of the horizontal things that

00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,330
we've been talking about so this is you

00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:11,150
know where you're sort of information

00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:12,850
design at the start of the talk comes to

00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:16,390
fruition here you know we've got types

00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:19,520
categories and tags authors languages

00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:22,970
and even sort of locations can be used

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,830
to to to use for facets you might have

00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:27,050
the main specific things such as you

00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:29,600
know t-shirt size or t-shirt color and

00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:34,220
you know they make very good things for

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:36,320
this kind of thing as well this is not a

00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,700
particularly new idea in Drupal I mean

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:40,340
you guys are probably all familiar with

00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:43,640
with solar but most of these recipes

00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:46,250
around faceted search revolve around the

00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,600
solar search engine because it's very

00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:49,520
good at returning

00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:53,450
rose from large data sets where you're

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:55,610
searching on different columns typical

00:30:53,450 --> 00:30:58,130
MySQL search is not so good on that

00:30:55,610 --> 00:31:01,309
because it can't sort of index across

00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:03,020
have multiple indexes on table so that's

00:31:01,309 --> 00:31:05,419
why the Apache Solr search engine is

00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:07,940
great the facet API module in

00:31:05,419 --> 00:31:10,100
conjunction with the Search API module

00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:13,220
or Apache Solr will will basically

00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:17,450
combine to provide you the interfaces

00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:21,980
hereafter so just wrapping up here users

00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:23,360
turn to search more frequently and you

00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,919
have the faceted search that you can

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,750
provide them as a waiter to bring all

00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:29,690
these horizontal concerns to the fore

00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:31,460
and to provide them with you know an

00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:37,220
interesting and effective search

00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:41,750
interface so yeah time to time to wrap

00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:45,020
up here I've had a look at a few

00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:48,140
patterns here today aspects types

00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:49,640
relationships and facets and the one of

00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,260
the main things I really wanted to get

00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,059
across was just there this concept of

00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:57,080
that the horizontal don't just focus on

00:31:53,059 --> 00:31:58,880
on the vertical things building out

00:31:57,080 --> 00:32:01,880
these this kind of stuff will lead to

00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:03,980
better interfaces for users one of the

00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:07,460
ideas and main reasons behind the talk

00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:10,490
today was just to try to bring some sort

00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:12,140
of data modeling concepts into Drupal so

00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:14,450
that you know us as site builders can

00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:16,730
you know be able to build out these

00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:18,200
structures more effectively if any of

00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:20,630
you guys have got any sort of other

00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:23,450
ideas or thoughts of how you would like

00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:24,950
to integrate other data structures and

00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:27,289
how we build our Drupal I would love to

00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:29,390
hear about them in the the question

00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:30,950
section at the end because you know I

00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:33,350
think the more ideas we can get coming

00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:36,740
into Drupal for this kind of stuff the

00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:40,010
better just coming back to the start of

00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:42,710
the talk I've focused a lot today on

00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:45,740
other content but please don't just

00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:47,720
focus on that it must be done within the

00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,309
context of what you want to achieve with

00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,409
the site and that the things you want

00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:53,480
your users to do so if you bring all of

00:32:51,409 --> 00:32:54,860
those together you know hopefully your

00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:58,010
information architecture should be

00:32:54,860 --> 00:33:00,460
improved and that's it thank you very

00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:00,460
much everyone

00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:08,240
well I I think I've actually got quite a

00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:11,420
bit of time I seem to have cruised

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,160
through that pretty quickly so you know

00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:16,220
if anyone's got any questions or

00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:18,620
suggestions or ideas I'd be really love

00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:43,910
to hear from you so anyone got a

00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:45,860
question oh yes up the back there so

00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:50,030
okay so that the question was what would

00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:54,290
I use to to group client content from a

00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:55,640
certain issue well I mean these are

00:33:54,290 --> 00:33:57,800
these kind of things come down the

00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:59,900
subtlety we're talking about sort of

00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,940
like a grouping kind of concept I mean

00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:04,880
natural natural grouping things in

00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:07,309
Drupal would be taxonomy terms or if you

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,560
wanted to model an issue out in in more

00:34:07,309 --> 00:34:11,270
detail you could have a content type or

00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,940
another entity that represented that

00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:16,149
issue and then you could then then apply

00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:19,250
that and select that and so you could do

00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:22,070
the containment that way that so did be

00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:28,090
either the air taxonomy or or in energy

00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:28,090
reference I'd say yeah

00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:37,730
yes yes

00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:48,840
yeah yeah yeah on the relation homepage

00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:50,460
here they address address the strengths

00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,380
of the relation module versus the entity

00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,590
reference thing that's that's one of

00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:57,870
them linking to other entity types as

00:34:55,590 --> 00:35:00,330
well as apparently anti references can't

00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:02,190
be versioned as well and that's that's

00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:04,410
one thing that they're they don't want

00:35:02,190 --> 00:35:06,180
to sort of add in so there are some

00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:07,740
shortcomings there but that's your

00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:10,500
coming you talk about is is also

00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:12,390
something that is very similar with with

00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,420
search as well and solar you can only

00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:18,600
sort of chuck in you have an index into

00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:21,270
a certain entity type so yeah general

00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:22,890
generally you know i mean i'm quite a

00:35:21,270 --> 00:35:24,990
fan of nodes and i'm quite happy to

00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:27,000
build out stuff as content types for you

00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:28,440
know for those reasons because you you

00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,390
don't run into those problems or and

00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,460
especially with the search but yeah

00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:44,810
that's that's noted it is certainly a

00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:44,810
sure coming there behind you yes

00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:58,670
okay so yeah the question was why did I

00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:01,430
choose entity reference overfilled

00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:03,590
collections I i really like field

00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:05,180
collections mainly because they're

00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,830
they're very good to use when you have

00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:08,750
sort of lots of them and you know you

00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:10,250
want to represent a collection of things

00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:12,530
and you just want to quickly model them

00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:14,210
out so you could just have you know you

00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:15,620
could come up with the person field

00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:17,240
collection and they just have a

00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,950
collection of people and you know you

00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:20,630
just so that's very good when you have

00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:23,330
multiple things because it's like a

00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:25,640
little container where you can just sort

00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:29,360
of swat all those fuel collections in

00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:31,220
however when the use case herbs talking

00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,570
about here was just for typing really so

00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:35,990
we were just going to be importing those

00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:37,610
fields in once so if you have a field

00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:39,770
collection and then you're just pulling

00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:41,630
those fields in it's just like it's just

00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:43,790
a little bit heavier you know you've got

00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:45,200
another entity in there and say when

00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:47,930
you're doing a views query you're going

00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:50,090
to have to go from your node to the

00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:51,530
field collection and then sort on the

00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:53,810
fields right so you just got another

00:36:51,530 --> 00:36:55,310
joint in the thing so I mean you know

00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:56,690
it's just a small thing but you know if

00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:58,100
you do if you don't want to do that then

00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:59,600
I'm probably just going to lighter

00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:02,170
weight way with the fields would be a

00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,170
way to do it

00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:16,270
yes that's that's yeah yeah if you use

00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:18,130
NT reference yes yeah that's very that's

00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:20,740
very true yeah that node is going to be

00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:22,420
that will be heavier so I mean the most

00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,800
lightweight ways just to do fields then

00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,960
you don't have to have to have any

00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:27,730
anything in so yeah I mean it's just you

00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,050
just pick whichever one you know bet

00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:35,010
specially it's what you want to do

00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:35,010
that's right okay down the front here

00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:05,140
yep yeah yeah so um yeah basically how

00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:07,690
do you model features you use sort of

00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:10,690
big units or small units I mean we could

00:38:07,690 --> 00:38:13,060
probably talk for hours about this you

00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:14,410
guys might know of Justin Randall but

00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:17,200
jeebus he's been working on the

00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:19,000
configuration management initiative and

00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,860
you know his idea is that you know all

00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,110
of this stuff the whole site gets

00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:25,630
chucked into one massive big tree and

00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:28,030
stored as configuration and that's just

00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:30,760
done in one chunk I'm probably much more

00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:32,860
of a smaller chunk person where each

00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,800
feature does have a little bit more

00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:37,480
reusability where it's sort of split out

00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,300
so that's why I've sort of designed

00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:42,040
these along sort of content type kind of

00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:44,470
lines and then sort of dealt with the

00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:47,140
cross-cutting concerns when required

00:38:44,470 --> 00:38:48,760
however if you are building a site out

00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:50,410
for a client and you don't really need

00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,790
to have any reuse there's there's no

00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:54,190
reason why you can't Chuck all of this

00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:56,560
stuff into the content type so that

00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:58,630
would include you know your permissions

00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,770
as well and you know maybe some other

00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,930
things you can just basically throw

00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:04,900
everything in because it is a unit of

00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:06,750
encapsulation but other systems I've

00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:10,240
seen you may have sort of layout

00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:12,550
features where you may be using context

00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,020
and other things to to map these things

00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:15,640
in so you can have a whole section of

00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:17,470
layout features for example where

00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,840
they're they're cross-cutting sort of

00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:21,490
concerns as well so it really depends on

00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,830
the kind of site your building and if

00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:28,240
you want to get the reuse out of the

00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:30,420
features that you you're building yes up

00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,420
there

00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:42,839
how do you get buy-in from the client on

00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,529
how you're structuring this stuff I

00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:46,269
personally think at the end of the day

00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:48,460
you know as an architect or whatever

00:39:46,269 --> 00:39:49,960
this is you know this is the expertise

00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:51,539
you're bringing to the field and you

00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,400
know you you've got to make the best

00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:55,900
decisions of course they're going to

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,059
have trade-offs along the way and

00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:59,470
sometimes you know there might be line

00:39:58,059 --> 00:40:01,450
ball cases where you don't know if

00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:04,720
something should be an entity or in it

00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:06,849
or a content type or something else and

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,089
I suppose then you might go back to the

00:40:06,849 --> 00:40:11,859
client and discuss can you see any

00:40:10,089 --> 00:40:12,940
future requirements around these things

00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:14,650
sometimes it's good to know what's

00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:16,960
coming down the road to see if you can

00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:19,809
make those design decisions up front you

00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,400
can make better decisions then but but

00:40:19,809 --> 00:40:23,170
generally speaking I'd say it's the

00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:30,819
balls in your court when you you're

00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:33,009
modeling the data yes yes I think that

00:40:30,819 --> 00:40:35,200
is helpful for clients too especially

00:40:33,009 --> 00:40:37,269
when your specking out its depending on

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:39,519
how you work with waterfall or agile but

00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:41,319
I think it is very handy for clients to

00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:43,269
be able to see those those basic moving

00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:45,849
parts and they can be alerted to any

00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:47,440
sort of shortfalls in the fields or

00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:49,359
whatever you're discussing so I think

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,789
that is going to be a you know a helpful

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:53,499
thing to to walk through the the client

00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:58,059
when you when you're mapping out what

00:40:53,499 --> 00:41:00,809
their requirements are yeah any other

00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:00,809
yep meadow

00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,730
yes what I mean with with if you're just

00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:15,440
chucking fields on hey we do it all the

00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:17,660
time let's say we've got a therm nail

00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,950
field just you put the thumbnail field

00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:21,110
on and you use it across the thick

00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:22,850
across all your content types that

00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:25,180
that's pretty much what I'm talking

00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:27,020
about so you get the reuse that way but

00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,700
when you're implementing the

00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:30,320
presentational layer your get still

00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,370
going to have to see if you're using dis

00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,380
place where you're still going to have

00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:34,970
to go in and configure that that one up

00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,140
manually so you're getting reduced with

00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:38,480
the field but you've still got to

00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:40,190
re-implement some of those display

00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,560
things or in your template layer for

00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:44,450
example but you know that's the most

00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,800
simple sort of lightweight common way

00:41:44,450 --> 00:42:02,710
and probably the most natural way of

00:41:45,800 --> 00:42:02,710
doing it and Drupal yep

00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,470
you could yeah you could I believe it I

00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:16,050
was thinking about this on the bus on

00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:18,300
the way here this morning if you're just

00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:20,940
going to do it just having you know

00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:22,560
objects and ND references between them

00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,869
it would be a very hard thing to do

00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:26,130
because you would have to have you know

00:42:24,869 --> 00:42:28,109
each of those siblings going like that

00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:30,000
and then the next one would have to be

00:42:28,109 --> 00:42:32,700
related to everyone so that is a very

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,700
laborious way of doing things but you

00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:39,510
could have you could come up with

00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:43,140
another entity type may be called set

00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:44,609
you know siblings right and then you you

00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:46,380
know you could basically have a

00:42:44,609 --> 00:42:49,200
collection so you could just have

00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,369
sibling field that's unlimited and then

00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,020
you could just chuck them all in there

00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:54,030
and you could even give it a title and

00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,800
call it the Kardashian clan or something

00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:59,400
like that and so then that's an entity

00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:02,730
in itself and but they each of the each

00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,990
of the each of the two get things

00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:05,910
semantically correct each of those

00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:07,950
fields is a relationship between each

00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:09,480
member and the actual entity itself

00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:11,940
that's the correct way it's not an

00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,170
in-between thing so it I know we're

00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:14,550
splitting hairs here but each one of

00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:18,270
these guys is going to be a member of

00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:19,290
this the cadet Kardashian clan entity so

00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:21,210
that's that's a bit more of a

00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:22,589
complicated way of doing it it's not so

00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:25,050
natural you've got to go away and build

00:43:22,589 --> 00:43:26,880
that structure and and then maintain it

00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:28,500
but that may make sense but if you're

00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,060
just having a lightweight you know

00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,500
trying to relate these things and there

00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:35,000
may be the relation modules the way to

00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,000
go but yeah go ahead

00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,900
I haven't I you know I haven't done any

00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:57,710
performance things but there's there are

00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:59,849
less moving parts in the end you

00:43:57,710 --> 00:44:02,369
reference one certain certainly for that

00:43:59,849 --> 00:44:04,589
donation example I gave you you've got

00:44:02,369 --> 00:44:06,750
one less entity type there okay so if in

00:44:04,589 --> 00:44:08,220
the relation module you would have in

00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:10,260
the relation what you'd have to have two

00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:12,180
relation entities if you wanted to add

00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:16,349
another thing another link to another

00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:19,349
thing maybe I don't know just say there

00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:20,819
was you know a lawyer consulted and you

00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:22,710
want to plug that wire into that

00:44:20,819 --> 00:44:25,289
relationship you're going to have to map

00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:27,839
another entity as far as I understand

00:44:25,289 --> 00:44:29,250
another relation entity in so it's not

00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:31,470
really a scalable solution because

00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,970
you're just making more and more as far

00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:34,530
as I understand more and more relation

00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:36,630
entities to get this more complex

00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:38,309
structure where is the relay entity

00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:40,349
reference module it's just going to be

00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:41,880
you know just have one entity in the

00:44:40,349 --> 00:44:43,500
middle and these things hanging off so

00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,420
that's a simpler structure I think it'll

00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:47,849
be more efficient to navigate that graph

00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:50,730
with with views and things like that but

00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:52,799
in terms of querying and displaying this

00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:54,990
stuff on on the page I'm not really sure

00:44:52,799 --> 00:44:57,059
how that that works but i think the

00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:58,319
entity reference module could get a few

00:44:57,059 --> 00:44:59,970
more smarts there could be some more

00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:01,710
contrib modules to handle this kind of

00:44:59,970 --> 00:45:03,420
stuff with the presentation of this

00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:06,569
stuff maybe a field format it can work

00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:09,420
out oh look this page is about Kim I'm

00:45:06,569 --> 00:45:11,549
not going to show Kim in this list of

00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,440
things you know you just show the other

00:45:11,549 --> 00:45:16,079
siblings maybe there are certain ways of

00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,180
working around that but the year the

00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,589
entity reference modules pretty it

00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:21,180
doesn't have any smarts about what it's

00:45:19,589 --> 00:45:24,180
you have to sort of augment that with

00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:26,720
other modules I just yeah just up the up

00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,720
the back there

00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,250
yep

00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:53,470
yep

00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,200
yep

00:46:03,009 --> 00:46:06,889
it could well be you could decide to

00:46:05,659 --> 00:46:08,419
call your content type you know

00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:09,769
something slightly more generic and

00:46:08,419 --> 00:46:11,599
that's an optional field and if that

00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:13,039
works for you that's that's cool so I'll

00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,349
just rest ate the question what do you

00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:17,359
do with content types which kind of have

00:46:15,349 --> 00:46:22,119
optional fields where your split between

00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:22,119
making up two different content types

00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:32,719
there's an objective criteria that I

00:46:29,899 --> 00:46:34,849
mean they're they're just decisions

00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:37,519
they're just decisions you make you know

00:46:34,849 --> 00:46:39,349
I'll just do a little throwback to say

00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:42,469
relational databases and and how you

00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:44,809
represent these sort of different types

00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:46,519
you know there's there's three ways if I

00:46:44,809 --> 00:46:48,679
remember correctly there's the one way

00:46:46,519 --> 00:46:50,229
of having a super wide table with all of

00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:53,179
the properties from all the different

00:46:50,229 --> 00:46:55,939
types the second way is to have a

00:46:53,179 --> 00:46:59,089
separate table for every type and the

00:46:55,939 --> 00:47:01,609
third ways that have a basic superclass

00:46:59,089 --> 00:47:03,469
table and then sub tables for all the

00:47:01,609 --> 00:47:05,389
subtypes right see even in relational

00:47:03,469 --> 00:47:07,609
databases there's three ways to model

00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:09,769
this exact thing and in Drupal you're

00:47:07,609 --> 00:47:11,989
facing the same problems where you've

00:47:09,769 --> 00:47:13,159
got you know you're basically deciding

00:47:11,989 --> 00:47:15,349
at the end of the day I think it's a

00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:17,509
practical thing and often times it comes

00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:19,519
down to what do the content editors

00:47:17,509 --> 00:47:20,899
expect you know do they want to go in

00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:23,059
and say I want to create a new event or

00:47:20,899 --> 00:47:24,679
a new whatever sometimes you can divide

00:47:23,059 --> 00:47:26,749
a site up like that to make it sort of

00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:29,839
logical for them you know a natural

00:47:26,749 --> 00:47:31,909
thing for them to do so yeah I mean it

00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:35,919
just depends i know that's not a very

00:47:31,909 --> 00:47:35,919
good answer better just depends really

00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:47,950
we need to have inheritance between our

00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:57,540
entity types can and can you sort of

00:47:47,950 --> 00:48:00,430
flesh that out a bit more Jonathan yes

00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:02,380
yes that would be awesome and when I

00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:03,580
first heard of bundles I thought oh well

00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,990
this is cool we're going to get like

00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:07,030
these interface kind of things on end

00:48:04,990 --> 00:48:08,410
reasons and then I realized no it's not

00:48:07,030 --> 00:48:10,450
it's that single inheritance thing so

00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:11,980
yeah that's what I'm kind of driving at

00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:13,690
is how can we we do that and you're

00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:15,340
saying you would like to have a bit more

00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:18,370
of a formalized structure for what these

00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:20,430
inheritance things could be but that's

00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:23,470
basically what this inline entity

00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:25,210
editing module does you know you can you

00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:27,970
can say okay this is an entity reference

00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:29,200
and you know just plug it in here and so

00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:31,030
you know you're kind of building it

00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:32,470
building it out in the content type

00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:35,980
still but it's yeah it's just not an

00:48:32,470 --> 00:48:39,120
explicit concept in Drupal core yeah

00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:39,120
over there

00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:59,930
so I know any modules for graphing out

00:48:47,600 --> 00:49:01,220
these relationships for visualizing you

00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:05,300
can probably tell for my body language

00:49:01,220 --> 00:49:07,850
that I don't there's does then does

00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:18,980
anyone else know a waste of visualizing

00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:21,260
yep oh yes yeah I know what you're

00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:26,840
saying i'm not actually you know aware

00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:31,490
of it I've got a safe in the relation

00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:32,780
module so oh the relation database model

00:49:31,490 --> 00:49:36,140
you're talking about all the relation

00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:50,720
module all right yeah I'm not entirely

00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:53,420
sure yeah yeah no I don't know when I

00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:58,280
was doing this talk actually I had to

00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:59,900
work out a way to to map out come on

00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:01,490
computer to map out these various

00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:04,430
relationships i came across this graph

00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:07,250
is open source project which where you

00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:13,460
can sort of just to a text file and then

00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:16,010
it will render out these render out

00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:17,390
these things so i don't know maybe you

00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:19,550
could write a little module just to go

00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:21,890
through the various sort of entity sort

00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:23,510
of definitions and pump out a text file

00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:30,340
until but yeah I don't know apart from

00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:30,340
that really yep

00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:38,650
yep ah yes yeah yeah yeah sorry about

00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:40,510
that yeah I haven't I haven't checked

00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:41,860
that that aspect of it out but yeah

00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:44,260
there must be little connectors to

00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:46,300
visualizing things and yeah I don't

00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:47,620
think that would be hard to to build

00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:50,020
something like that yeah it's just a

00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:53,580
matter of yeah of putting that together

00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:53,580
but yeah I don't know is the answer

00:50:53,790 --> 00:51:03,930
anyone else yes

00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:10,350
right okay so Drupal 6 hours node

00:51:03,930 --> 00:51:11,700
relationships module yep cool anyone

00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:13,470
else does anyone got any patterns or

00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,820
anything any sort of other ideas that we

00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:16,740
can throw into the mix I I basically

00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:19,380
went through the owl the web ontology

00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:20,880
language specification and how to look

00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:22,350
at the various properties in there and

00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:24,930
and worked out how they could map into

00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:42,720
drew pores has anyone got any other cool

00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:46,050
things yes yep yes it is it's pretty yes

00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:48,030
so our Terms and taxonomy reference the

00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:50,940
same yes that pretty much is you know

00:51:48,030 --> 00:51:52,620
it's just that that exact relationship

00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:56,580
and just in terms of the trade-offs

00:51:52,620 --> 00:51:58,350
between say content and taxonomy terms I

00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,910
think that for the main advantage is

00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:01,380
that terms have this concept of a

00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:03,090
hierarchy built in so when you're

00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:05,040
building out your vocabulary you can add

00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:08,250
that nesting in and for me that's the

00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,540
main advantage of terms over sort of

00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,280
nodes I mean they're probably a bit more

00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:13,080
lightweight as well but that is the main

00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:14,820
feature that that you get out of them so

00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:19,920
if you want to support that hierarchy

00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:21,510
yeah go with Gover terms sorry you back

00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:23,250
here the bose our welfare we've got the

00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:31,140
to take no crap boys down here fighting

00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:35,750
it out come on yes i did yep yeah yeah

00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:38,070
that's like that that got a bit of our

00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:41,190
what's going on there sorry guys but

00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:44,760
yeah the the commerce guys have yes bit

00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:46,950
of a snafu the commerce guys really have

00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:48,840
been thought leaders and in this area

00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:50,970
with the entity reference and entities

00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:52,980
and the inline editing form that's

00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:54,540
that's down to them and you know i think

00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:56,160
that's a great step forward and i think

00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:57,990
a lot of in the future we're going to

00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:01,260
get a lot of that pattern reappearing

00:52:57,990 --> 00:53:05,390
where you want logic and and data sort

00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:05,390
of being able to plug into other objects

00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:11,170
why it's more of a hardcore thing I mean

00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:14,080
if you want to go away and write your

00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:16,000
own entity feel free and then you know

00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:18,190
it takes a bit of effort and know how

00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,990
the field collection module is you know

00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:20,950
much easier to get up and running with

00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:23,860
obviously because you're just building

00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:25,600
out the field so you know if field

00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:27,460
collection is going to do it for you but

00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,660
other people I've spoken to just hate

00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:30,280
the field collection module because they

00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:31,900
don't like the concept of you know

00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:34,420
fields and that much prefer to build out

00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:36,340
an entity with with properties and have

00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:37,870
the database tables that the way they

00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:40,450
want them you know so it just depends

00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:49,020
what how comfortable you are with with

00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:49,020
with on that spectrum yep

00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:07,910
yep

00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:21,110
cool yes you know that's good sir james

00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:22,430
mentioned yeah trade some PHP I'm not up

00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:29,080
up with those but yeah i'll have to

00:54:22,430 --> 00:54:29,080
research those James it's good idea cool

00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:36,920
yeah yeah nice nice yeah well being it

00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:38,240
could be an interesting model right so

00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:40,040
you're not just getting feels you're

00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,680
getting functionality going across your

00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:44,840
content types you know I suppose that's

00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:46,670
what the you know that the Commerce guys

00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:48,260
solution with the the entity reference

00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:50,210
and the entity because you are getting

00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:54,530
that functionality I suppose yeah in

00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:56,420
there as well well I mean that the talk

00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:59,690
today guys I know it was maybe a little

00:54:56,420 --> 00:55:01,070
bit high level is but I hope you've sort

00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:02,690
of you know got a few little sort of

00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:03,920
ideas out there so when you're sitting

00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:05,630
down in front of your computer and

00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,670
building out your content types you can

00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:08,990
just have a few of these ideas bubbling

00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:11,990
around in the back of your head and

00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:13,370
maybe apply them and hopefully you know

00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:15,950
that site builders you're just going to

00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:18,560
have you know an easier experience here

00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:19,610
putting your sites together is that I

00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:23,360
don't know where how we are for time

00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:24,920
Alastair four minutes oh cool okay well

00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:28,550
are three minutes more fur for questions

00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:31,880
anyone else I'm getting quite enjoying

00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:37,330
these questions anyway no all right 11

00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:37,330
more yep

00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:57,920

00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,970
yes of people in the video yeah it's a

00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:02,470
quick question on that yeah how do you

00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:05,200
model things you put a lot of properties

00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:07,390
in 221 content type and just run with

00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:09,340
that and the response was well it's

00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:11,500
probably best to split split that out

00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:15,600
certainly for things like metadata and

00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:15,600
typing that up for Figgis on the web

00:57:19,110 --> 00:57:23,050
there's any dereferencing corn Drupal 8

00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:24,670

00:57:23,050 --> 00:57:28,410
