Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Information architecture for site builders
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	The aim of this presentation is to make you a better site builder. By thinking clearly about the data you need to capture and manage, you will be more easily able to meet your website architecture goals. The talk will be fast moving and touch on a number of different areas including aspects, types, relationships and facets. Traditional data modelling concepts will be introduced and then related to Drupal concepts.

The talk is aimed at an intermediate audience who:

is familiar with the basic building blocks of Drupal (content types, nodes, vocabularies, terms, fields) and
would like to learn more about how they can be best put together.
Aspects
Exploring different ways of thinking about site building.

Separation of concerns.
Horizontal vs Vertical components.
Implications for content types, presentation and features.
Types
Schemas on the web are multi typed.

Inspiration from Schema.org and Freebase.org.
Modelling multi typed things in Drupal.
Field groups, field reuse, entity relationships.
Relationships
Building complex entities with Nary relations.

How is it done on the web: RDF and Topic Maps.
EntityReference vs Relation approaches.
Building other structures with EntityReference.
Faceted classification
The use of facets

Taxonomy hierarchies and their problems.
What are facets?
Tips for facet design.

It'd be great to start a conversation about other patterns from which we can draw inspiration. Bring your ideas along and we can talk about them in question time or after the talk.
