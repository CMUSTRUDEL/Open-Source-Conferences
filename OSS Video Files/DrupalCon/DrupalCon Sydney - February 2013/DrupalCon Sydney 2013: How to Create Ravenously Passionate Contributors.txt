Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: How to Create Ravenously Passionate Contributors
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	This talk will walk through the "growing up" journey that I took in the Drupal community, and attempt to extract some broader lessons on how to do proper community management to foster an environment where passionate contributors can grow and thrive.

It should also serve as a fun history lesson of the ~2005-2008 period of the Drupal project, for those who weren't around back then, and contains practical explanations about how the Drupal community works, and what has helped it become one of the biggest open source projects today.
