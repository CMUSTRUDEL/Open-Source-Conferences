Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: It's not "their Drupal" - It's OUR Drupal
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	The ballad of Drupal 
How did we go from being 40 geeks in a basement to a Community with Drupals all over the world & not a weekend without a gathering somewhere on the planet.

The two legged monster 
In the world of Drupal we have two major dominant groups, that are usually in direct opposition: Tree hugging hippies & the greedy evil capitalist (!) In the kingdom of Drupal these 2 factions have (so far) been able to live in almost peace, what can we gain from that duality & can they keep work together in the Drupalsphere.

The Evil Empire
Why do we need a Drupal Association ?
What do they do with the millions (no trillions of usd) ;)
What can the DA do for you
Structure, understanding & benefits

A Gathering of Geeks
The gatherings around the world have been a huge factor in the growth of the Drupal community.
The importance of meeting person to person may look from the outside as a simple excuse to hang out, party & take a vacation to exotic new places (from naked in Copenhagen, to dancing with dinosaurs in chicago & drinks on the beach in sydney)
What can we learn from this & do it have an factor in the way we write code?

at first light we ride!
We came for the code & are staying for the community.
How do we keep the growth, focus & not forget the sheer enjoyment of creating something thats a bit bigger than our self.
Where is your role in all this, do you even have a role & is it okay to just wanna fix that goddamn bug, and not care about Drupal's COC (and is that actually an animal?) can you participate in core development without submitting bugs (hint yes you can)

mortendk is a veteran from the battlefields in the Drupal community. Besides arranging countless drupalcamps, making Drupal beer with world renowned mikkeller brewery, leading a DrupalCon (Copenhagen), he is also part of the rising of Frontend love with the underground army Frontend United.
He's proud as f... and very happy to have been elected by the community to be their voice for the next year on the Drupal Association Board, a voice that is not known to be silent.

This session comes with a warning - it will be loud & there will be a smoke machine!

thought up for the AUSA's custom areas

00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,700
of course always a part of us so it's a

00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,470
good thing this is actually my sponsor

00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,409

talk again in about a week in Melbourne

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:49,530
um cause no pun actually pulled it up

00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:52,860
compared to what city configure so go

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:56,820
Melbourne um how many years actually

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,710
members of the drupal association we

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,950
have one staff member hils was not a

00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:05,100
member it's it's actually pretty easy

00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:06,930
and it's only thirty dollars a year if

00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,099
you just click up here they become a

00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:10,890
member and then you can get like

00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,819
t-shirts and stuff that says Drupal and

00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:16,120
you could be epic

00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:18,260
if we look at this whole google project

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,870
one of the first statements I've heard

00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:23,269
about google was that that old CMS it

00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:25,010
sucks but Google sucks less than all the

00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:26,510
others it's kind of in an advance on

00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:29,810
this community over the years which is a

00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:31,550
good thing but we've go back about 10

00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:35,209
years ago when the actor was called drop

00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:36,620
org and this shows how good away we

00:02:35,209 --> 00:02:39,500
actually starting out with starting out

00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:43,190
on the spelling error so it should have

00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:47,780
been dope which means city in Dutch it

00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:53,810
turned out to be drop instead which is

00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:55,459
Drupal in touch loaf um so that's a

00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:58,280
cause a good way to start the first CMS

00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:00,110
come CMS permit comes in about 2,000 the

00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,209
same thing with this beautiful beautiful

00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:05,450
logo especially the slogan cheers of

00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:07,519
technology thing as saying that we have

00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:10,940
seen a lot of in the issue cubes over

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,950
the years it actually looks like this at

00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,290
this point in october two thousand it

00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:17,000
gets a huge design upgrade a couple

00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:20,239
months later the really shows that this

00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,579
community space for designers and really

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,609
takes care of that part this is clearly

00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:27,410
a nerd and geek project and we look at

00:03:25,609 --> 00:03:28,940
the whole project the first ideas of

00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,040
what was actually chosen world

00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:33,290
domination there's the initial first

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,880
post that actually sets the start of

00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:37,280
this whole adventure from fifteen of

00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,709
january two thousand one which makes us

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,630
soon to be a teenager so we can make a

00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:42,950
lot of trouble i can see a lot of forks

00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:46,730
and a lot of fun coming up the next

00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:48,590
couple years the fun thing when we look

00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,000
at the second release a couple of months

00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,639
later and we only have a couple of

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,590
months between each release that says a

00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:56,810
lot of the code base at this point 2

00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:58,760
months instead of two years but the

00:03:56,810 --> 00:04:00,560
friendly but small communities more we

00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:04,250
could actually change this a little bit

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:08,630
later on we get spread Firefox Google

00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:10,400
Docs through 0427 as you get the first

00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,950
google book reads about seven years ago

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,169
jae crowder gets into the drupal project

00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:18,289
which made jpr kind of explode at that

00:04:15,169 --> 00:04:20,000
point is very tiny project which by the

00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:21,950
way cost a ton of trouble in the

00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,050
community think kevin can remember some

00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,639
of the long long hot discussion about

00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,919
why we should not

00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:31,689
Iron JavaScript to do anything because

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:35,629
nobody use JavaScript for anything right

00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:38,659
anyway the association is born in 2007

00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:42,650
we get whitehouse.gov in which kind of

00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:44,060
made everything blew up in ton of

00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,009
business world in which was a good thing

00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:47,900
apparently everybody thought down Google

00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:50,199
was to using put a new hot was kind

00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:52,729
of the old hot chicken still hot yet

00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:55,400
we've got Symphony now into Juba witches

00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:58,400
is even more exciting we killed CBS

00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,779
which is a great thing for a lot of us

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,120
so we can actually begin to contribute

00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:04,039
we got an office in Portland so we

00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,900
actually gotten really got a staff here

00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:08,240
which is an interesting thing this is

00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,310
the historical moment when it finally

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,710
came into drew when there was a lot of

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,080
nerds who celebrated that day because

00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,699
CBS is a piece of and I hated it

00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:20,469
whether such a passion I actually wrote

00:05:16,699 --> 00:05:23,180
haiku poems for it I am not kidding um

00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:24,529
one of the things I've learned over the

00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,469
issue this group of things actually this

00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:29,050
whole gathering of geeks that we have

00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:32,020
which is a kind of celebration of Google

00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:36,139
people who know this guy this is drum

00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:40,310
he'll jump back an emperor 2006 we have

00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:46,930
trees up here we have various people

00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:50,120
that have the most is here I'm not sure

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:52,610
yeah kind of don't have all the names of

the that's like four or five left portal

00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:57,050
in 2005 that's was not a google come by

00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:59,060
the way there's part of Auslan I which

00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,830
happened again in am for them this was

00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:03,589
actually the first time but we had a

00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:05,419
panel discussion at at rubicon or jugal

00:06:03,589 --> 00:06:07,339
events that's not a good thing to do in

00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:10,520
amsterdam PA apparently people were a

00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:12,949
bit tired that that day that pharmacy

00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:15,889
enjoyed it was mainly as far as i know

00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:17,629
what kind of an epic fail vancouver the

00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:21,110
really great thing about this is oh

00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:25,300
thank you let's just roll back to this

00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:29,979

00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:32,930
don't hate you you hate me good I'm

00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:34,459
three a very very young version of trees

00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,870
especially this is the very first

00:06:34,459 --> 00:06:37,720
through booty show that actually ever

00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,490
came out

00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,560
I think what he's trying to demonstrate

00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:46,510
here is published option on a note

00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:49,150
Brussels 2006 we have web trickier I'm

00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:52,540
there as well we have andreas down today

00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:54,910
is chief architect of polio thermal

00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,560
works at Twitter we have a bond it's

00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:57,880
kind of edge of fun to go in and look

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,400
how many of these people still the

00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:03,730
communities about sixty percent oh and

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,320
the mighty trees as well yahoo it sunny

00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,820
where we did not take a picture here

00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,650
which was really really dumb this was

00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,510
back when Yahoo still was something now

00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,970
they have figure that's it but there was

00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:15,250
kind of a big thing um the conference

00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:17,170
sold out so quick that we could not even

00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:19,770
believe it that when the holy crap we

00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:23,710
sold for the chickens to a conference

00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:26,070
and we did the same thing six years six

00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:28,870
months later and Barcelona which was um

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,730
actually the first time i heard a person

00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,650
go up on stage and exercise I'm sorry

00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:36,040
for the coat that they did this is jeff

00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:38,200
agent who made a puppet excuse for form

00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:40,600
api which have destroyed so many lives

00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:43,780
at that point and this kind of also

00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:45,730
shows me a way of how this Drupal

00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:48,280
community works it's okay to up we

00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:49,840
all do that fast on now it will need to

00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:53,350
be so many people cannot even be in a

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,660
photo anymore 2008 850 attendees we've

00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:58,540
been to second provide after that second

00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:00,400
is the way the out there in Hungary

00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:03,850
it's not even the capital it's like a

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,919
student City three hours away in small

00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,360
little trains going through old Eastern

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,250
Europe that Eastern Europe by the way

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,250
Central Europe it's very important to

00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:14,890
remember that that's Central Europe I

00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:18,430
learned that the hard way um busy with

00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:20,770
crusted 1000 users which you can see

00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:24,640
here this one of my fav picture stuff

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:26,350
from juba cons after that Paris 850

00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,720
attendees we should learn in the future

00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:31,270
to actually be better to to make our

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,729
photos San Francisco three thousand

00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:36,070
users attendees that week and a half

00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:38,950
after Steve Jobs actually came up with

00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:41,740
the with the ipad we were we were this

00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:48,160
close to breaking the amount of units

00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:50,870
and simultaneous connections at that

00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,330
point ever beat us were kind of

00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,430
on that copenhagen which i was

00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,200
personally a leadoff which was still

00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:59,950
still think this is the best picture we

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,210
have from a jupiter that's just me um

00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:05,029
she can't on our people are getting to

00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:09,140
get married at drupa cons I mean London

00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:12,070
1800 so it Crichton eighteen hundred

00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:15,100
attendees and that was a riot I mean

00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:17,450
stuff were and fire on that converts

00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:22,130
Denver I have no idea how many came to

00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:23,480
Denver holy crap um so we open a number

00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,250
now where you pretty sure you're not

00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,040
going to meet anybody unless you

00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:30,200
prearranged stuff with them Munich had

00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,089
only eighteen hundred attendees which is

00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,570
practically the same when you offered

00:09:32,089 --> 00:09:37,279
that number said doesn't really matter

00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:39,440
we even doing small events now like

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,750
fronted United that hat about 200

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,490
attendees that we've goes six years back

00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:46,850
that was the size of a drupalcon and

00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:49,510
this is only for front-end nurse there's

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,650
kind of a this cult of Drupal that have

00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:54,560
started out around this whole these

00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:56,750
events and one of the things that we

00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:59,180
have that that very very first time when

00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:01,910
you're ready for your for the Google

00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,800
chair it should be popped and you think

00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,450
it's going to be easy and you've now

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,420
experiencing the Drupal learning curve

00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:09,980
and and the thing is that we have mod X

00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,070
WordPress Joomla all the other good

00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:15,230
things it's kind of is like a slow curve

00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:16,670
you learn and you understand and then we

00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:19,279
have google which is basically running

00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,779
into a flat wall sometimes feels

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,670
like the wall actually hunts you and

00:10:20,779 --> 00:10:25,010
smacks you down and you cannot get away

00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:28,190
from it and the thing that I've very

00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:29,930
very early learned that it's actually if

00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:31,490
you need help there's always somebody to

00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,680
help you because we beginning to be that

00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:35,060
that many people and kind of talk into

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,250
the DNA of course you want to help other

00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,690
people goes well first of all if you

00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:40,520
help them they've kind of probably help

00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:42,500
you and it feels good to show everybody

00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,990
else that you are badass at this thing

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:48,770
will just click three places or show how

00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:51,230
that form API works and it kind of that

00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:54,529
we have we have people who I mean it's

00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:57,170
becoming a this is Drupal 8 that's his

00:10:54,529 --> 00:11:00,079
handle he sent me this picture ever

00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:02,270
after i sent him a pocket of stickers he

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,960
then put that sticker on his leg that

00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,750
leg is now by the way covered

00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:19,320
drupal stickers I'm not kidding you it's

00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:20,060
it's pretty extreme I mean to the

00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,240
temperature

00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:25,519
Paul true

00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:29,779
24 you've got a website you need a

00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:33,470
system to manage your content drupal we

00:11:29,779 --> 00:11:36,220
have a song we even have a band which is

00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:39,949
a combination of swedish hard rock

00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:42,259
drupal and killing kittens they have

00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:46,389
played up up until multiple drupal

00:11:42,259 --> 00:11:50,089
events around scandinavia but they exist

00:11:46,389 --> 00:11:52,040
we even got world-renowned brewmaster

00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:54,500
mcclure to make us a beer just because

00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,050
we can and that is kind of the things we

00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,730
do even when we release a new version of

00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,980
Drupal we need to have release parties

00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:04,069
it's just the thing we all know what's

00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:05,750
going to happen in yeah that's how it's

00:12:04,069 --> 00:12:08,630
done I mean why wouldn't we have a

00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:11,300
release party it's this is way more than

00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:16,519
code right there's even like good shared

00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:18,800
memories which is kind of where did the

00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:20,899
traders Cove those people in the

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,149
community who knows what Colleen's

00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:25,430
training dollar is I will not make your

00:12:23,149 --> 00:12:28,190
name I have protected the innocence here

00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:31,639
so one of them is maybe this is this is

00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:34,730
the events that we have today I just

00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:37,370
went into Drupal town which is the far

00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,959
best event or event overview we have

00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,940
this is the amount of events that we

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,490
have today in the Drupal community I

00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:46,250
think it's pretty bad ass to be

00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:47,990
honest um and when as when that side

00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:51,139
came up I figure out this the first time

00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:53,240
it went a little bit you a little bit

00:12:51,139 --> 00:12:54,860
humble and I know people for me that

00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:59,690
sounds strange but a little bit holy

00:12:54,860 --> 00:13:02,410
 and this is kind of still the gold

00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:04,970
this is a slide a picture I found from

00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:07,339
2009 that this is kind of stuff this

00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:09,439
this is still the gold but it seems like

00:13:07,339 --> 00:13:11,660
we have this whole thing going on around

00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:13,430
it well I mean we even have developers

00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:15,529
who don't even build websites it's

00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:18,680
important where people come to Drupal

00:13:15,529 --> 00:13:21,319
events not to be a part of seeing a

00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:22,579
session but there is people who talk

00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:24,139
about that we actually need to have a

00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:25,759
whole rate track because we do have

00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:28,579
people who never shows up a session and

00:13:25,759 --> 00:13:31,069
one thing is that this hold oh wow okay

00:13:28,579 --> 00:13:33,470
the code is complicated well but I mean

00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:34,570
if we try that with people instead then

00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:38,630
it's going to be really fun

00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:41,570
and we look at the number map over

00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:45,400
20,000 modules we have about 1,600

00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:47,930
themes one or two that does not suck ass

00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:50,150
ton of distributions I have no idea what

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:53,090
all these distribution does but they are

00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:55,070
there anyways that's actually not this

00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:58,280
number of kind of blew my mind because I

00:13:55,070 --> 00:14:00,530
knew that in when we went to Munich we

00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:04,850
had 20,000 developed we just turned that

00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:07,130
thing that six months ago as far as I

00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:09,440
can calculate here we have about 3,500

00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:13,150
more developers since Munich holy

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,530
that's a ton of code coming out of that

00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:17,720
the amount of commits we have each week

00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:20,210
the amount of comments we have each week

00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:22,520
and actually this number is wholly trap

00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:26,450
this amount of users that is almost 1

00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:30,650
million users we have on a website god

00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:32,870
damn it so um it kind of no takes on

00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,490
this whole old life and when you look at

00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,770
other systems where every other system

00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:39,560
have some kind of flavor of the day well

00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:40,910
we're now going to use other I don't

00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,560
want to say other systems name that

00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,690
should be yet be an ass but we have

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,520
always new system popping up and it's

00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,320
kind of easy if you're free people down

00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,030
in their basement then it's kind of easy

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,500
to have your own little epic system that

00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:54,940
can do everything but when you begin to

00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:57,380
have almost a million users 20,000 plus

00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:59,270
developers who all have an opinion about

00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,400
every thing you can figure out

00:14:59,270 --> 00:15:03,830
then you begin to need some kind of

00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:06,800
management um but Exodus thing I think

00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:08,630
this really the interesting thing is the

00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,880
amount of power you suddenly got

00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:18,290
this is from rubicon in Chicago where

00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:20,630
Microsoft publicly says sorry 562 the

00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,220
true pecan I mean if we have been four

00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:23,930
people down in the basement making the

00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,850
most epic system ever that just was

00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:28,700
perfectly anyway do anybody thinks that

00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:31,850
Microsoft really give a this might

00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:34,130
might be a dumb stupid little marketing

00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:36,950
stunt but I really don't care Mike

00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:39,800
receps set microsoft said sorry to us

00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:41,510
fly six they did not say so much of the

00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,550
rest of the world it was us they said

00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:46,130
that so I think that's epic to

00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:47,600
be honest I this runs on about two

00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:51,889
percent of the whole

00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:56,810
websites that feels good and that

00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:59,029
demands a brofest um and what we it kind

00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:01,220
of another helping as I see like this

00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:03,079
kind of is this two-legged monster where

00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,389
we're beginning to we have created its

00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:06,949
own firm in its own thing whenever

00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:09,440
people who's showing up to a drupal ton

00:16:06,949 --> 00:16:11,480
not to attend at the drupalcon at that

00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,550
point then we find in my mind will kind

00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,230
of changed it all all around and we kind

00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,209
of have these different groups of people

00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,880
who have to develop us and develops

00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:22,190
really like things that work like Kevin

00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,509
crap out this stuff works they will

00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,880
cause we have two designers and

00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:28,040
designers really like things that looks

00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:30,139
good that's just a thing that they like

00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,759
they don't agree upon anything that

00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:34,279
might be a discussion about typography

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,800
oh no whatever we have own little flora

00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:39,199
falls we have the DevOps who is also

00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:43,459
beginning to become a part of this whole

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:45,050
thing we have ux people coming in now

00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:47,149
actually want to have an opinion have an

00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:49,970
idea what's going on here we have two

00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:51,620
suits that's that's digging in and we

00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:53,930
have this whole group of open-source

00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,189
hippies that's coming around and the

00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,230
whole thing is how do we get all these

00:16:55,189 --> 00:16:59,089
these different groups to work together

00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:00,350
i mean just getting devops and

00:16:59,089 --> 00:17:01,970
developers in the same room chair

00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:03,889
actually a green thing and then put a

00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:07,159
design on top of that that ain't gonna

00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:08,780
happen easy and the whole thing is to be

00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:11,419
even can we even lift live together

00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:14,929
pretty much things that the well the sad

00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:16,880
news here is is actually that in the

00:17:14,929 --> 00:17:18,350
bottom line it even me as a happy little

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,209
hippie is that if you don't have any

00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:22,100
money we don't have any code we don't

00:17:20,209 --> 00:17:23,839
have no code we don't have any money so

00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,000
we kind of beginning to depend on each

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,159
other and there's no way really really

00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,960
around that so I mean the success here

00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:32,299
is actually just to hug it out there's

00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,980
to accept the fact that what we gonna

00:17:32,299 --> 00:17:35,360
have some companies you kind of push in

00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:37,370
a ton of money and we're gonna pay

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,299
some people to doing some stuff and

00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:43,159
that's just how it is and we all we all

00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:45,080
really want to claim this this ownership

00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:48,289
of this product i mean i have my front

00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:50,330
end the life I live and breathe to

00:17:48,289 --> 00:17:51,830
change them make so perfect we have

00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:54,409
other people who want to make that whole

00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:56,690
database abstraction with abstraction on

00:17:54,409 --> 00:17:58,820
all these small things and when all that

00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,710
kind of comes together and we formed

00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:01,340
this community boom actually instead of

00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:04,730
hating on

00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:06,380
begin to accepting that not everybody

00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:09,440
else that you actually have the right

00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:12,320
opinion then things were actually begins

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,690
to grow and it's it's not easy at some

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,390
point we have big ass fat vinyl

00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:21,920
that really want to be that beautiful

00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:25,520
little creature and and it's it's it's

00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:27,080
it's kind of a zit maybe it's a shared

00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,580
responsibility that we actually have to

00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:30,110
each other when you download that Google

00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:32,620
the first time I begins you use it it

00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:35,380
begins to become a thing that you just

00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:39,500
when you give that you actually get more

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:41,480
and that's where this whole there's some

00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,190
buttons walk around the community a

00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,170
couple years ago there's like hey you're

00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:48,530
the theme to my module no I'm the module

00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:51,590
to your theme it's corny as but

00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:53,360
it's kind of Shels this whole idea of I

00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,850
see how we begin to use each other

00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,120
better and not so much like hating on it

00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,500
um this is a crowd I got out of the art

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:04,340
of community but you knew breagan which

00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:06,110
is pretty much epic add that the whole

00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,700
thing about if we want to have this to

00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:10,220
work we actually need to like walk

00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,930
forward together at some point it if we

00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,340
run around in small circles and just

00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:15,920
screams and shout and battle each other

00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,360
we will not succeed a thing that's

00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,800
interesting in these communities even

00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,860
though we have existed in 10 years

00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:25,790
there's only been one fork Dean space

00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:29,000
back in 2005 and they've gone back into

00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:31,220
Drupal 4.5 so there's been like one

00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,620
little drop out and that was it so

00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:36,110
either people walking away from the

00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:38,780
project completely and will not charge

00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:41,390
it anymore or they kind of stays in this

00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:44,210
in the same kind of the same ground um

00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:46,370
and this is kind of I mean I like this

00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:48,170
idea of marching forward that's kind of

00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:51,740
a back to my bike he routes this is what

00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:54,400
we understand like that way la la or if

00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:56,540
you see the chua Venga Venga Venga Venga

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:59,660
I'm apparently the only one here who

00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:01,970
watch cycling right yes that joke did

00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:04,160
not work well well but the directions

00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:06,200
that we need to take a community is kind

00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:09,200
of a thing that can be hard if you just

00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,000
do it as we used to do then it would be

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,130
a long discussion and we will not move

00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,029
forward at all pick alone all this stuff

00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:16,369
is actually the

00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:18,139
ending a kind of group on top of his who

00:20:16,369 --> 00:20:20,179
can kind of set the rules that the

00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:22,999
boundaries of making sure stuff works

00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:25,399
this is a crowd i have from a dude i

00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:29,539
know that pretty much says how he felt

00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:31,279
about the association he loves Jubal but

00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:36,590
he doesn't give a about the drupal

00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:41,929
association well we will not tell but it

00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:45,259
is the UM I think this is very this is

00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:46,729
not a normal way of feeling about the

00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:49,429
association in Drupal community today

00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:51,320
and those reasons for that I mean it has

00:20:49,429 --> 00:20:53,029
not been good to be open it's not been

00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,609
good to doing all the right things just

00:20:53,029 --> 00:20:57,440
that's just how it is um but the thing

00:20:55,609 --> 00:20:58,969
that it needs is we need some kind of

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,909
organization of all these believeth

00:20:58,969 --> 00:21:03,799
twenty three twenty thousand plus

00:21:01,909 --> 00:21:05,539
developers and we have a million users

00:21:03,799 --> 00:21:07,669
and we have how many events a year and

00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:10,969
all this thing and we can just run

00:21:07,669 --> 00:21:12,710
around full frontal anarchy everybody

00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:15,529
wants once a different way all we can

00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:19,159
exit two heads like find a common path

00:21:15,529 --> 00:21:20,719
to walk one of the first things things

00:21:19,159 --> 00:21:22,609
we could begin to exactly to look up

00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:24,529
what kind of people we have that

00:21:22,609 --> 00:21:27,200
provides this leadership this is by the

00:21:24,529 --> 00:21:31,429
way the drupal association board this is

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:34,099
me this is me this is the days we don't

00:21:31,429 --> 00:21:39,679
have the new leader of it all Holly hi

00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:41,659
Holly she will be responsible for

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:50,690
everything the next couple of years

00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:53,450
right yeah we have a lovely staff that

00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:54,769
actually do work for us um it's been

00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:56,599
hard for a lot of people to figure out

00:21:54,769 --> 00:21:58,940
what the staff actually does one thing

00:21:56,599 --> 00:22:00,859
the step as it does is being at do

00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:03,559
bukanas making sure actually works

00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:07,070
that there is chair that's there's

00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:09,799
coffee and water and food and drinks and

00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:11,899
a printer that voice and all this stuff

00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:13,309
I mean and if anybody ever tried to do

00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:15,169
with Google done by themselves and I've

00:22:13,309 --> 00:22:17,539
tried this on my own body that's about

00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:20,210
at least a thousand hours of work doing

00:22:17,539 --> 00:22:21,799
that alongside your normal job that

00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:25,220
pretty much means you're not going to be

00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:27,559
able to breathe for you and it's just if

00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,039
we have events that that has 3,000

00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:29,690
people

00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:32,899
there's no way around it we need to have

00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:35,269
a staff we even have our little server

00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:39,169
team it's a bunch of knowledge but they

00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:40,850
keep keep the stuff running and one of

00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:42,320
the things that maybe the tubular so she

00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:44,299
has not been good at doing is active

00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:46,519
chillin what it is that it does and it's

00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:48,379
it's not so much things that they

00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:50,059
actually as far as I know they do even

00:22:48,379 --> 00:22:51,769
as a board member but it's kind of

00:22:50,059 --> 00:22:54,440
important like keeping the lights on

00:22:51,769 --> 00:22:56,679
making sure we actually have a DDOT oh

00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,419
that works so you can actually

00:22:56,679 --> 00:23:01,639
go to the website I mean we had a couple

00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:04,759
of problems earlier a bunch of years ago

00:23:01,639 --> 00:23:06,229
well actually the server burned down we

00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:09,229
now have people to take care of that we

00:23:06,229 --> 00:23:11,210
actually have a bill to pay because with

00:23:09,229 --> 00:23:14,529
a million users you don't get free

00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:16,970
access it was free hosting anymore um

00:23:14,529 --> 00:23:20,659
legal stuff when somebody with the

00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:22,129
GPL there's actually organizations to

00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:24,559
take care of that so we don't have to

00:23:22,129 --> 00:23:26,659
think about it Google cons because

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:29,269
they're big as and it costs a

00:23:26,659 --> 00:23:31,460
ton of money and they provide us a

00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:33,649
ton of money which can make us do even

00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:35,539
more things and actually can make give

00:23:33,649 --> 00:23:37,700
us an opportunity to give people things

00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:39,789
to make stuff happen but I think it's

00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:43,669
pretty awesome even coach spins can be

00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:45,619
it's kind of a thing mean when we have

00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:47,299
two big trouble tones and now this small

00:23:45,619 --> 00:23:50,960
group on down here and we have these

00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:53,659
coach pins which kind of we meet we code

00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,059
we develop and getting all that

00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:57,349
settle up it's demanding at rubicon else

00:23:56,059 --> 00:24:00,289
we would not be able to get all these

00:23:57,349 --> 00:24:02,960
people into the same room even like

00:24:00,289 --> 00:24:05,659
forward planning is a simple thing like

00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,519
oh by the way we think we want to have a

00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:09,919
true book on down and Sydney how do we

00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:11,599
do that if we didn't have a staff to

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,340
take care of that's yet it would never

00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,499
be able to happen they don't be pure

00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,090
volunteer work somebody who will have

00:24:15,499 --> 00:24:19,009
the time for that period and it

00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:21,200
basically would not work will not be

00:24:19,009 --> 00:24:24,169
able to get forward we did have growing

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,509
pains in 2012 I mean we have an office

00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:28,970
now in Portland we have structural

00:24:26,509 --> 00:24:32,269
changes all around so 2012 where maybe

00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:37,249
not the best year but then it's good at

00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:39,499
2013 because I mean in that year we know

00:24:37,249 --> 00:24:41,080
that I mean we just know this because we

00:24:39,499 --> 00:24:46,480
now have flames

00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:48,010
it I will make sure you get a Manowar I

00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:50,950
will make sure this gets trio office

00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:55,210
Holly I will make sure of that this is

00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:57,280
the drupal association 2013 apparently

00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:59,320
the people of Drupal the Republic of

00:24:57,280 --> 00:25:01,630
Drupal apparently have elected me in on

00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:03,340
one of the seats of this association and

00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:05,200
that means that we have a little bit

00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:09,880
more of X wielding a little bit less of

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:11,680
politeness but all of this stuff and the

00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,820
thing is that I mean the drupal

00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:16,810
association have been here for five

00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:20,350
years and 2 12 maybe did not go as well

00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:22,210
as it good but we do know that

00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:24,040
takes time and we take that most

00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:26,080
essential piece of thing that we have in

00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,200
the community code let's look at one of

00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:31,450
the actually one of the very first

00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:34,630
issues we had in Deauville letter you

00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:37,630
should delete his own account simple

00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:39,750
right this way say yes it's simple not

00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:45,040
come nodded smiled simple simple simple

00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:48,010
look at the date 2001 most mans up and

00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:51,940
says yes I have some signed this one to

00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:54,430
myself a month later just curious is

00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:57,790
there any progress in this tilly's users

00:25:54,430 --> 00:26:00,370
own account and most now gives in you

00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:03,280
said it it's my nemesis I cannot get

00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:05,230
this done I am done it's over anyone

00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:11,950
else it should be possible to be the

00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:14,290
leader user account this is in 2002 we

00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:16,510
have to go into 2009 before somebody

00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:18,850
finally figured how to do this and all

00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:20,230
the complex levels of stuff that

00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:23,200
actually means that we have an issue

00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:26,290
that's creating 2001 and issue that's

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:30,580
fixed in 2009 but it's not actually out

00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:32,440
before 2011 that's ten years to

00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:34,750
fix a thing that we thought was just a

00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,850
small little problem small little

00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:40,240
problem it's not a small problem it's

00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:42,280
complicated as part and unless we accept

00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,720
that some things just take a little bit

00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:46,720
more time you might think we have to

00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:48,340
right answer but I mean and this was

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,850
just a small thing but we begin to move

00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:53,620
around with almost a million users

00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:55,780
20,000 plus developers as

00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:57,730
people who had that devoted to a product

00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:00,640
because it's open source so now they

00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:02,559
both comes in with their money and also

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,800
with their heart into the project that

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:07,990
just makes things complicated and that's

00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:11,350
kind of the whole thing is that we came

00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:13,030
for this coke thing and we I mean we're

00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:15,490
staying at the end of you staying for

00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:17,290
the community that's that's that's kind

00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:19,690
of the things at least that I can see is

00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:22,420
like oh I don't agree with all the code

00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:25,180
but it's it's kind of a second family

00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:27,460
you have around him een we did jump on a

00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:29,679
plane just 25 for 22 hours to get here

00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:32,050
to see the sunrise at six instead of

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,080
eight in the morning and talk Jubal in

00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:36,760
three days and then they'll rolled back

00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,250
and do the same in about four months in

00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:41,380
and six months again and so forth just

00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:43,780
kind of a thing that you just do if

00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:48,309
anybody has feedback on this I've made

00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:49,300
this findable tinyurl and actually

00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:50,860
wanted the last thing i want to show

00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:54,480
here is actually this is actually

00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:54,480
sponsored by the troop associates

00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:04,649
so starting with community what is

00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:06,899
cumulative more and more I'm falling in

00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:08,580
love for it's the community drupal is

00:28:06,899 --> 00:28:10,259
built by an open source community of

00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,450
volunteers so the software stays

00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:13,980
up-to-date and current one of the great

00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,629
things about the Drupal community is

00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,789
they do actually get together I think

00:28:15,629 --> 00:28:20,159
one main things they're using tried and

00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:22,740
tested codes as being out of 10 years

00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:26,070
working together for something that's

00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:28,049
more than adjust yourself it's more than

00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:32,039
just being able to finish the next

00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:33,690
project it's more than just developing a

00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:36,090
bit of code that you're going to use

00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:38,820
ones and forget about it it's about a

00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:41,039
bunch of you changing each other's ideas

00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:43,080
they made you actually get to meet the

00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:46,470
people that build the core modules and

00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:49,919
the big modulus face to face value for

00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:52,019
money as a local authorities rushing in

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,820
the continental climate fighting for me

00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:56,580
is what a good a greater sprawl on a

00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:59,279
Drupal the software itself is free there

00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:00,990
is a whole world white team of Drupal

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,669
developers going to choose one to build

00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:04,500
your solution we're very keen to

00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:06,179
encourage other local authorities to

00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,950
start using Drupal for their content

00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:09,929
under system we think it's a waste of

00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:12,480
money for public site organizations to

00:29:09,929 --> 00:29:15,029
reinvent the wheel when it could put

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,450
together okay so let's talk about Drupal

00:29:15,029 --> 00:29:22,080
and maturity of course it lead to be the

00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:25,350
jira system mature system means that you

00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:28,470
get a very solid and stable environment

00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:31,409
it's very secure and it's very scalable

00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:33,659
and if there's an issue someone would

00:29:31,409 --> 00:29:34,950
have dealt with it by now constant

00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:37,080
development

00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:38,490
of anything means that you're refining

00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:41,220
and refining it's just going to get

00:29:38,490 --> 00:29:43,980
better and better early I think group

00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,840
has been quietly building and beaver in

00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,490
my inner back banner i think it's now

00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,590
finally it's time to come with agents

00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:51,590
time to hit the mainstream

00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:58,650
was a very modular system so you can

00:29:56,130 --> 00:30:00,630
build a range of different sites to will

00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:03,330
give you that flexibility you can be

00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:05,580
able to shape it to what you are there's

00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:08,309
some way like 10,000 modules available

00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:09,990
you can really plug in what if you like

00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:12,270
so you think of it in terms of

00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:14,220
construction then you you know you're

00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:17,250
adding modules reading those blocks as

00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:19,350
and when you need the functionality you

00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,820
can take those away at any time you can

00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:23,220
update home you can build your own

00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,710
blocks so it really is the ultimate

00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:28,050
flexible system you don't need to know

00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:38,520
where you're going for it you know it

00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:40,470
will be able to take you there I thought

00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,210
we would hit the video it's actually

00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:45,330
sponsored by the drupal association

00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:47,520
through one of these grants but nobody

00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:50,850
knew and that's one of the things we're

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,620
going to change in 2013 so thank you my

00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:55,679
good friends everybody I should almost

00:30:52,620 --> 00:31:00,780
no for coming for this epic session it's

00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:03,030
been enjoyable I kept it down to more

00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:06,510
than three slides a minute's wait i

00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:08,540
think is pretty rock but thank you if

00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:14,070
anybody have any kind of questions that

00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:23,570
lady and orange down there you you're

00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:23,570
good ok yeah a little shy questions yeah

00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:29,930
yeah so the tubule Association is still

00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:31,700
have a little short of money so

00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:34,130
apparently don't they don't think that

00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:36,680
that that fun is a part of two bookends

00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:38,930
it's all about business that's another

00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:41,720
thing we will change in 2013 the smoke

00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:44,180
machine will return in Portland I've

00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:50,900
even heard rumors of male strippers as

00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:53,630
well challenge accepted and I now have a

00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:57,520
director of the whole group events that

00:31:53,630 --> 00:32:01,040
looks a little bit tired a little bit

00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:09,170
yeah I'm sorry for that do we have a

00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:11,320
replacement for him all right thanks for

00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,320
