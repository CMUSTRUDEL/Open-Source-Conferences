Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Citizen Journalist: blogs, media and your editorial team
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	From small blog to national or international news site, editorial principles and content teams have similar challenges. This session covers the 24-hour news cycle, building social into digital (and occasionally into print), ethics, writers, editors, sub-editors, content strategists and how the whole shebang relates to web producers and developers.

The speaker has worked as Digital Operations Manager at NewsLocal, delivered content strategy at Greenpeace, the City of Melbourne and the University of Melbourne and was the editor of e)mag in the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age and the founding editor of internet.au in 1995.

but for those of you who weren't in

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:07,020
Josh's session Josh did a fabulous

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,809
session just before lunch about the

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:11,330
South China Morning Post and he's I'm

00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:13,769
coming from the editorial perspective

00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:15,179
and Joshua's coming from the technical

00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:20,070
perspective and hopefully we'll be able

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:22,710
to do a cross discussion together so

00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,080
first a little bit about me hi my name

00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,279
is Roseann burstyn I've been in content

00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:28,080
strategy since about nineteen

00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,570
ninety-four believe it or not when Kate

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,149
Lundy this morning said that she's been

00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:34,649
angling for an NBN since about 94 I was

00:00:33,149 --> 00:00:36,540
like yeah I remember that my wrote an

00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:40,530
article about you in 1995 when I was the

00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:42,149
editor of Internet day you so that's how

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,760
long I've been doing this and I started

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,680
life as a journalist I was the founding

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,579
editor of Internet a you I was the web

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,110
producer for choice magazine in 1998

00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:53,940
I've worked as a digital strategist with

00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,710
Fairfax the city of Melbourne the

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,620
University of Melbourne with Greenpeace

00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:03,270
with News Limited and most recently with

00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:05,970
Sydney TAFE I'm relatively platform

00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,979
agnostic I've worked with Drupal I've

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,830
worked with WordPress i worked with

00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,049
sharepoint god help me i have worked

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:19,110
with my sauce matrix I've worked with

00:01:13,049 --> 00:01:22,110
all sorts of crazy CMS's what I know

00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,360
from all of these is that the content

00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,490
strategy and the editorial strategy and

00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,170
the editorial workflow is one of those

00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,650
things that you need to work out before

00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:33,780
you start building your site and you

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,840
need to know how technical and how I

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,670
where your content team is to know how

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:43,460
they're going to work with what you've

00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:46,200
built so i'm now heading my own startup

00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:48,060
doing content and digital strategy and

00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,909
one of the things i do is i work with

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,009
agencies to help build whatever it is

00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,320
the organization i'm working with wants

00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:57,500
to do i know some of you have commented

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,200
on my chief mischief-maker title and

00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,899
that's kind of how I'm seeing myself is

00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,010
trying to take the wonderful things that

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,870
we can do

00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,760
and and make some mischief not do the

00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:10,560
same old boring stuff that we've been

00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:13,740
doing forever but do something

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:18,300
interesting and exciting um I like to

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,530
disrupt expectations when we talk about

00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,460
content strategy I want to acknowledge

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:25,410
that Angus Gordon's talk was a fantastic

00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:27,240
beginning to talking about content

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,310
strategy and one of the things that he

00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:31,230
mentioned was about how it's partly

00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,790
about your production flow and that's my

00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,270
first slide so hopefully this is a good

00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:38,130
continuation in some ways content

00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:40,080
strategy is that thing you do at the

00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:43,230
very beginning of the process where you

00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,230
say how is this site going to look what

00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:49,440
components do I have what variables were

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,060
what taxonomy is how do these things all

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,970
talk to each other where should I put

00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:57,420
this thing if I have a website that is

00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:59,280
about you know cars and their car

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:02,490
reviews of what are on my website or

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,990
tests of fridges what aspects of a car

00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:06,240
are there are there models are there

00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,800
make that their colors how do I put that

00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:10,739
on the site that's part of your content

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:12,989
strategy what I want to do is talk about

00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:16,680
what it looks like for the content

00:03:12,989 --> 00:03:19,590
producer the day that they first put in

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,340
a car into the system how they're going

00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,590
to choose these things and where it goes

00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:28,050
those of you who are in media companies

00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:30,930
will probably recognize this kind of

00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,330
crazy production workflow as one of the

00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:35,670
things that you do just about every day

00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:37,260
you know it's this thing where you're

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,120
starting with story development and

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:40,500
actually I'm not sure it's actually as

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,150
visible as it could be on this slide

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,980
sorry about that and then you're going

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,140
into production and you're writing and

00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,519
then you're moving into copy editing and

00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,260
then you publish it the publishing it's

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,000
not the end of the story because you've

00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,220
got it then grow the story with social

00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,410
media and then it all comes back down to

00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:57,840
you know this kind of story collation

00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:01,230
and story generation again and round it

00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,870
goes so it's very complex as a system

00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:07,680
and I've got a credit this is from Amy

00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:11,460
web the web media group does this look

00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,430
familiar to anyone no you

00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:16,950
some of you are nodding the primary

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:21,410
question for an editorial content team

00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:26,390
is how do we make this coherent and

00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:29,250
efficient how do we talk about our

00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:31,980
production strategy our content strategy

00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:35,900
so that we are consistently delivering

00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:38,850
the best quality content we possibly can

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,740
using the content management system that

00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:45,330
the dev teams worked so hard to build

00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:47,820
for us the worst thing that I see often

00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:49,920
is this fabulous site that's delivered

00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,890
and then about a month after its

00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,510
delivered half of the features aren't

00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:57,000
being used because the content team

00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:59,160
doesn't know how to use them they don't

00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,030
understand how to use them they've

00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,740
forgotten how to use them or they kind

00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,940
of never really asked for that they

00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,290
wanted something different it never

00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,450
quite was delivered the way that they

00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:10,740
expected so they're just going to

00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,270
shoehorn what they thought they were

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,910
going to do into some other component of

00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,530
the site instead and it ends up looking

00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:19,260
like a dog's breakfast does that sound

00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:22,320
familiar to the devs in the room yeah

00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:25,770
okay so the question is how do we make

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,730
this work properly I've been talking

00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:30,780
with a couple of other people as well

00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:32,370
about house in some CMS's you end up

00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,780
with this fabulous site furniture around

00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,960
the edges that brings your consistency

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:39,780
but that the middle of the site is just

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,970
a bucket that you took the content into

00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,470
and of course that means the contents

00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,620
not reusable because it's just a bucket

00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:48,270
you're copying and pasting and it's not

00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:52,530
consistent because it's just a bucket

00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:53,850
and so right at that very beginning

00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,440
where you're having that strategy

00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,720
discussion with the editorial team is

00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,850
when you want to be talking about what

00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,270
has to be on every single one of these

00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:06,420
articles and it's not just a title and a

00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:08,040
blue and a short title and the kicker

00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:10,410
that appears on the front page that's

00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:11,910
separate from the lead that's involved

00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,740
that's separate from something else in

00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:15,150
one image and the related content or all

00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,560
those other things you know there's

00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:19,320
obviously there's the meta information

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,320
as well but if you've got video that's

00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,550
only on some stir

00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,200
is you don't want that to be an embed

00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:24,520
code that someone's just slammed in

00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:27,040
somewhere you wanted to have a video

00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,450
component that can be dragged in in the

00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:34,030
right place by someone who knows what

00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:37,000
they're doing now as I said I'm not a

00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,670
developer I'm tempted to throw over to

00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,730
Josh to jump in here because from my

00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:44,080
point of view the ideal is if your

00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:46,450
production flow is managed within your

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,220
content management system I've heard a

00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:51,040
lot of people talking this weekend about

00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:53,650
this week about some emails that get

00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,670
flicked to people in queues to tell you

00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:57,010
that there's something ready for you to

00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:58,420
do I'd prefer not to be switching in and

00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,340
out of my CMS to know what I'm supposed

00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:03,520
to do and one of the things I've seen

00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:07,960
work pretty well his workbench which is

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:10,870
a suite of modules that has workbench

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,860
access and workbench node q & workbench

00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:17,530
moderation that allows you as an editor

00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,870
to take the different levels that people

00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:21,160
have and move them through move an

00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:23,980
article through and you can login to

00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,260
your workbench and again sorry about the

00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:29,050
resolution of image at the top there it

00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:31,240
says content I've edited and it tells

00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,310
that person who which articles though

00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,960
they're working on right now and what

00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,690
materials available for them to work on

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,390
in Drupal and they can see you can you

00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,660
as an editor can log in and see who's

00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:45,180
working on what in what ways and

00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:49,690
moderate the articles as it goes through

00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:52,120
and I you know got to tip my hat over

00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:54,900
here to David who yesterday showed me

00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:58,570
some new things as well with panoply and

00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:00,880
with the inline editing with spark is it

00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:03,250
which is fantastic you know from now on

00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,290
I'm recommending those to anyone who's

00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,930
trying to do a conta site for content

00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:10,900
editors because it instantly makes it so

00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:12,640
much easier for those content editors to

00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,710
see what they're doing in and edit the

00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,180
right sections of the page and not get

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:17,710
confused about what they're doing and

00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,090
thinking oh well I don't know where it

00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,350
goes I don't know what's going on I

00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,120
haven't gotten to that point in the

00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:28,410
forum soul just stick it up here where

00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:28,410
it doesn't belong so

00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:32,800
I think I put some of this in because I

00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,240
didn't know who I was going to be

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,229
talking to you I think that you all know

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:39,940
about creating you know content people

00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:42,039
with the right levels of permissions and

00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,210
about not having nodes published

00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:47,170
immediately I don't think I need to say

00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:49,750
that what some of you won't know is

00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:51,850
about what the newsroom's of the future

00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:54,030
looking like now I worked for news

00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:58,210
limited as a digital operations manager

00:08:54,030 --> 00:09:00,280
from 2011 22 2012 i had a hundred and

00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:03,970
seventy journalists photographers and

00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:05,950
editors working with us on 23 sites so i

00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:10,150
was working for news local which is the

00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:11,950
local newspapers i imagine a number of

00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:14,920
you're aware of in a West Korea North

00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:17,380
Shore times black tan advocate went with

00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:22,300
Korea all of those are part of that

00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:24,340
family and one of the things that news

00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,600
limited and fairfax and just about

00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:28,240
everyone else i know what we're working

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,570
towards is a design similar to this

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:33,070
which comes from in an innovation

00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:36,880
company in the city i think they're

00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:41,740
based in spain actually and this central

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:45,240
desk is called the super desk and the

00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:48,730
idea of the super desk is that the

00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:51,100
editor-in-chief and the picture editor

00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:53,830
and all of the key editorial people now

00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:57,310
sit in the center of the room and around

00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:59,500
those chiefs now sit the print team the

00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:02,080
social team the editorial teams the

00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:04,900
image graphics team and then on the very

00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,390
edges you've got the TV screens and the

00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:10,810
video screens in the broadcast and the

00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:11,770
social media monitoring spaces now not

00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,270
all of you are going to be working with

00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:16,150
enormous companies but even if you've

00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:18,730
only got five staff I think this is one

00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:22,480
of the ways you want to start to set

00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:25,390
yourselves up so that you can scale when

00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,350
you get there and those chiefs can you

00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:32,320
can optimize the inputs and outputs of

00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:33,880
your content you're also dealing in the

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,890
in the newsroom of the future with the

00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,329
24-hour news space and you all know this

00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,399
your

00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:40,230
with this but what you may not know is

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,089
that even the News Limited's of the

00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:45,269
world are now all talking about digital

00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:46,619
first there is no such thing anymore as

00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,749
a print journalist there is just a

00:10:46,619 --> 00:10:50,489
journalist there is no such thing

00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:53,309
anymore as a morning and afternoon paper

00:10:50,489 --> 00:10:55,079
really everything just goes online and

00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:58,589
then it gets callated and pulled out

00:10:55,079 --> 00:11:03,179
into print and is that true of not from

00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:05,160
them so let's switch over here oh yeah

00:11:03,179 --> 00:11:15,649
there a second is there's a second mic

00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:20,790
over there oh really it does okay cool

00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:24,179
so just a quick comment on with how it

00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:28,009
was we've worked in Asia they actually

00:11:24,179 --> 00:11:36,089
were sort of teaching do you need to

00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:39,480
really that's way okay so you need to

00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:43,319
look at media each medium that you your

00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:45,449
mediate as different targets operate for

00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:48,259
different things so for example paper

00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:51,149
always goes out in the morning and

00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:54,410
internet goes up they at different

00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:54,410
points as going in and out doesn't it

00:11:56,029 --> 00:12:03,749
yeah and and so look if they looked at a

00:12:00,449 --> 00:12:05,489
store apple I think it was I keep going

00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:11,040
this way just in case it makes things

00:12:05,489 --> 00:12:15,360
better perhaps anyone off talk see if

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:18,259
that helps at all so it's a given event

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,819
i think the the example they showed was

00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:24,480
as an asian country so i came in but it

00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:25,949
was say it was Taiwan one event to be

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,569
able to host in their country and the

00:12:25,949 --> 00:12:30,029
whole country was really happy about it

00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:32,579
that decision was made at two o'clock in

00:12:30,029 --> 00:12:35,009
the afternoon so when that happened it

00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:36,749
was on TV it got put up in social media

00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:38,579
everyone was really happy about it the

00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:40,379
news companies at the time should have

00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:43,799
pushed everything to their online

00:12:40,379 --> 00:12:45,839
platforms at that time and then the next

00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:48,990
day the paper came out and it was still

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,130
pushing that same message but in reality

00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,140
at that

00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:53,490
stage people had already gotten over the

00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:54,780
fact that that had happened that already

00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,120
on this celebration with their workmates

00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,310
it you know from two to three four or

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,060
five and come the morning they're ready

00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:05,880
for the next exit of news so instead you

00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:07,800
need to look at what I target the news

00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,210
and because it is a current event and

00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,820
the term current has just changed from

00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:13,290
being once a day to all the time and so

00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,360
instead the paper now needs to be

00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:17,220
planned to be pushing out something that

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,930
preempts what's going to happen the day

00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,990
here don't look back on what happen

00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:30,810
yesterday so I think that's just the one

00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:33,780
point I had as a Christian flammer I'm

00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:35,010
I'm print and news media is the first

00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,470
time I've been involved in this industry

00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:38,910
i'm more of a deaf guy software guy so

00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:43,710
but i'm working with a client who

00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:45,810
primarily print but they recognize that

00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:47,580
you know they need to be online so they

00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:50,190
do have a website it's kind of crappy so

00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,640
so we're implementing drupal right but

00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:54,990
one of the problems they are facing is

00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:57,840
internal struggles between the print

00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:59,880
editorial team and the web editorial

00:13:57,840 --> 00:14:02,460
team and i'll add to adium have a mobile

00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:05,340
editorial team and they each publish

00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:08,190
different types of content often of the

00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:10,200
same title and one of the things i'd

00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:13,080
like to ask you based on that point is

00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:15,120
that one of the strategies this company

00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:17,940
is thinking of i'm not sure you know

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:22,470
where the guy end up with but because

00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:26,490
online is 24 hours and once in news hit

00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:28,500
the floor it goes online so and you know

00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:31,020
by the time the print comes out it's all

00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:32,670
news so they're trying to change your

00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:35,280
strategy so that the news that gets

00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:37,280
printed is more in depth and provide a

00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:40,380
different type of content that's

00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,570
satisfied those people who still enjoy

00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,040
having a print medium and then they also

00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:49,650
have a weekly publication where it goes

00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:50,730
really in-depth absolutely so wait not

00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:55,620
again yeah

00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:59,699
it's just angled wrong right um and

00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:02,459
that's not gonna oh well um I would say

00:14:59,699 --> 00:15:03,690
that that's absolutely absolutely the

00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:05,730
case it's sort of one of the things that

00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:08,730
happen with every single level of media

00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:10,110
that's when radio came out that changed

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:11,399
the way magazines will read and when TV

00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,560
came out it changed the way you had to

00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,639
use radio and you know the internet came

00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,740
out it's changed the way you have to use

00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,329
the previous media and absolutely you

00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,519
know you start to see more analytical

00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:23,430
pieces in print because you've got that

00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:25,320
longer time and the the breaking news is

00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:26,699
now the web so you don't see the

00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:28,320
breaking news story with the big

00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,730
announcement anymore you've got the more

00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,889
in-depth analytical piece in the print

00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:35,089
but the other thing that um that what

00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:38,070
your questions made me think of is that

00:15:35,089 --> 00:15:39,269
with news limited with what one of the

00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:42,510
things that they've done now is they've

00:15:39,269 --> 00:15:45,089
got a news team that's doing kind of

00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:46,769
eighty percent of the work for

00:15:45,089 --> 00:15:48,060
everything and then the other twenty

00:15:46,769 --> 00:15:50,699
percent is being pulled in from the

00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:52,470
other places so they're straight you

00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:54,240
know the Australian and The Daily

00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,560
Telegraph side and the news com site and

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,480
all of those other things on the iPad

00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:01,260
side etc there's kind of this eighty

00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:03,050
percent that's common and then the

00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:08,610
twenty percent that's being done by the

00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:11,639
other teams to localize or specialized

00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:14,250
so that that material is relevant for

00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:16,639
that audience so if there's a mobile

00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:19,019
content it's going to be more tightly

00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,060
designed for the mobile space and then

00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:23,730
if you've got your local paper then it's

00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:26,160
more coordinated for your local area but

00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:34,290
the you know you can scale up or scale

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:35,880
down pretty quickly okay um I also when

00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:38,279
I was at choice magazine we had the same

00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:42,510
problem with moving on to web they used

00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:45,899
to be a two month cycle between testing

00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:49,470
and print and we were trying to we had a

00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:50,639
big change process to get the testers to

00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:52,139
put their data straight into the

00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,889
database that when straight onto online

00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:57,810
and then have the print product come out

00:16:55,889 --> 00:17:00,240
afterwards with the summary of the best

00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:01,470
products and that was a huge process and

00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,440
that was sort of you know an ongoing

00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:10,870
thing in nineteen

00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:13,360
the 8th even yeah sorry Oh with choice

00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:16,689
magazine it's like come if like consumer

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:18,790
reports or which online or um continent

00:17:16,689 --> 00:17:20,980
and bond it's so they when they say best

00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:26,079
I mean at that time they were doing a

00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:27,640
barrage of tests for whatever it was and

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,350
one of the things about online which was

00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,520
interesting is that people want to rate

00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:31,900
their own stuff and say well this is

00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,920
budgets more important to me this is

00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,110
more important to me that's one of the

00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,640
reasons why it needed to go online first

00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:38,410
because the print product sort of comes

00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,580
out with well this is the top one

00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:42,340
according to the editors but online

00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:46,090
people want to be able to rate their own

00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:48,370
stuff but that's separate so um I don't

00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:50,860
want to I'm going to run pretty quickly

00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:52,150
through the content stuff that I want to

00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,650
talk about so we can get on to some of

00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:57,850
the paywall stuff because obviously

00:17:53,650 --> 00:18:01,170
that's also important so I'm going to

00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:03,850
take you through an example news story

00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:05,470
there's no one production flow but once

00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:06,760
you've got your production flow you want

00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,280
that to be the same for every single

00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:11,110
story that you produce except for the

00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,370
breaking news because obviously if there

00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,770
is something absolutely massive and

00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:16,690
major that's just happened like you know

00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:21,100
some famous figure has just killed

00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:23,260
themselves or for me at News Limited the

00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,090
example was some the guys strapping a

00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:29,430
bomb to his 11-year old daughter I think

00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:35,740
it was last year you need to be able to

00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:38,140
rush through very quickly and get to a

00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:41,260
manager who knows both the editorial and

00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:44,440
the legal and so on and so forth um and

00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:46,000
I'm just no that's all right I'm just

00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:50,200
switching it around so it doesn't keep

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:56,440
flipping it's just held wrong is that

00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:57,880
the problem no worries sorry um I don't

00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,230
want to stand in front of the as akin

00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:05,200
evidence they'll see that that's why I'm

00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:07,150
standing to the side um so you so you've

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,770
got you've got your basic editorial flow

00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:10,660
and then you've got your fast-track

00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:13,240
editorial flow and since that's

00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:15,940
something that needs to happen in the in

00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:17,799
the editorial room your technique

00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,659
all system needs to be able to cope with

00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:22,000
that as well you need some way of

00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:23,649
flagging this is a breaking news story

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,850
or a fast-track story and so it's

00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:29,259
allowed to skip through some of the

00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:30,309
production steps because the one person

00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:33,250
is going to be checking it and they're

00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:35,769
going to be bored stiff with having to

00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:38,259
go through the three steps that normally

00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:39,730
have to be gone through instead of the

00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:45,879
one when they're trying to get something

00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:46,929
out before the competitor so I'm going

00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:50,049
to start with the beginning of a story

00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:51,820
traditionally what happened with print

00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:53,409
stories is that interactive was thought

00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,669
of last and putting it on the web was

00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:57,789
thought I've last and so there was never

00:19:54,669 --> 00:20:02,230
any time to deliver from the really cool

00:19:57,789 --> 00:20:03,370
stuff that you wanted to do and I can't

00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:05,440
tell you how many times I've dealt with

00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:06,519
stories where they it's in print and

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,169
they come to me after that's been

00:20:06,519 --> 00:20:09,490
printed and they say hey we've been

00:20:08,169 --> 00:20:11,379
talking about this and we think that we

00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:13,809
could do this thing it's like well now

00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:16,570
you've got half an hour that's we can't

00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:17,850
there's no way the devs can do what

00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:20,230
you're talking about in half an hour

00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:22,960
whereas if they'd pitched that at the

00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:24,009
same time as they pitched the story the

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,299
devs could have been working on it while

00:20:24,009 --> 00:20:27,159
they were doing the research and it

00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:29,529
could all be delivered at once so I want

00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:32,080
to take you through an example where one

00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:33,370
of our journalists Tyrone butson had all

00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,850
of the coordinates of all of the

00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:37,929
fracking sites in Sydney so for those of

00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:40,559
you who don't know the word fracking

00:20:37,929 --> 00:20:43,570
we're talking about coal seam gas drills

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,429
and he had been doing what he's supposed

00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:46,840
to do he'd been monitoring the social

00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:48,759
media and he'd seen that there were

00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,639
protest groups out there very upset

00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:53,559
about coal seam gas and so he had

00:20:51,639 --> 00:20:55,600
gathered all of the geo-coordinates into

00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:58,000
a spreadsheet he went took it to the

00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,230
news producer the news producer says yep

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,779
great idea what he want to do with it he

00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:03,370
says I think an interactive map great so

00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:07,929
it comes to me as the digital manager

00:21:03,370 --> 00:21:09,789
and I bring in devs and together as a

00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:12,879
combination as a cross-functional

00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:15,190
production team we have discussions

00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:18,250
about this data what are the dimensions

00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:20,700
of the data how what can we do to that

00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:24,340
data to reveal more information about it

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:26,379
is it can we size or color code

00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,370
something to make something more obvious

00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:30,590
about it

00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:31,700
and in the end we talked about the depth

00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:33,559
of the wells and whether it's a

00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,970
production well around or an expansion

00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:36,020
well and all those sorts of things you

00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:38,030
also talk about what tools you're going

00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:40,040
to use and the devs can go away now what

00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:41,809
happens how does everyone know what

00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:45,309
they're supposed to do the editor

00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:47,450
hopefully is going to write a brief

00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:50,570
summarizing that meeting so that

00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:54,170
everyone in the team the journalist the

00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:55,940
editors the production the devs know

00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:59,059
what's been agreed and can deliver and

00:21:55,940 --> 00:22:00,410
know what the deadline is right you know

00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:02,990
hopefully we're talking in the same

00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:04,580
levels here now how do is ever know that

00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,990
um one of the ways of doing it is

00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,030
attaching a note somewhere as a block

00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:11,210
that has certain permissions so that

00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:12,980
only you can see it our only the right

00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:14,900
people can see it and then you've got

00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:16,850
the brief in the system with the article

00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,530
why is the article there because the

00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:20,059
production editor creates an empty shell

00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:23,420
of the article even though the content

00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:24,950
hasn't been written yet so it's already

00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:29,210
in workbench it's already on its way

00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:30,140
through the system I'm not going to

00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:32,090
concentrate on this too much because

00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,190
from the sounds of it the people who are

00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:36,110
here from content or any do media and

00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:38,510
the people who aren't here from content

00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:39,740
Adair was not working on blogs but don't

00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:42,710
let the speed of the cycle get in the

00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:45,080
way of facts and ethics and it doesn't

00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:47,390
just happen to small companies NPR and

00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:50,320
Reuters got caught by the fact that this

00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:52,540
guy calling himself comfortably smug was

00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:56,480
putting out false information about

00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:58,250
hurricane sandy about power outages and

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,420
mayor's being trapped and things like

00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:04,340
that turns out he was a Republican aide

00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:07,100
okay but NPR and what is both retweeted

00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:09,080
him because they thought they didn't

00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,880
have time to check it's always important

00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:15,410
to check my other favorite is

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:18,020
photographs the top one is actually from

00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:19,790
the day after tomorrow the 2004 movie

00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:22,100
and as you can see someone's

00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:24,110
photographed it photoshopped it to add a

00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:27,470
new strap to make it look more obvious

00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:30,380
more real and the bottom one's harder to

00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:33,050
pick it actually is a real storm but it

00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:38,000
happened in april 2011 so it's not

00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:39,380
hurricane sandy so just to note to any

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,700
of you who are at tim berners-lee on

00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,110
tuesday night will have heard this as

00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,700
well

00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:46,220
we've gotta stop concentrating on the

00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,420
death of print media and remember that

00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:51,559
we're still in the business of producing

00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:55,730
quality journalism right doesn't matter

00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:58,010
what format it's out there in thankfully

00:23:55,730 --> 00:24:00,320
no media organizations that I know of

00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:05,870
were fooled by the photoshopped images

00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:08,090
of sharks in people's backyards okay so

00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:09,500
now we're up to story delivery so the

00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,150
deadlines they're all the contents

00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,309
entered into Drupal the writer is adding

00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,690
the links and images in our content

00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:15,919
process in your content process you

00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:17,390
might have someone else doing the images

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:20,390
you might have someone else doing the

00:24:17,390 --> 00:24:22,400
metadata the way that News Limited's

00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:26,299
working at the moment is that there's a

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,309
home page editor who takes the story as

00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:29,840
it's been done and that home page editor

00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:32,390
is the person who adds all the metadata

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,770
and redoes the title for web if it's

00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:35,510
already but if it's only been done for

00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:37,429
print and that there's kind of a fork to

00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:39,919
process at that point where the print

00:24:37,429 --> 00:24:42,020
subs it with the writers writing for

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,120
everywhere but the print subs and the

00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:46,429
online subs are doing it differently at

00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:49,220
that point and again that's not

00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:52,130
necessarily your system but whatever

00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:54,140
your system is do it the same way and

00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,210
then the web producer ads in the

00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:57,860
interactive from the devs and checks the

00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:59,809
related content and checks the metadata

00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,280
and the copy editor is doing all that

00:24:59,809 --> 00:25:03,590
fun stuff that copy editors have done

00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:05,330
through time immemorial their ringing

00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:06,530
phone numbers they're clicking on links

00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:07,669
they're checking that it all works

00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:11,240
properly and of course they just got

00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:13,040
more work than they ever did before in

00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:16,760
our case we did our visualization using

00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,660
a product called tableau and if you

00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:19,790
haven't heard of it it's quite a

00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:22,669
powerful little tool and it does have a

00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:24,919
module called media tableau which relies

00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:30,309
on the media module and to bring in

00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:33,320
tableau into into your stories in Drupal

00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:35,270
this is just to give you a quick image

00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,799
of what that looked like and as you can

00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:38,510
see what we ended up choosing was that

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,850
we would color code whether whether it

00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:43,340
was exploratory or production and that

00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:46,880
the depth was size coded so you can see

00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:48,799
that there was a a deeper than 1.5

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,000
kilometer actually I've zoomed in on

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,190
this to show you that what we ended up

00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,650
discovering was there were clusters so

00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:56,390
mapping that visualizing that helped

00:25:54,650 --> 00:26:01,630
us understand where we then had to give

00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:04,880
put those stories that the cluster of

00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:06,440
drilling sites was down near the Camden

00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,140
area so that meant that MacArthur

00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:10,880
Chronicle needed that story we saw that

00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:12,140
there was a cluster up in Central Coast

00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,410
so we knew that the Central Coast

00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:17,900
advocate needed that story and you know

00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:19,520
at this point you would start splitting

00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:21,800
those stories and localizing them go

00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,900
interview a few more people and to make

00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,280
sure that works and of course you call

00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:28,580
it can also at this point to get your

00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:30,470
front end people to make this look a

00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:32,390
little prettier by checking what classes

00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:36,560
tableau is using and making sure that it

00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:38,600
all looks gorgeous in your site how does

00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:43,480
your editor know that it's ready to work

00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:46,490
on well you need a tracking tool and

00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:48,620
again you want your tracking tool to

00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:51,500
come into your CMS because you don't

00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:53,230
want to have to switch out my favorite

00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:56,860
tracking tool at the moment is harvest

00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:59,360
anyone here already using harvest a

00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:03,500
couple of people some smiles it's a

00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:09,020
beautiful beautiful tool it has android

00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:12,620
and iphone apps and desktop web and it's

00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:15,140
got a drupal module so what you can be

00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:18,230
doing there is any time anyone's working

00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:20,330
on a project they hit start timer they

00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:21,650
choose what task they're on whether

00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,960
they're a devil whether their editorial

00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:26,030
what they're doing you've got a cost

00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:28,790
against them so it tracks up how much

00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:31,850
they're spent much their time is worth

00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:33,470
and when they're finished they can

00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:35,900
complete you can see exactly how much

00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:39,860
has been done you can add notes etc and

00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:41,870
it comes up into into Drupal in a

00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:47,690
sensible way that allows you to see

00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:51,110
where you are on each project and then

00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:52,490
the end game which I'm sure they're a

00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:54,140
better there are other ways of doing

00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:56,120
this as i said i'm not a dev so maybe

00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:59,330
I'm going to throw over here again about

00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:02,540
how you guys are doing scheduling with

00:27:59,330 --> 00:28:04,760
you know once stories in the system how

00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:07,720
does the editor say yep that's ready to

00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:12,530
go live actually the

00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:16,070
for it with it's different with ecmp

00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:21,500
because they are print first and they

00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:23,750
think later so so yeah they actually

00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:26,360
pushed the paper out to the website and

00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:27,740
then then they say we'll have that than

00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:30,290
that so by the time it gets to the

00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:33,020
website it's already in a production

00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:34,760
format so they'll just repurpose it so

00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,870
they don't that they'll change that

00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,940
we've hit but I want to change the

00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:39,620
content of the story for purpose for the

00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:42,200
width and they have a separate feed that

00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:45,290
goes out to the tablet I think currently

00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:48,410
VAR would bring to produce that so it's

00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:51,200
a little bit different they use CC I to

00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:53,299
compose all of their content rather than

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,530
you're doing it inside of Drupal we

00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:55,640
originally proposed they do it inside

00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,900
and ripple but I think it just would

00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:01,179
have been too much of a culture shift

00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:01,179
for them to want to do that yeah

00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:18,359
yep

00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:32,400
you wanted to talk about multilingual

00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,400
didn't you

00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:46,019
not really I'd actually look to the

00:29:43,470 --> 00:29:47,370
browser to provide that support there's

00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:49,470
a lot of things you can add into the

00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:52,559
browser to make that kind of stuff

00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:56,669
happen I find trying to do grammar

00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:58,440
punctuation in Drupal or even in the

00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:00,419
server end of things kind of as complex

00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,860
because you need to submit it somehow it

00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:03,509
needs to process and think about that

00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,460
and come back with recommendations and

00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:07,440
you need to do that with a locality in

00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:09,240
mind right english isn't just English

00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,860
it's us english UK english they have

00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:15,570
completely different spellings yeah i

00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:21,629
mean reversion support is easy enough

00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:23,730
and in fact no you can use diff module

00:30:21,629 --> 00:30:27,090
and you can see the changes between run

00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:29,369
revision to another and it's in fact

00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:32,070
it's kind of easier i don't know about

00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:34,679
again i'm not a Content guy but it's

00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:36,629
easier to push the thing live because

00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:38,039
it's all about that you know there's

00:30:36,629 --> 00:30:39,419
also that competitive edge you want to

00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:41,909
get that piece of news out before your

00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:44,399
competitor does it's easier to push it

00:30:41,909 --> 00:30:47,999
if it's wrong and then correct it later

00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:50,610
than it is to go late because if you get

00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:52,519
that reputation of being the first with

00:30:50,610 --> 00:31:01,470
the information even if it's misspelled

00:30:52,519 --> 00:31:03,330
it's it's a people come back to you well

00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:05,730
yeah stuff dockery indeed back home

00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,919
that's that's kind of them they they're

00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:09,600
actually owned by fairfax media and they

00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,210
have a number of papers underneath your

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,919
arm and they have this online team who

00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:15,570
will want to push current events so you

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,490
know there's a house burning and so

00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:19,169
though just take literally take stuff

00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:22,559
off Twitter and post it up there and

00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:25,529
stuff and it's it's wrong but as the

00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:37,740
story unfolds it develops and it changes

00:31:25,529 --> 00:31:44,879
and it becomes better we could just go

00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:46,320
one like better yes just um so this is

00:31:44,879 --> 00:31:49,049
where you could have a fast track

00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:51,059
process for the breaking news where you

00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:53,129
say okay the fast track doesn't go

00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:54,060
through the extensive sub editing

00:31:53,129 --> 00:31:56,880
process and

00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:58,920
and we trust that journalist is a good

00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,900
enough speller and that you're going to

00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:03,660
miss the occasional typo but your main

00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:05,190
process for your big articles should not

00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:08,240
be going straight live that's a real

00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,240
problem from my point of view

00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:22,360
yeah and and Fairfax has been teased for

00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:24,220
this mercilessly ever since they

00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,180
outsource to know I look no offense to

00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,340
New Zealand but ever since they

00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:29,530
outsource their sub editing to page

00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:32,680
masters in New Zealand it's dropped down

00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:35,440
significantly and it's very noticeable

00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:36,640
to anyone in the industry that the and

00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,440
I'm sorry if anyone who's here from

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,300
Fairfax I used to work for Fairfax I

00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:46,030
love Fairfax but unfortunately that's

00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:48,040
true and people I know and people don't

00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:49,390
have time to go back and check because

00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,440
the next things happening and the next

00:32:49,390 --> 00:32:52,030
things happening and the next things

00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,090
happening i think it is important to get

00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:56,500
it right first time I think that

00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:58,480
spelling systems are important in this

00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,790
within the CMS's and that is improving

00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,260
that built in spell checkers and you

00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:04,510
know if cater and all those sorts of

00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:06,130
things start to have spelling within

00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:09,130
them and that people need to start using

00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:10,870
them better you know news limited it's

00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:12,670
very well publicized is moving to a big

00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:15,760
system called methode and moving away

00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:17,950
from cyber page and up until now you

00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:21,160
know one when when I talk about

00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:23,290
different tracks the track 4 News

00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,630
Limited has been at least four local

00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:27,280
news you write it in cyber page unless

00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:30,490
it's breaking news in which case you

00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,870
write it into the CMS so I am talking

00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:35,140
about an ideal situation in which you

00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:37,510
write everything in the CMS but the

00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:39,670
because what was happening was a an

00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:43,900
export system from cyber page into the

00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:50,100
CMS and the idea of a fast track version

00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:50,100
of your process is very common yeah

00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:08,280
right yeah it's actually I mean it's a

00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:10,859
complex task trying to get enable people

00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,679
to do the concurrent editing that Google

00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:16,679
Docs offers because it requires a lot of

00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,210
hardware and and things that Drupal has

00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,040
actually kind of not good at you might

00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:21,510
have seen some people there's a guy here

00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,879
in Sydney actually called Justin Randall

00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:25,980
who has been working with no jes

00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:28,350
technology which is super fast and

00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:30,240
responsive and he's been working with

00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:32,190
integrating that into Drupal so that you

00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,290
can push something and pull it at the

00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:35,609
same time and interact with people in

00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:37,859
the same space and that would be the

00:34:35,609 --> 00:34:39,780
kind of place that you need to go what

00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:42,000
Google Docs have done and is pretty

00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,470
impressive they also you probably where

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,570
they also create a google wave in fact

00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:48,210
that came out of Sydney and it's dead

00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:49,350
because it just kind of didn't mean it

00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:51,389
while it was great you can you know

00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:52,710
fast-forward and rewind and look at

00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:54,359
different parts of the document and

00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:56,129
things not really kind of got the idea I

00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:57,780
think it's what failed or maybe it was

00:34:56,129 --> 00:34:59,430
just wasn't very performant and browsers

00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,080
or something like that but there's an

00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,640
incredible amount of revision and

00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,140
thought and process it needs to go into

00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,470
that when you start talking about

00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:09,840
parallel editing and revision and

00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:11,369
tracking who did what it gets very

00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,600
complex you thing within the amount of

00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:15,359
metadata that needs to be associated

00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,280
with every single keystroke you start to

00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:19,800
really blow up the amount of data that

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,930
you're storing and tracking so I don't

00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:24,119
think that's going to happen and dribble

00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:26,940
anytime soon mainly because it's so

00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:29,280
specific that it would require a

00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,780
significant amount of investment and I

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,340
haven't seen anyone putting up their

00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:34,680
hand and saying yeah I'll fork out the

00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:37,740
dollars for that piece of development to

00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:41,580
occur so yeah I think it for now we're

00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:43,109
kind of more left with revision and

00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:45,330
googled working around Google Docs well

00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:46,859
you can you could you could offer the

00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:49,680
content in Google Docs if you wanted to

00:35:46,859 --> 00:35:52,560
it exports out into several different

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,240
formats HTML open document formats and

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,830
there are certainly importers that you

00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,590
can use to bring them into Drupal so you

00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:00,420
could get dibs to do that absolutely you

00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,400
would be also content authoring your

00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:05,250
content and Google Docs and leading them

00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,520
host that data that you care about so

00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:07,520
much

00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:18,740
yeah so they don't have voice low yeah

00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,740
there's a greater back there

00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:46,890
why thank you for your timing because

00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:49,920
that's my second note there yeah I mean

00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:52,350
I think look the NPR model everyone's

00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,670
kind of amazed and it's a it's a huge

00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,920
and amazing thing and if you are that

00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:57,450
big then absolutely that's what needs to

00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,520
happen and as I say news limited to

00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:02,760
doing that with my third now which is

00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,130
the same thing that the Chicago times

00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:08,460
use one of the papers over there users

00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:11,910
as well and it's exactly that situation

00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:13,830
where you want to be able to put content

00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:15,510
you know design neutral content in and

00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:22,650
it needs to be able to report be

00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:24,570
repurposed and I think that that is it

00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:26,340
really is what you need to be able to do

00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:29,280
and it's just a matter of who's doing

00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:31,620
which components of it because one

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,230
person can't have all of those skills

00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:36,360
necessarily and as I said before the way

00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:38,850
that news is handling that at the moment

00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,470
is that the journalists are putting in

00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:42,720
most of the content with a view to the

00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:47,370
fact that it's going into multiple areas

00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:50,150
and then right at the very end see what

00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:52,620
what you said so till it's old model oh

00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:54,300
this is going to be in the paper I'm

00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:55,920
only going to do it for the paper all

00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,660
now we're taking this thing for the

00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,070
paper we better put it online oh it

00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,990
needs lots of work to change it to

00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:02,670
online all now I'm going to promote it

00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:06,660
in social how do i do that all I need to

00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:09,240
do this right new model I'm doing this

00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:10,740
all and it's going all the way through

00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,330
its getting attached to images it's

00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,500
getting attached to content it's getting

00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:15,600
attached to meditate it's getting

00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:19,650
attached to everything and only right at

00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:21,210
the very end do I have oh I'm a print

00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:22,590
person I'm going to pull these bits of

00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:25,050
stuff that I need from that story and

00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:26,250
put it into the layout I'm a web person

00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:27,630
I'm going to pull these bits of the

00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:30,060
content that's in there and put it into

00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:32,700
the layout and I need I need the

00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:34,260
metadata I need the short heading I'm

00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:36,240
not going to use the long heading I do

00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:38,610
need this kick or I don't need that one

00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,260
I do need this I don't need that oh I'm

00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:44,130
the ipad editor I'm going to grab these

00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:45,690
bits of it and so it's and it's all the

00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:46,650
way through the system and it's tagged

00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:48,630
in and so any

00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:50,520
and like I said before that someone's

00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:54,060
coming in and putting into the CMS the

00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:56,910
photographers are not putting something

00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:58,380
into an image system over there that

00:38:56,910 --> 00:39:00,000
then has to be exported for print

00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,000
separately from being exported for web

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,080
they're going in and they're attaching

00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:09,860
print quality images into the CMS the

00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:12,510
CMS automatically outputs at correct

00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:16,170
resolutions for multiple uses that the

00:39:12,510 --> 00:39:18,780
editors at the end can choose and you

00:39:16,170 --> 00:39:20,550
know i think that the sort of massive

00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:22,410
content repository that the sps people

00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:24,360
were talking about yesterday is that

00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:26,670
classic example that you need to have

00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:28,140
this huge system that takes care of all

00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:33,090
your content so that it can be used

00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:36,480
multiple times in multiple ways does

00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:39,840
that answer the question yep good um so

00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,800
um this this end game I wasn't going to

00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:44,820
talk about polls because I wasn't

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:49,080
technical but I'd love to also what my

00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:51,150
end game as a content person is that we

00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,740
then need to do social digital and print

00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:54,990
and it's not about the technology it's

00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:56,310
about how the message shifts in the

00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:59,460
different contexts which I think I've

00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:02,040
now talked to which is great thank you

00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:03,720
for the question um so I'm going to talk

00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:07,800
a little bit about social interdigital

00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:09,270
and single sign-on open ID and how this

00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,740
functions but I think that this is

00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:13,860
exactly where we start talking about

00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:16,830
freemium and premium because what's

00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:21,660
happening with does everyone know what i

00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:24,090
mean by single sign-on yep good so one

00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:26,790
of the one of the things with your

00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:28,820
single sign-on systems is you instantly

00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:32,460
know a whole lot of data about people

00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:35,190
the news limited system for the

00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:37,380
australian is a freemium system where if

00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:39,990
you if you google the article you can

00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,970
get through i think five times through

00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:43,350
clicking and then it says hang on you've

00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:47,190
read 5 articles for free we're going to

00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:51,060
start charging you the new york times i

00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:54,030
think lets you read 20 a month and these

00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:56,670
are the kinds of new systems that's and

00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:59,580
these are not using your sign ons that

00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:00,450
it's it's a different system then you

00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,880
sign on but you

00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:04,349
signing on registering so far with their

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,619
own system I don't know if there's a way

00:41:04,349 --> 00:41:10,890
of combining that with social sign-on

00:41:06,619 --> 00:41:13,619
yeah I think Oh specifically speaking to

00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:15,210
pay walls you can I mean there's a quite

00:41:13,619 --> 00:41:17,010
a number of ways that you can make that

00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:19,920
paywall work and I guess it's all about

00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:23,250
figuring out for your platform what's

00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,020
the best way to make that work and so in

00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:28,050
the case of SCMP they were told that

00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:29,760
they could do a metered trial sort of

00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:31,560
thing in the similar fashion to New York

00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:33,329
Times so they read it X number of

00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,800
articles and they get prompted to sign

00:41:33,329 --> 00:41:37,140
on and then they knew that's all they'd

00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,670
get allocated for the month there been

00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,619
other models as well for example there's

00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:43,200
the freemium idea where you actually can

00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:44,790
read the paper for free but then there's

00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,339
sort of add-ons that you pay for that

00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:50,609
make it more valuable to you and people

00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:52,920
who are really into a particular brand

00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:54,630
of news they're really interested in

00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:56,970
that they will absolutely pay for those

00:41:54,630 --> 00:41:59,369
kind of add-ons for example if you want

00:41:56,970 --> 00:42:01,170
to get used to your mobile device we

00:41:59,369 --> 00:42:02,369
just pay for the app and you make money

00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:03,720
through that and things are there and

00:42:02,369 --> 00:42:04,859
there can be kind of a different model

00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,740
and I guess it's really more of a

00:42:04,859 --> 00:42:10,770
business devil type thing deciding how

00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:13,560
you want to make those models work for

00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:16,079
you technically the only thing I could

00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:19,410
really sort of encourage you to do is

00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:22,220
not do anonymous meter trialing because

00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:26,010
it's incredibly difficult to enforce its

00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:27,329
you know you put the capability to track

00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:29,220
somebody in the hands of the person

00:42:27,329 --> 00:42:30,839
you're tracking they can just decide to

00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:32,640
drop it and pick up a new one the start

00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,990
from scratch again so there's an easy

00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:35,460
ways of getting around it if you're

00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:37,260
smart enough you know it's either that

00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,760
or you know if you think that maybe

00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:40,109
ninety eight percent of your client base

00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,450
aren't smart enough to do it then just

00:42:40,109 --> 00:42:43,230
don't worry about to the senton and

00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:45,630
forget about it that's the same thing

00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:46,829
with like yo banks and credit cards you

00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,270
know they know the credit card for word

00:42:46,829 --> 00:42:49,859
is huge but they you know that just pay

00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:53,640
it back anyway because it's worth having

00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:57,140
critic ads around so that I think is you

00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,140
know this advice Dave

00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:06,020
absolutely

00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:19,240
yet you're absolutely right so they do

00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:21,400
that and I guess for the most part

00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,480
that's like the numbers so high that you

00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,070
don't actually care at the beginning

00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,770
about getting rid of it and then you

00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:27,970
start using the 20 and you know 20 down

00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,349
the track you can't really enjoying the

00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:30,670
experience and maybe when you start to

00:43:29,349 --> 00:43:32,980
feel guilty like actually I should

00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:36,720
perhaps pay instead of wiping my cookies

00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:39,970
and and starting from scratch again yeah

00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:43,510
can I just point out that I probably am

00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:47,230
NOT allowed to say the numbers but New

00:43:43,510 --> 00:43:49,570
York Times and The Australian end news

00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:51,490
locals experiences I think pretty

00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:54,270
similar and New York Times has spoken

00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:56,950
about this in public a little bit that

00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:59,920
despite the millions and millions and

00:43:56,950 --> 00:44:01,810
millions of page views per month the

00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:05,220
number of people who actually come back

00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:09,820
on a regular basis is very small

00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:11,470
proportionally and you don't need to

00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,599
worry too much about the techie people

00:44:11,470 --> 00:44:15,550
who are going to clear their cases

00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,410
because they're not necessarily you're

00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:20,920
absolutely regular readers anyway and

00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:23,680
the absolutely regular readers who pay

00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,420
can the price points have been set in

00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,550
such a way that they should make it work

00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:29,829
because what you're doing is saying i

00:44:27,550 --> 00:44:32,260
don't mind giving away one article every

00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:33,280
six months to that to this huge number

00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,470
of people but they're only gonna look at

00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:40,290
one article every six months what I'm

00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:42,810
trying to do is say I you those you know

00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:46,660
10 out of 100 people or whatever it is

00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:47,859
you rely on us you can't survive in your

00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:51,040
business day without us so you're

00:44:47,859 --> 00:44:54,400
prepared to pay the other 12 is just

00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,930
before your question is that you when

00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,369
you are tracking someone to how many

00:44:55,930 --> 00:44:59,140
views they can have you can only track

00:44:57,369 --> 00:45:01,420
them on the device and i don't mean the

00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:03,460
physical device i mean on the software

00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:05,650
device that you're using so you know

00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:07,960
every into every web browser that you've

00:45:05,650 --> 00:45:09,190
got installed has its own limit then you

00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,690
can switch to your phone into your

00:45:09,190 --> 00:45:11,740
tablet and they have different browsers

00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:13,839
as well then you've got your work

00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:15,550
computer so you know even though you

00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:17,140
might only get your 20 articles a month

00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:18,550
in new york time as well you can bust

00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:21,490
through that in a week on one device and

00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:24,760
switch so it really doesn't work unless

00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:27,310
you can ask people to invest in the

00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:29,410
meter as in put your username and

00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:31,570
password and you can only get access to

00:45:29,410 --> 00:45:33,760
meter through a user and password then

00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:35,260
you can track on this on your server how

00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,750
many views have had and you can enforce

00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:39,310
that across the device but news agencies

00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:41,080
don't want people to do that because

00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:42,910
they'll just leave they think that

00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:45,580
that's important it's also probably with

00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:48,310
also considering there are there are

00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:51,460
news companies out there that have a

00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:54,250
complete paywall block and you can't see

00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:57,490
anything without signing in and they

00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:59,110
have a very small number of users but

00:45:57,490 --> 00:46:00,610
they will pay a subscription fee and

00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:02,320
they make just as much money as people

00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:04,720
to implement me to trial so you need to

00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:06,400
understand that the kind of users that

00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,630
you have you are they kind of one hit

00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,370
time and they go away and never come

00:46:07,630 --> 00:46:11,230
back with maybe premiums better or if

00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:13,300
they are you know constant users or you

00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:14,680
know you can't sort of say here's a

00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,730
one-size thing that fits everyone

00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:17,320
because you need to understand your

00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:18,930
traffic before you start making

00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:21,070
decisions on how those should work

00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:24,190
there's also kind of almost a system

00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:26,350
called annoy miam which is some which is

00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:27,850
the crikey model where you can sign in

00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:30,130
for free and then they send you emails

00:46:27,850 --> 00:46:31,990
constantly telling you that you are you

00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:35,230
know a lazy bum who is stealing from

00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:37,630
them and you should really pay and then

00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:44,500
they start saying to you know hi you

00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:46,390
know um sorry you know hi squatter you

00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:48,940
know is how the email starts how are you

00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:51,610
doing today you know so um look I want

00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:53,170
to I will we've got sort of 10 minutes

00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:54,190
left and I want to quickly touch on a

00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:57,520
couple of other things and then come

00:46:54,190 --> 00:47:00,910
back to questions so one of the things

00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:03,610
was about tagging and taxonomy and how

00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:05,200
they can feed into social everything in

00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:07,180
our system was automatically tagged and

00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:09,670
that meant it could be then fed into

00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:12,070
yahoo pipes is anyone aware of yahoo

00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:13,360
pipes so you can then feed that into

00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:15,640
yahoo pipes which then feeds into

00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:19,570
twitter feeds which then feeds into

00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:23,230
twitter and other anywhere else that you

00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:24,730
can stick an RSS feed so for example the

00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:26,530
story the fracking story i was talking

00:47:24,730 --> 00:47:29,680
about before would have been tagged with

00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:32,230
environment council macarthur central

00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,730
coast in a west because of the petersham

00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:36,940
town are not Peters from some Peter's

00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:38,740
tower and then automatically picked up

00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:41,950
by those yahoo pipes automatically fed

00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:43,010
out into Twitter so that when you're

00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:44,780
doing taxonomy is you

00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:48,110
not just thinking about how does this

00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:49,550
work on the website you also should be

00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:50,840
thinking about how does this feed into

00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:54,620
the social systems that are out there

00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:57,200
and the kind of ecology the bio system

00:47:54,620 --> 00:48:04,700
that you've created for your your brand

00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:06,590
um and we also measured and rated all of

00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:08,630
our journalists on their social media

00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:10,790
sharing so in addition to it going out

00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:12,020
on automatically ty would have been

00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:14,090
doing it as the old-fashioned way of

00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:18,080
cutting and pasting into his Twitter

00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:20,000
feed personally and then and here's

00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:22,420
where we're doing it backwards to South

00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,860
China Morning Post but it has I think a

00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:27,650
huge benefit is that it comes around in

00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:30,290
this virtuous circle is that you then

00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:31,910
can put on the side of an article all of

00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:33,800
these quotes because you've put it onto

00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:35,510
Twitter or Facebook and you've said hey

00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:37,400
everyone what do you think of the map go

00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:39,020
look at the map and comment on it they

00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,580
then comment on it you then pull those

00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:41,720
comments in as if you've done Vox pops

00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:43,940
and you don't have to go stand in pitt

00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,320
street mall or bourke street mall with a

00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:47,450
camera and a journalist for five hours

00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:48,620
in the heat or the rain until you get

00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:52,010
enough people who said the right things

00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:53,690
to you right now if your news limited

00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:54,920
you also have a rule that they have to

00:48:53,690 --> 00:48:56,240
tell you what suburb the living in so

00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,130
once you've chosen which suburb which

00:48:56,240 --> 00:48:59,150
stories you're going to do you need to

00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:00,890
choose to check that they're real people

00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:02,630
you just send them messages through

00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:06,710
facebook from your personal journalist

00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:08,870
account and get their permission to put

00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:11,090
it in the paper but you've also should

00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:12,710
be sensible and have a terms of house

00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:15,110
rules on your facebook site and on

00:49:12,710 --> 00:49:17,000
anywhere else that says if you comment

00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:22,760
on our page you are giving us permission

00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:23,900
to publish on yep well you're giving us

00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:26,390
permission to publish in print though

00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:27,740
you know it because the a lot of people

00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:30,680
don't realize that and then they get a

00:49:27,740 --> 00:49:33,710
bit freaked out by it and of course you

00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:34,670
know there's more online down here you

00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:36,080
can see there's a little thing that says

00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:37,550
do you support or oppose these new

00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:38,960
restrictions comment online so you then

00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:40,400
switching people back from the print to

00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:43,400
the online and that's keeping on this

00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,810
keeping the circle going there are polls

00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,570
and surveys there's all those kinds of

00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:49,370
things that you can use and I want to so

00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:51,500
what I one of the reasons I really

00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:52,880
wanted to get to this n bit is one of

00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,860
the things we've been talking about here

00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:57,050
is about collaborating between dev and

00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:59,630
content and we always talk about

00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:01,370
agile when we're talking about dev but

00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:03,380
we never talk about agile when we're

00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:05,480
talking about content we seem to have

00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:07,340
this idea that we went to journalism

00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:11,060
school we learned how to do it and then

00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:13,430
we're done and it's just not true you

00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:16,310
can't shoehorn the old ways of doing

00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:18,440
content into the new world you have to

00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:21,050
adapt what you're doing and you have to

00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,850
adapt it on a regular basis and I think

00:50:21,050 --> 00:50:25,310
that what i want to start seeing is

00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:27,800
cross-functional teams where you have a

00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:30,530
stand-up meeting with editorial end

00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:32,720
production and management where everyone

00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:33,890
talks together about what they're up to

00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,260
and how they're working on it and what

00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:37,460
their challenges are so that everybody

00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:40,430
is understanding their own their

00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:43,700
positions together at news we had a

00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:45,890
weekly phone hookup with all of the

00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:47,960
teams talking about what our challenges

00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:50,140
were with online the Sprint's were still

00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,250
dev Sprint's every six weeks and

00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:54,530
everything that was new was then

00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:56,000
presented back to the editorial teams so

00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:57,200
the editorial teams could understand the

00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:00,920
new dimensions of what we could achieve

00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:02,660
I think that's really a very important

00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:05,420
thing you're also talking about devices

00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:07,700
and that's where your analytics are

00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:10,760
informing your content strategy because

00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:13,130
it's not something you do once I've

00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:15,140
cheated a little and stuck in a user

00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:17,030
personas slide right at the end because

00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:18,170
people think this is something you do at

00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:19,850
the beginning when you're doing a big

00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:21,620
redevelopment and then you do it and you

00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:22,940
don't do it again or you do it when

00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,110
you're first starting this website that

00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:25,310
you guys are doing because you've got a

00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:27,380
print product and doing it for the first

00:51:25,310 --> 00:51:29,060
time but I think user personas are

00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:31,640
something you come back to all the time

00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:33,680
who are your readers how are they

00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:35,120
reading do they dip in and out are they

00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,550
head what what news limited called

00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:38,870
headlines sniffers where they come along

00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:41,390
and they scan for the headlines and they

00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:43,130
go away again are they leisure readers

00:51:41,390 --> 00:51:46,940
do they wait for the weekend and read

00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:49,250
for two hours at a time if that changes

00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:50,210
you need to change your content and how

00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:53,450
you're delivering and when you're

00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:54,860
delivering after Christmas 2011 we

00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:57,530
noticed something very interesting in

00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:59,780
January 2012 all of a sudden people

00:51:57,530 --> 00:52:02,840
started reading the news half an hour

00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:05,240
earlier and we suddenly had a peek at

00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:09,710
nine o'clock at night on a new screen

00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:10,580
size iPads everyone got them for

00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:13,340
Christmas

00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:14,990
and all of a sudden the mums and dads

00:52:13,340 --> 00:52:19,760
were waiting till the kids were in bed

00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:24,800
and reading the news on their iPads that

00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:27,050
changes your content delivery it also

00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:29,570
should end up having you go back to your

00:52:27,050 --> 00:52:31,280
dev team and say hey we need to make

00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:33,620
sure we're optimizing our Interactive's

00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:36,640
for iPad because that's now our key

00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:38,930
evening audience so we're delivering our

00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,670
breaking news headlines sniffers for

00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:41,860
mobile phones they're reading them at

00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:44,060
eight thirty in the morning on the train

00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:46,340
then they're reading on their desktops

00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:48,710
at lunchtime then they're reading on

00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:49,760
their iPads at nine o'clock how do we

00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:51,080
make sure that we're delivering the

00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:55,660
right content at the right time in the

00:52:51,080 --> 00:53:06,500
right ways for those audiences and

00:52:55,660 --> 00:53:08,800
that's me done another question over

00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,800
here yet

00:53:17,550 --> 00:53:21,059
open keller yep

00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:44,450
yeah I can I can I cannot expand on that

00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,890
a little bit yeah so there's open

00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:48,260
caravaggio if you install it comes in

00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:50,540
two parts is the API module and then the

00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:52,040
actual module itself using the extra

00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:53,900
module itself you know it enables the

00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:56,890
API module and you take a piece of

00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:59,840
content it'll firstly it will create a

00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:03,260
set of vocabularies that align with what

00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:04,670
how open callate categorizes things you

00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:06,590
send the article across it sends it back

00:54:04,670 --> 00:54:09,230
in it tells you here are all the terms

00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:10,490
for each vocabulary and it creates a

00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:13,700
terms for you if they don't exist

00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:15,890
previously and things like that and then

00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:17,390
it'll associate and tag it all you need

00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:19,700
to kind of figure it a little bit though

00:54:17,390 --> 00:54:21,620
because it can go over the top quite

00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:24,440
easily you can see in an article away

00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:25,790
and it might be something like it's

00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:28,940
technics scenario when michael jackson

00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:31,790
died and there was the fault was being

00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:33,320
blamed on the doctor so then that'll go

00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:34,490
into all kinds of things there be some

00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,900
cool things like it'll come back with

00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:38,330
michael jackson and will come back with

00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,920
medical science something yeah well

00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:42,380
that's kind of medical and you know

00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:44,330
that's irrelevant and then it'll it'll

00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:45,860
just go you know and go way too far like

00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:48,530
I saw the color green so that's there

00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:50,930
and you know there's a kind of country

00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:54,170
over here and and like start putting it

00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:55,670
are really quite detailed now that you

00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:58,400
might want that stuff if you that's how

00:54:55,670 --> 00:55:01,850
you'll sort of doing things when we had

00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:04,070
eight hundred thousand articles and you

00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:05,570
get back say 30 terms to a single

00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:09,680
article that becomes a technical problem

00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:12,560
because 30 times 800,000 is a lot of

00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:14,870
data to store so we didn't want to go

00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:16,580
down that dep half and have to deal with

00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:18,370
that much data so we wanted to reduce

00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:21,170
that it also meant that like you have

00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:23,450
incredibly huge topic pages you click on

00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:25,010
that topic you get lists and some will

00:55:23,450 --> 00:55:27,200
just have two articles in them and some

00:55:25,010 --> 00:55:29,090
will have ten and some will have a lot

00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,650
different so you know articles that only

00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:32,120
have two well that's not really a valid

00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:33,680
page on your website let's get rid of

00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:36,080
that so you have to also think about

00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:42,340
other things like logic for reducing how

00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:42,340
much topics come in yeah

00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:49,450
yep there they issue since back

00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:56,910
irrelevant scoring for each Tim it also

00:55:49,450 --> 00:55:59,740
there's a back you can add to court you

00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:02,109
yeah it used to be the spring back in

00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:04,300
the early 2000s caught a tag cloud and

00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:06,220
you know it was like bigger tags and

00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:07,210
yeah you you're cool for you and bid one

00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:10,740
of those on the side of your website

00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:10,740
that doesn't happen anymore

00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:47,000
so from behind the Pearl the shearing

00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:53,330
sharing behind the paywall strategies to

00:56:47,000 --> 00:57:00,320
combat it or to encourage it right ah

00:56:53,330 --> 00:57:01,730
yeah yeah no I'm all I I know that there

00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:04,460
was a lot of discussion at the

00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:06,650
Australian about that too before they

00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:07,670
introduced the paywall about whether you

00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:09,620
were going to be able to get through the

00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:13,430
five freemium from shared as well as

00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:16,040
from google and that's where some of the

00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:18,160
discussion about how much that how much

00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:21,710
information was going to be shown before

00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:26,450
you logged in and that's why you can see

00:57:21,710 --> 00:57:30,380
three paragraphs for free I also think

00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:31,970
sometimes I see like news media

00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:35,600
companies coming on board it and they

00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:37,970
realize that the end user expects to see

00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:40,460
ads whether they're logged in or they're

00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:41,720
a subscriber you know or not which is

00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:43,700
kind of funny because you know you're

00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:45,380
there is a revenue stream for you so you

00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:48,140
know you could actually decide to just

00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:49,970
let your site be free access here's all

00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:51,890
of our content go ahead and see it you'd

00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:53,150
get so many hits you know you get all

00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:54,770
that and you'd get revenue from

00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:56,810
advertising see you shaking your head

00:57:54,770 --> 00:58:09,770
because that doesn't happen right but

00:57:56,810 --> 00:58:10,910
yeah was going to be dead and they

00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:12,290
didn't think that they're classified

00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:14,150
revenue was going to go into the toilet

00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:15,470
and therefore they just went oh don't

00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:18,980
worry we'll just charge this tiny amount

00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:20,260
per thousand views oh damn we've just

00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:24,040
signed our own different

00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:25,900
yeah so but crazy enough though like

00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:27,640
there are certain ads that you'll allow

00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:30,430
on your sites that users don't like

00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:32,500
things like videos at play autoplay I

00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:34,390
mean that's one of the ones I as a pet

00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,380
peeve of mine because you know i just

00:58:34,390 --> 00:58:36,730
wanted to read your article don't want

00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:39,370
you to take my bandwidth to play video I

00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:40,930
don't not interested in and yet you pay

00:58:39,370 --> 00:58:46,810
for a subscription and you still see

00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:48,490
that same edge show up it's like right

00:58:46,810 --> 00:58:49,930
but if you if your ad-blocking right

00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:51,460
well then you're kind of shooting

00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:53,140
yourself in the foot because if they're

00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:54,340
not getting the impression then they're

00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:55,690
not getting the money and they're not

00:58:54,340 --> 00:59:06,570
continue continuing the product that you

00:58:55,690 --> 00:59:14,110
enjoy unfortunately yeah why what as

00:59:06,570 --> 00:59:15,670
yeah it's kind of my point yeah so you

00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:17,350
should so you're saying you should pay

00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:23,980
for a subscription and implement an a

00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:25,330
blocker you shouldn't have to write yeah

00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:27,550
but behind the paywall they're still

00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:28,630
advertising as you're saying and you're

00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:31,110
trying to find a way that you can

00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:31,110
encourage that

01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:15,240
there's actually I'm trying to write my

01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:17,730
brain about what they are but they're

01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:20,339
worth I remember I was at the Asian

01:00:17,730 --> 01:00:22,890
media conference in December they spoke

01:00:20,339 --> 01:00:24,599
of three different types of people that

01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:27,119
you have coming into your site you got

01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:29,069
the the mass crowd that come by and

01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:30,210
they're sort of quick hits they look at

01:00:29,069 --> 01:00:31,559
your site they get what they can from it

01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:33,539
they go away and they don't really come

01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:36,930
back for most people that's a huge

01:00:33,539 --> 01:00:38,940
amount then you have people who buy into

01:00:36,930 --> 01:00:41,160
your subscriptions and they make you

01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:43,049
some money and then there's a people who

01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:44,640
buy extensions onto that and you know

01:00:43,049 --> 01:00:46,499
fully get into the whole thing and this

01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:49,289
is the street areas you need to look at

01:00:46,499 --> 01:00:51,720
how big each one of these areas are and

01:00:49,289 --> 01:00:53,940
then strategize towards that model so

01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:56,279
that's yeah for my experience what you

01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:58,890
need I think that what we're going to

01:00:56,279 --> 01:01:02,400
start to see is a similar system to the

01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:05,069
app models where there is actually going

01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:06,599
to be two level of paid and so you're

01:01:05,069 --> 01:01:09,390
going to have the the free model and

01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:11,009
then you're going to have the the

01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:12,119
minimum subscription where you get X

01:01:11,009 --> 01:01:13,769
amount per month but you still have to

01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:16,739
put up with ads and then there's kind of

01:01:13,769 --> 01:01:19,349
a super premium preferred customer

01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:22,140
version where you get you know

01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:23,430
untrammeled access and no ads and the

01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:27,029
ones you really really want that will

01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:29,279
pay that you we've already seen with the

01:01:27,029 --> 01:01:31,170
Australian Financial Review that you

01:01:29,279 --> 01:01:33,509
know the online version of that is a

01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:36,569
thousand five hundred dollars a year to

01:01:33,509 --> 01:01:39,559
subscribe you know that's unheard of no

01:01:36,569 --> 01:01:39,559
one thought it would succeed but

01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:51,630
you you mean like the sm h ipad app and

01:01:58,190 --> 01:02:02,030
yeah yeah so we were both talking before

01:02:01,010 --> 01:02:03,280
about wood wing and wood wing is

01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:06,200
something that just sort of takes

01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:07,550
materials out of indesign and other

01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:08,630
Adobe products and turns it into apps

01:02:07,550 --> 01:02:10,580
and there's you know there's certain

01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:15,350
amounts of things you can do with that I

01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:18,650
think that the app the magazines that

01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:20,750
I've been seeing done with Ulf and the

01:02:18,650 --> 01:02:22,940
pricing structure with Orff makes that

01:02:20,750 --> 01:02:24,830
work and I don't know how that works in

01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:28,250
with everything else you guys are doing

01:02:24,830 --> 01:02:29,750
but you know about orphan I don't know

01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:38,090
but I'm just trying to think about what

01:02:29,750 --> 01:02:40,250
i can add to that yeah i think you know

01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:41,990
from a from a technical perspective

01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:45,230
implementing a paywall across all your

01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:46,820
devices as a challenge and so they do

01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:48,980
try and though i think you'll naturally

01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:51,080
find the people end up bundling stuff

01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:52,940
like ipad and videos and things and

01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:54,020
naturally because it's like either you

01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:55,730
have it or you don't have it because

01:02:54,020 --> 01:03:01,400
it's too hard implementing it in

01:02:55,730 --> 01:03:02,480
incremental bits but yeah I think it's

01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,770
just sort of ends up happening that way

01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:05,180
and I don't know whether the sort of

01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:08,650
public input on to that whether they

01:03:05,180 --> 01:03:08,650
kind of think oh extra stuff or by

01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:19,000
