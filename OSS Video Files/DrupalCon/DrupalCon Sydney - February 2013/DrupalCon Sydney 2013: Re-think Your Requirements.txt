Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Re-think Your Requirements
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	Requirements often come with technical implications, without regard for the platform that will be used - or even for the system's users and what they might want. Meeting strictly written requirements can lead to an over-engineered and over-priced solution.

Don't let requirements undermine Drupal's strengths by being too prescriptive about the approach. You can re-frame the requirements to leverage what Drupal does well, instead of trying to work around its weaknesses to build a custom, complex product.

Beyond improving the technical outcome, writing Drupal-y requirements can help avoid misunderstandings. The intent of a requirement is to establish business value - not to tell you how to build something.

This session targets those on the delivery end of Drupal and will look at how to achieve useful requirements to establish a mutually understood goal. Then you can build it - the Drupal way!

comments on the session pages i am going

00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:11,880
to pre excuse myself because I gotta go

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,580

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:22,490
I do I'd like to introduce you to a Pam

00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:27,270
Pamela Barone is going to be taking this

00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:29,220
this session she is a web project

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,070
manager at previousnext here in Sydney

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:33,720
she manages large-scale web development

00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,200
projects on the Drupal platform of

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,140
course so she has the ax absolutely the

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,840
right prerequisites to be talking about

00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:44,549
requirements for your Drupal projects

00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,259
she currently specializes in delivering

00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,030
Drupal to government higher education

00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:52,710
and media organizations which I think of

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:56,219
previous next key verticals using agile

00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:58,890
methodology her session is entitled

00:01:56,219 --> 00:02:01,969
rethink your requirements please welcome

00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,969
Pamela Barone

00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:12,660
everybody hear me alright so as Mark

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:14,340
said I'm here to talk about Drupal

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,430
requirements I'm going to talk a little

00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,780
bit about why I think it's important to

00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,130
use Drupal to refine your requirements

00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,130
and then just give you a couple of ways

00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:24,600
that I've learned how to do that I just

00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,820
really believe that framing requirements

00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:28,530
and Drupal terms is the best way to get

00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,080
a good outcome on both sides of things

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,280
it's the best way to leverage what

00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,700
Drupal does well to avoid

00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,080
misunderstandings down the road just a

00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,760
little bit about me mark introduced me

00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,130
already but I'm a project manager for

00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,140
previous next in Sydney and I do mostly

00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:44,459
work on government media and higher

00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,970
education this is just some of our

00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:49,920
recent work and before I started working

00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:53,550
in Drupal I was a content editor at a

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,750
large media company in the US so my sort

00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,220
of formative years were on the other

00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,320
side at the client side of things and

00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,860
now I'm now I'm on the dark side the

00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:04,080
vendor side I'm just first a disclaimer

00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:07,080
there's no magic formula for how to do

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,209
it in Drupal it's not a translation it's

00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,780
not a you know this is the way you write

00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:13,800
them in Drupal it's really just about

00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,840
get it getting started in the right

00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,110
direction using using Drupal terms using

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,730
Drupal methodology like Drupal is

00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,530
already your framework so just make

00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,019
sense to use what Drupal does when

00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:26,160
you're writing your requirements kind of

00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:28,049
some background on how this came about

00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,670
this this is what kept happening the

00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:31,350
client would give us requirements they

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:33,000
would say what they wanted we would

00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,230
deliver what we thought they wanted and

00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,989
then they'd say no that's not what I

00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:38,519
wanted this happens all the time and

00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:39,959
it's not unique to Drupal but I think

00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:41,250
the great thing about Drupal is that

00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,830
there are a lot of ways you can use it

00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:47,130
to avoid this and the kind of classic

00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,630
example that we see is this is just a

00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,450
quick example but the client says we

00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:52,830
need to integrate video with Brightcove

00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,150
that's our video providers we just need

00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:56,430
to get Brightcove video on our Drupal

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,950
site we say no problem there's a module

00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,650
for that this will be an hour easy great

00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:04,709
then you deliver and they say write this

00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,420
this is fine but we need to put our

00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:09,959
player IDs in to target our payroll F

00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:12,299
and you say ah ok well the module

00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,890
doesn't actually do that we can do it

00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:16,260
but it's actually gonna take 10 hours

00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:19,769
set of one hour so ten times as long as

00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:21,690
we said and there was no module like I

00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:23,550
said incidentally there is now a module

00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:27,300
for that that we built because of this

00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:30,390
specific use case but it just seems to

00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,280
happen over and over and I realized that

00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:34,140
we must be doing something wrong right

00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,790
the client told us what they thought we

00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:37,830
needed to know they're not purposely

00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,690
holding back details because they're

00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:41,760
trying to mess us up at least I don't

00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:44,400
think so anyway they assumed they

00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,930
assumed that when they said we need

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,520
Brightcove that it would include all the

00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,160
stuff that they have in Brightcove

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,570
whereas that's not really how it works

00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,400
but I mean they told us what they

00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:56,460
thought we needed to know and we thought

00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,550
they told us everything but they didn't

00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:01,230
so I just started thinking I mean why

00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,720
does this keep happening and what are

00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:06,930
some ways that we can really avoid this

00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,790
in the future and the real problem is

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,610
that it's really hard to build a website

00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:13,260
from a stack of paper or just a

00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,669
collection of documentation because

00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,080
there are so many nuances and there are

00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:17,850
so many subtleties and there are so many

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,190
different ways to do things that it's

00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:22,950
just really hard to say here's what I

00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,080
want and then here's here's that exactly

00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,130
as you envisioned it so starting from

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,479
the beginning I just start to think

00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,660
about what are we what are we really

00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:32,550
trying to accomplish with requirements

00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,290
and I think it's really whatever you

00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,750
need to understand what the client

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,250
expects from the outcome and successful

00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,169
delivery really it depends on

00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:42,720
understanding exactly what they expect

00:05:40,169 --> 00:05:44,070
and why it's valuable to them so I don't

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,780
I'm not really concerned about format

00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:47,820
that you use for requirements is that

00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:51,120
user stories is it a you know a 200-page

00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,440
technical spec is it personas you know

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,760
it doesn't really matter and I don't I

00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,770
don't really think the methodology that

00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,840
you use matters either we happen to use

00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,669
agile but I don't think that some I

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,580
don't think that's too important to the

00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:04,950
underlying concept of just a mutual

00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:09,270
understanding of what they want and how

00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:11,280
you're going to deliver it so where does

00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,169
Drupal come into this whole picture I

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,210
think it should come in as soon as

00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:17,880
possible because you've already chosen

00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:19,860
drew pleasure framework so why sort of

00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,620
pretend that that's not going to be what

00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,180
you're using discussing requirements and

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,020
Drupal terms just reduces the potential

00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,669
for confusion and misunderstanding

00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:29,199
standing and it eliminates some

00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:30,520
technical pitfalls that you can run into

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,169
down the road if you implement something

00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:34,270
in a way that you thought made sense but

00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:37,569
the client said no that's actually

00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:39,190
absolutely not going to work and I think

00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:40,930
there's a little bit of hesitation among

00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,879
Drupal people to say well Drupal so

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:44,379
flexible so I don't really think that we

00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,360
need to have Drupal requirements because

00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:48,490
you know we don't want to make it seem

00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,069
like drupal only does things a certain

00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,349
way but if you're going to use Drupal

00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:56,460
there's just no reason to kind of

00:06:53,349 --> 00:06:58,690
hesitate or or try to avoid this because

00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,699
they're cut there are two parts to it

00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:02,770
Drupal is so flexible and that's part of

00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:04,479
the problem you can do anything but

00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:06,520
should you is really is really the

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,380
question and the other thing is Drupal

00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,330
Drupal provides a lot of things out of

00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,560
the box and does things really well but

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:14,500
also does things in a really specific

00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,909
way so if you tell the client yep just

00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,340
tell me whatever you want in your words

00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:19,960
and I'll build it you probably can but

00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,849
you might end up undermining a lot of

00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,680
what you get with Drupal when it's

00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:26,349
delivered so it's really not about

00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,789
saying no no we can't do that in Drupal

00:07:26,349 --> 00:07:30,159
that's just not how it works it's more

00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:31,360
about just being clear and being

00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:34,389
realistic about what you're going to

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,830
give them so this is a really standard

00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:37,630
requirement that we get on almost every

00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,979
project that we do now publishers must

00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:42,550
be able to quickly and easily revert

00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:44,259
changes to all pages it's pretty

00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:46,090
standard but at the same time this is

00:07:44,259 --> 00:07:47,710
not something that Drupal really does to

00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,199
be completely honest Drupal is not a

00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:52,060
page centric model that's not a weakness

00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:54,190
it's just the way things work it's very

00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,900
dynamic in nature so that kind of

00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,430
snapshot of a whole page is just not

00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,500
something that really happens in Drupal

00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,539
there are initiatives in progress now

00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,729
with content staging to enable this but

00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:05,560
it doesn't exist at the moment and you

00:08:03,729 --> 00:08:07,750
can come really close but it's not very

00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:10,960
easy so when we see this we say yeah we

00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,979
can do that but if you meant publishers

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,889
must be able to quickly and easily

00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:17,380
revert changes to all content that's

00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:19,000
really how it works in Drupal and it can

00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,349
seem like a small difference to Drupal

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,180
people because we're just so used to

00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:24,789
that being the way it works and it works

00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:27,460
really well but to content people it's a

00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:29,650
major thing because if they come from a

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,270
page centric CMS this might be a little

00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:32,709
bit scary to them they say well what do

00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:35,949
you mean I can't have a snapshot of a

00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:37,599
whole page I don't understand it seems

00:08:35,949 --> 00:08:38,940
like a weakness in the system but it's

00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,520
really not and and

00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,710
in most cases the content will suffice

00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,080
likes versioning the content is button

00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:48,780
is plenty it'll satisfy people but you

00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,610
just have to be clear so this is the

00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:54,060
idea basically is that both of you are

00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:55,500
thinking about it in the same terms we

00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,090
come to it with so much Drupal

00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,160
experience that can seem like I said it

00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:01,620
can seem really unimportant that it

00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,330
versions content versus versioning pages

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:04,920
because we're so used to it and we have

00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:07,410
a really clear picture of how it works

00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,940
but in most cases the client has never

00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:10,470
seen Drupal before they don't understand

00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,000
how it works they're coming from a CMS

00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:13,080
that might be really outdated and just

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,420
does things in a completely different

00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:17,550
way so they have just a different idea

00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,470
of how it works so what you really need

00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:21,600
to do is specify how you're going to

00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:24,930
satisfy the requirement not just say yep

00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,580
we can do that tell them how and then

00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:28,440
like I said before Drupal is really

00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,440
flexible but at some point it can become

00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,210
a liability because like I said you can

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,820
end up undermining undermining the

00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:37,260
things that Drupal does really well so

00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,270
trying to cobble together page

00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:42,630
versioning just because that's what the

00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:43,920
RFP said is a perfect example of you

00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,750
know jumping through hoops and going in

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,330
circles to make something happen that

00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,820
you really just don't need to do so just

00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,590
be honest at the start provisioning

00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:55,650
content is really easy drupal does it

00:09:52,590 --> 00:10:00,540
Drupal core does this visioning pages is

00:09:55,650 --> 00:10:01,860
not easy it's really hard and best-case

00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,570
scenario the client says oh yeah that's

00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:06,240
fine it doesn't really matter to me

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:08,520
that'll do and if they say no say why

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,540
what's your use case is it because

00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,430
you're afraid people are going to

00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,870
publish things that they shouldn't have

00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:14,700
and you want to be able to undo it well

00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,830
let's try a workflow system a really

00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,360
strict workflow system is it because you

00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:20,010
want to keep an archive of what your

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,050
site looked like on a given day well

00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:24,240
we've actually built a an HTML crawler

00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,950
for that it's a lot it's a lot more

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,300
lightweight and it's stored on a

00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,220
separate server so you can click through

00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,380
and see what the entire site looks like

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,300
at any given time and that's completely

00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:35,310
outside of Drupal and in some cases that

00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,290
will meet the needs and then it could

00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,940
just be well no our editors have to

00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:41,070
switch between versions of pages a lot

00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,290
and that's why we want and you could say

00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:45,330
well versioning the content will

00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:47,070
probably be enough because the dynamic

00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,490
list is probably completely independent

00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:51,450
of that

00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,980
so building page revisions is it's a

00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,450
really major commitment and it requires

00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:56,670
a lot of planning and it affects a lot

00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:58,050
of the rest of your site architecture so

00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:59,670
it's like I said it's really important

00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,920
to be clear about do they really need

00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:05,880
that and if so why and can you can you

00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,250
find a better alternative so the first

00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,360
thing I think that's really important in

00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,149
terms of actually how to make this

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,760
happen is get your clients to learn

00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:16,170
drupal as soon as possible this is

00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:18,600
actually a picture of Jesus bookshelves

00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:21,089
so it's a bit of an extreme example but

00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,470
there's so much material out there that

00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:24,540
clients can use to educate themselves

00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,399
there are formal training opportunities

00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,500
all over the world there are even free

00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,180
training days you can recommend you can

00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,950
hold a workshop with the whole team and

00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,690
just show them kind of the basics the

00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:36,480
most important things and just give them

00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:38,190
an idea of the way gerbil works we

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,880
recommend that all of our clients take

00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:43,200
the Drupal in a day acquia course and by

00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,300
the end of the day they'll have built a

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,190
Drupal site using vuze connection

00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,649
filters they learn a lot of things that

00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,930
they definitely won't be using on a site

00:11:49,649 --> 00:11:53,220
that we build but it's really it's a

00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:55,589
really great way of getting them to

00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,120
understand how things work and then they

00:11:55,589 --> 00:12:00,720
can be better at communicating how they

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:02,670
envision that it will work um suggest

00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,649
books to read give them node one

00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:07,110
tutorials just really make it clear that

00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:08,850
you expect some engagement from them on

00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:11,029
this level get them involved in

00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,440
technical conversations don't just say

00:12:11,029 --> 00:12:14,670
yeah tell us what you want don't worry

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,940
about the technical side of it that's

00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:21,300
our job force them to get involved in

00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:22,920
these decisions and then when you're

00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,829
when you're doing a project plan and

00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,970
when you're laying out your project

00:12:24,829 --> 00:12:29,010
budget for it because you're going to

00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:31,290
need this time to talk things over and

00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,579
to really iron out the specifics so no

00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:34,260
matter how prepared the client is they

00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:36,240
might come in and say no I've got a

00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:38,250
200-page RFP I don't need any

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:41,490
requirements gathering this is all you

00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:44,670
need just explain that yeah the RFP is

00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:46,320
great as a as kind of a I don't know

00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,760
blueprint is the wrong word but it's

00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,740
great to give us an idea of what you're

00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,959
expecting but it's definitely not enough

00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,550
to communicate the final outcome it

00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:54,750
you'll just you'll never get what you

00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:57,570
need from a document that's been

00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:59,010
provided by the client so just include

00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,110
this in the budget just say this is part

00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:03,360
of what we do you know

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,040
it's not it's not just padding your

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,980
estimates it's not just a contingency

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,260
it's something that you need so just

00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:11,970
tell them we start with pretty much I

00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:13,529
mean this isn't specific to every

00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,300
project but say twenty percent of the

00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:16,980
project budget is going to be spent on

00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,120
starting things off getting things

00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:22,560
getting a project vision established and

00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:25,890
really working together with them to do

00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,870
that so your inception phase can include

00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:29,880
any number of things but it should start

00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,589
with a kickoff meeting where you get

00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,940
together with them you discuss roles or

00:13:31,589 --> 00:13:34,290
responsibilities you know you kind of

00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,510
iron out the details of how you're going

00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:38,220
to work together but you also establish

00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:40,140
a project vision which is just a really

00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,850
quick statement outlining the purposes

00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,890
and the goals and and what the client

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,560
hopes to achieve from this project and

00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:49,740
it's really important that you actually

00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,640
kind of keep referring back to that and

00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,820
remember that that's what you're doing

00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:55,260
and don't get lost in kind of a sea of

00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:57,149
feature requests and scope creep because

00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,990
at the end of the day you need to just

00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:02,490
achieve that that vision it's not about

00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:04,560
kind of change requests and all that

00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:05,970
sort stuff end and why doesn't it do

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,769
this just keep referring back to the

00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,180
vision and say well yeah we can do that

00:14:07,769 --> 00:14:10,890
but do you really need us to do that

00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,910
because that's not really what that's

00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,860
not really what the project was

00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:17,339
initially supposed to be the other

00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:19,290
things are just workshops if they don't

00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:21,899
want to get you in in a room with our

00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:23,339
staff send out a feedback form and get

00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:27,449
just kind of some highlights about what

00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:29,130
they're expecting consultations and you

00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:30,810
so use that vision that you've

00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,370
established to kind of get an idea of

00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,560
how the work is going to be shaped so

00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:36,269
you know if it's a project that's really

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,440
strictly about the front end they don't

00:14:36,269 --> 00:14:39,600
they don't like the way the site looks

00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,699
they want to improve the kind of use end

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,660
user functionality that's fine but if

00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:45,000
you if you find out through your

00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:48,060
consultations that actually the what CMS

00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:50,010
editors hate it hate the current CMS

00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,540
then that's that's going to really have

00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:52,589
to shape the rest of the project and

00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:55,949
they might not have mentioned that

00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:57,209
actually so 3 or inception phase you

00:14:55,949 --> 00:14:58,829
should like I said establish the roles

00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:01,170
and responsibilities and the most

00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:03,180
important person on a project is the

00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:05,640
product owner that's what we call the

00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:07,380
client leave in agile but it doesn't

00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:08,880
really matter who you call it whether

00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:11,279
it's the client project manager the

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,410
client lead whoever it is this is

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,300
basically your ideal product owner he's

00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:16,580
here

00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,440
she is smiling and you know just

00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:21,230
reveling and all their responsibilities

00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:22,790
and ownership yeah that's great and yeah

00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,220
we're going to collaborate this is this

00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:27,890
is great ideally it should be somebody

00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,750
who uses the CMS on a regular basis and

00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:31,520
not just somebody that the client

00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,260
assigned to it because they want to make

00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:35,090
sure it doesn't go over budget it should

00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,550
really be somebody that can get engaged

00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:40,940
throughout the build and make decisions

00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:42,350
and give you useful feedback and you

00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,940
really should expect a certain level of

00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:45,590
engagement because like I said this is

00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,300
absolutely the most important person on

00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:49,850
the project it can make it or break it

00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,590
and I've seen this happen at a project

00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:52,790
that sort of was really vague in the

00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:54,140
beginning but ended up going really

00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:56,180
really well because the client was

00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,430
really engaged really involved at the

00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,800
same time a project that seemed like it

00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:02,270
was planned out to the detail and the

00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,070
product owner just really didn't care

00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:07,670
and in the end the client and what they

00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:09,650
wanted um so we do daily scrums we send

00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:11,900
out weekly reports we have approval

00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:15,170
deadlines we have expected response

00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,540
times all up front but but the reality

00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:19,040
of it is a lot of times your product

00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:20,930
owner can end up looking like this I

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,520
mean in some cases it's just not a job

00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:23,810
they wanted they didn't want to get

00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,150
involved in the project they didn't want

00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:27,710
the hassle you know they're managing

00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:30,200
internal expectations they've got

00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:32,240
committees they've probably also got ten

00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,530
other jobs and and meanwhile they're

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,390
just stressing out about the budget and

00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:38,150
constant surprises and just being

00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:40,280
bombarded with them requests from you if

00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:41,720
it's too much to handle you've really

00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,430
got to take that into consideration and

00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,590
figure out how you can reduce what

00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:47,600
you're expecting of them so you know

00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:50,600
just say hey what can we do to make this

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:55,310
work is a once-a-day email too much

00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:57,920
isn't once a week email too much how can

00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:00,260
how can you kind of hand over part of

00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,510
your load to us so you give us a really

00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:05,030
big kind of overview of what you'll

00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:07,370
accept will try to take on that role of

00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,660
a product owner so in scrum that's sort

00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:10,490
of how it works the scrum master can

00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,720
take on the responsibility of product

00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:13,490
owner if the product owner is not

00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,980
available and this works out really well

00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:18,110
because um like I said that oftentimes

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,260
the product owner is not thrilled with

00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:23,800
this job and in that case you really

00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,800
have to help

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,759
and if you do have a good product owner

00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:39,919
you can take advantage of one of the

00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,899
things that I think Drupal is best for

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,480
which is prototyping and doing

00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:46,340
iterations and doing demos so everybody

00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,909
knows this already in this room you can

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:51,559
really quickly add new features and so

00:17:49,909 --> 00:17:53,720
in cases where the client is a chore you

00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:54,919
can say well let's try this control

00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,690
module does it meet most of your needs

00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:58,340
no not really okay well let's try

00:17:56,690 --> 00:18:00,230
another one I mean that can take just a

00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:02,870
few hours to get to the right decision

00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:05,779
so instead of spending say a week or

00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:07,669
even a day or whatever it is trying to

00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:09,289
think of every possible eventuality and

00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,700
writing it down and paying if this then

00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:12,139
this and then we need this and then we

00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,669
need this just say let's try something

00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:15,500
let's try something to see how it

00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:17,059
actually works and then we can probably

00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,279
answer a lot of these questions without

00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:20,929
getting too far into it and the other

00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:22,610
thing is it saves unnecessary dev time

00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:24,710
so if the clients that I need these 10

00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:25,850
things you go off and do those 10 things

00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:27,740
well sometimes they would have been

00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,539
happy with two of the 10 but you really

00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:33,080
you can't know that because you didn't

00:18:29,539 --> 00:18:35,389
tell them this is a very in-depth

00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,970
requirement for managing links that came

00:18:35,389 --> 00:18:40,759
straight from an RFP and at this point

00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:44,029
in a project we were up to our eyeballs

00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:45,500
and scope creep and you know we looked

00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:47,779
at a lift like this and we said some of

00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:50,360
these make a lot of sense some of them

00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:52,309
are redundant some of them I don't even

00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,019
think are clear so you know something

00:18:52,309 --> 00:18:55,610
like it should not be possible to have

00:18:54,019 --> 00:18:58,700
broken links within the site managed by

00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:01,100
the CMS I mean content editors will find

00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,990
a way no matter what you do they'll find

00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,779
a way to have broken links this is just

00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:07,009
not very realistic so like I said at

00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:09,110
this point there was a lot of scope

00:19:07,009 --> 00:19:12,019
creep happening the budget was a concern

00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:14,299
so what we said was let's focus on that

00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:15,980
top line which is the overall goal of

00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:18,559
ensuring that there will be no broken

00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:20,090
links on the site so this is really all

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,289
they wanted they wanted to be able to

00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:23,720
manage links so that they didn't have a

00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:26,750
bunch of 404 pages we gave them a very

00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,610
pretty 404 page just in case but um but

00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:30,559
we really really have to focus on the

00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:32,240
core intent of the requirement so that

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,860
was the goal we don't want to have a lot

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,419
of broken links clearly they came from a

00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,070
system where they had a lot of broken

00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:38,450
links so this was a major problem and I

00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:41,389
think as a result they kind of

00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:44,480
overreacted and and got got a little too

00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:45,710
specific so what we said was let's start

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,929
simple we'll set

00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:50,059
the link content type for managing

00:19:47,929 --> 00:19:51,590
external links so there was a note ID

00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:53,960
for every external link on the site

00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:55,940
every time they linked off the site they

00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,559
were linking to a node ID and that way

00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,270
if they need to change it or if it got

00:19:57,559 --> 00:20:00,620
broken they only need to change it in

00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:01,909
one place they didn't even have to go

00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,250
around finding everywhere that was

00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:06,830
linked to the next thing is the link

00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:08,299
checker module which actually satisfies

00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,159
two or three of those requirements just

00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:13,490
out of the box it runs periodic reports

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:15,020
or it runs manually every time Kwan runs

00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:18,020
it does a sweep of every single link on

00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:20,149
the site and checks for broken links you

00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:21,740
can you can use that to generate reports

00:20:20,149 --> 00:20:24,649
you can use it to generate notifications

00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:26,149
but it's a really great tool and the

00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:28,760
other module we suggest it was linked it

00:20:26,149 --> 00:20:30,890
which is a way of linking within your

00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:33,470
Drupal site through the WYSIWYG without

00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:35,720
manually typing in without using that

00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:37,549
link icon so you're linking directly to

00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,350
a node ID you're not linking to an alias

00:20:37,549 --> 00:20:40,909
which can be really confusing for

00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,980
editors to say well I don't understand

00:20:40,909 --> 00:20:44,419
why there's a number here why can't I

00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,799
just like to the alias and the reason of

00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:47,740
course is that the alias might change

00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:50,779
but the note ID will always be the same

00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:52,640
so we implemented this it ticked most of

00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:54,230
the boxes and it was pretty simple it

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,600
really didn't take a lot of time and we

00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:58,549
said look we'll do this for you you test

00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,520
it out let us know if you need more and

00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:03,350
we can add more to it but in the end

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,750
they were really happy with it it

00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:09,200
totally met the goal without too much

00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:10,909
complexity because I think you also have

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,289
to be careful when you're trying to tack

00:21:10,909 --> 00:21:14,720
on layer on layer and layer of

00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:16,700
protection it can become a burden for

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,200
the editors because if there are too

00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,730
many place they have to go to check

00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,679
things they're just not going to do it

00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:22,940
so like I said this was really simple

00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,380
you of the link checker report and

00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:30,649
that's pretty much all you need to

00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:32,029
manage those broken links and the next

00:21:30,649 --> 00:21:34,490
thing that I think is really important

00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:36,200
is um goes without saying that you guys

00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:37,279
all have expert people teams I don't

00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,380
need to talk you guys it's really

00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:42,679
important to use developers who know how

00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:44,090
to use Drupal very well but your whole

00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:45,559
team should really have a good

00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:47,149
understanding of the way things work and

00:21:45,559 --> 00:21:49,100
you know even your sales team should

00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:50,179
know a little bit about it so that

00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,580
they're not going off making promises

00:21:50,179 --> 00:21:55,760
that either you can't keep or that are

00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:56,960
just too expensive to keep so um beyond

00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,399
that though I really think it's

00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,100
important to get the developers involved

00:21:58,399 --> 00:22:01,470
in the process

00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:03,390
as soon as possible show them wireframes

00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,980
show them requirements bring them to

00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,299
client meetings get them talking to the

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,539
client and I think it really gets them

00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:11,100
involved in the hole in the whole

00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:13,110
project vision and then I think as a

00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,820
result they take more ownership of it so

00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,860
they don't just see it as here's this

00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,480
list of tasks just complete it and then

00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,250
tell me when you're done and I'll and

00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,780
I'll worry about it from there they then

00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:24,080
they can kind of get involved in and

00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:26,010
give you ideas and say oh you know what

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,260
you said you would do it this way but I

00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:30,390
think actually a better way in a faster

00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,429
way or an easier way might be to do it

00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:34,230
this way and then the other thing is

00:22:32,429 --> 00:22:37,169
that you can actually vet their approach

00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:38,820
you can say no I don't tell me you can

00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:40,620
do it I know you can do it but how are

00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,870
you going to do it because a lot of

00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,679
times developers minds work in a little

00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,570
bit of a different way they're not

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,830
thinking about the content management

00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:48,539
side of things they're thinking about

00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,370
what's the quickest what's the easiest

00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:53,070
what's the technically best way of doing

00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:54,659
this where a lot of times if you

00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:57,120
actually ask them their thought process

00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:59,039
you can say yeah that's actually a great

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,700
idea that's really clever but I don't I

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,650
don't think it's going to work and this

00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:09,230
I think could be a whole talk on its own

00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:11,820
but you can't ignore the content editors

00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:13,620
their input and feedback is just so

00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:17,280
critical and if you don't have them on

00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:18,990
your side you're in big trouble and I

00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,270
think what we found a lot of times is

00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:23,159
that the client kind of resists this

00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:24,960
concept of we should consider what the

00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:26,789
content utters want they say now there's

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,440
too many it's too much of a hassle we

00:23:26,789 --> 00:23:29,970
don't want to hear from them and if you

00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:32,250
find that that's the case with the

00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:34,350
client then you need to be the advocate

00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,940
but the content enters need an advocate

00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:37,440
and if they don't have one in their

00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,320
organization then you have to be that

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,340
person because even if the car at the

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,140
client is we don't want to hear from

00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,450
them they're going to hear from them at

00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:47,010
some point and and if you wait too long

00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:50,250
then it's too late and it's going to be

00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:52,409
really expensive to fix and um I did

00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:54,240
some custom training recently for a very

00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:56,400
large web team at the end of a very

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,929
complex build and we were you know there

00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,260
were a few bugs still but I was really

00:23:57,929 --> 00:24:02,970
excited and got there and I was all

00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,340
bright-eyed and and ready to show them

00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:08,130
how things work thing I mean just about

00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:09,840
every 15 minutes they would say um why

00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,500
why does this work like this and we'd

00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,330
say well that's

00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:15,310
they told us to do and they think that

00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:17,380
really doesn't work for me and you know

00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:19,360
oh okay and you can hear that a few

00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,520
times before you kind of think well I

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,900
can't just keep blaming it on the

00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,330
product owner I can't just keep blaming

00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,280
it on the web team because at some point

00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:29,410
it just gets to be ridiculous like well

00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,390
why were why were we making these

00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:33,310
decisions and why was the client just

00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:36,190
completely ignoring what the content

00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:37,990
under wanted and half the time they they

00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:39,280
they suspect these really complicated

00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:41,290
features as a way of making things

00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,430
easier for the content editors and in

00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:44,050
the end they hated it it was so

00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:46,750
automated they had very little freedom

00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:48,850
and I think the the client thought that

00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,950
they could kind of um rain in bad

00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:53,440
behavior by having a lot of limitations

00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:55,540
in the cmf and it really didn't work so

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,400
what came out of that training and I did

00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:01,420
about five of them Safari and I just had

00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:03,160
like I know I know you hate it put just

00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:05,590
I'm just going to show you how it works

00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,270
um if you have feedback on why you think

00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:08,350
it should work differently please follow

00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:13,960
that up through the appropriate channels

00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:15,940
but I can't help you so find out about

00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,940
how their current CMS works talk to them

00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:20,320
do they hate it probably why do they

00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,700
hate it what do they hate most about it

00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,770
what are the top 10 things they hate

00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:25,420
what are the top 10 things they do every

00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:27,760
day that they wish could be made simpler

00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:29,620
I'm on the off chance that they love

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,940
their CMS find out why they love their

00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:34,390
CMS are they going to hate you for

00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:36,480
screwing it up it's probably not even

00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:39,400
that complicated like content editors

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,020
they have a very difficult job and I did

00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:42,790
this job for four years so I know how it

00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:46,030
is and it there's just nothing more

00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:47,830
exasperated being shown a brand new CMS

00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:49,840
you had absolutely no input on and just

00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:51,850
start scratching your head and theme why

00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:56,080
did they do that that way that just

00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:57,640
doesn't make any sense so um you just

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,020
need to insist on it just say it's built

00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,490
into your process so if the client says

00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,320
now we don't want you talking to the

00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:03,640
content editors just say you know what I

00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,440
know it's probably really politically

00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:07,150
delicate and sensitive and you don't

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,440
want to open a can of worms but this is

00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,850
what we do so we're going to come in

00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:11,260
we're going to have this workshop you

00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:13,540
can be the bad guy you can settle

00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:15,520
disputes but it's just really important

00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,870
to get that feedback as soon as possible

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,550
because like I said if you wait till the

00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,960
end of the project and you show them

00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:21,820
what it's like and then they get there

00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:25,210
you at their feedback then you have 100

00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:27,640
angry people criticizing every little

00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:29,830
thing and even if you even if you hear

00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,779
from them at the beginning it's a nice

00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:33,340
way of kind of explaining if you

00:26:31,779 --> 00:26:35,620
prioritize the things that you want us

00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:36,580
to do most will probably get to those

00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,870
we're not going to be able to do

00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:39,580
everything you want we're not going to

00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:40,929
make you the perfect system but just

00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,460
giving them that tiny little voice and

00:26:40,929 --> 00:26:47,260
making them feel like they've been heard

00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:48,940
can go a really long way so this is kind

00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:50,080
of along the same lines but you're

00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,000
building a content management system

00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,220
you're not just building a website so

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,470
matching the design is just not going to

00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,750
cut it because a lot of times the design

00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:00,010
doesn't specify how the back end is

00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,779
going to work and that's a really

00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:03,520
critical thing so there are always a lot

00:27:01,779 --> 00:27:05,380
of different ways to do it in Drupal and

00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,990
you need to pick the one that works best

00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:10,630
for them and the only way to do that is

00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:12,370
to talk to them so find out who's going

00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:14,350
to be performing this task how often are

00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:15,580
they going to be doing it you know you

00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:16,990
say well there's a really simple way we

00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:20,260
can do this but it might take them a

00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:21,940
little longer to do it in the CMS so is

00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:24,000
it worth spending a couple more hours of

00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,919
development to make this simpler task

00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,909
and this is a wireframe we got from a

00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:33,070
client it seems very straightforward a

00:27:29,909 --> 00:27:35,919
bunch of blocks with some dynamic lists

00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:37,690
and it was a layout that only appeared

00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,279
once on the side so this was not a

00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:43,919
repeated layout it was just a once-off

00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:46,390
page and it seems really obvious to us

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,370
once off lay out there actually isn't

00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:50,559
any original content on this page at all

00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:53,679
it's all references to other content so

00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:55,899
we said panels beans blocks and views no

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:59,289
problem we're using that elsewhere it's

00:27:55,899 --> 00:28:00,700
very simple and it's very efficient the

00:27:59,289 --> 00:28:02,320
problem was when we delivered this to

00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,710
the client they said yeah it looks right

00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:06,850
on the front but why isn't it a node

00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:09,760
everything else is a node where's the

00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:11,200
note edit page I'm so confused how do we

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,399
manage it I don't understand why there

00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,110
are all these little tiny different

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,600
things I have to edit it's not just all

00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:18,880
on one page how can we fit into the

00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,860
content hierarchy they were using a

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,200
really complex hierarchical structure

00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:25,330
and we used the node hierarchy module

00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,679
well we didn't know that this page was

00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:28,059
in the hierarchy because it didn't

00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:30,039
actually have a place there but they

00:28:28,059 --> 00:28:32,320
intended to use it that way and of

00:28:30,039 --> 00:28:34,149
course it's not a node you can't put it

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,910
in the new hierarchy so that was a major

00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:38,990
problem and the other problem was

00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,150
that they wanted to be able to track

00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:43,130
revisions and beans at this point are

00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:46,820
not revisional so that was just another

00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:50,390
kind of tick yep okay we did it wrong

00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:52,160
probably and now you know it just it

00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:54,410
just didn't make any sense of them and

00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:56,270
the thing is it's not as if we didn't

00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:58,010
ask the right questions we didn't even

00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:00,440
ask them any questions because the idea

00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:02,570
that this should be anything but panels

00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,600
beans blocks and views was like just

00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:07,670
never even under our heads but in the

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,070
end we rebuilt it as a node and I

00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:12,110
actually don't think we set up a content

00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:14,390
type just specifically for that one I

00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:17,360
think I think we did like a display mode

00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:19,490
situation so it wasn't a time it wasn't

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,440
a total disaster but I mean from a

00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:23,480
technical perspective our implementation

00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,970
made perfect sense we could defend it um

00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:27,650
from a technical perspective easy but it

00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,760
just didn't meet their needs so it

00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:32,120
really didn't matter that it made

00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:35,750
technical sense it was kind of a minor

00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:37,880
thing it only affected one page and we

00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:40,160
fixed it but this wasn't the first time

00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,660
we had a misunderstanding and it

00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:44,570
definitely wasn't the last either and I

00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:46,880
think it really led to a dynamic where

00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:49,190
it just got contentious because we would

00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,570
make a decision implement it they would

00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:52,430
tell us they didn't like it and then we

00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:54,410
got really defensive we would say no no

00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:56,990
no we did this right because these five

00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:58,940
reasons and we shouldn't be defending

00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:01,430
that after we've done it we should be

00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:03,650
presenting them our plan and then

00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:05,570
defending it before we build it so that

00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:07,970
it can be a lot easier to change things

00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,500
and and change our minds um so like I

00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:11,360
said it was a small misunderstanding and

00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,040
in the end we fixed it but these kinds

00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,900
of things really build up and just can

00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:17,120
can make the client just sort of feel

00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:19,130
like you don't get it and the other

00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,780
point is that like i said this only

00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:22,850
affected one page but sometimes when you

00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:25,100
make a decision like this it can affect

00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:29,650
the entire site architecture so it can't

00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:32,090
really be fixed without a major cost so

00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:33,590
it's just another example of how we were

00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:35,330
just thinking different things we were

00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:37,130
thinking how to build it they were

00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:39,290
thinking well what's the best way to

00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:42,950
manage it so we just didn't consider how

00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:46,700
our approach was going to affect them so

00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:48,800
um the next time we came to do something

00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:51,530
like this I started thinking about how

00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,840
we can find out what we need to know

00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:56,270
so this was the another build we did it

00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,820
wasn't a complicated build it's a simple

00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:00,590
enough design but from work for a

00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:02,030
content editor a page like this raises a

00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,440
lot of questions and the developer would

00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:05,090
say yet this is no problem I can do this

00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,380
in a second but that's not really the

00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:08,450
point the point is how are you going to

00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,310
do it and the the client wanted the

00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:12,560
ability to customize that sidebar

00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:13,900
content but the client will say yeah I

00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:16,820
want to customize the sidebar content

00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:19,130
okay well do you want to do it per page

00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:21,200
do you want to do it per section do you

00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:22,790
want it to be a URL based sidebar

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,770
content do you want it to be taxed on me

00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:26,270
based do you want to be based on the

00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:29,240
menu there are so many different ways

00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:32,210
you can do it so these are just a few of

00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:35,270
the many many ways that you can do this

00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:37,040
a field on each node that's a lot of

00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,420
work right they can they can target each

00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,670
page but a lot of work and you're going

00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,990
to get a lot of duplication one page per

00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:43,910
section it's a little bit more

00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:45,500
complicated to build but it's a lot less

00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:47,360
content to manage and also a little bit

00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,290
less flexibility because every page in

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,110
that section is going to have the same

00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:53,480
content a field on each node but inherit

00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:55,400
if it's empty that's even more

00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:57,890
complicated to build but a lot of

00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:00,080
flexibility again you can you can apply

00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:02,480
it to a lot of content or override it if

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,950
you need to and then the final way we

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,680
thought of is block visibility settings

00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:08,540
which is really simple to implement and

00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,010
it gives you a lot of flexibility but it

00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:13,850
can be a little bit scary that manage

00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:15,560
blocks page there's a lot of potential

00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:17,030
to break things on that page so you

00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,350
really have to kind of trust that um

00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:21,320
that people are going to know what

00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:24,800
they're doing there and I mean this is

00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,690
for probably 25 different ways you can

00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:29,360
do this and each one offers a different

00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:31,550
balance of ease of management ease of

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,370
development and just complexity in

00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:36,290
general so you have to think about which

00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:37,730
one's going to work best I mean you're

00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:39,200
not going to go to the client with 17

00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:41,480
different ways of doing and say hey

00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,710
which one would you prefer think about

00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,030
it from their perspective how many

00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,370
people are on their team how many people

00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:48,020
are going to have to do this have they

00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:50,360
use the CMS before do they have any

00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:53,690
technical ability are they you know that

00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:55,340
kind of microsoft word mindset have they

00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:58,130
ever seen drupal before do they

00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:00,320
understand how it works did it currently

00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:01,880
do this task in their CMS and how do

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,200
they do it there that's a really

00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,460
important one that I think people forget

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,200
about

00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:08,300
there's nothing worse to me that when

00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,060
the client says but in my old CMS I

00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:12,860
could do this and you want to say yet

00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:14,510
but in your old ziam it took 24 hours to

00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:17,150
publish anything but you can't really go

00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:21,260
there so you just you have to kind of

00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:22,280
get to that before so ask them so when

00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,510
they say something like I want to be

00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,530
able to customize it you have to

00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:26,120
understand that there are so many

00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:27,650
different subtleties and nuances to the

00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,300
different approaches that you can take

00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,920
to this do they need to version it like

00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:33,080
i said before we implemented beans which

00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:35,450
worked really great but you can't

00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,850
revision beans so that's a really major

00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:40,790
one and then again our their ongoing

00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:43,040
maintenance implications so say you set

00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:44,840
it up using context well we save kon

00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:46,610
texting codes so if they want to change

00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:52,010
it on the road are they going to need us

00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:55,160
to update a code setting and in the end

00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:56,570
we we thought it over and then we went

00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:59,000
back to the product owner and we said

00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:00,560
what do you think about block visibility

00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,020
settings she was really familiar with

00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:05,180
Drupal by that point and she felt really

00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:08,240
comfortable using blocks she said um

00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:10,220
yeah that sounds good like I said it is

00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:11,900
a little scary that manage blocks page

00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:14,450
so what we did was we locked down the

00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:17,030
permission and said only admin users can

00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:19,280
update this setting which in a way

00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:20,660
limits the flexibility a bit because you

00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,870
only have one or two people that can do

00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:26,480
it but it was super cheap it was super

00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:30,320
easy and it's really flexible so now she

00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:32,960
can target one page every page anything

00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:37,730
in between using any different number of

00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:43,880
criteria this is a quote from a client

00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:46,250
at the end of an inception phase at this

00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,560
point we had more documentation than we

00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:50,840
knew what to do with they said we've

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,870
thought of everything there's no way

00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:55,730
anything will change and of course

00:34:53,870 --> 00:34:57,650
everything changed everything that could

00:34:55,730 --> 00:35:01,450
change did change there were committees

00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:04,040
that change their minds they saw they

00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:05,210
saw the implementation like we did

00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,980
exactly what they asked and then they

00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:08,210
saw it and they said oh you know I think

00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:11,720
we actually don't want it that way we

00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:13,310
want to change that um and sometimes we

00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,900
said we're going to build it using these

00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:16,430
two contributed modules well it turns

00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,890
out actually those two modules don't

00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:19,060
work well together at all

00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:20,260
so we're going to have to either do this

00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:23,110
customer find a different way of doing

00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:26,080
it but the point is that it's not it's

00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:28,120
not that that guy didn't have a clue he

00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,770
really thought well we've sorted out

00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:32,350
everything and there's no way anything's

00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:34,570
going to change so the that's really the

00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:36,370
it's at the moment I you know at the

00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:38,290
time he said it I thought oh gosh you

00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:40,630
know he really doesn't know but that's

00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:43,540
not the point the point is that he's

00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:44,800
never done this before so we've done it

00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,870
before a lot and we're supposed to be

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,880
the experts so it's really our job to

00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:50,440
let them know that the end of the

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,120
inception phase is not going to be the

00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,800
final word there are going to be a lot

00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,420
of things to do after that a lot of

00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:58,780
changes other you're still gonna need a

00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:00,520
lot of input from them and so when the

00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,780
client says something like this it's

00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:06,540
really important not to just laugh it

00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:10,150
off and and say he's in for a treat um

00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:12,550
you really have to kind of educate them

00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:15,930
and and slowly but surely they'll

00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:18,310
they'll catch on and they'll understand

00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:20,740
what what they need to do like it'll get

00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:23,110
easier basically it gets better as they

00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:25,180
say so that that client that product

00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:28,000
owner who who might start off with a

00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:29,620
frown finds that as you keep asking him

00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,750
questions and as you keep peppering him

00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,370
with feedback he'll get better at giving

00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:35,800
you what you want on the first go so

00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:38,200
he'll say I know how I know how I want

00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:39,640
this done and I know what to tell them

00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:43,960
so that they don't have to bother me

00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:46,840
again which is good so um yeah it really

00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:50,980
is our job as as the Drupal experts to

00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:53,680
get from them what you need from them so

00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:55,420
like I said things change clients change

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,090
their minds developers change their

00:36:55,420 --> 00:37:01,000
minds stuff sometimes just doesn't work

00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:02,800
so the really important thing is like I

00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:05,380
said not to shy away from this and and

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,750
not to say sorry you told us this this

00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:10,420
is how it's going to go it's really fine

00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:13,540
to go through these kinds of them back

00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:14,830
and forth feedback loops we don't

00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:16,870
actually call them change requests like

00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:18,490
I said we shoot add up but um but the

00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:21,160
idea is still that it's an ongoing

00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:22,450
process so you're going to hit road

00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,520
bumps and you're gonna you're going to

00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:26,710
have problems but it's just about honest

00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:29,350
communication and and like I said before

00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:30,520
it at the store the middle and at the

00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,510
end of the project is when you really

00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:34,030
need to start thinking about

00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:35,200
to that project project vision so as you

00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:38,140
come down the line and you keep getting

00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,520
these um the features to start piling up

00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,620
and they keep making things more more

00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,260
complicated it's your job to stop and

00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:46,540
say hey we can do this we can do

00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:48,160
anything you want but do you really need

00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:50,830
it does this align with the project

00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,510
vision can we even do it right in Drupal

00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:53,770
you know does the client keep adding on

00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:55,390
feature and feature and feature and

00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:58,090
they're having you rebuild MailChimp and

00:37:55,390 --> 00:38:00,070
Drupal say no we're talking to this

00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:01,540
there's a mailchimp module sign up for a

00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:05,080
MailChimp account it's going to cost you

00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:06,700
a lot less money trust me so so just

00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:08,830
think about is this really adding value

00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:11,260
they're paying for it but are they going

00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:14,200
to get anything back for it and then

00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:15,910
where you need to redefine them change

00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:18,220
change the requirements simplify the

00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:21,970
requirements d prioritize things and

00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:24,370
just plain eliminate things but at the

00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:27,940
end of the day it's all about being

00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:29,890
clear and telling them in Drupal how

00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,930
you're going to do it so make sure they

00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:34,330
understand what they're going to get

00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:37,770
rather than sort of this surprise here's

00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:40,210
your here's your you I hope you like it

00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:42,460
just it's really just about open

00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:44,530
communication and and speaking in Drupal

00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:47,050
terms and demanding that back from them

00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,700
make sure they're engaged like it's a

00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:50,050
system that you're building for them so

00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,270
this concept that they don't need to

00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:54,340
know the Drupal side of it they're gonna

00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:55,780
need to know at some point right when

00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:57,460
you deliver it it fares so they're gonna

00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,780
have to learn it they may as well learn

00:38:57,460 --> 00:39:01,600
it at the beginning it's going to make

00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:03,220
everybody's life a lot easier um and

00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,750
like I said we do agile but I don't

00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,810
think it really matters what methodology

00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:12,810
you choose I think I think this is still

00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:12,810
really important any questions

00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:29,700
sweet oh sure how we manage budget well

00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:32,430
it depends on the client to be honest

00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:38,580
I'm some clients don't like the burndown

00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:40,710
aspect but I think it's all about like

00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,390
if they've agreed to it then they

00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:44,550
understand that they're burning down

00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:46,320
against a budget and it gives them the

00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:47,670
flexibility of not worrying about scope

00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,320
creep and not forcing them to fill and

00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:50,670
change requests so some of them are

00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,530
really nervous at first and they say

00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:54,090
yeah I know it's a job but are we going

00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:56,670
to get what we are we going to get what

00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:57,690
we wanted and you can say yeah like you

00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:59,040
can tell them while you want you can

00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:00,420
reassure them all you want but it really

00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,330
takes just the first few weeks I think

00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:05,370
of building and Drupal and showing them

00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:06,990
after a week they have a functioning CMS

00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:09,300
it's really about building up that trust

00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:12,510
and we like I said we send out weekly

00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:14,280
reports so every week we send a list of

00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:19,170
what we've done how much it costs how

00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:20,820
much is left etc but it really is just

00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:24,090
depending on the pine it's whatever

00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:26,040
makes them most comfortable but really

00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:27,660
once once you have the budget like like

00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,340
I said its twenty percent that that pie

00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:30,450
chart was twenty percent inception ten

00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:32,760
percent delivery and seventy percent

00:40:30,450 --> 00:40:34,320
construction but if you found that the

00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,700
inception phase only took fifteen

00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,740
percent of the budget that's five more

00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,390
percent you can use for construction and

00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:44,840
they really like to hear that they like

00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:44,840
to hear um oh cool more money

00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:04,180
that's a good question i'll have to go

00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:05,980
back i'm not actually sure let's see the

00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:11,980
question was how did we resolve the

00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:13,900
requirement about linking to a node and

00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:17,440
being able to see the link that's on the

00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:20,560
target node geez maybe we didn't like i

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:23,520
said they were happy with a simple

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,520
version of it let's see

00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:36,250
ah there it is

00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:51,860
which one of it

00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:53,480
oh it must be possible to create income

00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:56,200
within pages with the egg is clearly

00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,200
marked for authors

00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:09,020
i would say i don't think we did because

00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:11,780
if you really look at that closely I

00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:13,940
don't know what it means like Wenk

00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:15,500
authors must then be provided with a

00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:17,060
simple mechanism to browse a list of

00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:21,320
relevant anchors when creating links to

00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:23,300
pages so when you search for an ode to

00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:25,400
link to you get presented with a list of

00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:35,240
the anchor links on that node page yeah

00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:36,920
I have no idea how you do yes the

00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,510
question was do we use read mine and how

00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:40,970
do we find it I love read mine I've used

00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:43,940
it before but it's really simple it's

00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:45,530
really kind of just the basics it's just

00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:49,400
what you need and I think it gives you a

00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:51,260
lot of flexibility and a lot of

00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,270
visibility and I think that's what goes

00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:54,830
back to the agile budget thing when the

00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:57,680
client can see exactly what you're doing

00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:59,840
I think they feel a lot better about you

00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:02,360
working away all week kind of in a

00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,830
bubble they can see what you've done and

00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:05,390
they can see how much time you can even

00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:08,450
see how much time we've logged on it and

00:43:05,390 --> 00:43:10,400
we do have clients to say uh that seemed

00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:12,530
to take a lot longer than I thought

00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,570
what's the story with that and there are

00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:16,310
forums and their backlogs and there are

00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:22,070
a lot of plugins for read mine that you

00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:24,590
can do to enhance it and extend it well

00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:25,850
it's i would say dated is i think is the

00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:29,000
wrong word i think it's just really

00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:32,150
minimal so base camp is really pretty

00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,700
and it in it it looks really nice but I

00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:37,100
think it's also kind of overkill and it

00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:38,270
has a lot of Flowery features that can

00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:40,640
get in the way whereas read mine is just

00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:42,920
basically an HTML page with links on it

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,510
so I mean you can embed images and you

00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,700
can embed media and you can upload

00:43:44,510 --> 00:43:50,150
documents but it's very I would say it's

00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:51,830
very utilitarian but in a good way yeah

00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:54,050
and like I said there are there are

00:43:51,830 --> 00:43:55,430
plugins and extensions and you can you

00:43:54,050 --> 00:43:58,070
can seem it i'm sure you can make it

00:43:55,430 --> 00:44:00,370
look prettier but seems like anna seems

00:43:58,070 --> 00:44:00,370
like a waste

00:44:02,869 --> 00:44:09,319
yes this is my business director so

00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:54,310
yeah but

00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:10,540
but it's never a surprise so you're yet

00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,310
you're never going to get to the last

00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:14,440
week and you go oh my gosh we're not

00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:16,720
going to finish it's so it's so clear

00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:19,210
and everything's estimated and so it's

00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:21,250
much more um you're much more ahead of

00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:22,869
it than that so halfway through you can

00:45:21,250 --> 00:45:23,920
get a really good idea of are we going

00:45:22,869 --> 00:45:26,050
to be able to finish everything that's

00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:27,880
in there if we're not what are the

00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:29,320
things you can live without and if you

00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:31,420
can't live without anything then what

00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,400
you can do is say there's ten things in

00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:35,650
here we think we can do six if we

00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,180
simplify those six we can do eight if we

00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:38,920
simplify them even more we can do all

00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:40,540
ten there are a lot of options and I

00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,700
think a lot of clients that might have

00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:44,380
been afraid of agile at first find that

00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,550
really comforting and actually really

00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,930
cool they don't have to fill out a

00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:48,310
change request every time they want

00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:49,900
something and you're not constantly

00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:51,850
fighting them and saying actually that

00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:54,359
wasn't in the RFP so we're not going to

00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:56,470
do that unless you should pay us more I

00:45:54,359 --> 00:45:58,650
find that they actually quite prefer

00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:58,650
that

00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,930
yeah the question was if you if you

00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:20,700
don't have the ability to do workshops

00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:24,870
and you do have kind of limited access

00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:27,270
to requirements I think obviously like I

00:46:24,870 --> 00:46:29,130
said budget for it and explain that it's

00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:31,980
required and and really try to educate

00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:33,660
them about the fact that if they do tell

00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:36,510
you what they want they'll actually get

00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:38,100
what they want and the way you can do

00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:39,420
that is like say if you have a client

00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,590
that says I don't I don't care about

00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:43,050
Drupal and I don't want to talk to you

00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:44,700
about Drupal just do what I say if you

00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,810
have an example like that panels page

00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,850
where we built them something that they

00:46:45,810 --> 00:46:50,130
didn't want you can go to them and use

00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:51,600
that as evidence so if that's the case

00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:53,580
if they won't tell you much and they

00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:55,230
won't give you much access the first few

00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:56,820
times that gets contentious and the

00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:58,560
first few times that you find they're

00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,700
not getting what they want take that as

00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:03,360
an opportunity to start a conversation

00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:04,800
about you know if if you did learn a

00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:06,390
little bit about Drupal and if you did

00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,280
give us a little bit more feedback you'd

00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:11,520
be a lot happier with a result but I

00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:14,700
mean of course some clients won't hear

00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:16,560
it so what can you do but kind of cover

00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:18,510
your butt and stick to the word of the

00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:20,340
requirement I it's an unfortunate

00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:23,160
situation I mean I know that it does

00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:25,680
happen but there's not much you can do

00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:28,400
other than stick to the letter of the of

00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,400
the contract

00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:44,420
should be okay yes that's right um

00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:51,589
fantastic Pam look could you please show

00:47:44,420 --> 00:47:52,460
your appreciation for Pam Barone and it

00:47:51,589 --> 00:47:54,470
looks like we're going to get an early

00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:56,900
minute and during this early minute you

00:47:54,470 --> 00:47:59,839
could perhaps fill in your feedback in

00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:02,510
the eval you in the evaluation forms on

00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:04,369
