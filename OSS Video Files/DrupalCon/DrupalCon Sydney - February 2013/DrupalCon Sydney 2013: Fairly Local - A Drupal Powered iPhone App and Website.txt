Title: DrupalCon Sydney 2013: Fairly Local - A Drupal Powered iPhone App and Website
Publication date: 2013-03-29
Playlist: DrupalCon Sydney - February 2013
Description: 
	Fairly Local is a community-contributed local fair trade product search for Australia consumers, available as both a website and an iPhone app. As a community driven resource, consumers interested in ethical shopping add the local stores where they buy fair trade products, making that information available to the rest of the community.

After running a few years on a custom built platform, we this year rebuilt both the app and website on Drupal, rewriting and redesigning everything from the ground-up.

While there were many interesting adventures during the rebuild worth discussing, this session will explore how we approached:

- Native iPhone app development powered by a Drupal site
- Running third-party websites which build their own ethical product search powered by the Fairly Local Drupal site.
- Integrating Facebook Connect to enable a quick community contributions within the Drupal user system
- Multiple levels of content access for users, brands and certifications.
- The utmost importance of a strong visual design, alongside stable platform development
- Our mobile focus to user-experience, with fully responsive layouts for the website and a clean, simplified and focused UI for the native iPhone app.

We'll also explore our key learnings, and the considerations we have moving forward as we redevelop the site for Drupal 7.

done there I am Scott I I'm kind of

00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:27,599
excited to be a drupalcon because for

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,920
four or five years I've been coding with

00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,869
Drupal under a rock I've been that guy

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:34,500
under the rock in Sydney not Melbourne

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:36,180
who is learning platforms learning a

00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,790
bunch of different systems loves program

00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,960
and loves code but I don't really share

00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,610
that with the community I've never

00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,649
really been all that involved and so I

00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:45,480
I've kind of taken and taken and taken

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:46,649
and taken from Drupal and it's a little

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,770
bit of an opportunity in our Drupal

00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:53,010
where I can give a little bit back but I

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,930
am 25 years old I work at a digital

00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,460
agency in surry hills and Sydney called

00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:00,030
straight line media I'll talk a little

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:04,860
bit about them in a second but I've got

00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:07,229
to two main passions really that where I

00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,960
am now in life I think I found a way to

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:12,689
bring the two of them together the first

00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,189
passion is is for all things digital for

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:17,130
code for design that kind of thing the

00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:19,520
second passion is the social justice and

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,509
a real passion to see Human Rights

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,790
received for everyone in the world and

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:27,330
human development overcoming issues such

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:29,009
as poverty and a real passion for a

00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,770
quality social equality that kind of

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:32,850
social side to how I want to live my

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,340
life and what I want to see myself

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,470
achieve in the time that I have here on

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,049
earth and this passion for all things

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:41,729
digital alongside that and so for the

00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:43,649
last 10 years I've been developing and

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:44,460
various things I've been in designing a

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:45,990
various things and I've been a

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,720
freelancer for about seven of those

00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,790
years started in high school I made

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,310
flash games with my best friend and we

00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,860
had a scape scarecrow in the day and at

00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,960
night would make flash games and if it's

00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,719
back this interest of of pulling things

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,090
apart learning how they work and doing

00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,740
so digitally and so that led into a few

00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,869
free less opportunities with some family

00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,580
friends which continued for about seven

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,250
years as it formed a little bit of a

00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,720
business I went through training which

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,680
had nothing to do with anything digital

00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,329
whatsoever

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,280
spend a bit of time working with World

00:02:15,329 --> 00:02:18,900
Vision again doing nothing to do with

00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,579
computers or anything like that I was

00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:22,319
them I was working with high school

00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:24,659
students aspiring them to do the 40-hour

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,909
famine but along the way I just

00:02:24,659 --> 00:02:29,280
constantly just pursued in my you know

00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:31,980
my downtime in the hours I had free I

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,099
pursued the web I pursued digital things

00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:38,639
online and dumb and I really form this

00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:41,579
love for two things about digital it was

00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:44,189
a real love for bits and pixels I love

00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:46,500
code and I love design and i'll never be

00:02:44,189 --> 00:02:48,359
amazing a code and i'll never be amazing

00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,739
at design but this fence in between

00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:51,629
looking at the two of them and using one

00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:52,980
to inform the other is that place where

00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:56,790
i love working it's that place where I

00:02:52,980 --> 00:03:00,840
love doing digital things and so in my

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:03,120
current role at the moment you know I

00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,290
get to I'm the technical director at

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,730
straight line meeting or a digital

00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:10,500
agency of about ten ten people and I get

00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,659
to spend half my day in sublime text and

00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:14,849
another half of my day in Photoshop I

00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:16,680
get to spend half of my day working

00:03:14,849 --> 00:03:19,019
through checking things in community

00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,849
things into my github repository and the

00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:22,379
other half my day with a pen sketching

00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:24,780
things out and drawing it and working

00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:26,729
with our designers to them to find kind

00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,229
of visual solutions then working with

00:03:26,729 --> 00:03:31,709
our developers to see how we build that

00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:34,500
out and by no means are we a Drupal shop

00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:36,479
at streetline media but we are huge

00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,859
advocates of Drupal and so it's digital

00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,319
agency we do a number of things but

00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:42,060
where we can our weapon of choice and

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,829
how our units to our clients is let's

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,180
move towards Drupal let's move towards a

00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,040
platform which gives you the options

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,259
that you need because you've been on

00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,859
joomla for 14 14 years and there has

00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:54,239
been an update to it since and and so

00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,819
straight line media is where I found

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,040
myself kind of for the last three years

00:03:55,819 --> 00:04:01,290
it's a company that a friend of mine who

00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,930
had a similar story to me and I we both

00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:07,019
form this company streetline media and

00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,540
we formed it with one kinda core idea in

00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:14,069
mind and it was finding that balance

00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,659
between digital and social change how do

00:04:14,069 --> 00:04:17,849
we build a business how do we build a

00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:19,919
social enterprise which is going to work

00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:22,200
towards human rights outcomes work

00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,539
towards a better world by pioneering new

00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:26,669
media by using new technology and

00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:27,600
applying that to the world's issues by

00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:31,230
Jim

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,910
Wallace said your vocation is where your

00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,830
skills and your passions meet the

00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:37,170
overarching needs of the world and we

00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,000
really believe that as professionals we

00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,100
can do that in our work and we can build

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,600
a business which doesn't measure our

00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,160
success by the profits that we make at

00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,510
the end of the financial year but it

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,220
measured it measures it by the lives

00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:50,280
that we transform through the things

00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:53,250
that we create and so we do a bunch of

00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:55,200
work for organizations like World Vision

00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,880
this is war vision international Drupal

00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,700
site that we're launching on a career in

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,700
a couple of weeks and it's also a

00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:05,550
responsive site last year we did a

00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:06,930
rebuild of Fairtrade Australia's and

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,740
fair trade a new zealand their digital

00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:12,570
platform and that was a actually this

00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,010
one will come back to this second the

00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,360
fair trade australia that was another

00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,730
Drupal site and it was another

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,990
responsive Drupal site and down and I'll

00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,340
talk a little bit more about these guys

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,310
later on because there was some really

00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:27,930
great learnings that we got from that

00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:30,000
but we also work in we're still working

00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,700
iphone apps and mobile so while we love

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,670
online publishing on desktops and on the

00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:38,700
web into the browser I personally have a

00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:40,200
real passion for having tools available

00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,630
in people's hands which can bring about

00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,150
real change so this up here is one that

00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:46,650
well vision came to us and they asked us

00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,910
they said it was the church part of

00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:50,520
World Vision they said we want to create

00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,680
an app a resource for our supporters in

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,910
the church who can pray for us pray for

00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,290
the work that we're doing in the field

00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:57,270
when there's an emergency we can send

00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,310
out an alert and say hey get your arm

00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:01,950
get your people together less pray for

00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,810
this issue and let's kind of mobilize

00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,310
that Christian side of the work of what

00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:07,770
world vision was doing so this is an app

00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:13,200
that we built powered by drupal a native

00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:15,420
app which was giving those the work of

00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,420
world vision and giving that power to

00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:21,240
two well visions church supporters and

00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:23,880
so that place between mobile and the web

00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,500
and digital communications is really

00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,120
where we love working and the

00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,800
organizations like the World Vision's of

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,080
the world who are trying to achieve

00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,940
things digitally that's really where we

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,310
want to target our services and see the

00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,669
change that we do make a really big

00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,669
impact

00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:44,890
so for us as a company we really believe

00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:47,020
that we can be involved in changing the

00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:49,360
world through design through development

00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:51,160
through bits and pixels and we're trying

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,560
to design change one client at a time

00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,170
one website of the time but we also have

00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:58,060
our own ideas i'm also driven by this

00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,500
entrepreneurial spirit this idea of

00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,330
innovation where we can take our

00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,100
learnings and we can apply that to needs

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,690
we see in the world at the moment so we

00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:08,500
try and give a fraction of our week each

00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:10,330
week to developing ideas to working with

00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,010
our skills to make something happen and

00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,480
for me this is something that I've

00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,670
always tried to do over the last 10

00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,800
years is if I have tools in my belt I

00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,940
want to use them right now to make a

00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,070
difference in the world whatever that

00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:25,120
may be and for the last 10 years those

00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:30,480
tools have been digital and so about

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:33,220
five years ago I was in Tasmania and

00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:35,380
I'll tell the story in a second but I

00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:37,420
came up with this idea called fairly

00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:39,310
local and it's what I want to talk to

00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:41,680
you about today because fairly locals

00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:43,960
had this fun journey over the last five

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,000
years or so in the last two years have

00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,470
been a heavily Drupal journey and there

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,350
for me was this great learning of me

00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:53,020
getting involved in Drupal I'm by no

00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:57,160
means a true pearl expert on a scale

00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:58,480
from 1 to dress I'm about to but I think

00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,330
that's what's amazing about the Drupal

00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:02,590
community is because while I'm at two

00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:05,320
there's all this work for me to get

00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:07,870
ahead in Drupal to is an empowering

00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,520
place to be and to as a place where I'm

00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:12,010
not contributing to cool I don't you

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,170
know write custom modules and put on a

00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:16,570
drupal.org or anything like that but I

00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:18,250
do have a login on drupal.org and I can

00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:20,140
build a website and I can advise a

00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,360
digital team on how to build it and how

00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,760
to structure out our data modeling and

00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,740
how to engage with views and custom

00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,330
modules to solve some of the problems

00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:32,260
that we face on the projects that we do

00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:34,360
and so fairly local is this fair trade

00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,340
locator it's about finding ethical

00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,260
products where you are it's about using

00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:43,210
your iPhone or using the website to find

00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,620
the nearest Fairtrade cafe to find that

00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,510
cab reblog of chocolate which you're

00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,610
just craving and you have no idea where

00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:52,460
the nearest stories and so it started as

00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:54,080
this idea for me where and will

00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:59,210
more about this later on I want to just

00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:01,580
get past this started as this idea for

00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:03,170
me in 2007 I was working with well

00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,510
vision at the time I was freelancing in

00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:07,400
my spare time and I was just starting to

00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,980
kind of get a little bit involved in

00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:12,350
Drupal I was you know at the 0.01 on

00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:15,830
that scale of my involvement with Drupal

00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:18,320
and I was down in Tasmania and I was

00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,880
talking to high school students about

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,740
these children that I've met on it on a

00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,790
trip i went with World Vision across to

00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:26,000
India and i was talking to them about

00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:30,350
child labor and child rights issues and

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,660
i was i was sitting outside a car rental

00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:35,300
place in hobart just craving a coffee

00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:36,740
because i was really tired and I was you

00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,570
know impassioned at the time and wanted

00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,920
to find a fair trade coffee because

00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:41,930
little consumer decisions that I make

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,820
can make a big impact if I make them

00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:47,000
regularly and I'm using my voice to

00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:48,230
share those thoughts and so I do know

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
where to start and so I started going

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,680
around a few cafes asking if they had

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,420
anything no one had anything so I

00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,860
thought what if what if there was a

00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,440
resource what if I could just pull out

00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:59,060
my iphone and just say find me something

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,960
nearby which is fair trade find me a

00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:04,460
nearby cafe and as I generally do when

00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,920
I'm trying to think up ideas the first

00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:09,470
thing I think of as a pun so my sense of

00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,390
humor is really bad and it generally

00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:13,250
centers around puns and so I was

00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:15,470
thinking only there was like a local way

00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:16,850
to find something fair fair fair fairly

00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,550
local and that's where I started I had

00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,630
the name and I thought well how do you

00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:21,860
build that how to make something like

00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,960
that and started thinking in the back of

00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:26,090
my head I don't know i work with HTML

00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,470
and i build websites and tables i have

00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:28,400
no idea how to make a website which

00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,890
would do any of these kind of

00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:32,210
location-based things but the first

00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,980
thing i did was check if the domain was

00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:35,750
available the domain was available so

00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:40,700
that was an open door to start exploring

00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:42,380
it and so I am I found my coffee and i

00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,580
sat down i started to think about what

00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:45,680
this might look like and i pulled out my

00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:47,570
laptop and I started to explore to see

00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,070
if there was anything like it online and

00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,450
I couldn't I couldn't find anything I

00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,980
couldn't find any resources so I thought

00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,270
I could do this I could make a

00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:55,040
difference in the world through a

00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:56,720
website it may not be a huge difference

00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:00,200
but it'll be a difference and any

00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:03,380
difference can have a huge impact and so

00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:06,200
I started to think what might a fair

00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:08,120
trade locator look like what might it be

00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,500
to what might a resource look like to

00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:12,620
find fair trade where you are in

00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:15,380
Australia and and my general philosophy

00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:18,650
is if it doesn't exist yet then build it

00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:20,900
and so for about six months in my

00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:23,240
downtime I'd you know buy a book or I'd

00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,950
really topic I don't have Stack Overflow

00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,650
existed at the time but that would help

00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:29,240
to be a whole heap back at this time and

00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,980
I would just try and figure out what it

00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:33,710
you know how you do spatial measurement

00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,390
and what azimuth means and how you do

00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:38,900
some kind of a location-based thing in a

00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:40,460
mysql table and and none of that made

00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:42,830
any sense to me and i found a whole

00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,030
bunch of code which you know if i copied

00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,290
and pasted it all together i'd end up

00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:47,360
with the spaghetti script which would

00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:50,000
output some kind of a function and about

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,230
six months and I had this prototype and

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,300
I thought this is cool this could work

00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,330
this looked horrible but it could work

00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,370
it could do something as a website and

00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:00,470
and then I got distracted for you know

00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:01,700
another six months or so and then I came

00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,140
back to I thought this is horrible this

00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:06,770
is horrendous I've got to build it again

00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:08,270
and so I built it again I wipe the wipe

00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,560
the slate clean up or I'm going to build

00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,210
it again listen and that's kind of the

00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,860
story of fairly local to be honest is

00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:15,500
that it's remarry built about seven

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,330
times but this is the second time and um

00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:19,010
and there were a few times since then

00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:22,030
just trying to get it right but about

00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:24,080
two years later so by about 2009 2010

00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:26,960
after having put it on the back burner

00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:29,090
for a while I'd eventually come up with

00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:31,640
this working prototype called fairly

00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:33,650
local version 1 point 0 and it was

00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:37,490
Australia's firth first ethical product

00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:39,680
locator online and mobile managed by the

00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:43,760
community and it looked a little bit

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:46,010
like this it was a basic site it had a

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,890
search box at the top it had way too

00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:50,900
much text and hardly any kind of

00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,820
appealing graphics whatsoever but it

00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,080
worked and you could enter your postcode

00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:57,140
and you could find what was available

00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:58,880
nearby and so if you you know we're in

00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,380
geelong victoria you'd find organic

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,330
ladder where they have a whole bunch of

00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,620
products there which are fair trade now

00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:05,930
somebody added this from the community

00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:07,040
out of this particular listing then you

00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:08,090
where to buy fair trade thought I'm

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,050
going to share that with the world I'm

00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:11,660
going to let them know through fairly

00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:14,570
local how you buy how you find fair

00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:16,430
trade near geelong and so I thought well

00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:19,130
the websites working we're starting to

00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:20,160
get maybe a hundred hits a week which is

00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:22,259
more successful in

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,779
website had done before but by no means

00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:26,940
is a huge measure of success I thought

00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:28,949
but it needs an iphone app and I don't

00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,540
know anyone who makes iphone apps but I

00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:32,279
know that 13 year old kids on YouTube

00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:34,379
have tutorials he'll tell you how to do

00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:36,180
it and so I watched the 13 year old kids

00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:38,610
on YouTube who taught me how to program

00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,529
in objective c and i bought a object of

00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,300
c for dummies book and over about three

00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:44,250
weeks i learn a few basics are

00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,350
downloaded Xcode and i learned a few

00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:48,089
basics to be able to make this app so

00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,550
from the point of watching that first

00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:52,860
youtube video to six weeks later I had

00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:54,180
an app in the App Store and it worked

00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,149
and I used it when I was out and about

00:13:54,180 --> 00:14:02,069
and I could find fair trade that worked

00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:04,709
for about two years it was a completely

00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:07,079
custom PHP MySQL website and an

00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:08,790
objective-c iphone app and if you looked

00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:10,230
at the code and if you guys are

00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,810
developers which I imagine most if not

00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,610
all of you are it's horrible like it's

00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:17,250
the worst code there's about a thousand

00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:18,990
pages for every different thing and it's

00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:21,149
just all spit as a few functions that I

00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:23,160
wrote so wasn't all lost but by no means

00:14:21,149 --> 00:14:24,480
was a content management system by no

00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,980
means was it something that anyone

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,170
except me could work on there were no

00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:32,160
comments there was nothing and the

00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:33,779
performance was questionable but there

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:36,180
was some there was some kind of key some

00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:38,490
key successes for two years of sight

00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:40,529
averaged about 2,000 visitors a month we

00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:42,149
had 100 brands on board who'd log on and

00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:43,800
add their products and we had about two

00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:45,509
and a half thousand listings across

00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,939
Australia of where to find fair trade

00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:50,730
products and so for two years it was a

00:14:47,939 --> 00:14:52,319
resource that worked but during those

00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:54,060
two years my journey went from

00:14:52,319 --> 00:14:55,709
freelancing to starting up this

00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:58,829
not-for-profit company with my friend

00:14:55,709 --> 00:15:00,149
Marie and and we took this on board we

00:14:58,829 --> 00:15:02,069
thought let's make a resource of this

00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:04,680
let's make something beautiful from this

00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:08,880
let's redevelop using open standards

00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:11,639
using a responsive layout using Drupal

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,050
as the backbone of this project and

00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:15,240
let's make something which really sings

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,850
let's make something which is just going

00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:21,779
to kind of take it to the next level and

00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:23,120
so there are a few key problems that

00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:25,439
would learnt from this first version

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,779
which we wanted to try and overcome the

00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:29,279
first was poor for poor performance the

00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:31,350
second was that it was really timely to

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,240
extend the third that there were some

00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:33,510
major security issues and we got a lot

00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,390
of

00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:37,290
spam all over the web site and and the

00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:40,290
third was that the design was

00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:42,090
ineffective it worked in part but by no

00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:43,860
means was it mapped around usability and

00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:45,240
the user experience there was no user

00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,340
testing there was nothing that was just

00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,110
it's be a search box needs to be a

00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:50,400
description of how it works needs to be

00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,750
a navigation link and it's got to have

00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:56,520
the Fairtrade logo somewhere on there

00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:58,350
and so we thought what we're going to do

00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:01,140
with this old website let's build it

00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,210
again and as prioritized good design

00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:05,520
let's prioritize extensibility let's

00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:09,350
prioritize scalability unless prior

00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:12,390
adduct eyes stability and security and

00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:15,990
so this time we wanted to rebuild it

00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:17,880
right and so Drupal it was and and it

00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:19,260
was a natural fit so many reasons we

00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,020
were leaning towards Drupal we were not

00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:23,820
great Drupal developers at the time even

00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:25,250
now we're still good Drupal developers

00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,570
they're not great group of developers

00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,250
but it was the platform that we needed

00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:32,130
we knew it was scalable when you're

00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:33,830
secure when you're was extensible and we

00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:36,270
knew that we could have performance

00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:38,010
really tailored and fine-tuned to make

00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:39,300
sure the site doesn't go down you know

00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:43,620
when there are four people visiting at

00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:46,590
the same time and so this is what we

00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,990
came up with after about probably

00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:50,340
another year of our spare time spent on

00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:52,170
it just about it was probably about a

00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:54,600
hundred hours all up in the redesign but

00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:57,690
you know it's that hard to buy 100 hours

00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,160
in a year often and so we had fairly

00:16:57,690 --> 00:17:00,720
local 2 point 0 which was still

00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,270
Australia's first ethical product

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,290
locator online and mobile now powered by

00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:09,120
drupal and so we completely redesigned

00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:12,150
the interface we focus to all around the

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,470
search and we completely redesigned the

00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:15,390
map and we sent it everything about

00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,820
location based out the app and centered

00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:20,270
everything around location-based maps

00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:22,740
and prioritize clean slick interface

00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:24,240
focused around the core features and

00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:26,220
functions that a user's going to need

00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,220
and so I just want to give you guys a

00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:32,220
bit of a demonstration as to how the app

00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,540
works what it might look like if you

00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,280
were on the website on the mobile phone

00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,680
feel free to follow along it's a free

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:41,750
app if you want to download it but you

00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,750
under no reason to have to download

00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:56,169
so we have the app and we have the

00:17:51,489 --> 00:17:57,730
website now if we open up the app will

00:17:56,169 --> 00:17:59,529
see if it locates this in Kochi it does

00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:02,110
so we're here this is where we're

00:17:59,529 --> 00:18:04,659
located right now and if we want to find

00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:07,769
something near us all we have to do is

00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:09,730
first locate ourselves and then search

00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:11,259
we could search for a whole bunch of

00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:13,210
suggestions here we could type in what

00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:17,499
we're looking for I think we want

00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:18,970
chocolate and if we do a search we end

00:18:17,499 --> 00:18:21,730
up with a result just around the corner

00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:23,259
from the Loni's grocer learner's

00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:25,359
grossest cells a few different types of

00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:28,359
cocoa chocolate which is a very amazing

00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:30,940
type of chocolate I can vouch on its

00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:33,340
behalf and that's it that's all the app

00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,049
does it tells you where it is it tells

00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,549
you what they have available and then

00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:38,710
you can just get directions or view it

00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:40,989
on a larger map if you want that's all

00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:43,299
the app does but it does it well and it

00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:44,649
does it seamlessly and it's like a tool

00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:45,850
which is just available in your hand

00:18:44,649 --> 00:18:49,869
which you can come and go and use it as

00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:51,850
you need now on the web if we were to do

00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:54,159
the same thing we could come here and

00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:59,950
say okay I'm looking for chocolate near

00:18:54,159 --> 00:19:01,570
could G and it's going to return a whole

00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,159
bunch of results out our zooms a little

00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:05,109
larger on the website so we've got a

00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:06,249
whole bunch more results here heading

00:19:05,109 --> 00:19:08,559
out to surry hills and that kind of

00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:10,840
thing but we've got Maloney's grocer

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:14,710
it's four kilometers away and we have

00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:16,269
that same information here available we

00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:17,619
can click on a product find the

00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:20,230
information about it we can actually

00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:21,789
find all the places nearby which sells

00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:23,109
this particular product so if you just

00:19:21,789 --> 00:19:25,960
wanted to find a particular type of

00:19:23,109 --> 00:19:27,669
product you can do that as well and

00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:30,100
really that's all there is to the search

00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:32,200
on the on the website as well we've

00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:34,059
tailored everything around three options

00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,999
you can search you can browse or you can

00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:39,249
contribute and and the one thing I want

00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:41,440
to look at now is just will in a bit

00:19:39,249 --> 00:19:43,179
we'll explore how this works in in using

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,669
Drupal to power both the app and the

00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:47,669
website but really I've got

00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:56,870
a block of chocolate yes which if you

00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:59,720
pay close attention i will give you this

00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:01,220
block of chocolate because i my my wife

00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,630
and I have a cabrio dairy milk chocolate

00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:05,150
addiction ever since they went fair

00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:06,830
trade and so we have far too much of it

00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:09,190
at home and so i'll gladly give this

00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:12,080
away to whoever pays the most attention

00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:14,270
but I have this block of chocolate it's

00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,310
located here at rubicon Sydney and it's

00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:17,750
not listed on fairly local so I could

00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:19,010
wait for somebody to think oh I'm going

00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,200
to add that block of chocolate to fairly

00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:23,420
local so that everyone can find it or I

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:29,960
myself having this knowledge can think

00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:35,510
ok well im looking for Cadbury near

00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:38,540
coogi and I don't get any results and so

00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:41,030
we're going to add it and so first I'm

00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:42,710
going to contribute it's going to ask me

00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,590
to log in i'll log in with facebook just

00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:48,530
so things are much simpler and once i

00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,850
mean i can contribute now it remembers

00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:50,930
that I've already searched for coogi so

00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:52,430
it's going to give me a bunch of stores

00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,990
near could you that I can contribute to

00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,800
I don't want to contribute to any of

00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,930
them because we want to add our own

00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,670
store it's going to be called the crown

00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:01,010
look at that I was testing her before

00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:03,860
crowne plaza it's going to be a Drupal

00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,690
store add rubicon category which is not

00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:08,030
obviously there every day I may have

00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:10,370
added that just for the presentation and

00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,930
we're going to put in our location does

00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:16,160
anyone know the location here is it to

00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:22,100
42 actually I've probably entered it to

00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:23,780
42 Adam Street in coogee State postcode

00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:26,510
anyone it's not that important one two

00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:28,430
or three one and we don't have any

00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:30,980
websites or images to upload so I'm

00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:32,840
going to submit this and now added the

00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,550
store now I want to start adding some

00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,410
products to it and so we've got this

00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:37,580
interface which we've designed where you

00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:40,010
can say alright well just start typing

00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,170
what you're looking for I think we want

00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:44,210
maybe dairy milk chocolate it's going to

00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:47,930
add it to the shelf let's add another

00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:49,610
one maybe cocalo chocolate dark seventy

00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:51,590
percent now I know is the fact that i

00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:52,670
don't have cocoa chocolate in my bag so

00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:54,860
i'm just going to drag that one to the

00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:57,380
bin and get rid of it it's all updates

00:21:54,860 --> 00:22:01,460
over Ajax and so that's now available if

00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:03,770
I come here and do my search again we

00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,519
should get and our dresses a little bit

00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:07,580
wrong

00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:08,690
the crowne plaza draconian coogi should

00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,929
have our available block of chocolate

00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:13,989
there and if we need to we can just get

00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:16,820
our directions or view it on a map and

00:22:13,989 --> 00:22:18,619
this process here is what powers the

00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:20,149
whole website it's a community driven

00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:21,919
website it's about people sharing

00:22:20,149 --> 00:22:23,659
knowledge it's about people going out

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,249
and finding fair trade and then letting

00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:28,399
the rest of the world know that it's

00:22:25,249 --> 00:22:30,169
open open source of an open source

00:22:28,399 --> 00:22:31,519
principles really applied to a community

00:22:30,169 --> 00:22:33,469
of people trying to find fair trade

00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:35,239
share your knowledge be involved in the

00:22:33,469 --> 00:22:37,309
community make a difference by adding

00:22:35,239 --> 00:22:39,829
what you have because when knowledge is

00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:42,499
available and free everyone's empowered

00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:45,019
and that's really all there is to the

00:22:42,499 --> 00:22:46,519
website there's a whole other kind of

00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:47,929
bunch of back ends the brand's I won't

00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:50,359
go into that now you can ask questions

00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:51,349
later on if you need to but I don't want

00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:52,659
to spend too much time talking about

00:22:51,349 --> 00:22:56,959
things that people may not care about

00:22:52,659 --> 00:23:04,929
and so I'll move on and I'll head back

00:22:56,959 --> 00:23:08,450
to my presentation so how do we build it

00:23:04,929 --> 00:23:11,239
well drupal gave us a whole bunch of

00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:14,509
options to work with but effectively we

00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:17,359
build this on Drupal 6 apologies for

00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:19,489
that with location and Facebook Connect

00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:20,749
where our real key modules I mean

00:23:19,489 --> 00:23:22,669
they're a bunch of other country modules

00:23:20,749 --> 00:23:24,769
but they were the key ones which

00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:26,479
empowered us to create what we need to

00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:28,969
create in regards to use of registration

00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:31,369
workflows and in regards to geocoding

00:23:28,969 --> 00:23:34,549
data and represented that out now the

00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:35,809
main reason it was Drupal 6 was because

00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:38,989
when we started building it we were

00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:40,249
using gmaps to and and there was just no

00:23:38,989 --> 00:23:42,320
work being done on the module and so

00:23:40,249 --> 00:23:44,479
will kind of pushed into Drupal 6 at the

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,249
time in the end we just can gmaps to

00:23:44,479 --> 00:23:48,950
anyway because we wanted to use Google

00:23:46,249 --> 00:23:50,089
Maps version 3 and so we just kind of

00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:52,519
worked with some views templates that

00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:53,539
guy need to make a work but that was

00:23:52,519 --> 00:23:55,489
kind of the reason we started with

00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:58,239
Drupal 6 at that point and there are few

00:23:55,489 --> 00:24:00,469
really crappy modules which we made and

00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:02,179
they worked and I'll talk about one of

00:24:00,469 --> 00:24:05,329
them in a sec which could be a fantastic

00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:07,820
module if it wasn't written by me but

00:24:05,329 --> 00:24:09,769
the concept was really nice and then we

00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,450
have one really intense view which is

00:24:09,769 --> 00:24:14,509
that search view and so it's got about

00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:18,020
seven contextual filters it's got seven

00:24:14,509 --> 00:24:20,630
exposed filters and really young we use

00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:22,400
that too to generate those results both

00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:26,840
it's the same view which generates the

00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,460
results for the iphone app by returning

00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:30,110
JSON to the iphone app when it's

00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,670
requested and it's the same view just

00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:38,300
with different displays which returns

00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:42,170
those results on the website so how do

00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:43,910
we use location the location module gave

00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:46,430
us everything we needed to to geocode

00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:48,680
our store content types there's only

00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:50,180
about I think maybe for content types on

00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,830
the whole website there may be a little

00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:56,270
bit more than that we have brands we

00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:59,360
have stores we have products and we have

00:24:56,270 --> 00:25:01,190
listings now a listing is really what

00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,480
this is powered by the search so when

00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:05,000
somebody adds a listing they're adding a

00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,950
listing of a node reference product to a

00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,450
node reference store and so that's all

00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:10,070
the listing is and that just allows us

00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,990
to have used which I haven't got

00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:14,960
multiple relationships and a huge kind

00:25:11,990 --> 00:25:16,550
of load on the database there it also

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,170
allows us to make that nice shelf where

00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,030
you can add and remove products really

00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:22,190
easily but location gave us everything

00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:23,660
we need if we put an address in it would

00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:26,200
geocode that and we could store

00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:29,150
longitude and latitude in the database

00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,220
there were a few explorations we did

00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:33,860
around like I mentioned using gmat gmaps

00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:35,780
and a few other kind of libraries to try

00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:37,790
and geocode things but location had it

00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:40,040
all there for us at the time that we

00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:42,590
were making this and without the country

00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:45,050
module location how the project would

00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:48,800
have been lost so I'm very grateful to

00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:51,200
the community who build that Facebook

00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,020
Connect which I think might be called

00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:57,440
something else now but at the time again

00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:58,790
we love Drupal but in Drupal 6 at that

00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,560
point we didn't love the registration

00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:04,820
workflow and that was going to be a real

00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:06,320
hurdle to us having people contribute to

00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,250
the website people would want to

00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,110
contribute but if you're going to ask

00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:10,730
them to register then they're not going

00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:12,020
to want to enter all these details and

00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:14,390
they've got to ask questions about where

00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,800
the privacy is safe and what you're

00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:17,270
going to do with the data and it's just

00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,680
a nightmare process for someone who just

00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:21,290
wants to say hey here's where you buy

00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:24,410
fair trade and so we thought it's

00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:28,100
important that we have additions to the

00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:29,840
website being mapped to users but but we

00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,980
need to make that seamless and so as you

00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,399
saw when I logged in with facebook

00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,379
connect

00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:34,999
before the process is fairly seamless

00:26:33,379 --> 00:26:36,649
now if I hadn't registered before there

00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:38,359
would have been one extra screen which

00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:41,239
said do you give this our permission to

00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:43,669
access your email address and that's it

00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:45,769
and so Facebook Connect module they

00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:50,419
really enabled that in a great way it

00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:51,889
also allowed us to decrease the value to

00:26:50,419 --> 00:26:54,979
contributing the site but also open the

00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:57,289
site to integrated social sharing and

00:26:54,979 --> 00:26:58,369
there's a bunch of things that came with

00:26:57,289 --> 00:26:59,659
that module where you can see which of

00:26:58,369 --> 00:27:02,599
your friends have registered to the

00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:03,739
website that kind of thing but really

00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:05,509
just getting those permissions from

00:27:03,739 --> 00:27:07,549
users to be able to interact with them

00:27:05,509 --> 00:27:10,669
on Facebook through through your

00:27:07,549 --> 00:27:12,710
facebook app is just a great door open

00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:13,849
to be able to explore your social

00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:17,719
connections that you have with different

00:27:13,849 --> 00:27:19,099
people there was this one custom custom

00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:21,499
module we made which was called

00:27:19,099 --> 00:27:23,719
intention and the real purpose of

00:27:21,499 --> 00:27:26,269
intention was to Matthew users input to

00:27:23,719 --> 00:27:27,529
that view that we created now you would

00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:29,450
have noticed when I entered that before

00:27:27,529 --> 00:27:31,279
I had kind of two different types of

00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:33,499
keywords in there I had I'm looking for

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:37,009
chocolate and I'm looking for it near

00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:38,299
coogi and that's hard input to decipher

00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:39,919
what they mean it's hard to understand

00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:41,389
what the intention of the search is what

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,889
if somebody just searches for chocolate

00:27:41,389 --> 00:27:45,139
then you're going to have the geocode

00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:47,450
somehow near where they are or default

00:27:45,139 --> 00:27:49,159
to another country what is another city

00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:52,099
what if somebody just wants to search

00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:54,349
for a location say I grew up in barao in

00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:56,059
Sydney what if I just want to say five

00:27:54,349 --> 00:27:58,219
fair trade near barrera how do I know

00:27:56,059 --> 00:27:59,749
that browse no type of product how do I

00:27:58,219 --> 00:28:03,309
know it's not a taxonomy which is

00:27:59,749 --> 00:28:06,109
somehow grouping stores or products in

00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:07,609
term references how do I know all that I

00:28:06,109 --> 00:28:09,859
have to figure it out so we wrote this

00:28:07,609 --> 00:28:12,259
custom module which basically looked at

00:28:09,859 --> 00:28:14,839
a few things first it would check out

00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:16,099
taxonomy and all the synonyms related to

00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:17,509
that and so we can have variant

00:28:16,099 --> 00:28:19,249
spellings of cafe and that kind of thing

00:28:17,509 --> 00:28:22,489
if it found a match there it would give

00:28:19,249 --> 00:28:24,080
points to that match for cafe off the

00:28:22,489 --> 00:28:25,969
chocolate and then it would move on to

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,950
the next step it would break things

00:28:25,969 --> 00:28:30,619
apart with that conjunctive of near or

00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:33,019
in to determine whether there were two

00:28:30,619 --> 00:28:35,839
things in there so product near location

00:28:33,019 --> 00:28:38,029
or product in location and then it would

00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,219
iterate over the names of products and

00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:42,259
brands and certifications throughout a

00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:45,230
view output just to see if there are any

00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:46,880
matches and so what quite similar to how

00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:49,820
the default Drupal search module would

00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,679
work but there are a few specifics that

00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,970
we needed and we weren't confident

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,370
enough to be able to extend the search

00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:57,650
module to make that happen and so we

00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:59,450
wrote this this module intention and

00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:02,630
that module is used both on the website

00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:04,490
and on the iphone app I wish I could

00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:06,650
contribute it to Drupal but it's

00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:09,200
horrible and it's tailored to our

00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:12,320
situations so again my intention would

00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,630
be to in the future work that towards a

00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:16,730
better kinda approach to multiple

00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:18,110
different projects because I think it's

00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,860
really valuable to be able to understand

00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:23,630
sentiment when somebody's doing a search

00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:26,870
and the other thing which was core was

00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:28,340
views and naturally it's called pretty

00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:31,700
much any website that we would all

00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:34,090
create but having the power to have

00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:36,770
location interviews and be able to do

00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:38,240
proximity filters and that guy thing to

00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:40,549
understand how close on the kids to

00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,990
something else saved all that hassle for

00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:43,760
us to try and figure out how to do that

00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:45,980
with our own you know first time we did

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,650
the project trying to figure out how you

00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:49,850
do distance calculations between you

00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,900
know as a Muslim the curvature of the

00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:55,790
earth and all those sorts of things

00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:57,320
which were just well over my head now

00:29:55,790 --> 00:30:00,710
that's kind of some of the core things

00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,970
that were really important for us to to

00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:04,429
get the development working to get the

00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:05,840
functionality there which we needed but

00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:08,870
another huge component for us was the

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,610
design so one thing we really wanted to

00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:13,669
do in this project was prioritize design

00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:15,500
we didn't want Drupal to be the you know

00:30:13,669 --> 00:30:16,850
the proverbial cart before the horse we

00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,380
really thought the designs going to need

00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:20,059
to drive this we need to understand our

00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:22,700
usability our user experience we need to

00:30:20,059 --> 00:30:25,490
map that out before we build anything in

00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:27,440
Drupal and so we wanted to prioritize

00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:29,419
design because good designs isn't it's

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,820
as important as any great development we

00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:33,490
need to give the time it needs and we

00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:36,559
need to engage designers where needed

00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:38,960
and this was hugely important we have

00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:42,590
some designers on our team but the role

00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:44,570
of designers in understanding experience

00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:46,820
a lot of the time sometimes the design

00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:48,230
it can be quite eerie and what they end

00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,330
up producing which doesn't have any

00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:52,970
considerations to usability and doesn't

00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:55,970
have any considerations to the user

00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:57,919
experience but the ability for designers

00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:59,030
to work alongside developers is so

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,980
important it was really

00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:05,210
on this project to have that

00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:07,310
conversation to have that happening the

00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:09,470
other thing we wanted to embody in this

00:31:07,310 --> 00:31:11,120
project is a mobile first design so we

00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:13,880
wanted to explore a usability by

00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,400
shrinking down the constraints of our of

00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,710
our device and then starting from there

00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:20,300
and so when you constrain your design

00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,430
you'll find your user experience

00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:24,290
priorities and so for us we constrained

00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,670
it right down we thought we kind of want

00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:27,980
two things we want people to be able to

00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:30,230
search and we want people to be able to

00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:31,580
contribute their kind of our two actions

00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:33,170
on the website that third one browse

00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:35,450
kind of comes under search it's just

00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:36,830
another way to search but we were able

00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,270
to shrink it down and think well that's

00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:39,530
what we want people to do that's how we

00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:41,660
want people to be engaged we want them

00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:43,730
to find fair trade and we want them to

00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:45,410
help others find fair trade wherever

00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:47,750
they are and so by constraining

00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:50,240
ourselves to the you know the width of a

00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:51,800
mobile phone we immediately started to

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,050
ask those questions okay what do we get

00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:56,360
rid of what's redundant what's for both

00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:57,560
what can go out the door and what are we

00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,760
left with at the end and then let's

00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,500
build up from there and take those

00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:04,540
principles of a mobile first design and

00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,540
apply them to our desktop side as well

00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:11,270
we were just exploring responsive design

00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:12,950
at the time and what that meant and so

00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:15,380
we wanted to put it into practice on an

00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:18,260
internal project and see what it looks

00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:24,440
like to have one design to rule them all

00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:26,420
so to speak and and so we were trying to

00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,910
prioritize designing sites that respond

00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:30,890
to the limits of any device to ensure

00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:35,480
the best user experience no matter what

00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:38,990
website the what device the website is

00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:42,980
viewed on and I think it was important

00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:45,350
for us to to not get stuck in any

00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:47,810
particular frameworks as we build this

00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:49,910
on a framework called skeleton we

00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:52,280
haven't used it since but we haven't

00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:53,780
changed it since as well it was really

00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,160
helpful for us to have somebody who done

00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:56,600
the forethought and think all right

00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,700
let's think about the type of devices we

00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:02,840
have let's have a really basic kind of

00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:05,210
boilerplate boilerplate markup and CSS

00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,400
to be able to see how to make stuff

00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:09,950
happen but the problem we found with

00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:11,580
this was that skeleton was designed by

00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:13,650
someone who had an iphone and a

00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:15,780
ipad and so you've got four media

00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:18,690
queries you've got your desktop which is

00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:20,910
you know 960 you've got your portrait

00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:22,050
iPad you've got your landscape iPad wait

00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,670
that's what I do for you have to

00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:25,710
portrait iPad you got your landscape

00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:27,780
ipod and you've got your portrait ipod

00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:32,040
you've got kind of four designs there's

00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:35,030
no fluid Styles between them and so you

00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:37,710
know we've since then move towards

00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:39,180
bootstrap now I I took a long time to

00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:41,820
come around to bootstrap personally

00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:44,880
there's just so much bloat which goes in

00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:47,160
there but for us as a studio like our

00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,710
workflow has been transformed being able

00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:53,130
to have prototyping tools in bootstrap

00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:54,630
which you've got full control to be able

00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:56,940
to extend it how you like be able to

00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:59,160
strip things out that you don't need and

00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:00,870
I personally what I love about bootstrap

00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,880
is the thinking behind it and that might

00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:04,050
be because I'm I sit quite in line with

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,620
the way they've thought semantically

00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:09,510
around a few things but it's great for

00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:11,280
us to work in a team collaboratively

00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:13,950
with our designers with our front end

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,350
designers with our developers to really

00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:19,170
achieve the best kind of mobile

00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:20,850
responsive frameworks that we can in the

00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:22,850
sites that we're building other things

00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:25,890
we had to consider with design was

00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:27,900
planning ahead now we didn't really do

00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:29,580
this and that's the nature of having an

00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,950
internal project you don't really plan

00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:34,710
ahead you just ad hoc solutions together

00:34:31,950 --> 00:34:36,540
as you go along but we tried to as best

00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:39,420
we can in the time that we had to design

00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:42,120
sites by planning it out and ensure that

00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:43,620
usability was met and that's hugely

00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,850
important when you're talking about data

00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,670
modeling and that kind of thing but so

00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:53,400
often it's it's ignored or neglected

00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:54,240
when you're talking about design the

00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,380
other thing I think this is probably

00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,830
being mentioned in a few different

00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:00,540
workshops over the couple of days but

00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:03,240
you want to be in control of your markup

00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:07,050
as well and there are ways that you can

00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,880
do that not very grade in Drupal 6 but

00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:12,510
that was you know the sword we fell on

00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,340
by choosing to use Drupal 6 but don't

00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:16,620
let the Drupal the Drupal defaults

00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:17,910
dictate your markup you want to take

00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,770
ownership to ensure that you're in

00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:21,180
control of your standards and

00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:23,490
particularly in respect to your

00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,810
front-end developers for a front-end

00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,270
developer who's not all that familiar

00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,950
with

00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:29,200
rupal it can be a real nightmare to work

00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:31,420
with views which have 17 nested devs

00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,120
before you get from the parents view dev

00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:36,640
to your output of you feel so we use

00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:38,140
things like semantic views and taking

00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:42,190
control of the template files as best we

00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:45,340
can to do that and and try this weekend

00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:47,080
to control our markup I'm really excited

00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:50,350
about what's on the horizon in regards

00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:52,690
to that as well with Drupal 8 and the

00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:54,130
iphone what kind of lessons do we have

00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:56,790
what are we trying to prioritize when

00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:59,980
we're making the app or remaking the app

00:35:56,790 --> 00:36:01,870
the iphone was built rather than being a

00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,880
web-based thing compiled with phonegap

00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:06,040
or one of those other compiling services

00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:07,090
it was built in objective-c I thought I

00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:10,870
bought the book I might as well get my

00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:13,420
money's worth and and we used views data

00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:14,560
source which provides the display where

00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,600
you can choose a whole bunch of data

00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,390
source outputs and the one that we used

00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,530
was JSON and that was from that kind of

00:36:19,390 --> 00:36:23,710
killer view that we had which was

00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:24,940
powering the whole website and it worked

00:36:23,710 --> 00:36:27,820
really great for us and we've used done

00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:29,470
on a number of apps since but for us it

00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,330
immediately meant we could work in our

00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:33,280
libraries we could work with the format

00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:36,940
of JSON coming in we could work with

00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:40,030
Objective C to ensure that we really

00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:42,400
prioritize right design and good user

00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:43,840
interface on a mobile phone you know

00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,400
human interface guidelines from Apple

00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,720
and those kind of things obviously

00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:50,740
considered there too I've mentioned that

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:53,110
this is the other thing I wanted to show

00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,460
you now this is our slice file so this

00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:56,860
is every single element which goes

00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:58,810
together to make up the app we do it in

00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:00,040
one giant PSD we slice everything up and

00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:02,680
you'll notice there's two sizes for

00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:05,050
everything thanks apple for your retina

00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,310
graphics and so we're still having to do

00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,510
that I'm sure many of you guys are

00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,560
facing that problem on the web and

00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,790
there's a whole bunch of different

00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,740
solutions to work with high-density

00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:14,980
displays kind of thing when I go into

00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:18,280
that now but this just kind of gives a

00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:20,800
little bit of a snapshot into you know

00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,690
how we've composed the interface and if

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,760
you look at some of these elements like

00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:26,380
they carry across from the website we've

00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:29,020
got this dark color in the backgrounds

00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:30,370
long here we've got this strong or green

00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:32,500
bar at the top we're using the same

00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:34,110
shelf and we're using these same icons

00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:36,370
to represent different types of products

00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:39,190
we really wanted to make sure we were

00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:41,260
consistent between a mobile app mobile

00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:44,829
piece of software and our website our

00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:47,290
web platform we were building on now the

00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:49,569
other thing which came out of this which

00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:51,069
was really interesting is that it

00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:52,810
started a conversation with fair trade

00:37:51,069 --> 00:37:55,240
Australia and New Zealand we did this

00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:57,490
you know as a service to humanity we

00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:59,170
really were selfish really I wanted to

00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:00,520
find fair trade near me so I building

00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:02,410
that for me to be able to do that and

00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,000
then I said you rest of the world find

00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:05,680
the information for me so that I can

00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,660
benefit from it my intentions were

00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:10,329
selfish but they were selfish in the

00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:11,770
sense of what I wanted I knew would also

00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:13,900
make a difference in the world in some

00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:15,700
small way but it started this

00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,349
conversation for us with fair trade and

00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,390
this happened while we were developing

00:38:17,349 --> 00:38:21,250
on Drupal and we said to them hey what

00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:22,869
if we could because they wanted a

00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:24,280
resource like fairly local they wanted a

00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:26,770
fair trade search engine that they could

00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,270
provide to their consumers and so we

00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:30,310
said well why not why don't we partner

00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:33,220
what can we do with with fair trade

00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:38,500
Australia to partner with fairly local

00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:40,359
and so using domain access we actually

00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:43,839
created them for them a responsive

00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:46,540
custom branded fair trade exclusive fair

00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:48,160
trade search for fair trade Australia it

00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:49,599
looked a little bit like this quite

00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,430
different to fairly local you notice the

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,069
little power by fairly local at the

00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:55,420
bottom but the user experience is very

00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:58,660
much the same tailored around that

00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:01,349
search being able to have the intention

00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:04,420
sentiment there in the search as well

00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:07,089
the maps all kind of very similar but a

00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:08,589
different sort of display and the

00:39:07,089 --> 00:39:10,420
listings we've lost the shelf but

00:39:08,589 --> 00:39:12,369
everything is quite similar and this is

00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:15,670
actually the exact same website this is

00:39:12,369 --> 00:39:17,079
fairly local the same database the same

00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:19,030
views everything's still powering it

00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:21,550
we've just designed a custom theme for

00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:23,319
them and using domain access we can say

00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:25,119
all right this is the approved content

00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:26,890
which fairly local once on their website

00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,240
and so we don't get any of the stuff

00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:29,619
which people add which may not be fair

00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,630
trade certified that was really

00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:32,980
important to them so this for us was our

00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:34,960
first kind of multi site and it was

00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:37,420
really fun exploring domain access and

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,349
how we can do that there's also a new

00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:43,599
zealand version search fair trade co NZ

00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:46,390
which the same kind of concept except

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,800
it's limited to new zealand data which

00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:49,960
is interesting because we don't have new

00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,730
zealand support on fairly local but we

00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,950
do have it their underlying just so that

00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:56,380
we can power their web

00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:58,240
and so for us this was a yeah really

00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,890
kind of interesting process to happen

00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,290
alongside the building of their Drupal

00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:09,010
platform website to provide this service

00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:10,630
from from one that we already built but

00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:12,190
as I kind of think about every internal

00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:14,920
project every personal project I have

00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:16,690
got to build it again like when you hit

00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,680
a dead end or you get tired of design or

00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:19,570
something you got to build it again

00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:23,290
biggest hurdle we face is the fact that

00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:25,000
we built it on Drupal 6 but seriously we

00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:27,610
want to build it again and we're trying

00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,230
to find the time to schedule it in to

00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:31,060
really make sure that we can take it to

00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:32,710
the next level again and I mean I've

00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:34,690
been working on this project personally

00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:37,270
for six years and I think I'll probably

00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:39,100
work on it for another six just because

00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:40,870
it means a lot to me because it was

00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:43,540
instrumental in my development journey

00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:45,090
in providing me a platform where I can

00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:48,580
explore and try new things and and

00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:51,090
pioneer personally and then push the

00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:55,030
limits of my development capabilities

00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:57,430
but what do we have to consider do we

00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:59,530
build it on a Drupal 7 that's almost a

00:40:57,430 --> 00:41:01,870
debt we don't build on a Drupal 6 that's

00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:04,630
a decision or do we wait until we build

00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:06,970
it on Drupal 8 i'm really excited after

00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,140
the last couple of days and what Drupal

00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:10,090
8 is going to afford us for a project

00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:13,390
like this particularly with web services

00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:15,670
and symphony as well as just with one in

00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:19,420
to prioritize front end in our design

00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:21,160
and in our workflow as a team I'm stoked

00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:23,620
about twig and a bunch of different

00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:25,210
things which are coming in Drupal 8 but

00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:27,310
we course caught the last wave out on

00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:31,090
Drupal sticks and and we know that in

00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:33,550
the development of this site and so

00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:35,500
we'll probably explore building on

00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:36,790
Drupal I like rebuilding this site so i

00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,110
think we'll build on drupal 7 then with

00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:40,480
drupal 8 comes out we'll build on Triple

00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:42,640
A just because it's fun to keep working

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,680
on it and train you know simplify your

00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,700
code and make everything more stable and

00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:51,240
a much better experience but there are

00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:54,670
the kind of considerations which we want

00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:57,610
we have a whole bunch of modules running

00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:59,830
on the site to manage content access

00:41:57,610 --> 00:42:03,220
this is an area this is why I put myself

00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:06,220
in the to basket of of Drupal

00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,460
development because content access and

00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,990
those

00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:10,660
things I've never had time to bury my

00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:13,839
head in them deep enough to kind of

00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:15,220
figure them out but we were able to make

00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,839
something work for this particular

00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:18,460
website we were able to have content

00:42:16,839 --> 00:42:20,320
access where we can say all right you're

00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:22,420
a certification you've got access to

00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:24,430
every piece of content which is marked

00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:25,599
as fair trade certified and so you can

00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:27,369
approve that you can do whatever you

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:28,930
like with that content and you can limit

00:42:27,369 --> 00:42:30,970
it so that no other user can edit that

00:42:28,930 --> 00:42:32,530
content everywhere every other piece of

00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:34,510
content though which is not approved as

00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:36,070
fair trade certified free to any

00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:39,160
authenticated user to go in and edit

00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:40,869
make the changes as an open web site and

00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:43,089
we also have brands where we have a

00:42:40,869 --> 00:42:45,430
similar kind of limit see if you have

00:42:43,089 --> 00:42:47,619
content Wizards which is marked as your

00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:49,630
brand's content you're the only ones who

00:42:47,619 --> 00:42:52,390
can edit that what you and Fairtrade

00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:53,950
Australia and for us trying to figure

00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:55,480
out what the best modules to use how do

00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:57,430
we do that do we design a custom module

00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:59,109
I thought we do design a custom module

00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:01,630
to make work and then I pulled back and

00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:02,859
thought wow if we were a Drupal shop

00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:05,320
which were really good at this stuff we

00:43:02,859 --> 00:43:09,790
would do that but we are not and so we

00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:10,810
will not and so content access with such

00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:13,359
varied roles system between

00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:15,339
certifications and brands we would want

00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:17,950
her in a rebuild would want to explore a

00:43:15,339 --> 00:43:21,640
better solution there and we have a few

00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:23,470
ideas of how we might do that we'd also

00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:26,470
want to prioritize the social layer of

00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:27,790
what we're doing that was kind of I got

00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:29,260
left behind that was the carriage which

00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:31,540
kind of got dropped off in the push to

00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:33,070
try and get it finished on time we had

00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:34,510
these huge intentions of making the

00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:36,390
whole thing social make you deeply

00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:39,280
integrated with people's stories online

00:43:36,390 --> 00:43:41,290
because this is a website as a resource

00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,990
where people care about this stuff

00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:46,869
there's a community of young activists

00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:49,960
thousands of them across Australia who

00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:52,510
are behind causes environmental causes

00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,730
causes against poverty seeing our

00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:57,220
foreign aid budget increase 20.7 as we'd

00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:59,980
committed 13 years ago people who are

00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:01,720
passionate about seeing change happen

00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:04,390
from where Australia sits in the world

00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:06,280
and Fairtrade fits into that ethical

00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:08,140
consumerism fits into that and so we

00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,839
have this active community of people who

00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:12,220
are not really engaging socially and so

00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:14,560
we'd want to deeply integrate that

00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:17,740
social sentiment throughout the website

00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:19,300
so that people can find and share their

00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,869
knowledge but broadcast that to their

00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:23,440
networks

00:44:19,869 --> 00:44:24,940
well and you know the better you do your

00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,499
social the more impact your site's going

00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:27,789
to have on a broader scale and for

00:44:26,499 --> 00:44:31,029
something like fairly local where the

00:44:27,789 --> 00:44:33,130
benefit is seeing people talking more

00:44:31,029 --> 00:44:34,480
about where our products come from who's

00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:36,789
producing this where they paid a fair

00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:38,680
wage when I have my cup of coffee how

00:44:36,789 --> 00:44:40,390
important is it that I'm considering the

00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:41,890
planned and the soil which grew this in

00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:43,779
the country where it grew and that the

00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:45,849
people who are managing that yeah you

00:44:43,779 --> 00:44:47,680
know in a cup of sorry I'm going to get

00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:50,049
partially those in a cup of three dollar

00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:52,599
coffee the the producer gets about 3

00:44:50,049 --> 00:44:56,230
cents under fair trade that's about 12

00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:57,460
cents but it's it's just so important

00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:58,839
for us to be kind of considering that

00:44:57,460 --> 00:45:00,849
and I think there's a huge social layer

00:44:58,839 --> 00:45:02,559
which we could have in a rebuild of this

00:45:00,849 --> 00:45:04,990
site where we have an emphasis on

00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:08,980
shareability of the content both online

00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:11,319
and on the mobile less is more this is

00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:12,930
probably skip past this it's not all

00:45:11,319 --> 00:45:15,549
that important but I included it anyway

00:45:12,930 --> 00:45:17,710
we love Les and Seth where our

00:45:15,549 --> 00:45:18,910
preference is less I think everyone else

00:45:17,710 --> 00:45:21,460
hears preferences ask them the

00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:24,849
impression I'm getting in the talks but

00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:26,289
we definitely use that in a rebuild but

00:45:24,849 --> 00:45:27,999
I think it's really important to make

00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:29,200
sure with any kind of capacity assess

00:45:27,999 --> 00:45:31,599
that you're doing that you're not being

00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:35,200
lazy in your coding because you can

00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:36,579
quickly get so much blow and and less

00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,230
and sass provide these amazing

00:45:36,579 --> 00:45:40,950
opportunities for us to actually have a

00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:43,599
definition for what cascading means and

00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:45,430
yeah we would want to be smart in

00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:48,190
whatever we're coding in a redevelopment

00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:49,779
they're hosting I hope no one has a

00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:52,960
question about how we're hosting this

00:45:49,779 --> 00:45:55,210
because it's let's just say it needs to

00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,829
be better and so if we were able to

00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:59,400
generate some money from this then we

00:45:56,829 --> 00:46:02,440
would without a doubt moved to a clear

00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:04,180
to support that just because it's not

00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:08,200
good at hosting environment the moment

00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:10,210
and in fact to do this presentation for

00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:12,779
i downloaded everything locally just in

00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:15,430
case just in case it didn't work and so

00:46:12,779 --> 00:46:17,470
if you try and find that cabri block of

00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:19,440
chocolate on fair trade p.s i've still

00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:20,920
got this i think your hand was up first

00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,890
so

00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:28,210
feel free to share it around I forgot to

00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:29,470
give that out before and that will

00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:30,820
disappear from the website once you've

00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:32,920
finished that block of chocolate it's a

00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:37,030
custom module we wrote into that block

00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:38,440
of chocolate the other thing that we

00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:39,670
want to do is we want to give people the

00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:42,010
option when they're on their mobile

00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:43,450
phone to be able to contribute to be

00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:45,580
able to say hey look here i am and

00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:47,260
woolworth i can see for fair trade boxes

00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:49,090
of tea and they're not here listed on

00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:51,930
fairly local I want to scan the barcode

00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:54,880
enter the store and upper go so that's

00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:57,220
that's available there to contribute to

00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,690
do that we'd want to use if this were in

00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:01,660
Drupal 6 and help web services

00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:03,640
interpolate and I think a few other

00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:05,020
modules which have gained prominence

00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:07,720
since we originally built this I think

00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:09,840
rest WS or something like that might be

00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:12,600
another one but Drupal iOS sdk

00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:15,760
integrates really nicely with services

00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:17,980
and basically it gives you this whole

00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,080
layer and Objective C for you to be able

00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:22,390
to create note objects and just call a

00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:24,370
node save command and it takes care of

00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:26,020
all the other communication with your

00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:28,450
server you set things up with the

00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:31,480
services module and it will give you

00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:34,650
access to users access to pretty much

00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:39,220
any entity you can think of and it

00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:42,670
empowered my vision for where this could

00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:45,120
go and having a great it's available on

00:47:42,670 --> 00:47:48,430
github if you guys want to explore that

00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:50,440
work habit of released that but it's a

00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:54,340
really great framework if you are into

00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:55,960
native iphone app development at all but

00:47:54,340 --> 00:48:01,300
i guess the last thing i wanted to come

00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:03,760
back to is we are all pioneering when I

00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:04,930
was young I grew up in the mall not in

00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,630
the bush I grew up on the bush in

00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:09,970
barrera and I loved exploring I love

00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:11,200
finding new caves and imagining that the

00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,610
no one's ever been here before and

00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:15,010
always been here for hundreds of

00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:17,050
thousands of years and that thought of

00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:19,630
being in the bush being somewhere new

00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:21,580
pioneering new frontiers that kind of

00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:23,530
explore spirit in me always got me

00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:25,120
excited when I was a little bit older

00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:26,980
and kind of my early teens I realized

00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:28,690
that everything's been explored and so I

00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:30,400
kind of quenched that out but then I

00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:32,590
found new media and I found technology

00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,180
and I found these new frontiers where we

00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:34,640
can pioneer we can push through we can

00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,130
innovate

00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,569
we can create something new and that

00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:41,359
Explorer spirit in me was sparked and

00:48:38,569 --> 00:48:44,059
that's powered a lot of my my bits and

00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:45,980
pixels journey a lot of my design and

00:48:44,059 --> 00:48:47,900
development and how we can find our

00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:49,549
vocation where our skills meet the

00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,380
overarching needs of the world and I

00:48:49,549 --> 00:48:53,150
think for all of us irrespective of the

00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,769
projects that we're working on we have

00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:58,099
these tools in our hand which is shaping

00:48:54,769 --> 00:48:59,630
the future and we as a company you're

00:48:58,099 --> 00:49:00,890
trying to do that we're trying to do

00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:02,329
that by the clients that we work with

00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:03,859
but trying to do that with the quality

00:49:02,329 --> 00:49:05,180
of work we do we're trying to do that

00:49:03,859 --> 00:49:07,549
internally by coming up with these ideas

00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:09,440
and investing our resources into making

00:49:07,549 --> 00:49:10,970
something happen but I think Drupal is a

00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:12,559
community is doing that as well and I've

00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:14,599
been inspired by the talks over the last

00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,339
few days about how Drupal can make such

00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:18,410
a huge impact and so I just wanted to

00:49:16,339 --> 00:49:20,029
encourage you guys in closing that you

00:49:18,410 --> 00:49:21,559
have these tools where you can pioneer

00:49:20,029 --> 00:49:23,029
and push through some of the issues

00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:25,640
we're facing in our world at the moment

00:49:23,029 --> 00:49:27,019
so we can find a more equitable world so

00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:30,019
that we can find a world which doesn't

00:49:27,019 --> 00:49:32,660
have the man-made horror of poverty so

00:49:30,019 --> 00:49:35,329
we can find a world which is which has

00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:37,010
climate stability and we're not exposed

00:49:35,329 --> 00:49:38,779
to vulnerabilities from human effects

00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:40,759
and those sorts of things whatever your

00:49:38,779 --> 00:49:41,950
passion is whatever you excite to you

00:49:40,759 --> 00:49:45,109
about make your difference in the world

00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:46,880
apply your digital skills to that and

00:49:45,109 --> 00:49:49,579
together we can make a change is that

00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,769
together we can design the future and we

00:49:49,579 --> 00:49:55,220
can see real positive things come out of

00:49:51,769 --> 00:49:57,529
that that's about all I had to say open

00:49:55,220 --> 00:50:00,140
to questions if anyone has any questions

00:49:57,529 --> 00:50:02,349
from that I think we have maybe yeah ten

00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:02,349
minutes

00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:18,660
ah yeah the the intention module that we

00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:19,980
made it's not available online if it was

00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:22,230
that would be really great and we would

00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:27,030
have used it are we going to contribute

00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:30,120
that look honestly probably not I'm to

00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:32,220
be honest just because to make it a

00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:34,260
polished module which really worked in a

00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:35,190
whole bunch of settings and fit you to

00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:36,210
be able to say well what are your

00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:37,950
sources that you want to measure

00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:39,750
intention across and how do you have a

00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:41,730
kind of algorithm which measures

00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:44,060
sentiment based upon these kind of

00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:46,110
broader principles of measuring that

00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:48,900
that would be a pretty big undertaking

00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:51,960
maybe a little bit a weight above my

00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:54,480
kind of punching grade but there are

00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,890
sentiment api's out there which are

00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,060
available which aren't Drupal once there

00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:59,160
may be some Drupal integration done

00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:02,190
there but sentiment api's which can look

00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:04,020
at you know things like your followers

00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:06,570
on Facebook and measure the sentiments

00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:08,370
on kind of the general you know Twitter

00:51:06,570 --> 00:51:10,170
sphere and pull out some really

00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:11,520
important things about what people are

00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:13,070
saying how they're saying and what their

00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,730
sentiment in the tweet that they send is

00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:17,370
so there are those kind of things

00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:19,590
available out there in an open source

00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:22,340
sense and a proprietary sense as well

00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:22,340
yeah

00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:40,390
yes oh yeah the question was for

00:51:37,299 --> 00:51:43,029
community contributions I guess how do

00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:45,039
you avoid problems there like is there

00:51:43,029 --> 00:51:46,990
any validation any checking to make sure

00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:49,299
that things are authentic things are

00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:55,119
clear and what role does domain access

00:51:49,299 --> 00:51:56,769
play in that as well oh okay yeah so we

00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:59,230
have it depends on the content type

00:51:56,769 --> 00:52:00,609
really so listings there's no check in

00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:02,559
whatsoever if somebody adds a listing

00:52:00,609 --> 00:52:05,289
it's a pretty low priority content type

00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:07,509
it's pretty hard to span with spam with

00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:08,650
two reference fields except that you're

00:52:07,509 --> 00:52:09,759
just going to get incorrect data and

00:52:08,650 --> 00:52:11,519
people can just log in and delete it

00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:14,890
themselves anyway to keep that data pure

00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:16,900
for adding products we have approval

00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:18,880
queue which we log in and fair-trade

00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:21,579
login just to make sure we get a lot of

00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:23,289
spam in that approval q either that or

00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:26,619
fair trade fair trade viagra I'm not

00:52:23,289 --> 00:52:29,980
sure but we get a whole heap of spam

00:52:26,619 --> 00:52:31,569
coming through and and that approval Q

00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:33,250
catches all that so it never appears on

00:52:31,569 --> 00:52:35,589
the website and so everything is

00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:37,299
unpublished until we can go through and

00:52:35,589 --> 00:52:39,220
prove that for stores there's no

00:52:37,299 --> 00:52:40,630
approval q whatsoever if somebody adds a

00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:43,299
store it's only going to appear online

00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:44,950
if people this product there and they

00:52:43,299 --> 00:52:46,599
can't list products there which haven't

00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:48,750
been approved by us anyway so

00:52:46,599 --> 00:52:52,569
everything's kind of interconnected to

00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:53,799
that central product approval process

00:52:52,569 --> 00:52:55,029
which is where we have the permissions

00:52:53,799 --> 00:53:03,430
which don't allow people to publish

00:52:55,029 --> 00:53:04,960
content without us having review correct

00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:07,269
yet but the owners fan is on the

00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:11,589
community to delete that stuff as a

00:53:07,269 --> 00:53:15,240
community resource they could just

00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:15,240
delete the product listed there yeah

00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:24,030
no yes which was interesting with

00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:25,320
something we explored and we and we get

00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:26,760
down to the point where this is an hour

00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:28,560
resource this is a community resource

00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:31,680
and so it'll need to be managed by the

00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:33,420
community in that regard and we do have

00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:34,830
back like if they delete a listing it

00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,630
doesn't delete that node it just done

00:53:34,830 --> 00:53:38,280
publishes it and so if somebody goes and

00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:40,410
tries to get rid of everything we can go

00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:44,300
back and undo that and we we track what

00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:44,300
kind of publishing actions happen there

00:53:44,869 --> 00:53:54,869
yeah yeah we're so the question was do

00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:56,940
we have a.m. there's like an order

00:53:54,869 --> 00:54:00,930
suggest search there that was a little

00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:02,280
jquery plugin we wrote which is if you

00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:05,280
view the source go to the website you'll

00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:09,420
be able to see how it works it's it's

00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,980
not great but it works i'm pretty self

00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:13,380
deprecating I apologize about that I'm

00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:15,930
actually not that bad a developer oh I

00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:17,160
just feel a little out of my depth with

00:54:15,930 --> 00:54:22,800
all these amazing developers around us

00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:24,300
I'll show you on the homepage yeah so

00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,339
you can see that says cafes near crow's

00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:28,050
nest it is this suggested search where

00:54:26,339 --> 00:54:31,680
it's got taxonomy is loaded in so if we

00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:33,270
do chocolate near and there's a few

00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:35,339
popular Australia cities in there so

00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:37,650
you'd be alloted Melbourne maybe maybe

00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:38,550
not Melbourne Sydney I probably took

00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:41,400
Melbourne out because i don't like

00:54:38,550 --> 00:54:46,500
Norman what's like to one but me

00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:50,339
tamworth so there's a few sorry let's

00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:54,450
hope it is nah maybe long system no

00:54:50,339 --> 00:54:55,859
sorry maybe i'll add that employee but

00:54:54,450 --> 00:54:58,140
you can enter anything you like you so

00:54:55,859 --> 00:55:01,349
you say i want to find coffee near 25

00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:03,330
clinton clothes for our hearts no

00:55:01,349 --> 00:55:06,960
guessing as to whether that's where I

00:55:03,330 --> 00:55:09,480
grew up and it will actually gioco so

00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,800
that bit there is geocoded by Google so

00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,359
we send in the address they give us back

00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:13,980
long between latitude and we feed that

00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:16,369
in then if you can see it up here but

00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:18,060
this is help you it's pretty intense

00:55:16,369 --> 00:55:20,400
there's a whole bunch of different

00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:23,190
arguments which is this the nature of

00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:25,770
this URL is determined by intention and

00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:27,089
we explain the intention down here so

00:55:25,770 --> 00:55:29,509
says you're searching for chocolate and

00:55:27,089 --> 00:55:31,069
we certainly a 25-22 iceberg

00:55:29,509 --> 00:55:36,939
heights so you can do anything you say

00:55:31,069 --> 00:55:40,459
well I'm looking for cadbury Nia Hornsby

00:55:36,939 --> 00:55:42,159
well let's see if it fixes that yeah

00:55:40,459 --> 00:55:44,689
look at that all aggressive as Hornsby

00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:46,579
thanks to google and it found the brand

00:55:44,689 --> 00:55:47,869
of cadbury to be able to see what all

00:55:46,579 --> 00:56:04,279
the Cadbury products are that are

00:55:47,869 --> 00:56:15,739
available on that coming yeah it will ya

00:56:04,279 --> 00:56:17,509
yeah well correct yeah so just long

00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:20,029
during latitude and the short name of

00:56:17,509 --> 00:56:22,279
that particular geocoding so the

00:56:20,029 --> 00:56:25,189
question was are we catching the

00:56:22,279 --> 00:56:26,869
geocoding what happens when we get it

00:56:25,189 --> 00:56:29,089
returned or are we having a request that

00:56:26,869 --> 00:56:30,469
from google each time we do catch that

00:56:29,089 --> 00:56:32,299
but if you do a new search it will do

00:56:30,469 --> 00:56:34,999
it's only on this search command which

00:56:32,299 --> 00:56:36,139
does the geocoding well as well as this

00:56:34,999 --> 00:56:38,209
little button down here which is better

00:56:36,139 --> 00:56:40,789
on the home page where you can say

00:56:38,209 --> 00:56:42,049
figure it out where I am I don't know if

00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:46,069
this is going to work it's going to be

00:56:42,049 --> 00:56:48,849
Waverly New South Wales yet that one day

00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:48,849
I will do it gia code

00:56:49,410 --> 00:56:55,680
no that's just html5 s geocoding API

00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:57,330
doing that and then we send the

00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,180
longitude latitude we get from that we

00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:01,830
send that to google it returns us the

00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:03,930
readable name and we still that in the

00:57:01,830 --> 00:57:06,300
session so now if i was to search for i

00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:09,390
