Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Lessons Learned from Building a Large Multilingual Site in Drupal 8
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	With a core initiative focused on improving support for multiple languages in Drupal, Drupal 8 offers much more out of the box for building multilingual sites. It is much more powerful and offers greater flexibility than Drupal 7, and all without the need for the i18n contrib module!

Having recently launched a website with 13 distinct languages across 4 different regions, this session will take you from the basics of configuring your content to be multilingual through to making it localised in different regions and the various pitfalls encountered and lessons learned along the way.

The session will touch on the following areas:

Configuring your languages and language negotiation
Translating nodes and taxonomy terms
The joys and pains of translating paragraphs
Translating menus and user interface strings
Regionalisation (aka localisation)
Translation of views and other configuration, and why your module needs a schema.yml file
Varnish, SEO, redirects and more finicky bits 
Attendees should be proficient at Drupal site-building, familiar with content types, views, etc. Familiarity with multilingual in Drupal 7 not required, but might be helpful.

	00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,600
hello everyone so we're going to get

00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,940
started so today I'm talking about

00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:10,940
multilingual and the lessons that we

00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,980
learned from building a rather large

00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:17,609
multilingual and multi-unit and group

00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:21,420
elites earlier this year so a bit about

00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:24,390
me first my name is Stella I've been

00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:27,060
involved in the Drupal community for no

00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:31,230
longer than I care to remember four

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,690
point seven days I was originally a

00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:35,940
hobbyist so I did this as a hobby in my

00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:38,850
spare time and then I went to Jupiter on

00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,190
saket and realize other people were

00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:42,989
making careers out of it so I started my

00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,890
own company at which point I stopped

00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:48,510
contributing really and started working

00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,070
so I'm mainly originally a back-end

00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,350
developer but these days I'm mainly

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,690
managing a company but ever so often I

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,660
get to work in a project which is what

00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:59,520
happened to earlier this year so just a

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,129
bit of background about the project I

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,140
won't be really touching ours again but

00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:06,900
it was for an Irish multinational there

00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:10,080
are launching a new brand across the

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,210
globe not just in Ireland and they

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:18,780
wanted four different regions and 13

00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:21,509
languages distinct languages so they the

00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,159
content in North America was different

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:24,810
than the content in Europe even though

00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,470
they were both speaking English so

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,630
that's what I mean by multi region so

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,710
just to briefly summarize what we're

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,630
going to go through today time allowing

00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:39,979
first how to configure your languages

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,329
and what language negotiation means

00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:43,619
translation versus localization and

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,299
there is an important difference

00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:51,530
especially if you're using the

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:57,360
paragraphs module that's not me if

00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:59,310
okay so just some of the pains that we

00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,380
encountered there had to translate stuff

00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,829
yet the joys and pains of translating

00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,750
paragraphs and menus and if I have time

00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:10,200
I'll go more into the the multi-region

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:13,319
stuff at the end so first of all getting

00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,849
set up over here is used Drupal 7

00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:20,870
multilingual raising hands okay good

00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:23,459
does this is in the beginner session so

00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:26,370
Triple H is coming out and there are

00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,780
four modules in you need or you don't

00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,519
have to use them all but four of them in

00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:31,830
Drupal core you do not need the

00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:34,920
internationalization module you do not

00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:37,319
need i18n so this is fantastic there's

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,360
four main modules and let's start at the

00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:41,160
bottom language essentially just allows

00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,190
you to add another language to your site

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,739
so if you're just going to do a single

00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,870
language site say in French then you

00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:51,599
just add that it will download the

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:54,780
French language pack and you don't need

00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:58,590
the other ones interface translation

00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:01,769
then allows you to translate the system

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,329
strings so say like there's text that's

00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:05,730
defined by the module that you're not

00:03:03,329 --> 00:03:08,970
able to configure like say the search

00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:11,340
button text is allows you to translate

00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:13,170
that then there's content translation

00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:16,319
which allows you to translate translate

00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:18,450
your entities your notes and taxonomy

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,850
terms and then configuration translation

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:24,840
which I guess is the equivalent of i18

00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:27,090
and variable in Drupal 7 so it allows

00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,040
you to translate configuration strings

00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:34,530
that you might enter when configuring a

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:37,410
module so first of all you need to add

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:39,900
your languages so this is the it hasn't

00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:42,690
changed much from from Drupal 7 really

00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,000
looks slightly different but you can add

00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:47,069
new languages now this drop down and

00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,950
string shot is just set to custom

00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:51,780
language but you know French German

00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,940
Spanish all of those there and you can

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,680
pick those the one you want and when you

00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:59,129
do it will download the language part

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,780
from localizer drupal.org however in our

00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:03,659
case we were doing multi regions so we

00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,240
had to define different language codes

00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,690
like

00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:11,470
NGB for english in the UK and Ian well

00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:14,080
we just went with Ian for the US so I

00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:15,940
don't know we it's Spanish and Latin

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,580
America Spanish in Europe there are

00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:20,470
different language codes that we used so

00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,570
that allows you to do that and then you

00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:26,620
if you want you can download the regular

00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:29,140
Spanish pack and then import those

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:33,010
strings into your custom variable just

00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:34,930
to give you a head start so these are

00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:38,260
some of the languages that we had

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:41,740
so English North America Asia Pacific

00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:43,180
Mia Latin America I went on couldn't fit

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,480
them all on the screen we also had

00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,490
Russian and Chinese and I got pretty

00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,790
good at not necessarily reading Russian

00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:53,470
but at least been able to figure out the

00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:59,800
character combinations that made me do

00:04:53,470 --> 00:05:02,350
what I want so language negotiation if

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,490
you've air of you have used Drupal 7

00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,120
before so I'm not gonna spend much time

00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,860
in it

00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,830
but it's basically when the user comes

00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:11,230
to the website at the naked domain so

00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:12,610
how do they know how does the browser

00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:16,480
know how's the website know which

00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:18,760
language to return so the first thing

00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,470
that we've done is to set it to the URL

00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:24,910
so if you have come and you're

00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:26,290
requesting example.com /en then you're

00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,480
going to get the English version if you

00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,850
don't example coms a chef or you don't

00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,250
the french version so we'll check that

00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:35,710
first if that's not set then we have

00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:36,640
configured it to be in this place the IP

00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,560
address

00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,290
it'd be probably more standard most

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,680
sites to use the browser's of the user

00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:47,280
has configured their preferred language

00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:51,340
in their browser then it would use that

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,740
but as we were doing IP address I'd said

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:55,480
in English in North America is different

00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,100
than English in Europe that we couldn't

00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,230
just rely on the browser settings as

00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:06,660
they were just at English and we need to

00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:10,330
know which English so the IP address one

00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,970
by the IP language negotiation module so

00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:16,440
that was an add-on that we used and it's

00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:16,440
one that we ported to Drupal 8

00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:23,199
so I just want to briefly talk about the

00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,060
difference between translation and

00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,419
localization and it'll become

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:32,530
importunate later because it really you

00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:34,750
know cause me a lot of pain and I don't

00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:39,520
want you to fall into the same mistakes

00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:42,129
so translation in my head is you have a

00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,110
copy of your content in English and you

00:06:42,129 --> 00:06:46,000
want the exact same thing just

00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:50,830
translated like for like word for words

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:54,280
into French if you're have a view and

00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:56,500
you're returning all you know say latest

00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:59,229
news articles in the the current

00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:03,009
language then it will return them all in

00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:05,409
French say but if it finds a notes that

00:07:03,009 --> 00:07:08,080
has not been translated into French then

00:07:05,409 --> 00:07:09,460
the normal process is that it will just

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,569
return the English version because

00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:15,460
that's the one that has that's the

00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:19,569
master copy or the source say that's

00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:22,060
pretty much okay by and large as long as

00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:25,840
you're not using paragraphs so I'll come

00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:28,990
back to that localization is when you

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,520
have content in the same language which

00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,469
is targeted to different locations so

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,360
you're localizing a to the region so

00:07:32,469 --> 00:07:37,960
you're localizing English to North

00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:41,380
America or English to Europe the content

00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:43,150
often diverges so in our case the

00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:45,370
solutions or services offered by the

00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:47,590
kind were different they offer different

00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:50,080
solutions in Europe than they did in

00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:52,240
North America as a results their menus

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,580
also changed and I'll come a bit more

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,469
into menu translation later on but it's

00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:00,509
an important difference that the menus

00:07:56,469 --> 00:08:06,639
actually changed the links that they had

00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:09,340
so adding translations I'll start first

00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,580
with the the system strings it hasn't

00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:14,830
really changed since Drupal 7 you you

00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,810
know you enter in the part of the string

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,520
that you want to translate you find us

00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,949
in your language that's missing and you

00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:24,460
translate the one thing to watch out for

00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:27,699
here is that it stays sensitive so we

00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:29,409
are tryin swear translating and they

00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:31,330
didn't denoise notice that

00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:34,719
had to enters in perfectly in there are

00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:36,519
the same capitalization and spacing so

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:41,860
trading spaces and stuff like that can

00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:46,149
really mess things up so for who here

00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:50,680
has used NC translation in Drupal 7 okay

00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:53,560
that half the room so Drupal core and in

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,240
Drupal 7 had the concept of I think it

00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,459
was called content translation or no

00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,439
translation which was essentially when

00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:02,769
you translated your node from English

00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:05,259
into German then it would create a brand

00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:07,269
new node give it a new node ID and then

00:09:05,259 --> 00:09:11,230
link the two in the database through a

00:09:07,269 --> 00:09:14,139
translated node ID or at enid so that's

00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:16,959
done instead we have as essentially was

00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:19,899
entity translation module in Drupal 7

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,660
that's now in core so here you have the

00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:24,699
one node container and the fields are

00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:27,639
translated and you can choose which

00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:30,819
fields are allowed to be translators so

00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:32,110
it's much better it's much easier to

00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:35,470
translate especially if you're using

00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:38,769
field collections or paragraphs and it's

00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:41,800
just nicer in this case we had a node

00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:43,569
called bakery and this is the translator

00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,880
tab that you would normally expect and

00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:51,550
you can go down and add or edit the

00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:55,089
translation for your language enabling

00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:58,240
translation for your entity so you can

00:09:55,089 --> 00:10:00,759
either go through you know the structure

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,310
content types into your content type

00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:06,720
click enable translation for this node

00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:10,630
and then go into and edit each field

00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:14,050
that's a not very you know do it use of

00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:15,819
your time so there is a another page

00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:18,309
underneath the regional and language

00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:21,880
configuration section which allows you

00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:23,680
to just be checkboxes enable which

00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:26,559
content types are which entities first

00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,569
of all have translation enabled and then

00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,759
which content types would in say the

00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:31,990
content section and then once you take

00:10:30,759 --> 00:10:34,329
the content type but then it shows you

00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:38,259
the fields and you can just no take tick

00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:39,550
tick so this is the top part of the

00:10:38,259 --> 00:10:40,660
screen where you can choose your

00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:45,160
entities

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:46,810
then you get to your notes so you can be

00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,639
at a call to action node we use campaign

00:10:46,810 --> 00:10:50,949
node with other ones as soon as you

00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:52,300
click translate in the campaign then it

00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:55,000
shows the fields and you can take

00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:58,120
translate on those and it's not just

00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,370
nodes it's also taxonomy terms and any

00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:06,000
other entity so from products to menus

00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:06,000
and so on so I'm just going to quickly

00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:10,449
okay that did not keep my browser over

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:18,910
there

00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:25,389
I better not put up the trivia questions

00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:29,490
and my browser with my handily

00:11:25,389 --> 00:11:29,490
pre-prepared tabs has disappeared

00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:46,470
hmm I'm just on there again this is a

00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:52,190
old test site so you can ignore the

00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:58,800
security warning so configuration

00:11:52,190 --> 00:12:01,290
regional language so content language

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:09,209
translation see if I can make that

00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:10,500
bigger to new readers at the back so I'm

00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:11,670
just don't assume that you will it

00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,740
doesn't really it's not relevant for

00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:16,320
this point the point is you choose your

00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:18,180
entities at the top and then you enable

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,770
it if you have a lot of tons and types

00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:21,570
and you're translating them all and they

00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,800
all have lots of fields and then you've

00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,620
got paragraphs and you're translating

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,779
them and taxonomy terms and menus and

00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:34,350
blocks you get a page that looks like

00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:37,260
this so it's not the best user

00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:40,520
experience it's trickier than going in

00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:43,520
and editing each field individually but

00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,520
yeah

00:12:52,620 --> 00:13:02,730
so menus there's a few sort of minor

00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:05,590
gotchas it's straightforward enough but

00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:07,750
it really it tripped up our kinds and

00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:10,030
numerous occasions first of all I'm not

00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:11,890
saying back long strain you can choose

00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:13,540
to translate your custom menu links so

00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:14,650
you choose that and then you can

00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:17,080
translate the title and the description

00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:20,680
and when it was last changed if you so

00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:22,840
wish that's fine when you go into your

00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:25,930
menu configuration you datastream like

00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:28,120
this so you can see your menu items and

00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:31,840
then you've got this Translate menu at

00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:33,850
the top which it kind of has the design

00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:35,770
same design pattern as when you go to

00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:38,530
translate a node it has the translate

00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:40,540
tab we cited at the top however if you

00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:42,190
don't click on that translate menu what

00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:45,220
you're actually doing is translating

00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:47,530
main navigation and site section links

00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:49,930
you're not translating the links within

00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:52,480
the menu you actually have to go and

00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:56,400
click on the drop down button besides

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,400
each link and click translate on those

00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:04,270
the other thing to watch out for which I

00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:07,990
alluded to earlier is straight you can

00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:10,300
translate menus links but there are some

00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,070
things that are the same across all

00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:15,070
languages

00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:17,110
so you'll see and then it just includes

00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:18,790
it's you know handling all the languages

00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:22,480
and brackets after so I just didn't

00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:25,780
notice it at the time that you know

00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:29,380
enabled our languages and shows expanded

00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:32,530
our languages and the link our languages

00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:34,390
so if you change that it effects all

00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:36,490
your translations across the entire site

00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:37,360
and what happened with us was they had

00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:39,580
different solutions

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,740
they'd solutions services in their menu

00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,390
and we they had different solutions in

00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,550
different regions what we ended up

00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:48,340
having to do was cloning the entire menu

00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,020
and translation again just solely to

00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:53,170
change the thing can remove wouldn't

00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:55,090
solution from the menu and there isn't a

00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:59,850
workaround for that you just have to do

00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:59,850
it so just watch out for that

00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:07,210
so who here is use paragraphs oh goody

00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,130
who here is these paragraphs and Drupal

00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:15,010
8 yay

00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:19,660
I know paragraphs paragraphs is where

00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:26,440
translation that's messy so it's worth

00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:28,720
taking it back a bit ok so when I'm with

00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,940
entity translation when you translate

00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:34,270
something from English to Irish or

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:36,490
French or whatever you have the same

00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:38,170
node ID and you just have the their

00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,940
story of different aspects I think I

00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:42,580
like to think of its different views in

00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:45,790
on the node and just the fields or

00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:47,410
translators and that's fine and that

00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:49,450
that's just not just for notes for

00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:51,910
entities so paragraphs are entities in

00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:53,920
their own right so the recommendation

00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:57,070
for paragraphs out of the box is that

00:15:53,920 --> 00:16:00,490
you don't translate the paragraph field

00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:04,270
but you translate the paragraph entity

00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:08,020
yeah sure I got that right so what ends

00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:10,030
up happening is you have one paragraph

00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,070
with the one paragraph ID with different

00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:15,700
aspects it's just different the fields

00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:18,520
on it translated which is fine until you

00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:20,560
actually want to change the paragraphs

00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:22,990
that you have and by change the

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:25,480
paragraphs I mean you want to remove one

00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:28,060
or you want to add one or you just want

00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:31,330
a different image or something on us if

00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:34,030
you need to reorder them in one language

00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:35,380
over another angry language then this

00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:37,630
isn't working because the reordering

00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:40,090
effects all your language versions and

00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,950
if you remove one everyone moves it from

00:16:40,090 --> 00:16:44,230
all the languages not just the one that

00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:47,230
you're currently translating similarly

00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:49,060
if you want to add one to the German

00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:51,580
version of your site you can tell sister

00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:55,300
na you're not allowed to do that so

00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:56,860
there is you need to do localization you

00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,830
need to translate the paragraph field

00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:04,209
not the paragraph entity however to do

00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:05,949
that you need a patch and it's not fully

00:17:04,209 --> 00:17:07,240
stable well actually the patch works

00:17:05,949 --> 00:17:09,250
pretty well and we've been using it for

00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,209
six months it just doesn't have tests

00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,640
and other

00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:14,709
maybe some edge cases are in debt so I

00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,299
will say use at your own risk but it has

00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:19,990
been in production for us for six months

00:17:16,299 --> 00:17:22,720
and it's been working perfectly however

00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:25,329
I mentioned that it's important to debt

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,089
translation versus localization right at

00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:32,140
the beginning of your project because we

00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:33,760
didn't and what happened was we went

00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,460
okay right we need to translate the

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,169
fields not the paragraph entity let's go

00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,440
change her configuration and that long

00:17:38,169 --> 00:17:44,289
list of things and once we did that all

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,200
of our translations went and disappeared

00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:49,720
and they all reverted to English and we

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,880
had we're still not in production which

00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:55,240
is fine we were close to production

00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:59,279
which was not so fine and it had two

00:17:55,240 --> 00:18:02,590
months of content added by these users

00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,240
so the translations were still there

00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,909
they were in the database they just

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,070
weren't able to be accessed so we had to

00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:13,120
do like a bit of hacking and database

00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:18,190
hacking and fix it so I maybe just do it

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:19,960
right the first time it's a worthwhile

00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:22,600
conversation to have with your client

00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,850
and we've just we have actually had this

00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,860
conversation with kinds like in Ireland

00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,960
public sector bodies you have to produce

00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:31,240
your websites in English and Irish or at

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:36,070
least as much Irish as you can get away

00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:37,779
with or as little so but they're very

00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,279
very much in the light for light

00:18:37,779 --> 00:18:40,750
translation we were just translating the

00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:42,520
content we're not changing the menus we

00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:44,919
don't have different things in different

00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,130
languages but what did happen to us well

00:18:44,919 --> 00:18:49,899
is that is fine the majority of cases

00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:53,250
they're a bit slow at doing their Irish

00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:55,059
translations so when they have a

00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:58,120
paragraphs and stuff in the homepage

00:18:55,059 --> 00:19:00,250
they want to be able to have different

00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:03,640
content pulled in as they're highlighted

00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:05,679
you know press release or whatever and

00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,390
you can't do that if you're doing

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,070
translation you will default back to the

00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,990
English and so they actually want the

00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:12,340
content to have a diverge simply because

00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:13,960
they don't have the translation ready

00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:15,520
yet and they don't want to display

00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,590
English on the Irish version because

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:22,990
that's just a whole political mess

00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:30,350
so just integrate translating

00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:34,370
configuration then so modules like the

00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:37,130
easy breadcrumb module come with strings

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:39,080
that you can after a computer or sorry

00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:41,720
often configure through the user

00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,210
interface so this was a very simple

00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,730
example but with the easy breadcrumb

00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:50,720
module you can configure the text for

00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:51,890
the home link and you can say you you

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,659
know that you want to be home or you

00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,159
wanted to be something else I don't know

00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,260
why you wouldn't choose home but I mean

00:19:55,159 --> 00:20:01,279
you you then need to translate that

00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:03,620
though so this module at the start of

00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:06,850
the project we patched it and contribute

00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:10,399
to the pack it didn't support

00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:12,620
translation well I'll come back to that

00:20:10,399 --> 00:20:14,659
in one second the next slide is when you

00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,520
do take translate so let's translate

00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:18,679
easy breadcrumb tap at the top when you

00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,950
do click it need a page like you would

00:20:18,679 --> 00:20:23,600
with any other translation thing with

00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,929
the various fields that you just the

00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:30,710
ones that can be translated so it didn't

00:20:26,929 --> 00:20:34,130
work it was impossible to translate it

00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:36,620
so for the module developers or patchers

00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:38,840
in the room there's three steamer for us

00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:42,080
are three llamo files that you need the

00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:44,390
first is the schema which defines you

00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,270
should have it anyway it defines what

00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:50,149
variables or configuration settings you

00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:53,210
can capture and your module only two of

00:20:50,149 --> 00:20:58,669
them types are translatable text to

00:20:53,210 --> 00:21:00,200
label if you use the string type or you

00:20:58,669 --> 00:21:02,899
know field type that there's boolean and

00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,490
string and reference and text and so on

00:21:02,899 --> 00:21:06,049
if you use the string it's not

00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:08,090
translatable I'm not quite sure the

00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:09,890
reasoning behind that but you want to

00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:12,610
use text or label depending on this

00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:16,399
whether it's a text field or a text area

00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:19,850
you also so I did that and then I also

00:21:16,399 --> 00:21:22,580
added in my config translation Yama file

00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,590
which essentially just says hey this

00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:27,020
module has translation or configuration

00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:28,520
that can be translated I didn't really

00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:31,640
know what that did and I'll come back to

00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:31,950
later says it it would have saved me but

00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,180
it's

00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:37,920
when I would just save me time figuring

00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,390
out why the other third part doesn't

00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:43,650
work which is where I needed the third

00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:46,800
Yama file which is the the Lynx task so

00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:48,870
I had the steamer triggered and I had

00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:50,790
the module saying hey I've configuration

00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:55,380
that can be translated what I didn't

00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:58,320
have was a menu task item for the easy

00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:00,060
bread crumb module I could access easy

00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,040
breadcrumb configuration page it was in

00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,080
the menu but they didn't have a local

00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,900
task so that meant it couldn't have a

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:10,710
tab and if it couldn't have a tab then

00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:12,210
the config translation couldn't attach

00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:21,540
itself to its parent and give a

00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:24,210
translate tab beside us but if I had

00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:27,540
known what the configuration translation

00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:29,100
Yama file did I would have spotted that

00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:31,440
the page was actually there it was just

00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:35,610
absurd missing and what it actually does

00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:38,430
is underneath so administration

00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:42,240
configuration regional language there is

00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:44,040
a configuration translation link where

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,260
you can like the content one that we saw

00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,120
earlier that was really long there's

00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,620
another tab or menu item there where you

00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,210
can go in and see what modules have

00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,980
declared that they have translated our

00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,240
configuration to translate and you can

00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,280
just go in there and it's sort of a

00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:04,580
handy gateway to translating different

00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:04,580
modules any case so translating views

00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:13,920
this is the top of a news view so it's

00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:15,600
possible to translate we use or

00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:20,580
translate views and Drupal 8 out of the

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:26,220
box which is the user interface isn't so

00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:32,220
great so maybe I'll just show you what

00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:35,150
it is like in reality this is very quick

00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:35,150
you might try to load up

00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:40,820
well

00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,580
so we're some news

00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:57,220
you sneeze using resources so you can

00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,870
just go here and translate or you can go

00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:08,020
in and edit and then hit them translate

00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:10,840
tab and then you pick your language so

00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:13,900
this is the views configuration we have

00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,280
I don't really see it but you've got the

00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,740
different displays I'm guessing over

00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:21,610
here you're right it really is difficult

00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:24,400
to see the screen from here so you have

00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:27,070
your master just have your master

00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:29,800
display settings and there's a lot of

00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:33,400
clicking in so if you have expose

00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:35,200
filters you eventually get in here and

00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:43,480
you can change the search button or

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:45,670
apply button you eventually can take in

00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:52,930
and you can change the actions per page

00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:55,360
text in the pager filters yeah there's a

00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:57,520
lot of clicking or nested stuff that

00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,440
goes on if you want to change the text

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,330
that appears in the menu then you have

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,330
to find a page display I can't see

00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:09,810
whether these are page displays or not

00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:17,110
this one is yeah and then take and

00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:19,330
somewhere in here honest there's a lot

00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:21,580
of thinking I know somewhere in there

00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:24,250
you can translate the menu item and so

00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:25,810
on and it's just it it's great that you

00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:28,330
can do that but there is a lot of

00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:31,300
Nestor's clicking in to it the other

00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:35,020
thing to watch out for is if you've not

00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:37,630
fused exposed filters and say you have a

00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:41,650
views exposed filter on the taxonomy

00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:43,660
tags directory or taxonomy term you

00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:45,790
actually have to go to structure

00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:47,110
taxonomy types find the tags and

00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:48,970
translate them there and not in the view

00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:53,790
which makes sense when you think about

00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:53,790
it but it can't be a bit confusing I

00:25:54,180 --> 00:26:04,410
want you to bring ok for time okay

00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:05,550
so looked realization so yeah as I

00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:08,280
mentioned earlier at this particular

00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:10,440
site they wanted different the same

00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,930
language in multiple regions so they

00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,160
wanted this in English as I say English

00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:15,300
North America different from English

00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:19,350
shamea different from English

00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:21,150
asia-pacific and so on so just a this

00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:22,590
doesn't come out of the box so there was

00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:25,950
a little bit of just custom

00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:28,920
configuration and a tiny bit of a glue

00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:31,410
module just to put it together so how we

00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,990
approached it was as you saw earlier we

00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:37,080
added multiple languages in the en-us

00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:39,270
Eng beer and so on to get all of our

00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:43,290
different languages then we had a

00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:45,810
taxonomy region or for the region so we

00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:49,070
had four taxonomy terms been Mia Latin

00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:51,750
America North America and Asia Pacific

00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:54,060
for each one we configured the allowed

00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,600
languages or the enabled languages for

00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:58,050
that region

00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:01,100
and the countries in each region we use

00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:04,980
the IP language notation

00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:07,200
whatever module to reported that to

00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:10,530
Triple Eight and so that would detect

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:13,230
your IP address with the IP to country

00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:15,540
module actually that would map so the IP

00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:18,030
to country matches your IP address

00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:20,750
against the country database and then

00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:23,040
the IP language in negotiation module

00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:25,740
determines which country that is and

00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:28,770
then returns the correct language and

00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:31,470
then we also had to have menus different

00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:34,560
menus per region and then we also had

00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:36,660
yeah we had a smaller module that added

00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:38,250
a block to make the taxonomy reach into

00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,650
him into a drop-down that when you

00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:44,130
changed it would automatically submit

00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:48,840
and change the users language so this is

00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:50,490
the taxonomy term this okay have no mess

00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,990
so the first language drop down is

00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:55,980
actually the language of the vocabulary

00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:58,230
so you can translate Europe or North

00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:01,920
America into whatever language if you so

00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:03,660
wished and then the second language

00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,370
drop-down is actually the default

00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:06,690
language for the region so if they can't

00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,250
figure it out but it knows you're coming

00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:10,020
from Europe then you're going to get

00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:12,930
this language

00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:16,320
then we use there's a language field

00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:19,830
module which gave us you know and I sort

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,810
of a you know multi-value field where we

00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:23,460
can select and enable the different

00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:25,200
languages for the region and then

00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:27,720
there's a country module which there was

00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,150
a very very very long list of checkboxes

00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:37,260
for countries and you just have to go in

00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:39,860
one by one and so we combined that then

00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:42,300
with just a glue module to strip out the

00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:44,100
you saw in our languages and you can see

00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,500
there actually it's English shamea and

00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,760
English North America and stuff when

00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,380
you're sewing showing that to the try

00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,090
enter to the user on their sites you

00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:54,000
don't want to show them the region in

00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:54,990
the language name so the region was

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,940
there in the language name for the

00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:01,830
editors but for the user we just cut it

00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:04,260
out and we has two drop downs at the top

00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:07,170
of the page one for region actually can

00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:14,030
they briefly though they're just make it

00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:14,030
easier where's my mouse oh there it is

00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:25,740
so you have your region drop-down and

00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:27,090
language drop-down that's enabled so

00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:34,710
North America just as the addition

00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:38,160
Spanish and if I go to your then it

00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:39,660
reloads the page and there's only three

00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,809
enables here I'm not quite sure what

00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:46,200
happened oh I'm in that in America

00:29:41,809 --> 00:29:50,940
so whoever said with that so that's what

00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:52,260
was one it's for for desktop this is how

00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,660
it works so when you choose your region

00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:57,419
they will submit the form printer at the

00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:59,549
new language and return you know the

00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:01,740
site and the the localized local

00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:04,110
language and then update the language

00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:06,030
drop-down but it will also then if

00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:08,880
you're on mobile that isn't necessarily

00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:10,650
a great user experience to take thing

00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,169
and wanting to go to change the other

00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:15,179
drop-down so we have a different

00:30:13,169 --> 00:30:26,910
workflow for this with a an actual

00:30:15,179 --> 00:30:31,380
submit button so some useful information

00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:34,190
and this is really where they're

00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:38,940
touching all the pain points that we had

00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:40,500
so interpolate the new default cash in

00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,030
somebody can correct me if I'm wrong but

00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:45,960
it's fast shaming

00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:48,330
I think but basically your configuration

00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,880
all your configuration which is your

00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:51,870
account the configuration structure of

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,280
your content types and your

00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:55,559
configuration strings and how you can

00:30:53,280 --> 00:31:00,540
configure it this and that all of that

00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:01,799
is storage in it stashed to make the

00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:03,179
site faster when you're loading it so

00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:07,350
it's not hitting the file system where

00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:08,970
the database every time the default a PC

00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:13,320
use limits on the hosting company that

00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:15,570
we were using which is well well-known

00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:19,290
 hosting company was set quite

00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:20,610
low and the reason that was fine if he

00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:23,640
just had one language but the thing is

00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:25,470
when you have a multilingual site saved

00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:28,140
to your translation from English and

00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:29,710
German say you now have doubled the

00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:31,870
amount and figuration

00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:33,700
if you then add on French you've got

00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:35,740
three times semantic configuration you

00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,990
add in 1390 whooshes you got a hell of a

00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:41,620
lot of configuration the storage in

00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:43,450
cache and we hit the limits and the site

00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:45,610
was getting slower and slower and slower

00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:47,740
until eventually it just crapped out and

00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:48,940
start giving us errors but at least once

00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:53,410
we had errors we kind of knew what was

00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:56,200
wrong so we switch to a memcache

00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:58,300
back-end which unfortunately doesn't

00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,820
support PHP seven so I think we've

00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:05,620
switched back to a database so we can

00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:08,800
use page b7 then as I mentioned earlier

00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:10,330
paragraphs get you get it out figure it

00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,460
out right first whether you're using

00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,960
translation or a totalization because if

00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:16,140
you get it wrong and you have to switch

00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,130
later on you're going to lose your

00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,600
translations there's still be in the

00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:21,850
database but the users won't see them

00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,890
and it's it takes a lot of messing

00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:27,070
around in the database and in the code

00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:28,990
to try and rebuild the links afterwards

00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:31,420
so have the conversation with your

00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:33,010
clients and ask them particularly about

00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:35,200
well what if the translation is not

00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:36,400
available in that language on the

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,320
landing page and those sort of things

00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:40,180
where you might use paragraphs more but

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:44,230
that is really where it's going to

00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:47,200
matter doodle translate so we had we had

00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:48,490
a we had the time to entering all the

00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,010
translations we weren't going to do that

00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:53,440
for the hundreds of pages that they had

00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:55,000
and they're 13 languages and a lot of it

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,560
was copy and paste because for launch

00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,750
English North America was actually the

00:32:56,560 --> 00:33:05,230
same as English Europe but oh and I

00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:09,730
missed on this point earlier when you

00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:14,200
configure your language negotiation can

00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:16,440
I go back to it it's right back to the

00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,440
start

00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,060
this one at the bottom there's content

00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:28,330
language detection and the topless

00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:29,890
interface text language detection and by

00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:32,470
default the first one was only checked

00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:34,270
but you can check that by checkbox at

00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:37,450
the bottom which allows you to have a

00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:38,860
different language for your content and

00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:41,380
the different language for what you see

00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:45,610
is an editor however it doesn't work for

00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:46,810
us and there is a patch which stopped

00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:50,320
working for us they worked for a while

00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:52,030
but then it broke media somehow so we're

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,120
not using it and we weren't using it at

00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:58,150
the time because the patch wasn't ready

00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:01,420
but so that meant that our editors had

00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:03,580
to step on it in our editors were

00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:09,100
entering Russian with the forum being in

00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:12,460
Russian and so on so one of them decided

00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:13,720
that has just turned on due to translate

00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:16,540
and that will get around the problem for

00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:20,350
me what happened and what really

00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:23,560
surprised me was to translate decided to

00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:25,510
translate the content in the fields not

00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:27,730
all of them just some of them depending

00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:29,350
on how fast it loaded or agility but it

00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:32,410
would actually translate the content in

00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:34,000
the fields itself and so they would

00:34:32,410 --> 00:34:36,040
wrote to us because we had this issue

00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,680
with paragraphs we had to switch from

00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:40,300
translation to localization we not stole

00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,490
the English or we've lost a lot of

00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:44,680
translation is reverting to English so

00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:46,120
she did it for dual translation under

00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,220
the translate and there was like we're

00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:52,470
reverting to English again randomly but

00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:55,480
mainly only for Russian it turns out I

00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:57,760
couldn't figure it out so I did a screen

00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:00,400
share with her and I saw that she do to

00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,540
translate turned on if it's just Chrome

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,160
trying to be helpful

00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,560
would you like to translate this page

00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:07,650
and she clicked yes and that's what

00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:11,440
caused that issue

00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:16,210
caching redirects was also an issue so

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:18,280
if you so if you go to the naked domain

00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,630
without the slash again and this is how

00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,700
we've set it up that you need to go to

00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:24,460
slash en for the default language as

00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:27,290
well like it doesn't just return the

00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:30,020
default language for that

00:35:27,290 --> 00:35:32,150
it it needs to do it detects what

00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,740
language doing the language negotiation

00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:34,850
and then it should redirect you to the

00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,670
correct payment at the user actually

00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:44,150
ever seen it but what was happening was

00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:46,520
that the redirect was being cashed so I

00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:48,140
would come along in English North

00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,460
America I would write redirect it so

00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:51,350
that language and then somebody else

00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:53,900
would coming on from France and they

00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:56,030
would seen - North America because the

00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,520
redirect from the homepage to the other

00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:01,730
language was hashed now we got around as

00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:05,210
I think by installing a patch and parse

00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:06,590
the patch was also to change the type of

00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,570
redirect so there is a version of the

00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:12,140
patch and it was still not fully working

00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:15,050
right so we patched it again to change

00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:17,270
it from a permanent redirect to a

00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:22,460
temporary redirect and the reason for

00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:25,070
that was varnish was caching or storing

00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:27,470
the tournament redirects for 15 minutes

00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:29,480
even though the Drupal configuration was

00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:32,690
said don't cache these sorts of

00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:34,190
redirects at all the varnish setup on

00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:36,080
the server for the hosting company was

00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:38,930
ignoring the Drupal settings what Drupal

00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:40,280
was saying and was actually caching it

00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:41,690
for 15 minutes and there was no way we

00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,250
could change this the hosting company

00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:46,880
couldn't do that for us because it would

00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:47,960
affect more than just us so be afraid

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,910
about actually we should be using a

00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:52,640
temporary director anyway not permanent

00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:54,740
one you have the thing to watch out for

00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:59,660
if building a multilingual site is your

00:36:54,740 --> 00:37:01,220
SEO so they're my favorite XML sitemap

00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:04,190
module for Drupal 7

00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:05,810
it doesn't actually support multilingual

00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:07,760
at least not since you put 8 there's

00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:10,940
another one called simple sitemap so

00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,680
there are language orders certain ties

00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,970
that you need to have in your XML

00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:18,170
sitemap to say well there's an

00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:20,060
alternative language for this site and

00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:21,740
here are the other versions of it in

00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:24,200
other languages similarly you should

00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:26,570
have a link tag at the top of your HTML

00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:29,090
in the head with the hate ref

00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:31,250
line and there's a module for that as

00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:32,690
well which I'll give drink to later so

00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:34,970
it just says here are the alternative

00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:36,740
language versions and particularly when

00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:39,020
you're doing localized content in

00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:39,390
regions or it is kind of the same as

00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:42,060
hell

00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:44,250
minimize the duplicate content SEO

00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:46,860
penalty that you might otherwise get and

00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:48,810
then design watch out for design if

00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:54,120
you're doing multiple language languages

00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:56,250
so the most obvious cases are say you

00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:59,340
have English German and Russian or no

00:37:56,250 --> 00:38:00,810
into German and Chinese so you design

00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,640
your site the designer is looking in

00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:04,980
English everything's beautiful you put

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:08,460
in German text suddenly your boxes have

00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:11,010
words that are this long and it's

00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,360
overflowing and you need to account at

00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:14,940
the design stage how you're doing to

00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:17,130
handle really long words that you how do

00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:18,750
you - laters how do you figure where to

00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:21,690
put that correct - if you're doing this

00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:24,180
or yeah so and then Chinese is the

00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:25,950
opposites the long words become really

00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,930
short and those are only three

00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:30,090
characters or four characters long so

00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:33,810
your design just has to be flexible

00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:35,910
enough to handle all of that so here are

00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:39,660
some of the modules you might want to

00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:41,100
consider so the HF line just adds in the

00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:43,920
links at the top of the page is very

00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:46,110
simple simple XML sitemap supports the

00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,150
the language stuff and that's pretty

00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:50,040
well we used the language switcher

00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:52,650
drop-down because with 13 languages or

00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:55,800
even when you toss it down to the - just

00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:58,170
your region there's five or six I think

00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,670
it's the most in one you don't want the

00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:02,430
links which is the standard out of the

00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:03,960
box which Drupal core if you're doing

00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:07,170
localization then you need the IP

00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:08,790
language negotiation stuff probably we

00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,740
have patched something listed in the

00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:12,360
next page and then there's a really nice

00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:18,120
module called translation management

00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:20,880
tool and so if you're we're not using it

00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:22,800
but if well we are using module we're

00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,840
not using it for its main purpose I

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,080
think which is to allow you to hook up

00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:30,270
with external translation companies who

00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:33,330
provides integration and you can submit

00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:35,340
content to be translated to them they

00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:37,190
translators and then they submit it back

00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:39,120
and I don't mean an automatic

00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:41,190
translation that go to translate though

00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,810
I think you can do that but actually you

00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:44,110
know manual translators would use their

00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:46,120
own system and then

00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:49,330
it's and it would end up in a draft or

00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:50,740
ready for review on your site but the

00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:53,850
reason even though we're not using that

00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:57,330
feature the reason that we install it is

00:39:53,850 --> 00:40:00,400
and when you do install this you get to

00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:02,020
you know a translation drop-down and

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,090
your jobs are the things you can send to

00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:10,120
external translators you also get this

00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:13,510
nice sources page so here you have your

00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:15,940
list of nodes or yeah well I'm its

00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:19,840
content so nodes in this case and the

00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:21,820
list of languages now probably you start

00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:24,310
to the next page because this is just a

00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:26,410
deficit so you get a little green tick

00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:28,390
box if it's been translated into the

00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:30,880
last language and you get an X if it

00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:33,160
hasn't and there is little legends at

00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,350
the bottom like there's needs review and

00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:37,390
in progress and other stuff but and

00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:39,190
that's if the translation is outdated so

00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:41,830
if the source has been edited and

00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:43,570
modified you can configure it to market

00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:46,840
all the other translations that's

00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:47,770
needing updating so it's just it's just

00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,150
nice when you're dealing with this

00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:52,770
number of languages in this number of

00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:52,770
pages it's a very useful report

00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:03,890
so the patches that we used so the first

00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:05,780
one was to fix the content versus

00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:07,070
interface languished negotiation we

00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:10,099
couldn't quite get it worked for a while

00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:11,900
and then some update happens and well it

00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:13,760
just it worked but it didn't work with

00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:16,130
the media or image uploads stopped

00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,609
working or something I can't quite

00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:23,060
remember and then the second one is for

00:41:18,609 --> 00:41:26,420
the preventing it to cached redirect to

00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:29,080
the correct language there is the patch

00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:31,250
which is still in the needs work

00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:33,800
same for paragraphs to support

00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:36,260
neutralization it has worked Lee for us

00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:39,800
for six months now it is missing tests

00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:43,040
if you want to contribute on code sprint

00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:44,630
day that's a good use of your time and

00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:47,810
then we also had issues with the entity

00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:50,780
browser which we added on later on it

00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:52,190
couldn't pick up the like the media it

00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:53,900
was very referencing in the correct in

00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:55,070
the correct language so the alt text was

00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,390
in the English even though it should

00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:59,270
have been in French well there's a

00:41:56,390 --> 00:42:03,560
pattern that works perfectly there's

00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:04,790
great documentation that link and all

00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,859
the slides will be going up on the line

00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:10,490
afterwards so you don't have to throw

00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:12,260
these down and yep I'm just going to

00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:14,180
wrap up but basically there is a code

00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:16,520
sprint mono not just close friend

00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:17,690
contribute contribution sprint so you

00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,849
don't have to be towed or you can be

00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:22,010
designer or write documentation or just

00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:22,849
help manage people and get them working

00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:25,910
on something together

00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:32,380
so please do coming on Friday and please

00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:32,380
write this session questions

00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,469
now for the questions if you could use

00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:45,880
the microphone in the middle of the room

00:42:43,469 --> 00:42:47,559
when you were transom when you were

00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:51,130
translating the view you were in the

00:42:47,559 --> 00:42:52,359
views UI yeah as long as the view the

00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:54,400
the strings have been triggered

00:42:52,359 --> 00:42:56,229
somewhere you can get to them as well

00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,869
through the translation UI where you

00:42:56,229 --> 00:43:01,140
just fill in the word and you get the

00:42:58,869 --> 00:43:03,670
list of all occurrences of the word and

00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:06,039
that that allows you to not have to

00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:09,809
navigate and click open everything does

00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:11,950
that work for the menu items - should

00:43:09,809 --> 00:43:15,130
everything that's translatable that's

00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:17,319
that's actually handled us using using

00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:20,589
string translation ok this we're also

00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:24,099
translating the link so the the path bit

00:43:20,589 --> 00:43:28,209
would also enjoy would also translate ok

00:43:24,099 --> 00:43:29,559
let's do another so have a question

00:43:28,209 --> 00:43:31,839
about all the paragraphs you could

00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:33,729
extend for your absorptions did use some

00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:35,319
tools to extend it all in all or we

00:43:33,729 --> 00:43:38,920
really clicked everything to open the

00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:42,249
paragraphs extent them I'm not quite

00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:44,170
sure I understand the question so yeah

00:43:42,249 --> 00:43:46,059
like the the menus to extent them it'll

00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:50,799
click it in your extended menu yeah and

00:43:46,059 --> 00:43:53,140
when you take a paragraph yes some tool

00:43:50,799 --> 00:43:56,140
to extend it automatically everything no

00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:57,940
it's just as edge of the box so you just

00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:02,519
take down the paragraph and then things

00:43:57,940 --> 00:44:02,519
appear it's quite some job

00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:10,559
hello thanks for the presentation I had

00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:12,029
two questions regarding this translation

00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:14,940
mechanism the first one is for the

00:44:12,029 --> 00:44:17,490
translation of files because in Drupal 7

00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:19,319
you couldn't really translate file

00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:21,480
entities you could translate the title

00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:22,859
and different audible other fields that

00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,200
were attached to the file but you

00:44:22,859 --> 00:44:27,930
couldn't say that my PDF a what the

00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,880
translation of PDF be and is this now

00:44:27,930 --> 00:44:33,240
address or going to be addressed

00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:34,319
somewhere in this Drupal 8 truck I'm not

00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:36,510
quite sure

00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,369
like we didn't deal with PDFs in this

00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:42,630
site it was images and they didn't have

00:44:38,369 --> 00:44:45,569
text in the images so like files are and

00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:47,490
seasoned in Drupal 8 so it should work

00:44:45,569 --> 00:44:50,309
and you should be able to translate the

00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:52,289
image like immature file you should be

00:44:50,309 --> 00:44:54,839
able to say that for this translation

00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:57,420
you can upload a different thing to

00:44:54,839 --> 00:45:01,529
replace it so I think it should work but

00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:05,039
don't help me to that I've tried and

00:45:01,529 --> 00:45:07,230
then my second question is okay we have

00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:10,529
fillable entities which are translatable

00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:13,319
by field and what about the trend the

00:45:10,529 --> 00:45:15,750
publication workflow is now possible to

00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:17,789
to trying to have a publication workflow

00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:20,750
per language or is it always for the

00:45:17,789 --> 00:45:23,009
entire node we didn't do it this size

00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:24,990
but we have done another one since in

00:45:23,009 --> 00:45:27,059
the simpler site and it was you were

00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:30,420
able to to lock it down I think we were

00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:32,970
using the workflow module rather than

00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:34,710
workbench but I can find out for you if

00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:36,920
you want I wasn't involved in that one

00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:39,690
but it was possible for them to have

00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:41,490
just to have a certain language was in

00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:42,869
draft while the other ones were

00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:45,210
published yeah

00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:47,609
and not to revert all languages at once

00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:49,710
for example yeah I don't think you had

00:45:47,609 --> 00:45:52,490
to do that but I can check that for you

00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:52,490
okay

00:45:54,770 --> 00:46:00,950
how do you handle and manage the

00:45:57,930 --> 00:46:05,060
interface translations do you are using

00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:06,300
products to export languages and create

00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:09,060
profiles

00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:11,310
so when you say which translation so

00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:14,070
you're talking about the the system

00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:15,660
strings or system strings the system

00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:20,040
strings are not configuration they're

00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:22,350
stored in the database you can export

00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:24,750
them as a doppio file and upload them to

00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:32,520
localize that drupal.org if you want to

00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:37,320
contribute them back but yeah with

00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:39,570
products the p OT yet sir

00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:41,160
yeah so that you can download those from

00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:43,770
localizer troopers are it but we're not

00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:45,870
storing them does we we don't want to

00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:48,840
store them I might be we are maybe

00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:50,640
they're in debt but they're not we don't

00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,260
keep them up-to-date because once you've

00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,390
got their the P strings that we want to

00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:56,040
translate it we don't really go back we

00:46:54,390 --> 00:47:00,150
contribute back if we can if they're

00:46:56,040 --> 00:47:04,650
Furcal trip which is it modular core but

00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:13,860
we don't maintain the pl files does that

00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:22,680
answer your question yeah after you

00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:25,050
generate all the language yeah so the

00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,660
simple XML sitemap person feels like my

00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:29,910
personal it doesn't do the auto submit

00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:33,300
so XML sitemap is nice and that you

00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:35,430
could resubmit your content every day I

00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:37,380
don't think it does that but so you can

00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:40,050
manually log in to do to Webmaster Tools

00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:42,150
or Bing tools and give them the URL and

00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:43,950
they'll crawl it every so often and you

00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:46,020
just have to do it once because it links

00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:48,570
to the other ones so you don't have to

00:47:46,020 --> 00:47:51,940
do it for every language and does it in

00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:58,510
terms of localization if you submit into

00:47:51,940 --> 00:48:00,010
go what master it doesn't hurt I think

00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:02,650
it helps because it knows that there's

00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,970
more versions of the same page in

00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:07,960
different languages and there's more

00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:10,360
things to crawl this I'm not quite sure

00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,880
what way XML sitemap does it which is it

00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:18,880
there is a risk of Jupiter content

00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:25,960
penalty yeah I'm I think it helps like

00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:29,710
it's not going to hurt so thanks for the

00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:34,050
presentation maybe you don't use the web

00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:36,430
for module but that has a very handy

00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:39,840
interface for translation where you can

00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:44,370
translate in the graphic user interface

00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:47,230
translate of the strings in Yama code

00:48:44,370 --> 00:48:50,860
but have you come across similar

00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:52,510
interface for other translation nope and

00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:56,080
I have seen that one for a web forum but

00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:58,230
no I haven't seen it anything else thank

00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,230
you

00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:09,570
how do you translate the u-pass how do I

00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:12,120
translate sorry what you view Pat's so

00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:14,130
in that views configuration or

00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:17,030
translation if you take far enough in

00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:19,950
and you find where you set the paths oh

00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:22,470
okay you're right the other thing you

00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:24,690
can do is set up an alias so you can set

00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:28,830
up an alias for your language and just

00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:31,080
say slash news is slash nuked in Irish

00:49:28,830 --> 00:49:35,180
and you just say for Irish version

00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:42,810
redirect to this URL or set up an alias

00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:51,000
it works okay there's no other questions

00:49:42,810 --> 00:49:52,770
we'll leave it there thank you oh if you

00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,960
