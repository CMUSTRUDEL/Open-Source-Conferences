Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	This will be an update on the status and progress of the Layout Initiative. 

In this session we'll cover the new proposed concept of Layout Sections, as well as the Layout Builder, and how this affects existing solutions like Field Layout, Panels, Display Suite, Bricks, Paragraphs, and others.

	00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,740
seems pretty full so I'm gonna get

00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,890
started hi I'm Tim Plunkett and I'm here

00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,660
to talk about the layout initiative

00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:11,580
there are four people officially on the

00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,099
layout team I'm the only one that could

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,109
attend this triple con but I wanted to

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,740
give a credit to the others have been

00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:22,050
working on this the team sort of grew

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,920
out of the people who worked on

00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,660
panelizer and panels and CTools so while

00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,390
we've worked very closely with other

00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:33,180
people like the display suite team and

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,270
obviously the UX team this is where

00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,940
where we came from so you might see

00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:41,460
things in core feeling similar to

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:44,190
panelizer and that's for a reason now

00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,110
we're a little biased so just a quick

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,770
recap of what the layout initiative has

00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:52,350
accomplished so far we have a layout API

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,670
now in Drupal 8 there's a layout

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,430
discovery module that you can enable

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,350
that gives you some basic layouts and

00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:01,590
they're just the ability to provide your

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,870
your own new layouts and the all three

00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,580
display suite panelizer and panels and

00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,700
also a new core module called field

00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,049
layout all use the same layout API so if

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,100
you write one layout that can be used

00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:16,500
across all those modules single unified

00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:19,439
discovery mechanism field layout is a

00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,409
new experimental module that was added

00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,930
in 83 and it tries to attempts to bring

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,460
layouts to the field UI without making

00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,590
any other drastic changes to the field

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,030
UI without bringing any of the extra

00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,229
functionality that this play suite and

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,759
panel lines are bringing it Just's

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,979
instead of being able to dump your

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,200
fields into either content or disabled

00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:40,070
it allows you to choose a single layout

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:44,149
for that and arrange your content in it

00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:48,210
from within that UI as limited as it is

00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:50,340
once we're all done panelizer will just

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,130
no longer need to exist we're targeting

00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,680
all of its functionality to eventually

00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,170
be in core there's still some things in

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,880
display suite that could and should

00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:02,640
probably still exist and can be used

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,590
alongside that specifically the ability

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,910
to customize the exact output of

00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:10,370
individual fields choosing the mark-up

00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:14,090
specifying different prefixes and

00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:18,629
attributes within the selectors

00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:20,190
HTML classes themselves but but vom this

00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:22,530
mean the site builder perspective

00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:25,830
without worrying about the exact HTML

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:28,110
output eventually all of that will

00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:31,019
function I will be brought to core and

00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:34,140
we're targeting Drupal 8 5 for the like

00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:35,400
very first initial version no real plan

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,030
on what we're gonna finish the whole

00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,890
thing which brings us up to today

00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,019
so a force coming out there's nothing

00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:45,269
really that new in 8 4 other than that

00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,870
the API we introduced is now marked

00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:47,849
stable

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:51,420
it hasn't really seen any change since

00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:52,380
83 since the spring but when now we're

00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,540
working on anything called layout

00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,790
builder which all of you that were in

00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,160
the Driss note saw this morning and that

00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,319
was a real demo that really worked I

00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,560
grew out of a hackathon project that

00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,690
some of us worked at at a Acquia

00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,310
engineering on site but now it's like a

00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,959
real patch in the real issue queue with

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,510
real code that can really be used on a

00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:16,260
real site which is very exciting and you

00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,250
can instead of you know having to

00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,170
handcraft

00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,940
every individual layout that you would

00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:22,350
need if you need I need this you know

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,299
two columns and then three columns and a

00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:27,239
big footer at the bottom you used to

00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:30,269
have to write that in your HTML twig

00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:33,720
file and write custom CSS for it this

00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:36,209
has a new idea on how to compose new

00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,910
layouts directly from from the UI itself

00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,889
and the UI you saw this morning and I'll

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,810
show again is pretty rough right now but

00:03:40,889 --> 00:03:45,900
it's we're working very closely with the

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,519
usability team to to come up with

00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,019
something that really you know presents

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,829
all the complex concepts and they're

00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:53,880
really easy to use way the right now

00:03:52,829 --> 00:03:56,040
we're targeting landing page

00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,470
functionality since there already is you

00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,030
know panelizer and display suite and

00:03:57,470 --> 00:04:02,010
even rudimentary functionality and field

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,329
layout there's not really anything right

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,359
now that's really doing landing pages

00:04:03,329 --> 00:04:09,090
page manager sort of exists it's not

00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:12,000
really being pushed very hard for drupal

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:14,970
like the Jubilate version so that we

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,519
soft landing pages as the the most

00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:20,090
important thing to work on first and be

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,090
able to say this

00:04:20,109 --> 00:04:25,960
and it uses the API itself so everything

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:27,909
that you've built for your existing

00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:32,139
sites will immediately be usable from

00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:40,860
within the new layout builder live demo

00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:40,860
time I have to get my windows in place

00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:54,699
you can kind of see that so this is my

00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,219
cool landing page does how many contact

00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:59,860
but there is a layout tab here which

00:04:57,219 --> 00:05:02,379
allows you to then add new sections so

00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,940
if I click Add section you're presented

00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:05,770
with the different layouts they've been

00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,889
defined these will ones provided by core

00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:10,810
so I could say I want two columns I

00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:12,669
would like to add a block so I will add

00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:16,330
the most useful block which is powered

00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:18,189
by Drupal and I'd like to add an

00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,689
exclamation mark there we go so now we

00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:23,110
have it powered by Drupal block if I

00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:26,139
save it's on the page this UI is similar

00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:30,090
to views UI in a way in that if I were

00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:33,719
to go to this and like a incognito mode

00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:38,050
well okay

00:05:33,719 --> 00:05:40,870
didn't yeah whatever access denied

00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:42,610
whatever that's fine live demos yeah the

00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,080
idea is that the content the when you

00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,589
make changes here or I can see it from

00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,199
within even as if I were another user

00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:54,370
viewing the actual output if I go and

00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:59,440
actually edit this title from the

00:05:54,370 --> 00:06:02,110
front-end and update it it shows here

00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,740
but viewing the actual node

00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:11,030
wow that's broken let's file a bug

00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:14,210
I'm gonna write that down broken time

00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:16,190
story that's true but we're supposed to

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:18,380
protect you from both and we didn't so

00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:20,570
I'm writing it down for later thank you

00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:25,700
all for helping me find a bug in Tripoli

00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:28,220
yeah well pointed out though that it is

00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:30,260
all probably only we're only protecting

00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:34,760
you from from having the regions be

00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:36,800
different so if I save this layout it

00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,380
looks like that if I edit it in one tab

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:42,010
and put them both in the same region by

00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:44,480
the way drag and drop yay

00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:48,770
really hope this works nope

00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:51,860
also still a bug I know so if I

00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:53,240
shouldn't take effect until I save that

00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,760
would be the ideal thing so that someone

00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,050
could be composing the perfect UI but it

00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,700
not actually taking effect for the end

00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,960
user and still save and this worked a

00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:03,220
couple weeks ago so I wonder why our

00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:07,400
tests aren't failing always fun in core

00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:11,660
anyway so I previously made a more

00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,950
complicated layout so I decided that you

00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,750
know there's a new movie coming out soon

00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:17,720
it's called Thor Ragnarok and I'm a big

00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:20,330
Thor fan and I like I really liked all

00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,860
the posters they they tweeted out that

00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:23,540
showed all the different characters I

00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,310
thought they'd be really nicely arranged

00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,020
and a certain thing but if you just try

00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,850
to dump all these images into into

00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:31,070
Drupal it just lists them sequentially

00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:35,960
but using the layout builder it could

00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:38,000
look something like this and if you

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:41,180
actually go and edit it we could then

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,160
say well you know I mean Loki is way

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:45,770
cooler than Thor so let's move him over

00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,570
here and have him over here and now

00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,070
there's only eight people instead of

00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:52,610
nine so instead of having this awkward

00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:54,590
you know 3x3 grid we can know that we

00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:58,160
need to have three columns here to

00:07:54,590 --> 00:08:02,090
column here and three column here and if

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:04,039
I save this is also responsive or it was

00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:06,770
yesterday

00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:10,159
whoo so you know you got a little

00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:12,830
squishing action and then once you get

00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:26,599
too small it jumps to one column which

00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:29,059
is really nice okay all right future so

00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:33,500
that's that's what works today works air

00:08:29,059 --> 00:08:35,930
quotes so the other said the adea's to

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:37,399
first introduce it as a layouting tool

00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:39,860
so that I just showed you with a single

00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:41,469
note so every node that you use this on

00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:43,909
you could make have a different layout

00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:45,139
as I mentioned earlier field you or

00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:47,600
field layouts module tries to improve

00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:49,579
the field UI so the eventual goal would

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,040
be to present a similar UI to control

00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:54,730
say oh I want all article nodes to look

00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,230
and have this layout except for node 5

00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,360
or like all press release notes to have

00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,829
this other type of layout and it's not

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,360
even node specific it works you can lay

00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:05,329
out your comments with this which gets

00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,560
really wild you can any any any type and

00:09:05,329 --> 00:09:11,089
it would be very useful for things like

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,740
media to say oh I want the the captions

00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:14,449
show over here underneath or like

00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:18,769
underneath the video at this this view

00:09:14,449 --> 00:09:20,329
vote viewport width so the idea is to

00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:22,720
bring this whole idea of the section

00:09:20,329 --> 00:09:25,760
base where you can add in many sections

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:30,110
to all of Drupal and and we really think

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:33,139
that for the 90% use case that being

00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:36,050
able to switch between sort of more

00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:38,360
building block style layouts is very

00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:41,209
powerful instead of having to write out

00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:45,139
a very complex layout from scratch a by

00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:46,819
hand in twig so the next things we need

00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:48,230
to do is come up with a good name for

00:09:46,819 --> 00:09:49,490
this because they're called sections

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,260
it's called layout builder it's called

00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:53,839
field layout we need to sort of unify it

00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:56,120
they all came out of different spheres

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,750
so we need to find a good way to explain

00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,000
this to pool

00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:02,209
we're gonna write a migration path from

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,740
panelizer we have that because the the

00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:05,209
maintainer zip analyzer are working on

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,690
this I want to stop maintaining

00:10:05,209 --> 00:10:07,250
panelizer

00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,930
only a good way to stop maintain a

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,660
module is to migrate everyone away from

00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:13,579
it and market obsolete also in

00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,420
discussion would be a migration path

00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:17,190
from page manager and from

00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,580
displace me for the portions of this

00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:23,310
place we that could be migrated and

00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:25,020
that's all I have to say about that are

00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:28,710
there any questions you might see more

00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:32,870
broken demos please use the microphone

00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:36,240
[Applause]

00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:38,070
the demos we have seen kind of use the

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,490
block system so you need to have block

00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:44,010
with your content yes on Drupal 7 on

00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:47,250
some kind of landing page we have used

00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:49,230
paragraphs could you see a future for

00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:52,770
that in Drupal 8 with paragraphs and

00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:56,060
using layouts for kind of styling the

00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:58,410
different bundles yes so I know a

00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,000
tentative session about paragraphs and

00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,530
they're saying oh well to do layouts you

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,630
need to create sub paragraphs paragraphs

00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,880
within paragraphs and and you end up

00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,380
taking what is a really good tool a

00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,090
great data model and then completely

00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:11,670
corrupting it just to get layouts onto a

00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:14,210
page so yeah as you as you mentioned it

00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:17,430
is completely block based there is a

00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:19,980
plug-in within C tools that allows you

00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:21,060
to reference individual fields and it's

00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:23,460
basically what everyone's used to in

00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,780
triple7 where you can chop up and say I

00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:27,330
want the body field over here the title

00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:30,210
field over here so the idea would be to

00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:32,610
present each of your fields from within

00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:35,130
this UI and let you move them around and

00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:39,080
it would completely replace I'm just go

00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:42,630
to the admin side so like the this page

00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:44,460
where you're used to like the this where

00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,470
you have just one column even if you had

00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,060
different regions here and still just

00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,410
presented linearly the idea would be

00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,340
replaced this was more of a graphical

00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:55,740
layout builder style thing and even to

00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:58,230
in specific overrides target individual

00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,850
field deltas so you know the third value

00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:01,020
of that field which is where we would

00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,490
really need for paragraphs to be

00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,710
powerful

00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:06,840
there's we're not blocked on the

00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:09,810
technical side were blocked on the UX

00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:12,780
side because presenting that is very

00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:14,580
complex so the that is a goal and I mean

00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:16,440
the work on presenting just saying oh I

00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,450
want my body field over here in title

00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,850
field over here that's already in

00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:24,000
progress but getting down to the the

00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:25,980
individual field level like field Delta

00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,470
level which would be need for paragraphs

00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:30,660
is forthcoming and I hope that if the

00:12:28,470 --> 00:12:33,590
paragraphs people are here or listening

00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:42,180
will want to help because I need help

00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:46,260
yeah anyway other questions it's about

00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:50,460
transmission yes translation how does it

00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:51,870
work so we actually it works great it

00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,340
actually works

00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:57,900
I don't have a multilingual site set up

00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:59,220
write them away uh yeah no I also only

00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:02,520
speak one language to be really hard

00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:04,980
from your demo yeah so the there are two

00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:06,060
mechanisms for translation and they ran

00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,790
it by the usability team and they said

00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,020
providing two is is bad because if you

00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:12,270
have choice people get confused and

00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:17,430
people do weird things so the idea would

00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:19,050
be that the initial decision was that

00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,630
you can just use since they're all

00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:24,350
blocks you could use block context and

00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:26,220
the language context to then use that to

00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:27,750
individually say oh this block only

00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:30,120
shows up for these languages that's the

00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:31,740
easy way and that works fine the other

00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,410
thing is that because of the way we

00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:37,380
built this it is using field the field

00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:39,570
system so the actual definition of the

00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:42,570
layout and what it contains is a field

00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:44,970
which is translatable so you could so

00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:47,100
the use case for that was like a

00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,590
newspaper where they don't want to just

00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:51,390
change what how the block is shown or

00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,800
what you know how its laid out based on

00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,410
a single language they want to present

00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:57,720
an entirely new UI for a different

00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:00,330
language so you could completely

00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:02,390
translate the entire layout and present

00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:05,340
different content in different columns

00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:06,780
different regions based on language now

00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:09,960
that wouldn't necessarily be turned on

00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:12,030
or labeled by default but it would be

00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:16,080
completely accessible to someone to do

00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:18,420
that so and we you know as I said we we

00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,670
just used the field system so we also

00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,590
will in theory get revision ability and

00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:25,980
all the content moderation so you should

00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:27,810
be able to stage layout changes and so

00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,790
for example also with the newspaper

00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:32,150
where if a story is getting more

00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:35,550
important over time you can adjust its

00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:36,510
its prominence on the page and you can

00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:39,980
have that go through an editorial

00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:39,980
workflow which is very powerful

00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:51,019
other questions yes please if you could

00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:54,050
come to the mic somewhere to build a

00:14:51,019 --> 00:14:57,290
simple side today should I use coal

00:14:54,050 --> 00:15:00,559
blocks should I use pen Eliza should I

00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:04,129
use field layout or should I use layout

00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:06,589
builder nah nope nope nope don'ts in

00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:08,420
them so that's a great question so do

00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:09,889
not use field layout because it is an

00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,480
experimental module

00:15:09,889 --> 00:15:13,549
do not use layout builder because it's

00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,569
an experimental patch and it doesn't

00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:19,249
really work as you just saw but I would

00:15:17,569 --> 00:15:21,379
I would personally this is my suggestion

00:15:19,249 --> 00:15:23,420
I would say use panel answer only

00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:25,040
because we know that there's a plan to

00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:29,239
write a migration to whatever the future

00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,389
core thing is yeah i mean i would i

00:15:29,239 --> 00:15:34,100
would use panelizer

00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:35,989
page managers is important for other

00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:38,989
things but this is the close that's the

00:15:35,989 --> 00:15:42,100
closest analog I think other questions

00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:42,100
yes please

00:15:45,129 --> 00:15:53,269
how's this welcome to relate or

00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:55,069
integrate with CSS grids so it's the

00:15:53,269 --> 00:15:58,999
current layouts that were written in

00:15:55,069 --> 00:16:03,019
core are using flex which is new ish

00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:08,360
Newton eyes newest grids I mean that's

00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:10,339
really up to the layout otter I think I

00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,279
don't really know I I know I don't know

00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:15,949
how the tool itself could better

00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,149
integrate with that the template CSS and

00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:18,499
the templates themselves I feel like

00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:20,629
it's up to them the authors of the

00:16:18,499 --> 00:16:24,110
templates to make that decision and use

00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:25,519
grids over flex I mean even the CSS

00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:27,019
that's in core for this right now is

00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,610
pretty rudimentary it's basically just

00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:30,410
using flex instead of floats and it's

00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:33,529
still percentage based it's not even

00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,339
using the best way of doing things but

00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:38,149
yeah I would say that's up to the

00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:42,499
template author and the CSS for these

00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:44,119
templates is now like stable so but

00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:45,619
there could be new you could we could

00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:47,809
ship with newer versions and deprecated

00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:51,110
old templates and our old layouts excuse

00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:52,460
me so if someone has knowledge of grids

00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,690
and wants to help improve

00:16:52,460 --> 00:17:05,860
the layouts we have that would be great

00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:05,860
others yeah okay great

00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:14,360
- the other question about which module

00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:18,950
you should use or not in a few Ln a week

00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:22,970
or so shouldn't this be stable so now

00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:24,470
label this so this is we're aiming for

00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,130
eight five eight four comes out in a

00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,370
couple weeks

00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:30,950
yeah the API itself is stable okay so

00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:32,960
display suite and panelizer and panels

00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,780
all use the stable API that's going to

00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:38,420
be an officially stable a week this

00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:40,190
layout builder stuff isn't even in in

00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:43,130
core yet it's still in the issue queue

00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:45,710
just a yes so it's just the API is there

00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:48,710
so yeah I mean using you can define your

00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,300
layouts now using llamó and you know

00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,100
that's all that's all stable one's not

00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,930
gonna change

00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:57,350
hi thank you for all the work it's

00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:59,480
shaping up really great my question is

00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:03,910
like we are in rupal seven we are used

00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:08,150
to you know explore a getting a lot of

00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:12,020
features from panels like we have styles

00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:14,930
we have views argument we can pass I

00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:19,040
think that is still missing

00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:21,380
somehow yes there is Allah in in t7

00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,150
panels or t8 page manager that we

00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:25,820
haven't really tackled and I think the

00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:29,060
main reason was that people are now

00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:30,560
using paralyzer to fake landing pages

00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,960
you just make a landing page content

00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,520
type and you can get very far you can

00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,030
only get so far and there's a lot

00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:40,250
missing the stuff with views arguments

00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:43,220
I mean views blocks now I'll take

00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:45,620
arguments via context which is recently

00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:47,830
committed and since everything's all

00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:51,950
blocks that that's the presenting

00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:53,750
context d8 context in a in a reasonable

00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:57,200
way in the UI is still very challenging

00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:58,340
and hasn't really been done yet and the

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,340
other I mean the other thing is setting

00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:03,710
up this is all using saying for example

00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:06,080
notes or an energy content of you type

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:08,539
with page manager and panels in g7

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,519
it's it's more of a configure thing and

00:19:08,539 --> 00:19:12,250
you're defining a path and you define

00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:15,740
that path and you can place things on it

00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:17,179
and that will probably that will exist

00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,860
and it should eventually use this layout

00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:20,630
builder but the layup loader is like a

00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:22,940
single concept it's more than the way

00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:26,149
once you once all that is done how do

00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,710
you actually then implement it so that

00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:30,529
wouldn't necessarily be a function of

00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:33,409
the layout team you know page panels are

00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:35,059
still going to need to be around yeah I

00:19:33,409 --> 00:19:37,130
think access plugins are one more thing

00:19:35,059 --> 00:19:40,190
which are missing right now page

00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:43,010
managers and panels whole thing we can

00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:46,730
you kind of use context for that but

00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:53,360
then again this is how you can manage

00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:55,429
access on views you can't do that yeah I

00:19:53,360 --> 00:20:00,409
mean there's still there's issues in the

00:19:55,429 --> 00:20:02,870
keys for bringing t7 earth bringing the

00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:05,690
the power of what see tools and panels

00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:09,710
put in d7 into core even though views

00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:11,690
moved in the views content module was a

00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:17,029
separate module that was in see tools in

00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:18,139
d7 and it's sort of like the 60% of it

00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:21,049
or so I was in core but like the other

00:20:18,139 --> 00:20:23,539
40% has not even been written yet so

00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:26,870
that just takes more people to work on

00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:28,850
CTools see tools is stable as was

00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:30,289
announced the keynote but it's only the

00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:32,809
functionality that they bothered to

00:20:30,289 --> 00:20:35,779
write the rest of it is doesn't even

00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:38,389
exist so there's a lot of work to be

00:20:35,779 --> 00:20:40,880
done there still but as you said that's

00:20:38,389 --> 00:20:42,710
that's a very advanced use case but it

00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,880
worked so great in Drupal 7 we need it

00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:46,279
in triple 8 now because we're used to

00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,539
that power and that's the problem with

00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:49,340
writing really awesome code is you have

00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:54,350
to keep maintaining it forever or people

00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:55,130
complain I know the questions so there's

00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,779
one other thing I wanted to talk about

00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,889
which I didn't have slides for because I

00:20:56,779 --> 00:20:59,299
didn't think I was going to talk about

00:20:57,889 --> 00:21:01,880
until Drees mentioned it today in his

00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:04,700
keynote which was the concept of

00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:08,630
possibly using a modern JavaScript

00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,250
library to sort of decouple this layout

00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:14,270
builder concept from from Drupal itself

00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:16,730
and so we last week a co-worker of mine

00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:18,980
at Matt grill and I worked on a thing to

00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:21,950
rewrite this layout builder UI

00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:23,690
in rien pre-act this was during when

00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,890
everyone thought react was terrible no

00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,480
one's ever gonna be use it again and it

00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,680
was dead and then they fixed react and

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,990
now everything's fine

00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,890
I'm sorry to rewrite the demo but uh the

00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:37,460
idea would be to to present this layout

00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:39,650
builder UI using instead of this

00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:42,740
currently is built using a massive

00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:45,980
render array and Drupal Ajax commands

00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:47,600
and it's the most true policing ever and

00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,370
there's no reason for it to be it's a

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,660
brand new UI there's no there's no

00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:53,090
version of this from d7 that we're

00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:54,590
building off of it's completely new so

00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:57,230
there's no reason for us to build it in

00:21:54,590 --> 00:22:00,430
this old old way so we started to work

00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:03,650
on I'm working on rendering this via

00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:05,930
react and it worked really well right up

00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:08,660
until you click the add block button and

00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:12,020
then you pick a block and then you are

00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:14,570
presented with a form because there's no

00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,970
way to present and render and move that

00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:20,300
validate and submit Drupal forms from

00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:22,280
the client side so that's that's the

00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:24,260
thing that so then we decide to turn and

00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:25,700
ask the forum system maintainer to help

00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:32,380
work on that and then I remembered that

00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:35,000
that's me so so now I'm working on

00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:37,730
decoupling the form API from Drupal and

00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,190
rewriting it in JSON which has been

00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:44,120
really exciting it'll be done in about

00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:46,100
10 or 15 years yeah but either either

00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,990
then the there's a d7 module called

00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:52,370
restful panels they some people have may

00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:55,190
used and really it just dumps the the

00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:59,270
actual configuration at runtime in just

00:22:55,190 --> 00:23:00,680
a JSON representation and we already

00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:02,270
built that like we can do that now so

00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,100
we're going ideally we would put

00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:06,650
basically restful panels or restful

00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:08,180
layouts right into core so even while

00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:11,000
we're struggling with working on how to

00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:13,550
submit forms on the admin side we could

00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,520
it still be able to render the actual

00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:18,620
layouts for the end user via from the

00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:21,350
client side completely which is really

00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:23,270
cool so there might be some talks about

00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:24,710
that on Friday during the sprints if you

00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:28,360
come find me I will be wearing a red hat

00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:31,280
as I usually do and we could talk about

00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,060
doing some client-side jeaious versions

00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,200
and layouts

00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:39,020
should be very cool any questions

00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:46,369
alright great thank you very much

00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:46,369
