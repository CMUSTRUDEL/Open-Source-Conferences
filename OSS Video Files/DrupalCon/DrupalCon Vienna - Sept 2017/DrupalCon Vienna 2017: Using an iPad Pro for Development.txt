Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Using an iPad Pro for Development
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	Although my MacBook isn’t overly heavy, it still adds additional weight to my backpack and I pack enough other stuff the way it is. Ever since the 12.9” iPad was released, I was determined to make it work for everything I would need to do while I was traveling to help lighten the weight of my backpack. That meant having everything I needed to make a quick hotfix or code change to a website project.

After some timely research, and possibly wasted app purchases, I was able to accomplish almost everything I wanted to do on an iPad and travel without my MacBook. I will do a live demo of various developer tasks and apps that help you accomplish them.

Live Demo Tasks

Setting up a new project
Managing git repositories 
Make code changes in a robust editor
Commit code changes to version control
Push code changes to a remote server
And many other developer tasks

	00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,730
all right so we're gonna get started

00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:07,980
this morning I did the introduction to

00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:12,030
the juries note this is way less scary

00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:13,559
than that so super chill we're gonna

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,550
talk about using an iPad pro for

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:18,810
development I travel a lot with Pantheon

00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,630
I do a lot of community involvement

00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,130
speaking of conferences answering

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,660
developer questions just kind of being

00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,539
out there and then it includes a lot of

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,099
travel and MacBooks aren't overly heavy

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,109
but they're heavy enough where I got

00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,719
sick of carrying mine and decided like

00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:36,690
what are other options I got the new

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:39,360
iPad pro you can't it's up here hooked

00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,510
up it's gigantic it's like as big as my

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,010
macbook but much lighter so I'm really

00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,539
excited about the things that I found in

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,469
using it for development and wanted to

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:50,190
share so just a few things about me

00:00:48,469 --> 00:00:52,350
agency and community engineer at

00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,789
Pantheon so I just mentioned I get to do

00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,500
a lot of travel I get to talk to a lot

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,230
of awesome developers help them with

00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,870
WordPress and Drupal as well as on the

00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,640
Pantheon platform that also means that I

00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,100
am helping them outside of the community

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,830
as well you know inside of trainings and

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,689
whatever that might look like you can

00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,090
follow me on Twitter actually have

00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:14,010
buffer posting my slides like this very

00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,180
second I'm guessing so if you want the

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,430
slide deck you can grab that for my

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,150
Twitter account and then my website as

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:24,270
well so I'm just gonna talk through some

00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,310
some different points for me like the

00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:29,939
different perks or the reasons why I

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,590
decided to use an iPad pro I just

00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,659
mentioned size and weight like the

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,280
weight of it is like one and a half

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,189
pounds compared to the weight of my

00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,770
actual macbook cost

00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:43,049
I wouldn't say cost is it like definite

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:46,020
pro if you're using like a MacBook Air

00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,340
or the regular MacBook castas about the

00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:49,170
same because it I think it was about a

00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,060
thousand dollars so they're not a really

00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,899
cheap but they're not as expensive as a

00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:58,200
pro speed it's super quick so I'm able

00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,610
to use apps instead of web browsers so I

00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,469
can navigate between different apps

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,040
pretty quickly and it's a lot faster

00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:07,500
than using my macbook the gps piece of

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,009
its really cool so if I'm like working

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,929
on a website

00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,780
or if I'm doing something specific to

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:14,670
like navigation or locations

00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,379
and has all of that technology in it to

00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,980
be able to recognize exactly where I'm

00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:22,230
at makes life a little bit easier

00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:23,879
battery life is fantastic I've been

00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:26,939
sitting in this bigger room for probably

00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:29,099
the last like 45 minutes to an hour and

00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:30,420
I used like 1% of my battery and I was

00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,459
doing like a continuous integration

00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,769
build so I was doing some pretty

00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:38,159
strenuous things that my iPad was able

00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:40,680
to keep up the cellular data is probably

00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,719
the biggest win for me I can take it out

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,329
wherever I am whether I'm like riding in

00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:47,310
the car with someone or I'm sitting in

00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:49,769
traffic I'm on the train wherever it is

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:51,780
that I might be I can take my iPad out

00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:53,129
I have cellular data and I can do all

00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,400
the things I need to do without having

00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:57,870
to connect to Wi-Fi and then of course

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,269
like iPads are meant for media streaming

00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,400
for reading for listening to music

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:03,930
things like that and they're still also

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,909
super great at that and I have all of

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:10,139
that in the system that I like to use so

00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:12,090
I'm going to talk through like some of

00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:14,609
the apps that I've opted to do I've

00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,230
probably spent I'm not sure I actually

00:03:14,609 --> 00:03:19,409
want to admit to the amount of money

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:21,060
that I've spent in buying iPad apps to

00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:23,250
figure out exactly which ones I really

00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,569
liked and everyone obviously has their

00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:26,220
own opinion but I'll give you a couple

00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:28,129
of different options for the things that

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,150
I've been doing and my favorites and why

00:03:28,129 --> 00:03:34,650
and give you some more information about

00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:36,419
things you could dig into so currently

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,879
just like show of hands is anyone using

00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:41,879
an iPad or like doing anything for like

00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:46,530
development lots of you maybe you guys

00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:47,909
can tell me some things so there's a few

00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,239
different things obviously you need to

00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:54,329
do development on any machine text

00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:56,189
editor like IDE obviously some way of

00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:59,159
like committing to some type of like

00:03:56,189 --> 00:04:01,199
either version control or SFTP or

00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,720
whatever that might be

00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:07,530
so when it comes to text editors I

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,359
actually opted for text tastic so text

00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,340
tastic is one of them coda is another

00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:14,669
one some of you might know coda it's

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,709
also available on like actual Mac's it's

00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:18,840
pretty similar on an iPad I didn't

00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:20,440
necessarily like there was anything I

00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,680
didn't like about coda

00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,770
it is $25 versus $10 or US dollars for

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,530
Tech's tastic the only reason why I

00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:33,310
actually chose to use text a stick is

00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:36,610
because the app that I use for get like

00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,530
for git repository management integrates

00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,850
with text a stick so that was a major

00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:41,650
choice for me because I wanted the

00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:44,320
integration to be able to kind of go

00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,430
back and forth between the two and after

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,960
I go through these I'm actually gonna do

00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,070
some like live demos and you can see

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,210
check out the apps and all that good

00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:55,630
stuff so so working copy is the one that

00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:57,820
integrates with text tastic you can

00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,710
clone a repository from either github

00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,450
bitbucket or like any repository

00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,250
location so if you have it like out on

00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:05,140
the internet you just bring in the URL

00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:06,790
working copy you'll clone it in you can

00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,250
manage it push pull do everything you

00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,840
need to do right inside of that app and

00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,460
that actually integrates with text

00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:15,400
tastic and so that was my selling point

00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,900
for using that versus coda clone is

00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,390
another one clones actually pretty great

00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:22,420
the UI for it isn't as intuitive as

00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:24,100
working copy was and after a few minutes

00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:28,750
of like messing with it I was like nah

00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:30,490
it's not as good so command line I would

00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:32,410
say like the fallback and I do have like

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:34,480
an entire slide talking about reasons

00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:38,919
why you shouldn't use an iPad or why you

00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:41,440
can't but using command line if you want

00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:44,610
to SSH into a server be able to manage

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,560
things that way I personally like prompt

00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:50,169
prompt is actually built by panic which

00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,550
is the same company that made coda so

00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:53,740
kind of that whole stream line of

00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:55,410
products by that company prompt is

00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,030
really great it allows you to save

00:05:55,410 --> 00:06:00,880
server connections so I had like a VPS

00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:02,530
that has SSH access and I have all of

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,090
the credentials and the SSH commands

00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:05,860
just saved in there and I can pop it

00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,919
open and be able to log into my server

00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:11,680
whenever I want a blink is like really

00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:12,460
like somehow people love it on the

00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,350
Internet

00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:16,660
I didn't care for it it doesn't have any

00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:19,000
way to set any settings save any of your

00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:21,490
server configuration you basically open

00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,590
it it's like this black box of a command

00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,580
line so you can't save anything and have

00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:30,910
to remember everything you're going to

00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:32,870
type SFTP even though you know it's it's

00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:33,830
probably not used as often

00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,210
it's still something that you may have

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,120
to use maybe you need to get into a

00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:40,160
server maybe you need to download a file

00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,710
whatever that might look like I opted

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,080
for transmit it's also built by the same

00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:48,040
people that built coda so prompt

00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:51,050
transmitted in coda all built by panic

00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:57,620
in opted for prompt and transmitted just

00:06:51,050 --> 00:07:01,790
chose not to use coda but okay but

00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:04,310
test.txt tastic and coda actually do

00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:06,770
have like SFTP integration into them

00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:08,840
it's just not as awesome as if you had

00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:12,560
transmit transmit allows you to be able

00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,300
to move stuff around where coda and text

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,340
a stick it's like oh sure you can upload

00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:21,290
or grab something but it's not as user

00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:23,630
friendly and then some other notable

00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:25,340
apps like obviously I have slack and

00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:28,010
some of the other like very basic apps

00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,380
that all of us likely use but some other

00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:33,590
notable ones is code hub code hub

00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:35,449
actually is a github management app and

00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:37,400
so most of the things that you can do on

00:07:35,449 --> 00:07:40,130
github if you've ever tried to go to

00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:43,940
github on your like phone or web browser

00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:45,770
it's not good and so code hub kind of is

00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:49,340
an interface to allow you to do things

00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:52,220
on github and it's totally free so it's

00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:54,470
a nice app to have a workflow is also

00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,900
awesome that's actually built by Apple

00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,550
and it I'm not sure if it comes default

00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,280
or not I know when I downloaded it it

00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:02,599
wasn't default at the time but it allows

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,789
you to go through and actually set up

00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:06,680
workflows so you could have something

00:08:04,789 --> 00:08:10,039
that would say like when I get a

00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:12,289
calendar invite like create something in

00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:13,490
a different app like maybe it's prepared

00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:15,979
for a meeting maybe you need to write

00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:17,240
notes or prepare a slide deck or

00:08:15,979 --> 00:08:18,940
whatever that might look like you can

00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,870
actually set up different workflows I

00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:23,060
haven't done it for anything web

00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,440
development related there was a really

00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,960
awesome blog post where someone was

00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,610
doing this with like a Jekyll site but

00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,289
it's just a really great like way to set

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:34,130
up different steps to do different

00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:35,990
things and then any font so I'm actually

00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:37,909
obviously using my iPad right now for

00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:40,400
this when I got this slide deck from the

00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:42,589
drupal combien a team they use that

00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,740
these custom fonts in there as we all

00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:45,540
know our phones

00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:47,820
our iPads do not have fonts that we can

00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,130
install so any font it was a dollar

00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:53,459
ninety-nine US dollars totally worth it

00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:55,170
I can actually create like a zip file of

00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:57,000
all the fonts that I want and then I

00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,860
open it with that app and it turns it

00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,750
into like an installable profile and

00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,060
then I can bring that into my iPad or my

00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,700
phone and then I have access to all of

00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:07,980
those fonts so that was a major void for

00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,240
me especially with like presentations or

00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,880
like front-end design to be able to

00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:20,339
check anything having that font was a

00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:21,570
necessary thing all right so the next

00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,399
part I'm going to get into like more

00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,310
demo pieces with the actual apps I'm

00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:27,839
using so there's obviously lots of

00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,730
different ways that all of us work it

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,630
really just depends on like what team

00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,490
you're on if you're working by yourself

00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:35,670
if you're using it if you're not using

00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:38,730
it who your host is where your server is

00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:40,680
all that good stuff and so I'm gonna

00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,029
walk through some different examples of

00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,500
how you could set them up and then

00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:44,209
actually go through the app and how I

00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,339
did that

00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:48,870
so I work at Pantheon obviously so I

00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:50,160
have to do a little bit of a plug here

00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,079
for Pantheon and they paid for me to

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,200
come here which is super gracious of

00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:56,670
them but I actually do use them all the

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,140
time and I use them for like side

00:09:56,670 --> 00:10:00,930
clients that I joined up having because

00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,310
I just enjoy the workflow but also

00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,560
what's really nice about Pantheon is

00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,630
that they have their own git

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,750
repositories to each site so I basically

00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:11,610
just take the get URL and I bring it

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,160
into working copy and I'm able to clone

00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:17,010
it over and then I can open those files

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,700
in text tastic make changes go back over

00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,370
to work and copy

00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,089
commit my changes and I'm good to go so

00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,970
I'm actually gonna go through that

00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:31,589
process here quick to show you all right

00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:34,279
so working copy will go into you will go

00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,279
to this site here

00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:48,350
my keyboard is being weird of course

00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:59,939
just so you guys know I hate the smart

00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:02,009
Keyboard it's not smart yes got it very

00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:03,720
cool so I'm in my Pantheon dashboard for

00:11:02,009 --> 00:11:05,939
so if you've been by the Pantheon booth

00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,980
we have like the crazy expanded demo

00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:10,379
that we're doing so I'll I just like

00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,610
forked the site and I've actually been

00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:14,220
setting up the continuous integration

00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:15,779
piece of it for the demo but I can also

00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,110
just clone the site so if I copy this

00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:23,129
over this is my git clone command I want

00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:25,800
to working copy I can just do a plus I

00:11:23,129 --> 00:11:27,240
can say clone repository and then here

00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,379
it gives us like lots of choices I know

00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,319
this is probably really small so I

00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:33,839
apologize for the ones in the back there

00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:35,579
but it says bitbucket github and then it

00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,290
says other so if I pop over to other

00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:40,920
then I can just type in this little like

00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:43,579
get URL box so if I paste that I'm gonna

00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:48,720
remove out some of this other get clone

00:11:43,579 --> 00:11:56,430
stuff that I don't need go back over

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:59,040
here so the one thing that I do want to

00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:00,990
note is that SSH keys can get kind of

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,329
tricky on an iPad

00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,470
so with Pantheon I have my SSH key Rd

00:12:03,329 --> 00:12:07,259
and my accounts I don't worry about

00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:09,329
authenticating working copy actually

00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:12,089
gives you like a setting and a way to

00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:14,160
create an SSH key so that you can bring

00:12:12,089 --> 00:12:15,959
that to other places so that's been like

00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,290
huge for me also is finding apps that

00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:22,790
are SSH key friendly so now we're

00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,790
bringing my repository in

00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,820
which takes a couple seconds obviously

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:49,900
all right cool so now we're ready to go

00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:51,460
so I could go in here as you can see

00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,840
here like you can change branches so if

00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,940
I wanted to like go create an additional

00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:56,500
branch I just click on branch I can go

00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,390
up to the top and like merge or rebase

00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:00,610
like I can do all the same things that

00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:03,160
you could do with command line in this

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:05,410
awesome UI so now if I were to go over

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,720
to text astok which is my preferred code

00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,690
editor I can actually go to like the

00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,100
home screen here and when I go to open

00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:14,140
working copy is actually an option for

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,930
me to choose so I just click work and

00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:19,990
copy I go select grab I think this is

00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:22,060
probably one go grab it and then now all

00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,440
of my stuff is in here this is

00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,210
everything that I just brought over for

00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,620
my Pantheon site and we can see my

00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,630
upstream in here all the other stuff

00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,750
it's just uh I like literally just

00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:33,220
installed Drupal like an hour ago so

00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,690
just a regular Drupal installation and

00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,400
then I can go ahead and make changes and

00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,350
then after I make changes if I pop back

00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,720
over to work and copy it will recognize

00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:42,730
those changes and then I can go and

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,260
commit them here where right now it says

00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:47,640
nothing to commit but it would show up

00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:47,640
and I could click on that to commit it

00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,870
yeah you definitely could um when I

00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,220
haven't looked plugged in it's kind of

00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:57,160
weird to like get back and forth so I

00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,360
didn't do it but iOS 11 actually like as

00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,680
much as people have been complaining

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,600
about it

00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,520
it's actually a huge upgrade for iPad

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,830
users because it has like this also this

00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,900
new like files option so you can

00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:10,090
actually get to the files inside of your

00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:12,700
iPad now which is huge and then they

00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:13,990
also released multiple windows so you

00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,370
can set up like two different windows

00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,470
next to each other and then you could

00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:19,270
set up multiples of those so like if I

00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,920
wanted to have like slack in my email in

00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:22,780
one window then I can slide over just

00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,520
like you can on a MacBook and have like

00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,750
working copy and text a stick in another

00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:28,360
and then be able to slide over and go to

00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:29,980
like whatever view I wanted and so

00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:36,580
that's been a really great upgrade

00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:37,900
actually with iOS 11 all right cool I

00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,070
have a couple other more scenarios and

00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,690
then we'll kind of dig into like a

00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,500
little more demo but I want to leave a

00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:42,940
lot of time for you guys to ask

00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,830
questions because I know that's actually

00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:46,720
been the biggest part I've been using my

00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,790
iPad for a few months to do like any

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,070
other presentations and I just did a

00:14:48,790 --> 00:14:52,570
continuous integration talk and at the

00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:54,130
end there just like I don't have any

00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:56,329
questions about your talk but can you

00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:58,100
tell me about your iPad usage

00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:03,259
um so I know that there's likely to be

00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:05,059
questions so SFTP you know it may not be

00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:06,259
the perfect route to go some people

00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:08,929
might still be using it though and

00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:10,610
transmit is super great if I were to go

00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:12,079
in to transmit I actually don't remember

00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:15,350
if I have any saved in here because I

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:17,209
don't usually use this but it looks like

00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,939
I do have one site so you just go up

00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:21,230
maybe I don't anyways you can go to like

00:15:19,939 --> 00:15:22,369
Quick Connect and you just enter in your

00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,529
credentials and then you go ahead and

00:15:22,369 --> 00:15:25,759
add it so it's really easy to just be

00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:28,699
able to connect and then you can also

00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,860
save them and so then once you save them

00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:32,809
you can see here that like and again its

00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,489
small so I apologize but like the left

00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:36,670
hand side says local and the right hand

00:15:34,489 --> 00:15:38,720
side says remote so it's a lot like

00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:40,129
transmitted on a computer where you can

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,339
just move stuff around and be able to

00:15:40,129 --> 00:15:45,939
like see what you're doing and then of

00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:48,679
course like if you're using any SFTP

00:15:45,939 --> 00:15:49,699
programs you can use text a stick you

00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:52,100
can use coda you could really use

00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:56,360
whatever editor you want at that point I

00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:58,850
just like it because of working copy so

00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,489
get SSH if you're using a server that

00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:03,860
has SSH like I have a VPS that I have

00:16:01,489 --> 00:16:06,529
some of my side clients on I can

00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:08,720
actually use prompt to go in there and

00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:11,749
so I'll show you quick in prompt what it

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,509
looks like I have all of my connections

00:16:11,749 --> 00:16:16,879
already saved and so I have two over

00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:21,769
here that are just connecting into my

00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:24,019
servers and upon connecting in there

00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:26,749
like I've been SSH into my server I can

00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:28,519
go ahead run commands change directories

00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:30,139
check out all the different things that

00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:31,809
I have in my directory and be able to do

00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:33,799
anything that I could on the server

00:16:31,809 --> 00:16:35,360
what's actually really enlightening

00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:36,470
about this is that you if you have

00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,709
different things that you want to be

00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:40,999
able to like do or run or different

00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:43,069
commands like if you want to do like

00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:45,079
compose there anything else like you can

00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:46,939
just put them on a server and just run

00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:50,679
it through the server if you don't have

00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:50,679
that capability obviously on your iPad

00:16:54,009 --> 00:16:59,779
so I would say like in using an iPad pro

00:16:58,129 --> 00:17:02,509
like my strongest recommendation is to

00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:04,610
use continuous integration and let like

00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:06,889
circle CI or Travis do all the work for

00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:08,579
you if you're not familiar with what

00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:11,669
continuous integration is it's a

00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:13,740
way to build out a site and so what

00:17:11,669 --> 00:17:17,059
happens is that I commit code to say

00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:19,380
github github and Circle C are connected

00:17:17,059 --> 00:17:21,449
circle recognizes that I've made changes

00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,819
it goes through an entire build process

00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:25,649
that I have like the example that I have

00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,929
here it's actually using composer to

00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:30,179
bring in all of my dependencies and then

00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:32,610
it's compiling my sass it's minifying my

00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:35,250
JavaScript it's doing some b-hat testing

00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:36,960
and some other PHP unit testing and then

00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:39,269
once all of that stuff is done and

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,279
everything passes it automatically

00:17:39,269 --> 00:17:43,019
deploys everything to a server so the

00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:45,419
only things that I actually need on my

00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:47,519
iPad to work in that type of scenario is

00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:49,429
really just a text editor and a way to

00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,690
be able to push to my github repository

00:17:49,429 --> 00:17:57,690
so that's my strongest recommendation

00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:59,549
for a workflow for on your iPad so there

00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:02,039
are some downfalls obviously limited

00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:03,179
command-line options so with Pantheon

00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:05,880
actually we have a command line tool

00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:07,260
called terminus and it allows you to

00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,419
basically do anything on your Pantheon

00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,950
sites that you'd want to do the downfall

00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:12,870
is I can't install that it requires a

00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,230
curl command or an installation of some

00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,720
kind

00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:17,880
I can't install done on my iPad the one

00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,559
upside is that I have it in my next

00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,010
slide but has anyone heard of cloud 9

00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:26,130
has anyone used it before no awesome

00:18:23,010 --> 00:18:29,220
cloud 9 is awesome it is a cloud based

00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:31,289
like IDE basically you can set up like

00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,389
any site or anything that you want on it

00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:35,850
you can tell it like what you want like

00:18:33,389 --> 00:18:37,200
the languages the like dependencies

00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:38,760
anything that you want on there it's

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,340
basically like this blank server that's

00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,779
online and I have terminus installed in

00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,110
a cloud 9 environment so I can do

00:18:42,779 --> 00:18:47,240
anything I want to do inside of that

00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:49,559
just some other quick downfalls

00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,529
some apps are not meant for heavy work

00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:54,990
if I am on a Zune call on my iPad I

00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:58,380
literally cannot do anything else so

00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:00,360
that's a major downfall there's only one

00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:03,360
port like I do have this adapter and the

00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:04,919
adapter has USB C and HDMI so that's

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,720
great but like I can't really do a whole

00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:09,120
lot of other stuff like I can't plug in

00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,580
like an actual like wired mouse or

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,350
anything like that mobile web site

00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:15,539
versions by default it gets really

00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:18,720
annoying there is like the awesome like

00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:20,669
request Desktop inside of Safari but

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,570
Google apps by default try to keep

00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:23,070
everything like

00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,530
easy and give you the mobile version and

00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:28,280
it's really not easy so that's kind of a

00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:32,100
downfall something I've gotten over but

00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:33,540
lack of file support SVG's and CSVs are

00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:36,420
just two examples but you can't open

00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:37,950
them on iPads so if I get any of those I

00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,420
end up having to like upload those to

00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:41,040
Google Drive and then open them through

00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:44,700
Google Drive like Google sheets or

00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:45,720
something else app limitation obviously

00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,220
you have to get everything from an app

00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:48,750
store unless you're like an iOS

00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,580
developer and want to compile everything

00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:53,070
with Xcode but you still have to do that

00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,960
on a computer and then the cost of apps

00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,160
like I said I don't even want to admit

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,500
the amount of money I have in

00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:02,040
investigating apps but it's like

00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:04,260
hundreds so they're not cheap one quick

00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:05,700
thing I want to show you before I'm

00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:09,270
going to actually show you how to do

00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,500
what I did in cloud 9 I'm so cloud 9

00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:12,060
again like I said lets you setup

00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,100
whatever you want for an environment I

00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:16,950
already have like a terminus 1 so if I

00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,360
go open this and you'll be able to see

00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:20,580
like you can basically install anything

00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,780
you want you can run curl commands you

00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:23,130
can bring anything in there that you

00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,930
want like you could set up your whole

00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:27,720
website like with composer and run

00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:29,130
actual composer commands to install

00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,640
everything and it would build all of

00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:37,080
that for you but like here is an example

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:39,360
of terminus so if I wanted to guide

00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:44,000
terminus installed here one second my

00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:46,350
keyboard is also being silly

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,690
so terminus art is a command that just

00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:50,880
gives you like a random logo probably

00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:54,810
instead of terminus at that time I got

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:57,780
hello world this time I got the Drupal

00:20:54,810 --> 00:21:00,090
logo so I was able to go in and

00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:02,370
basically edit like my bash profile and

00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:05,550
anything that I would need inside of

00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:07,830
cloud 9 it's not as fast as it is on a

00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:08,850
desktop but it still works and so if

00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,920
there are some things that you're like

00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:12,240
ok cool I'm working on an iPad I really

00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,620
need to do this and I don't know how

00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,720
else to do it like set up a cloud 9

00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:17,490
environment for the most part it's free

00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,710
I did sign up for like a $10 a month

00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:23,940
plan but that's only so I can share with

00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:24,930
other people um I think that's all I'm

00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,210
gonna show you cloud 9

00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:28,320
let's see you just wanna make sure I'm

00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:30,060
not forgetting you thing and then leave

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,870
time for questions yeah so we have like

00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:41,180
5 minutes for questions I think

00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:43,910
yeah um well I say out of databases to

00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:46,640
be honest so it really doesn't come up I

00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:47,900
would say like I'm not sure like what

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,120
you're doing in a database but if you're

00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:52,010
in the database probably doing something

00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:54,620
you don't need to be doing but it just

00:21:52,010 --> 00:22:01,450
depends like what is what would you do

00:21:54,620 --> 00:22:03,470
in the database to change yeah sure I

00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:05,240
guess it kind of depends like if you're

00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:07,550
using Drupal 8 you could probably like

00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,520
use some of the configuration management

00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:12,200
and try to do some tweaking that way it

00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:18,500
just kind of depends but I usually stay

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:22,970
away from databases oh you know I like

00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:24,920
I'm pretty sure I have I don't um but I

00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:27,020
feel like yeah so I got like a MySQL

00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,670
like editor I haven't used it yet but

00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,240
like I said I avoid databases like the

00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:32,420
plague

00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:34,490
so that would be why but if you have

00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:38,390
like advice I'd be welcome to hear it so

00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:45,290
oh well that one seems promising but I

00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:48,470
don't know yet good question though yeah

00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:51,020
oh yeah

00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:53,270
so front-end development I actually um I

00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:55,130
would say like my expertise is probably

00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:56,740
front-end development like I can do all

00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:58,790
of it but I really like the like

00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:02,000
reciprocation of being able to see my

00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:06,320
work like immediately I actually have so

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,960
if I go you can set up Firebug as a

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:14,090
bookmark I have to remember like how to

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:17,690
get there again cancel so there is an

00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:19,370
online tutorial to do this and I don't

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,830
remember of course like I cleaned up all

00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:24,380
my bookmarks I don't remember I put it

00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:27,110
but you can all here we go Firebug so

00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:28,520
it's like a JavaScript like snippet and

00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:31,010
you can actually and there's like an

00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,600
article online if you just google it but

00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:34,220
you can actually go ahead and like do

00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,770
the same stuff so if I go here and go

00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,420
inspect I can actually touch stuff and

00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:40,670
get the same thing that you can from

00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:43,010
Firebug in a browser and it's just a

00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:45,380
JavaScript like couple lines of code and

00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:46,760
you add that as the URL of your bookmark

00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:49,820
and then you can just click it and it

00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:52,670
opens up in your browser it's not like

00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:54,620
as good as like Google Chrome or Firebug

00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:59,020
developer tools but for me it's been

00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:59,020
sufficient to be able to to edit things

00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:07,520
yeah like a local server so that's one

00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,930
thing you're definitely giving up like

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,700
working on an iPad is that you don't

00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,290
have the local server

00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,210
cloud9 has been a really great resource

00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:15,710
if you want to have a local server and

00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:18,350
be able to like see things as you're

00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:20,240
doing it again like I use Pantheon a lot

00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:22,760
for most of my sites and Pantheon like

00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,440
has its own like multi dev environments

00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,970
and so as soon as I push code up I can

00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,220
see it in my environment and that's like

00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:31,120
a live URL and so that's kind of been my

00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,120
workaround

00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:41,659
yeah totally and that is the downfall

00:24:40,129 --> 00:24:44,809
for sure is that you don't you can't

00:24:41,659 --> 00:24:45,349
like locally work on the iPad at least

00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:54,200
not yet

00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:56,359
hoping that changes but yeah cool um so
