Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Drupal and the Ethereum Blockchain
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	Here are my slidesÂ http://slides.com/digitaldonkey/drupal-ethereum-2

Blockchains have received a lot of media attention in the passed year and considered a game changer of the Internet. Blockchains add an immutable layer of trust to web applications by being a distributed ledger that is a tamper-proof history of all transactions sent to it.

This enables a lot of new applications and business models currently being explored by pioneers. These include asset management and tracking, borderless payments, automated payments (IOT), decentralized certification, decentralized registries and much more.

In this session I present my ongoing development integrating the Ethereum blockchain with Drupal.

While blockchain is a peer-to-peer technology that can be used in fully decentralized p2p architectures, I will give an introduction to the semi-decentralized architecture my Drupal Ethereum module uses, explain the basics of the underlying PHP Ethereum library I'm writing in parallel and provide an outlook on potential applications.

Currently I'm working on a new implementation of Single-Sign-On using Ethereum cryptography without on-chain transactions. I will explain how this can be used for document signing.

Ethereum is an open source blockchain platform that is programmable via smart contracts. Integration with Drupal would allow organizations to integrate Ethereum into their user registry workflows and begin to explore blockchain's benefits.

hello I think it's time to start welcome

00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:17,730
to my presentation about Drupal and the

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:19,970
blockchains yeah thanks for closing the

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,970
door

00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:37,130
so my name is Torsten I'm working in the

00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:42,430
blockchain for a while and for Drupal in

00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:42,430
a very long time currently I work for oh

00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:48,100
sorry it's not in my control

00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:02,790
currently I'm working for a company in

00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:07,140
New York called consensus we really like

00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:10,950
a start-up with around close to foreign

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,020
people now working in different sections

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,530
of the blockchain

00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:19,200
lots of experimental stuff myself I came

00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:23,550
to to blockchain technology some about

00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,890
two years ago a friend asked me to do

00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:28,500
some some UI because he said he created

00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:32,580
a Twitter client and nobody can ever

00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:35,580
censor it was a funny project it's not

00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:38,450
maintained anymore but basically it just

00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:41,340
wrote text strings into a blockchain and

00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:48,270
it showed me a lot of things and it made

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:52,440
me very interested into this who knows

00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:55,320
Bitcoin its most most of the people and

00:01:52,440 --> 00:02:03,540
who now is a terraeum so far oh it's a

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:05,670
lot surprised yeah my talk will be might

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,940
be a bit more technical than the last

00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,500
one about this subject but I will try to

00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:12,299
start with a very simplified

00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:18,150
introduction to the blockchain

00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:20,670
technology so basically who cares about

00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,190
the blockchain it got a huge media

00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:29,000
coverage in the in the last 1 1 2 years

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:32,160
and nearly all professional sectors like

00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,940
evaluating how a blockchain might affect

00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,610
their work so for example a lot of banks

00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:43,890
and bank consortiums try to improve

00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:46,230
their inter banking trade in for example

00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:51,870
I work in Dubai recently on online

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:55,230
registry project so Dubai device King

00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:58,170
I think decided 2020 he want to have

00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:01,980
like all public government's documents

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:06,750
on the blockchain and to have like

00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:07,810
signatures approved by a state but

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,150
there's a

00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:14,050
a lot of more than the the enterprise

00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:18,340
part I really like the idea because it's

00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:21,220
a peer-to-peer platform so I like the

00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:26,640
idea that you're you have like direct

00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:29,260
enable direct trade without borders and

00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,849
there's there's lots of interesting

00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:32,890
projects for example of one of my

00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:35,849
company's project is Buju

00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:40,739
music they try to make kind of like a

00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:43,630
music platform where you directly have

00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:46,150
contract become later to this where you

00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:49,540
say oh this is my license models for my

00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:51,010
song and then you can choose a payment

00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,110
option that you get a license for a

00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:56,170
movie or license just to like stream it

00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:59,290
and something like this and you don't

00:03:56,170 --> 00:04:01,630
have like the payment is directly done

00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,880
to the to the music and you set up all

00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:10,420
its my band and this party gets so much

00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:13,269
share and stuff like this and last year

00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:15,820
also like the lawyers do a lot of

00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:19,630
research and thinking about how how this

00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:26,470
new technology will actually affect the

00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:28,720
legal view so what what the blockchain

00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:36,430
is is bringing new to the Internet

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:38,080
it's a new layer of trust which is like

00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:40,990
it currently in the internet you cannot

00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:45,639
like trust on money and you have a

00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:47,650
central network where everybody get the

00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:50,020
same value and it's syncing itself but

00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,930
we get there what I really like about it

00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:57,070
what I just said is the idea of like

00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:59,169
sharing economics it's basically the

00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:02,770
companies like uber or something take a

00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:05,289
share of a taxi driver and I see a high

00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:09,010
potential of rebuilding this stuff into

00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:16,210
a like without these big companies in

00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:20,440
the middle in the decentralized way and

00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:24,820
there's also the idea of self so

00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:26,680
brain user data so that you put up a

00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:29,890
profile and then you have attestation

00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:33,630
for example you put a address on your on

00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:36,400
your profile and then whatever bank or

00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:47,350
country can like attest that this

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:50,290
information you put there is valid so

00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:54,070
how to imagine this is mystical

00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:56,610
blockchain I kind of like the idea it's

00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:59,050
the most simple way to explain it like a

00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:02,620
decentralized database which keeps

00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:06,460
itself in in sync so if you if you take

00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:09,970
Bitcoin is the the the first blockchain

00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:12,820
is an example so it says oh this address

00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:15,060
owns that money and then you transfer

00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:18,490
the money to somebody else and if the

00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:21,100
every node of the network into consensus

00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:23,710
about this so if I set up one own node

00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,840
and I say oh no I own like more bitcoins

00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:28,660
than the five I actually have the

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:31,570
network won't like find out that I do

00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:33,250
like wrong information there and it will

00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:36,010
just like kick me out of the network

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:46,120
because I kind of forked the chain and I

00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:48,940
didn't agree to the consensus so so

00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:52,000
about it here iam like a terraeum is I

00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:53,860
think a little bit a later version of

00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:59,080
the blockchain Bitcoin only does money

00:06:53,860 --> 00:07:02,380
transfer where like it here iam is it's

00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:05,640
based on all implementations or open

00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:14,290
source and it offers a lot more

00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:16,780
functionality than Bitcoin does so in

00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:20,710
the adherend blockchain you have next

00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:22,660
studies database consensus as I as I

00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:26,880
call it it's a peer-to-peer network of

00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:29,860
nodes confirming each other you have

00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:32,590
like this leads you to a global ledger

00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:35,230
so you can put a value there

00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:38,410
and the value is like every every note

00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:40,300
has the same value which enables like

00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:42,160
things like these registries that you

00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:45,610
can like you put a hash of a document

00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:47,500
there and then nobody can like change

00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,180
the history and can say oh the hash was

00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,670
different I want to change the document

00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,410
it was not really my favorite so you

00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:56,970
just can't do a new transaction and

00:07:53,410 --> 00:08:02,260
everybody will see that you changed it

00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:05,490
the the also new thing compared to

00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:09,730
Bitcoin is that you can create scripting

00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:13,300
this this business value of money when I

00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:16,120
come back to this in a second basically

00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:22,650
the whole system is based on a symmetric

00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:29,520
cryptography a little bit like like with

00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:34,630
PGP I also come back later do this so

00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:36,970
how we get the data into like the chain

00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:40,210
so basically there's like a new block

00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:41,950
created every I think like 15 seconds or

00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:44,920
something there's a new block created

00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:46,990
and it takes all signed transactions

00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,900
together and combine some into our block

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:52,630
the block always contains the hash of

00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,880
the last block and the next block has

00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:58,060
the cache so so you cannot like break

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:06,010
this change without break this chain

00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:08,320
without annoying it one thing is like an

00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:10,900
interim blockchain data is kind of

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,570
public it's a little bit binary encoded

00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:16,900
and you need to know that the way you

00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:19,590
put it that you can read it but it's not

00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,580
encrypted there's some some other

00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:25,240
implementations of each IAM like a

00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:27,070
quorum which kind of it goes for for

00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:33,280
privacy protection in this but it is

00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:36,550
like not yet the default so what is a

00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:39,670
smart contract basically I have this

00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:41,650
this example of the most simple idea of

00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,370
a smart contract that I seen in the

00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,499
crowdfounding

00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:47,229
so basically

00:09:44,499 --> 00:09:51,669
you'll say in a crowd round you say oh

00:09:47,229 --> 00:09:55,029
if I if I found like whatever $10,000 or

00:09:51,669 --> 00:09:59,049
money units then my crowd found is

00:09:55,029 --> 00:10:01,239
successful so I will move the money to

00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:03,369
the founding account but if this is not

00:10:01,239 --> 00:10:05,919
happened by the by the given time you

00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:08,589
can automatically transfer the money

00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:12,969
back to it to its original owners and if

00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:16,419
you have this deployed you're like it's

00:10:12,969 --> 00:10:18,549
it's gonna happen you cannot like just

00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:24,069
change it oh I decided to 9,000 is in

00:10:18,549 --> 00:10:25,839
Athens so it's it wouldn't work so the

00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:27,669
smart contracts they have like addresses

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:32,379
so you can like address them and

00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:43,899
interact with them to make transactions

00:10:32,379 --> 00:10:47,889
like so everything is based on this in

00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:50,229
this asymmetric crypto key pairs and you

00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:52,659
need like in order to put anything on

00:10:50,229 --> 00:10:57,279
the blockchain you need to sign it with

00:10:52,659 --> 00:11:00,339
your with your private key every private

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:05,039
key is like represents a address which

00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:05,039
is like at every word of the public key

00:11:05,939 --> 00:11:11,709
but you cannot only assign transactions

00:11:09,189 --> 00:11:13,479
with this there's like some other things

00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:17,709
would you like work with a symmetric

00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:20,849
cryptography before which is doing just

00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:22,959
signatures like on a text without

00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:25,929
necessarily interacting with the

00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:28,149
blockchain so basically when you when

00:11:25,929 --> 00:11:30,309
you have a text and you give a signature

00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:33,220
to it and you have like a string of this

00:11:30,309 --> 00:11:35,319
signature and if somebody has the text

00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:37,359
and the signature he can say oh you are

00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:39,369
the only one who could produce the

00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:41,559
signature so he knows that you own this

00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:46,869
this private key without knowing your

00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:49,589
key and you can also like encrypt data

00:11:46,869 --> 00:11:49,589
with this

00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:56,410
so one of the the evolving stuff and one

00:11:54,519 --> 00:12:00,220
of the most challenges currently is

00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:03,509
getting this to all browsers this is

00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:07,810
like a very highly moving environment

00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:11,500
and currently there's a meta mask you

00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:15,060
see in the image which is a browser

00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:18,699
plug-in it's currently developed into a

00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:20,529
browser independent plugin there's like

00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:23,439
the original aetherium is browser this

00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:25,860
is the two two ones I have currently am

00:12:23,439 --> 00:12:28,350
working in my proof-of-concept

00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:33,569
application which is the current module

00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:39,610
but there's a lot of other projects

00:12:33,569 --> 00:12:42,459
developed and I think in yeah the timing

00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,560
is hard to say I'm optimistic that we

00:12:42,459 --> 00:12:47,230
get more and more and use the devices in

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:50,199
actually being able to interact with the

00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:53,019
blockchain so this is just some of them

00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:54,699
coming on the horizon so when I think

00:12:53,019 --> 00:12:58,000
about Drupal we always want to like

00:12:54,699 --> 00:13:00,970
serve like every use of our website so I

00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,769
think it's not yet the ecosystem is not

00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:04,720
yet ready that you can just like make a

00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:07,389
application for like everyone because

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:11,050
the all these transaction signers are

00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:13,120
not that advanced that that you could

00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:20,380
like say oh i i target all browsers

00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:22,689
immediately in the module also

00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,360
concerning signatures there's like I

00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:30,910
created kind of two different ways to do

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:34,149
the same thing when one is a smart

00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:37,209
contract based signup where you kind of

00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:40,269
get a challenge from Drupal and you sign

00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:44,470
it as a transaction into a smart

00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:46,269
contract registry and then Drupal can

00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:50,100
read that you signed this and then it

00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:52,569
knows oh you're on this key so you're

00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,870
added to this registry in the contract

00:13:52,569 --> 00:13:57,939
but this is basically a transaction

00:13:54,870 --> 00:14:01,649
which which costs a little money like in

00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:01,649
a tier iam all transactions

00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:07,370
cost it's not much but if you write data

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,100
to the blockchain you need to pay

00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:12,830
something because this money is used to

00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:14,500
actually as an incentive for the people

00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:17,480
who are running this blockchain note

00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:21,620
that they did they did they do it you

00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:25,280
know but I created a second signup

00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:26,900
module which is like an on blockchain it

00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:28,520
uses the same techniques but it just

00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:35,330
signs a challenge it's a challenge

00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:36,860
response identification so duper you

00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:41,810
don't need to like pay for the

00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:44,390
transaction you can just sign up so

00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:46,340
basically just a little bit a summary

00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:49,340
there's a lot of a lot of different

00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:53,270
things happening in the ecosystem the

00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:55,550
theorem is specified by a yellow paper

00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:57,230
it's called and it has different

00:14:55,550 --> 00:15:00,020
implementations like on the on the

00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,850
client level it's like gate parity forum

00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,050
there's like a test environment which

00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:05,870
doesn't actually connect to the

00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:09,620
blockchain just for testing so the

00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:12,440
implementations are not 100% the same so

00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:15,110
I ended up building a library to

00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:18,920
abstract it it's like a strongly type

00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:20,690
PHP 7 library because all the data types

00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:22,580
you want to write to the blockchain and

00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:26,900
need to be like strongly tight otherwise

00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:29,570
it wouldn't work and on the front and

00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:34,010
you also have the problem that you don't

00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:37,210
know yet exactly which tools your end

00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:40,700
users I have to sign transactions so

00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:42,920
like on the on the PHP side the library

00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:45,620
is kind of working but on the front end

00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,570
I'm currently use support me Tom asked

00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:49,220
and missed but we need to have like a

00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:52,010
more palatable infrastructure that you

00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:55,040
maybe also can like just scan a QR code

00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:59,630
to sign this transaction in a totally

00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:02,000
external device I think this is one of

00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:03,920
the biggest challenge to integrate many

00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,600
clients and you also need to evaluate

00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,600
which are actually in use

00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:19,750
so there's like basically aetherium is a

00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:21,910
fast evolving system it's the main

00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:26,040
language for smart contract solidity

00:16:21,910 --> 00:16:29,260
it's still in a no point release and

00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:31,900
it's like constantly evolving there's

00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:36,100
new libraries people evolve away

00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:38,460
different ways how to do things we have

00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:42,060
a currently transaction throughput of

00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:44,320
about I think it's like around 15

00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,610
transactions if you only do value

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:49,600
transactions like you would do in

00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:52,570
bitcoins like 25 but this is like not

00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,410
really a scale where you where you can

00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:56,590
like reach like large sites these

00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:59,080
processes

00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:04,870
I think 60,000 transactions per second

00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:08,380
so there's the goal is from an ethereal

00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:10,900
foundation to reach the the transaction

00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:20,439
speed of visa but it will take some

00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:23,110
years yeah basically the blockchain is

00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:25,089
really large now it's 280 gigabyte every

00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:28,750
time I talk about it it's like doubled

00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:30,370
ever so there's a light client

00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:33,760
development basically you cannot have

00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:36,460
like a client with 200 gigabytes to

00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:41,290
deliver on a phone so there's like web

00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:43,270
services if you're it's a service which

00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:45,430
you can like use to connect to the

00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:48,790
blockchain which I use as a default in

00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:51,040
the module but this is all in high

00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,570
development I think in within a year we

00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,270
will have light clients which don't

00:17:52,570 --> 00:18:00,760
download a whole block chain just like

00:17:54,270 --> 00:18:04,570
headers for verification drupelet area

00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:06,280
module I need to speed up a bit I picked

00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:09,250
it up in 2016

00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:11,890
found out that it was like not really

00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:16,690
working and I kind of completely rewrote

00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:18,700
the library below currently we have a

00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,950
proof of concept some

00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,170
some parties in github only because I

00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:26,650
couldn't like make it solve one problem

00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:29,200
which which I would see required to put

00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:31,530
it in a in a Drupal branch because now

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:37,030
it's not only still depending on a

00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:42,370
external tool and I focus on creating

00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:44,730
the infrastructure around so my company

00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:47,620
we really favor the ideal

00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:49,480
decentralization so compared to the

00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,700
current web you would have like the

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,730
etherium network as a data share layer

00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:58,000
and ipfs is it's called interplanetary

00:18:54,730 --> 00:19:01,630
file system it's decentralized file

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:03,580
system where like the idea is like

00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:06,270
everything is like decentralized and you

00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:10,750
just interact with decentralized stuff

00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:13,990
but in practical the world is not that

00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:16,720
far so about every blockchain

00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:22,000
application I now currently needs a dead

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:25,390
central database somewhere I came to

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,070
this which kind of just the point where

00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:31,600
it really fits into into the Drupal

00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:34,210
environment so I don't want to host keys

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:36,100
on a server because if you if you do

00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:38,650
like oh we make a passport login and we

00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:42,400
create a private key for you you just

00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:45,970
have the security of your signup process

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:49,270
so the current focus of the Drupal

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:52,390
module is transactions sign signatures

00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:54,760
are always done in the front end because

00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:56,800
you should own your key I don't want to

00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:02,200
have the key stored somewhere I would

00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:04,240
not do it on a web server for sure so

00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,040
basically you have a front-end side

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,770
where you're where you sign a

00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:12,220
transaction this will directly go to the

00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:15,040
ATM network and then Drupal can validate

00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:18,970
if this transaction actually happened so

00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:20,950
you sign up into our like a registry and

00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:23,020
it's my contract and then Drupal will

00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:25,150
like see oh this transaction has

00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:27,970
happened yeah he really signed up so you

00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:30,820
have kind of like a circle validation

00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,610
and Drupal will only pull data the PHP

00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:39,679
layer

00:20:31,610 --> 00:20:43,490
only poll data so I try to get a little

00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:46,370
bit to the architecture we have like the

00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:50,410
theorem nodes which is like the

00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:53,390
decentralized network and we might also

00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:55,520
like one plan is creating an entity type

00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:58,730
for notes that you can kind of like do

00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,380
easy listing in fuse listing all the

00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:04,520
servers whatever if they're online on

00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:07,130
offline or they're there the server

00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:10,130
information you can can gather a query

00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:12,350
from notes currently we only have like

00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:17,210
one fixed connection that this is like

00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:22,400
one part what already kind of works is

00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:26,059
the connection of Drupal ethereum

00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:29,419
accounts with a Drupal account sorry it

00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:31,730
hiriam accounts the Drupal account where

00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:35,450
you kind of have the possibility to

00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:37,220
create like a known user your map this

00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:41,690
terraeum address which is just a text

00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:44,090
long hash to to account and then you

00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:48,950
have for a limited user group you can

00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:51,530
say oh this is my users so every

00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:53,450
interaction is creating transactions

00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:55,760
another thing I think it's really

00:21:53,450 --> 00:22:00,559
important for this module is to be able

00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:02,299
to listen to blockchain changes and say

00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,790
you deploy a smart contract and it

00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:07,010
creates a registry so you want to know

00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:09,260
like every time somebody submits this

00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:12,860
you would create an entity on the front

00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:14,450
end that you can kind of act on this you

00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,580
know the contract you read the data and

00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:25,460
it's like oh this value is submitted and

00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:29,630
you act on this and we have smart

00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:33,280
contract in an ideal world we will like

00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:36,919
just deploy them out of Drupal I think

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:39,800
or I'm working on on infrastructure to

00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:43,010
enable this that you you have like test

00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:45,260
networks live networks and in your would

00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:47,450
ideally just like

00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:49,700
a module or sub-module of the Ituri

00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:52,550
module whatever a voting modules and

00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,410
then you deploy the contract which is

00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:57,650
delivered with their tour to a network

00:22:54,410 --> 00:23:17,150
in admin your I using also a transaction

00:22:57,650 --> 00:23:19,940
signer to deploy and basically the every

00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:24,320
contract defines its own data types

00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:27,110
it's called this contract ABI and Drupal

00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,820
needs to know which is the data types

00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:31,220
and a contract in order to read the data

00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:33,290
otherwise it's like an unknown hex data

00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:35,120
and you don't know where it start and

00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:46,030
where it's if it's array or if it's a

00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:49,160
string so current state we have this

00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:52,970
sign up module in into two variants one

00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:58,700
is in github I created a docker script

00:23:52,970 --> 00:24:00,890
to test it and basically there's a lot

00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:03,200
of things to be done I was like actually

00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:06,470
very little on time and in the last

00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:09,140
half-year about I'm very optimistic that

00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:11,920
in November I gonna start like it gets

00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:15,410
much more time on this project the

00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:18,080
underlying PHP library is not like

00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:22,730
supporting the heart complex data types

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:24,800
yet what I what I explained with the

00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:27,350
transaction sign is I need to develop a

00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:31,070
pluggable system that we can replace

00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:35,360
different and user transaction signers

00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:38,180
on this and contract management and

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,220
deployment and server entities I think

00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:43,100
this is like the basic infrastructure

00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:48,280
modules we need in order to create like

00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:48,280
real applications on top of this

00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:59,480
so why is this actually interesting I

00:24:56,749 --> 00:25:08,570
think it will really change the internet

00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:18,950
on the long term and Drupal strength is

00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:21,889
actually Enterprise workflows so I see a

00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:23,899
lot of potential applications like asset

00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:26,179
management document signing systems

00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:29,029
where you basically need a user workflow

00:25:26,179 --> 00:25:34,159
on on the back inside in order and you

00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:36,590
have a visualization like fuse making

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:41,379
making it nice and I think this is

00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:41,379
something super would really fit in

00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:50,059
there's also the idea of like creating

00:25:45,529 --> 00:25:55,749
the decentralized organizations which is

00:25:50,059 --> 00:26:00,049
a that you create a founding out of

00:25:55,749 --> 00:26:02,509
material members and and do budgeting or

00:26:00,049 --> 00:26:04,970
voting systems like you say oh this our

00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:08,210
budget and we vote for this there's some

00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:10,190
ideas but I have to admit that I was

00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:14,269
optimistic we get earlier to this but

00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:20,080
the infrastructure work is is more more

00:26:14,269 --> 00:26:24,139
than I than I thought so far and yeah

00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:30,259
but it will come in in an ideal world we

00:26:24,139 --> 00:26:33,049
have out-of-the-box stuff so I plan to

00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:34,940
back above session tomorrow for people

00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:37,190
who want to discuss more use cases I

00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:39,499
liked a little bit the actual

00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:43,840
applications this time it's more in my

00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:46,490
last talk I invite you to join tomorrow

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,179
discuss more about what what you can

00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:55,309
imagine in Drupal and blockchain

00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:58,340
connected yeah that's my slides you'll

00:26:55,309 --> 00:27:01,340
find there it's like yeah my my company

00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:05,180
conferences is sponsoring my time so I'm

00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:26,940
grateful to be able to work on this

00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:27,090
and that's it any questions okay thank

00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:35,070
you

00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:38,220
oh so you talked about the sign-in

00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:40,740
process in Drupal and that Advent checks

00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:43,560
if the transaction was processed on the

00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:44,010
blockchain via PHP how long does that

00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,690
take

00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,580
is it instant or do you have to wait

00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:51,030
like 15 seconds before it picks it up

00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:54,450
and says ok it's ok you can log-in it it

00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:56,460
takes a little time 15 seconds might

00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:59,100
might be writers to average block time

00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:02,790
itself it's instant and as a regular

00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:05,190
login it works in the other way like

00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:07,230
basically this one login is like really

00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:10,190
doing a transaction where we'll take the

00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:11,820
time if you if you use the approach of

00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:14,100
challenge/response of the identification

00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,570
where you just like sign it's instantly

00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,940
because you don't need to wait for the

00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:20,490
blockchain it's just like local

00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:23,520
cryptography ok and then one quick other

00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:24,540
question like now you still need like

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,480
the metal mask

00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:29,340
plug-in or another kind of browser are

00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,140
there any plans to integrate it into

00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:33,630
existing browsers like Chrome Safari

00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:38,240
Internet Explorer or that's still way

00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:40,650
into the future so so the most common

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,860
tool for this currently it's me Tomas

00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:45,930
and it uses a web service so it doesn't

00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:47,880
download the whole blockchain the

00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:50,970
etherion browser downloads really did

00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:56,550
280 gigabyte blockchain now it's a

00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:59,210
challenge and but it's developed into

00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:03,720
like a more non browser independent

00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:05,550
JavaScript library I think there will be

00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:07,560
much more to come

00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:10,110
like currently and I'm thinking about

00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:12,150
how is the smartest way to integrate it

00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:13,800
to make it really exchangeable that we

00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,130
can use all different kinds of

00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:25,180
transactions Ines

00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:32,310
okay thanks okay thank you

00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:32,310
[Applause]

00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:42,230
