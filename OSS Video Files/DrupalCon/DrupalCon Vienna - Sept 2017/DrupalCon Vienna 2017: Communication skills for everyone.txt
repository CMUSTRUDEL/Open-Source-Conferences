Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	Communication. It's a skill. You already know how to communicate. Most of us do it, in one way or another, every single day. But what makes someone a great communicator? Is it natural talent or a skill that can be learned? Or something in between. This talk explores communication techniques, strategies and skills. Some that are simple, and some that need practice. Wherever you are on the communicator skill spectrum, you should find something new to put in your comms toolbelt. Come along and be prepared to talk to other members of the audience, share your own ideas and strategies for getting your point across, and for listening and understanding your colleagues, friends, and family.
