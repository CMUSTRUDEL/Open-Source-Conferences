Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Communication skills for everyone
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	Communication. It's a skill. You already know how to communicate. Most of us do it, in one way or another, every single day. But what makes someone a great communicator? Is it natural talent or a skill that can be learned? Or something in between. This talk explores communication techniques, strategies and skills. Some that are simple, and some that need practice. Wherever you are on the communicator skill spectrum, you should find something new to put in your comms toolbelt. Come along and be prepared to talk to other members of the audience, share your own ideas and strategies for getting your point across, and for listening and understanding your colleagues, friends, and family.

communicate down here perhaps

00:00:08,059 --> 00:00:18,000
communication is a basic skill most of

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:22,010
us practice everyday often without

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:27,000
really realizing we're doing it and

00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:30,390
really intentionally my name is Donna

00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,020
Benjamin I'm a project lead at catalyst

00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:39,500
IT and I sit on the board of the Drupal

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:43,340
Association but what makes me qualified

00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:49,739
to talk to all of you about

00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:53,370
communication a colleague made me

00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:56,670
realize that I'd been taking some of my

00:00:53,370 --> 00:01:00,149
skills for granted I have a Bachelor of

00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:03,510
Arts in theatre and drama

00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,700
I have another qualification in Internet

00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:10,799
and web computing and I'm a qualified

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:12,900
trainer all of those things add up to me

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,299
having studied a body of knowledge that

00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:16,830
I don't even think about now it's kind

00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,560
of like once you learn to ride a bicycle

00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,850
you don't think about how you learned to

00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,439
ride a bicycle or the mechanical

00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,750
mechanical actions you take to keep

00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:33,390
those wheels turning I take it for

00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:37,110
granted so my colleague was was prompted

00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:40,650
to sort of ask me about this because I

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,840
had such sort of I was so kind of

00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,310
relaxed and comfortable about speaking

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,159
in front of people it didn't kind of

00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,570
fill me with dread or nerves like some

00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,159
of our other colleagues were sort of

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,439
discussing and their challenges of how

00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,759
to improve their speaking skills so this

00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,380
was what prompted a little bit of

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,939
reflection so that's what I sort of

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:03,540
bring to the stage if you like a sense

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:09,079
of stagecraft of connecting with you as

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,079
a great stage craft in action

00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:31,659
okay so this is me I've already gone

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,390
through this so what I wanted to do

00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:37,000
today was to invite you into a

00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:40,299
conversation not just stand up here and

00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,819
talk at you for an hour I wanted us to

00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:47,700
kind of engage a little bit in this

00:02:42,819 --> 00:02:47,700
thing this thing called communication

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:59,500
stagecraft is just one element this bit

00:02:53,859 --> 00:03:02,919
me broadcasting to you speaking is only

00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:05,980
one element element the thing you learn

00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:09,780
when you work in theater is that you

00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:13,299
need to know yourself as much as

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:16,480
anything else so that you are able to

00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:19,450
perhaps pretend to be someone else and

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,310
that's probably the one tip I give most

00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,290
people who are first standing up on

00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,500
stage and wondering how they're going to

00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:29,319
do it and I say pretend it's not you

00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:34,750
it's not about you it's about all of you

00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:37,650
it's the audience know the audience this

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:40,720
to me is the real key to communication

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,090
it's what's happening it's what you're

00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,859
all doing right now you're actually the

00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:49,449
important factor in communication it's

00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:51,819
the listening that matters we usually

00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:54,280
think when we talk about communication

00:03:51,819 --> 00:03:56,769
about the broadcast that's right about

00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:01,180
the speaking about the writing or

00:03:56,769 --> 00:04:04,840
reading you know or or um presenting

00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:08,260
speaking talking whether it's broadcast

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,269
on whatever medium whether there's a

00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,639
bull billboard it's all about the kind

00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:15,310
of broadcast part but I want us to bring

00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,650
back and say perhaps that's not the

00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:20,019
whole story

00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:23,320
it's the listening that matters and how

00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:27,810
do we improve our listening skills to be

00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,810
more effective communicators

00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:33,490
communication

00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,640
is a two-way street I love this image

00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:39,010
there's a lot of communication going on

00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,690
in this picture does anyone want to kind

00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,660
of call out some of the things they see

00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:47,170
here why would this why would I say this

00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:53,890
is communication it's alright you can

00:04:47,170 --> 00:05:03,270
speak street signs yes there's two

00:04:53,890 --> 00:05:03,270
street signs what else yeah

00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:14,600
beautiful so I'm gonna repeat for the

00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:16,940
recording on the one side of the street

00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,980
there's a lot of free expression and on

00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:23,000
the other side there's a lady hiding

00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:24,290
behind a curtain yes thank you so

00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,540
there's a lot going on here there's

00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:28,880
graffiti graffiti is a make an amazing

00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:31,220
form of communication it's not very

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,720
generally not authorized in Melbourne

00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,730
where I'm from it's become you know

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,560
street art and very you know well love

00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:40,040
to recognize but it wasn't always so

00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,070
right so graffiti and there's artwork

00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:44,620
and this signs and there's one of those

00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:48,520
signs is one way that I'm saying

00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:50,720
communication is that two-way street so

00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,270
this is one of the reasons why this

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,390
matters this is pretty interesting time

00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:58,570
in history we have up to five

00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:02,000
generations of people in our workplaces

00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:04,730
that's extraordinary they all have

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:10,160
different ways of preferring how they

00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:12,050
consume and engage in communication they

00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,600
may not necessarily fit the stereotypes

00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:17,990
but it's just this vast kind of array of

00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,730
types and sorts and things as many as

00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:22,970
five generations with diverse

00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:28,820
communication appetites makeup today is

00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:32,630
work for us so let's get into it I

00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:35,570
wanted to kind of distill this big broad

00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:45,620
hairy topic of communication into three

00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:48,440
things the what the how and the why so

00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,450
let's start with the what and actually

00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,460
not going to spend a lot of time here I

00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:55,280
think about the what as the actual

00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:59,750
message you're trying to communicate the

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:03,680
idea the story whatever it is that is

00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:06,470
that message is the what and I kind of

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,870
distill it right down into what we often

00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:11,800
do with communication is transmit

00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:16,070
culture whether it's workplace culture

00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:18,530
big art stuff we're often transmitting

00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,490
culture and all of the little bits and

00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:21,620
pieces that

00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:24,979
within that but that's not where I want

00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:29,900
to dwell today I think the big bit is

00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:32,810
the house this is where we all have room

00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:35,870
to grow no matter how great a

00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:37,970
communicator you are if you take the

00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:41,180
idea that you can always be better if

00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:44,650
you can focus on developing your mastery

00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:50,900
this is where we all have room to grow

00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:52,669
how do we communicate now if you read

00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:56,150
your abstracts carefully

00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:58,520
you were you were forewarned then I

00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:02,960
would ask you to engage in a little bit

00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:05,599
of communication what I'd like you to do

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,949
is turn to the person beside you or

00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:12,620
clump into threes or fours and have a

00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:17,360
chat about this question how do you

00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:19,220
communicate how what does this mean how

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,050
do you communicate I'm going to give you

00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:24,770
a couple of minutes and won't you have a

00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,690
chat throw your ideas around because I

00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,789
think we all do this every day right but

00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,590
we don't stop to think about it unless

00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:33,260
you're a communications professional and

00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,880
I I would suspect there are a few of you

00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,229
in the room today hands I people to

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:41,469
consider yourself a communications

00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:44,390
professional there's a few of you right

00:08:41,469 --> 00:08:46,520
so you probably do think intentionally

00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,899
about what communication is so I'm going

00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:50,899
to I'm going to call on you to be our

00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:54,140
experts of the room the rest of us are

00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:58,790
absolutely brilliant amateurs okay so

00:08:54,140 --> 00:09:01,630
huddle up Bruton cluster have a chat how

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:01,630
do we communicate

00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,809
[Music]

00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,130
[Music]

00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:42,500
okay

00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:44,780
I see some of you starting to wrap up

00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,980
your conversations others are still in

00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:48,350
full force

00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:50,990
so as you sort of start to kind of bring

00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,400
your thoughts together some of you who

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,550
perhaps finished early came to some

00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,230
clear conclusions quickly perhaps some

00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:59,030
of you has got into heated debates I

00:11:57,230 --> 00:12:02,750
could tell from the noise and the energy

00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:04,820
in the room yeah so someone perhaps you

00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,710
know call out some of the sort of

00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:11,450
thoughts or insights that you heard how

00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:18,370
do we communicate got some some thoughts

00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:18,370
to share yes

00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:50,149
so let me see if I got this so starting

00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,829
with some people use phone calls but

00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:53,329
perhaps they like to use face-to-face

00:12:51,829 --> 00:12:57,559
and there's the difference between

00:12:53,329 --> 00:13:02,149
speaking to customers and hello welcome

00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:03,709
come on in and and some of the

00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:05,360
challenges of having different types of

00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:07,699
communication to those different

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,249
audiences yeah great thank you something

00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:12,860
at some others how do we communicate

00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:14,629
I've grown up some of the elements of it

00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:21,189
and I imagine that some of you touched

00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:21,189
on on some of these what are others yes

00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,220
yeah

00:13:43,089 --> 00:13:48,379
phone so there's a shift from having

00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,170
used the phone to starting to use video

00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:54,079
and have that opportunity to see people

00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:56,689
as they communicate which adds facial

00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:01,059
expressions and more richness than you

00:13:56,689 --> 00:14:01,059
get just on the phone yeah thank you yes

00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:34,100
that's really interesting so George is

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,690
talking about his organization where

00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,690
they've got a combination of people

00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:40,640
working together in the one place

00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:42,700
present and they've got a no I'm not a

00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:45,529
number of others who are working

00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:47,930
distributed and they're coming in and

00:14:45,529 --> 00:14:50,810
and if you have even just got one person

00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:52,730
distributed prompts everyone to use the

00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:54,710
augment the communication with

00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:57,470
technology so that it allows everyone to

00:14:54,710 --> 00:15:00,220
participate to the same extent lovely

00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:00,220
thank you yes

00:15:53,830 --> 00:16:01,220
that's a lovely story thank you so just

00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:02,930
to sort of summarize that is this person

00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,970
from amazing labs is building out their

00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:07,550
distributor team and they're they're

00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:10,490
finding that that that difference

00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:12,200
between the the locator team and the

00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:15,560
people who are coming in distributed

00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:17,090
over technology the lack of the remote

00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:20,030
ins being able to see

00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:22,430
body language and the nonverbal

00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:23,930
communication that we all do and take

00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:26,330
the grounded when we're with each other

00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:28,010
like I could make a whole bunch of

00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:30,680
physical slapstick that would never go

00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:32,600
on the recording right there's physical

00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:36,040
things that we do we say facial

00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:38,750
expressions body language shut down

00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:41,120
these things are huge but when we start

00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:43,940
to have this sort of blended situation

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,550
we realize how much we're missing and

00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:48,860
think about how we have to compensate

00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:51,880
thank you really great insight thank you

00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:51,880
yes Jam

00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:33,870
thank you Jim so the the key learning

00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:37,020
that sham has has found is that that

00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:38,340
in-person connection up front makes a

00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,649
really big difference and so they've

00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:43,230
built that into their process that it

00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:45,690
changes have others found that is that a

00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:48,870
common kind of yes and nodding some

00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:52,770
hands up up the back yes so you know

00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:55,559
because we lose so much in in using

00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:57,809
technology when we lose those visual

00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:59,580
cues making that initial connection is

00:17:57,809 --> 00:18:02,669
really important and it's one I would

00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:05,340
argue that once you've had an

00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:08,059
opportunity to connect face to face it

00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,080
gives you a lot more leeway to be

00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:12,179
understanding about the things you might

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,000
be missing when you don't have it yeah

00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:17,270
Thank You Sharon great yeah thank you

00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,270
yep

00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:53,610
lovely is anyone else doing that whew

00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:56,930
yeah that's so so what they're doing for

00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:59,309
the recordings benefit is the the ways a

00:18:56,930 --> 00:19:01,470
company have started doing or have been

00:18:59,309 --> 00:19:03,210
doing for some time a newsletter because

00:19:01,470 --> 00:19:04,770
what they're finding is that when people

00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,179
are communicating they kind of know

00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:07,679
what's going on they've been involved in

00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:09,360
that but it's all the stuff they don't

00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,610
know that's going on that gets really

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,080
frustrating I'm so colliding that and

00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,630
putting it into a newsletter and I sort

00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:18,059
of out-of-band I guess non-synchronous

00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:20,520
means of communication gives everybody a

00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:25,490
chance to get up to speed lovely thanks

00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:25,490
Louise all right let's have one more yes

00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:43,710
yes yes reformulating was the word you

00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:45,620
used absolutely and and it comes into my

00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:50,309
oh it's going to sleep again damn it

00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:52,250
I'll continue on it's the the important

00:19:50,309 --> 00:19:55,890
part about listening in my view is

00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:57,480
clarifying that you have understood the

00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:00,450
message someone is trying to give you

00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:02,160
and then giving them a sense of feedback

00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,500
and reassurance that they've been

00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,720
understood and reformulating that back

00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,910
in a way which is not just repeating

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,980
exactly what they said but showing that

00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:14,010
you've internalized it and understood it

00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:18,030
is is really important part of it that's

00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:19,410
fantastic thank you okay so we're going

00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,330
to have to wake that up again in a

00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:26,970
minute but I'm going to let you have

00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:28,410
another think about what may about how

00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:30,720
we communicate and we've talked about

00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:33,630
technology and some of the challenges of

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,580
being in person and present and having

00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:38,220
teams who are remote but what are the

00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:39,870
things that set someone apart so if you

00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:43,650
think of a great communicator what are

00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:45,090
some of the behaviours or traits that

00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:47,429
you think I mean I let you have a little

00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:50,610
chat while I get my computer back on

00:20:47,429 --> 00:20:52,679
back on the stage have another little

00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:53,760
chat maybe you've got some examples

00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:55,049
maybe you can think of great

00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,720
communicators maybe there are people

00:20:55,049 --> 00:20:59,490
maybe there are colleagues or maybe it's

00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,740
just behavior that you've you've learned

00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:04,530
to recognize okay so just have a quick

00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,860
chat well I beat my computer into

00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,860
submission

00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:11,119
[Music]

00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:25,710
[Music]

00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,289
[Music]

00:22:53,590 --> 00:23:04,360
okay what makes someone a great

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,640
communicator what do you think of with

00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:13,180
the words a great communicator do you

00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:15,520
think of star trek yeah no seriously

00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:25,090
what makes someone a great communicator

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:30,850
a storyteller yes lovely yes the

00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:34,620
possibility of listening listening to

00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,620
the person you're communicating with yes

00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:49,510
being very selective regardless of who

00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:51,760
you're talking to with a colleague or a

00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:53,290
client you want to make sure that you're

00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:55,810
coming across as clearly as possible

00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:58,600
that makes me think of another one which

00:23:55,810 --> 00:24:00,370
is choosing the right language now we're

00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,330
in Europe so I'm sure that many of you

00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:04,960
are multilingual

00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:07,450
so there's human languages and are you

00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,120
speaking in a language that you share or

00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:13,600
are you using a third language but also

00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:16,870
professional language jargon we often

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:20,380
get lack clarity when we get start using

00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:23,190
jargon lovely thank you back there and

00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,190
then with you yeah

00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:28,570
asking questions when you don't

00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:30,550
understand seeking clarity seeking

00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:33,010
understanding again I think that's part

00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:35,760
of that listening piece great thank you

00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,760
yeah

00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:01,720
beautiful I think that's the TLDR for my

00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:03,880
whole talk I love it

00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,470
so let me see if I can if I can do a

00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,860
justice I might get it back in pieces

00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:12,010
its clarity brevity without distorting

00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:16,090
what you're trying to say I'm missing

00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:20,380
one and consistency that you carry

00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:23,320
through on that your actions meet what

00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:24,970
you're saying no contradiction between

00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:26,500
what you're saying and what you're doing

00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:28,600
are the signs of a great communicator

00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:35,200
Thank You Rajesh lovely

00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:36,580
there was one yes huge massive now I

00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,090
want to have a wreath of Franklin come

00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:42,190
in respect we don't get good

00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:43,360
communication without respect a talk I

00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:46,150
gave a couple of years ago was actually

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:49,300
on constructive conflict resolution and

00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:52,060
respect and respecting your opponent is

00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:55,600
so critical so yeah even when you don't

00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:59,970
agree respect makes such a difference

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,970
yeah thank you and there was one yes

00:26:08,669 --> 00:26:13,649
that is beautiful I'm not sure I can

00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:16,279
repeat that and give it give it justice

00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:19,799
a great communicator is someone who can

00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:23,669
leave their listener feeling respected

00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:26,909
and empowered not diminished and

00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:28,230
degraded yeah lovely thank you let's say

00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:30,889
I get two more I'm loving this is

00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,889
fabulous yes

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,889
yes a great communicator make sure

00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:48,749
they're prepared and organized which

00:26:46,889 --> 00:26:51,989
gives the people who they're meeting

00:26:48,749 --> 00:26:54,599
with the sense of that the expectations

00:26:51,989 --> 00:27:06,389
will be met yet lovely thank you it's a

00:26:54,599 --> 00:27:08,879
good one yes absolutely

00:27:06,389 --> 00:27:11,099
empathy are up there with respect we

00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:13,529
don't have a song like RESP ECT on

00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:14,580
empathy but any that's actually one of

00:27:13,529 --> 00:27:17,249
the worlds which I think goes to the

00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:19,679
heart of why I think listening is the

00:27:17,249 --> 00:27:22,950
skill that we can all do to practice

00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,690
because really listening and taking the

00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:26,580
time to understand gives you the

00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:28,019
opportunity to develop empathy for what

00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:30,179
that person is saying and where they're

00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:49,129
coming from thanks Greg really good yes

00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:49,129
I would say some are

00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:57,370
some are and perhaps but not with good

00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,990
intent very great question so the

00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:00,580
comment there was agree with all of this

00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:03,520
how could I not it's all sort of

00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:05,410
probably pretty self-evident but would I

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:08,890
say a politician was a great

00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:09,910
communicator yeah hands up if you let's

00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,930
see what the audience thinks do you

00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:16,330
think politicians are great

00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:17,830
communicators some are some are there's

00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:20,020
lots of hands kind of doing the wavy

00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:22,450
thing yeah it's interesting isn't it

00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:24,220
when I was doing some of my background

00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:27,370
reading for this talk I also went

00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:30,040
looking for great communicators and I

00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:33,820
don't know you may have picked up from

00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:36,730
my accent or an Australian our former

00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:38,620
Prime Minister Julia Gillard was not

00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:40,360
generally actually a great communicator

00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:42,670
in my view in terms of getting up and

00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:45,670
speaking but she gave one cracker of a

00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:50,140
speech in Parliament called the misogyny

00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:52,240
speech and she was diabolical and the

00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:55,150
contrast with that talk where she was

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,520
delivering with passion and like

00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:59,980
off-the-cuff compared with some of the

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,330
very formal you know communication that

00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:03,250
she would do to camera and press

00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:05,740
conferences and stuff but that was

00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:11,230
really interesting and another example

00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:16,090
was actually Michelle Obama and her when

00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:17,530
they go low we go hi speech and that

00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:21,370
example was talking not about

00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:24,190
necessarily just you know a natural

00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:26,140
talent but that she had practiced but

00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:28,300
what was key about that particular

00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:30,850
speech was how tuned it was to the

00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:33,430
audience it was not just about standing

00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:35,410
up and giving a flourish of oratory like

00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:37,540
perhaps her husband was used to doing

00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:40,360
but she really connected with a lot of

00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:42,370
people and in a really sort of powerful

00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,110
way I think that was kind of interesting

00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:46,870
so this sense of what makes someone a

00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:49,120
great community communicator can vary so

00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:51,790
Julia Gillard as a politician Michelle

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,130
Obama are not really a politician but

00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:57,510
really a politician yeah interesting

00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:57,510
thank you great great comment

00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:36,450
that is very interesting I mean I'm

00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:38,130
gonna try and repeat that back part of

00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:42,630
the challenge that we have as Drupa

00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:45,630
lists is common in with what politicians

00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:47,070
that the thing we have to talk about is

00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:49,740
perhaps not something they necessarily

00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:50,850
want to listen to you know and it can

00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,920
come across as something they're not

00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:55,650
interested in and how do how do we find

00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:59,429
the way to make it relevant to them sort

00:30:55,650 --> 00:31:00,630
of okay very good thank you and of

00:30:59,429 --> 00:31:01,980
course my computer's gone to sleep again

00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:06,660
you I don't know if you noticed I was

00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:09,270
playing with my power settings and it's

00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:11,850
conspiring against me clearly need a

00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:13,590
communication kind of remediation with

00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:16,470
my computer later well we'll have a

00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:19,950
conversation so what makes a great

00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:22,530
communicator so all of these things that

00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:24,870
ability to tune into the audience I

00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:27,210
think is one of the real differentiators

00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:31,400
then I think there's just some basic

00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:33,690
skill technique stuff that people learn

00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,920
and that comes back to the stuff around

00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:36,929
stagecraft

00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:42,390
little things like I'm not kind of like

00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:44,160
where when I first so that's just

00:31:42,390 --> 00:31:45,420
technique right so there's some of that

00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,840
stuff that you can just learn and

00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:51,090
practice I've not been doing a very good

00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:54,030
job of this one today but speaking more

00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:56,790
slowly especially if you speak a

00:31:54,030 --> 00:32:00,360
different language to your audience or

00:31:56,790 --> 00:32:02,730
you have a funny accent as I do to take

00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,860
the time to speak more slowly and

00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:05,850
clearly then perhaps you would if you

00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:08,670
were just having a conversation with

00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:09,400
somebody things like that another one

00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:11,050
which I've also

00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,420
been guilty of not doing properly for

00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:15,610
this one is never look at your slides if

00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:17,440
you're giving a talk you should actually

00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:19,120
continue to look at your audience and if

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,940
you're really lucky you might have a

00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:24,310
prompt we foot a foot video but if you

00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,600
don't this is what I what I've done not

00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,540
that that's really working for me today

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,650
but hey that's a different story right

00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:31,000
so there's just some little things and

00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,870
the other one is you'll notice I'm not

00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,950
here right

00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:37,480
do you see does that seem like a

00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:40,900
difference like if I was doing this

00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:47,590
whole talk from here I you know I'm a

00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:49,660
little height challenged versus here

00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:51,520
where I can be much more engaged and

00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,810
directed with you I'm not hiding behind

00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,970
something there's not something between

00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:56,140
me and you

00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:57,490
these are little things these are things

00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,230
you can learn and lots of people can

00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:02,050
teach this stuff right but it's tough I

00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:03,790
just didn't even think about because of

00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:05,920
my theater background I just sort of

00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:07,600
took it for granted and someone said no

00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,010
there's something in there maybe it's

00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,190
something that we could remind people

00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:13,930
that hey we can learn this as

00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:16,150
technologists as Drupal ist's you know

00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:18,400
we don't necessarily think about using

00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:22,300
stuff like stagecraft using your whole

00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:24,840
stage and this one this is the only

00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:27,370
point where I've actually I'm in light

00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,870
and I can feel that but something I

00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:31,150
learnt in theatre I can feel that

00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:34,780
there's light on me here as opposed to

00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:41,980
over here up in the dark here I'd be

00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:43,180
Gollum precious humor silliness this is

00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,010
another way to connect with your

00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,330
audience you woke up there were people

00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,800
who are like completely not paying

00:33:46,330 --> 00:33:49,210
attention but now they're like oh what's

00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:54,990
going on or miss something because you

00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:58,600
laughed yeah all right so I talked about

00:33:54,990 --> 00:34:00,910
the what and I've talked a bit about the

00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:04,630
how the bit about the how I haven't

00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:06,340
spoken much about is the channels you

00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:07,890
know when I say we've got you know five

00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:10,570
generations in the workplace

00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:12,370
this vast array of preference of how

00:34:10,570 --> 00:34:15,190
people like to talk like moving from

00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:18,250
foreign to video like preferring to meet

00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:20,330
in person like having a newsletter all

00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:21,950
of these things are different channels

00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:23,600
and there's just more and more of them

00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:27,590
and it's going to be more and more of

00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:30,860
them so it was Marshall our friend

00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:33,560
Marshall McLuhan who said the medium is

00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:36,500
the message and it's never been more

00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:40,340
true the thing that you're communicating

00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:42,260
is intrigue intrinsically linked into

00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:44,630
the way you're communicating or the

00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:47,330
method that you're using never forget

00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:50,210
that make the most of it the thing you

00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:52,040
can communicate in a tweet versus the

00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:55,280
thing you communicate in a presentation

00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:57,860
like this there's a common thread but

00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:01,280
you use different words you have a

00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:04,520
different scope for for using it so the

00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,320
medium is the message and excuse me well

00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:07,520
I just step behind the curtain again and

00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,610
have another conversation with my

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,590
computer while I do that and what do you

00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:15,560
think about that how so we've talked

00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:19,280
about stuff like listening verbal

00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:20,090
nonverbal body language the channels and

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,950
all that sort of stuff

00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:24,800
can you perhaps um in your little chats

00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:27,080
think about where that's come together

00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,420
for you in a really powerful and

00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:32,270
interesting way where the medium and the

00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:36,350
message were beautifully aligned yeah

00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:39,070
well I go often have a little moment

00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:39,070
talk with my machine

00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,519
[Music]

00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:06,720
okay let's uh let's bring this home so

00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,100
let's have a cup couple of examples but

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,410
I'm also conscious there we're in the

00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:13,020
lunch one time slot and there's a lunch

00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:15,450
two time slot and if I let you go early

00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:17,940
you might get I get a head start so I'm

00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:22,230
keeping that in mind so I just want to

00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:27,720
come back to this any ideas where for

00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:30,870
how the met the the how we do it the

00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:34,560
medium come together in interesting ways

00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:47,130
in really well aligned examples when it

00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:50,100
find a couple no one had any when your

00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:53,250
wife is pregnant and she's only showing

00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:57,450
you the indicator the medium and the

00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:58,440
message are beautifully aligned very

00:38:57,450 --> 00:39:02,300
good thank you

00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:13,860
nice one that's visual that's nonverbal

00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:16,800
yeah yes the safety demonstration that

00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:19,160
air stewards give yes what a great one

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,160
it's like

00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:24,830
the medium and the message are perfectly

00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:27,100
aligned yeah a nice one I love this okay

00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,100
yes

00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:41,840
sorry asking putting your hand up yes

00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:43,220
yeah I haven't got a great one haven't

00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:47,480
thought about so that the act of putting

00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:49,220
up your hand is a message and the medium

00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,260
all in one yeah really nice

00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:53,350
okay one more I could do this all day

00:39:51,260 --> 00:40:06,380
that we don't have time

00:39:53,350 --> 00:40:12,590
going going all right so which brings me

00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:14,810
to the why we talked about the what very

00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:17,240
briefly transmitting culture the how

00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:18,740
which is where we can practice and build

00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,900
our skills in all sorts of different

00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:23,120
ways and all sorts of different you know

00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:26,150
perhaps becoming mime artists to improve

00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:29,630
our body language practicing speaking

00:40:26,150 --> 00:40:34,670
writing listening all those things but

00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:36,380
really why the why of communication why

00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:40,870
do we do it what's the point of all of

00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:44,690
this sound and fury signifying nothing

00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:47,990
so if you want to make a difference

00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:50,260
instead of making a point make sure you

00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:52,790
have a call to action

00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:55,640
very communication e buzz speak right

00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:58,430
CDA right you've got our CDA button call

00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:00,590
to action but I think this goes beyond

00:40:58,430 --> 00:41:03,670
that I think that the ultimate point of

00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:06,410
all communication is to drive

00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:09,830
transformation of some kind

00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:13,930
perhaps you're absorbing content because

00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:17,350
you want to learn so learning is the why

00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:20,810
perhaps you want to change the world

00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:24,560
perhaps you want to have a different

00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:28,130
conversation with yourself so that

00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:30,200
action what steps will you take because

00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:32,270
of a communication and with your

00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,850
thinking about your audience when you're

00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:36,640
communicating to them

00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:39,940
how do you want them to be transformed

00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:42,730
what steps will they be now empowered to

00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:44,830
take that they couldn't before what is

00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:46,350
that next step like what is the why why

00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:51,240
are we absorbing all of this information

00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:53,320
why are we ignoring so much information

00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:56,920
what is it it that makes it

00:41:53,320 --> 00:42:02,110
communication the dialogue the

00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:04,120
transformation the why this is one I

00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:07,120
don't necessarily have an answer for and

00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:09,550
there will be a different answer for

00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:12,340
every message but there has to be a

00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:14,200
reason there has to be some purpose and

00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:19,390
I'd like to say there has to be some

00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:23,140
kind of impact and action that drives

00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:25,570
the need for that communication perhaps

00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:26,550
it's a simple thing like I understand

00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:28,810
better now

00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:32,920
it doesn't necessarily have to be

00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:39,370
earth-shattering but that why really has

00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:43,960
to inform both the how and the what to

00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:49,990
really get at the heart of your why make

00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:52,900
sure you have a call to action so

00:42:49,990 --> 00:42:55,120
bringing it together distilling it down

00:42:52,900 --> 00:43:00,160
of all of the communication skills there

00:42:55,120 --> 00:43:03,220
are listening to me is the most

00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:07,420
important one the what is the listening

00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:10,120
for how is daily practice we get better

00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:12,490
at things when we practice them and do

00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:14,950
it with intention and saying I can

00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:18,070
improve on that that we do it with

00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:20,110
others we can help others get better by

00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:23,350
working with them and they say you only

00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:26,950
really learn when you teach so how do we

00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:28,660
encourage better listening and what does

00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:30,520
that really mean and I think some of the

00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,890
things that come up around claret

00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:38,020
seeking clarification asking questions

00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:41,020
building empathy daily practice to reach

00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:44,230
mastery you just keep working on it you

00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:47,720
don't settle on your plateau that well I

00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:51,960
can talk good now and battle

00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:57,180
daily practice listen and ultimately

00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:59,910
that why to have more impact if you

00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:03,450
really take the time to listen to your

00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:07,590
audience rather than expect them just to

00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:11,250
listen to you you're likely to have more

00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:14,310
impact because you'll tune your message

00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:17,420
you'll use the medium the channel more

00:44:14,310 --> 00:44:20,100
effectively because you're being

00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:22,950
audience focused we talked about user

00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:30,180
centered design I'm advocating for

00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:32,660
audience centered communication any

00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,660
questions

00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:51,720
silence thank you very much it was very

00:44:43,410 --> 00:44:53,730
clear and no questions but I do see a

00:44:51,720 --> 00:45:14,400
hand right at the back so something

00:44:53,730 --> 00:45:17,040
wasn't clear sorry yes so what is that

00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,030
what is a hard problem encountered when

00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,410
trying to improve your communication

00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:22,140
what are some of the really more

00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:23,880
challenging things well I think it's one

00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:25,830
of those ones that varies for different

00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:29,970
people so I'll use one of my own

00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:32,250
examples and I guess why I why I've

00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:34,860
chosen listening is probably a bit of

00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:36,990
personal bias as well as an extroverted

00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:38,850
kind of person I sometimes have to

00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:39,510
remind myself to sit down shut up and

00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:41,850
listen

00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:45,330
alright so that one's challenging for me

00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:49,530
sometimes but I think the hard problems

00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:51,990
are really finding the bit that

00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:53,610
interests you and I think sometimes it's

00:45:51,990 --> 00:45:56,540
harder to get better at something you're

00:45:53,610 --> 00:46:00,030
good enough at like whenever we're

00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:02,160
completely new to an area we can we can

00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:04,950
improve really quickly really easily by

00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,600
just doing some basic stuff right we can

00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:08,280
all get better at any bit of

00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,990
communication that we're currently not

00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,340
that comfortable with because you just

00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:13,440
need to do it a couple of times and you

00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:15,360
go ah that wasn't that hard after all

00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:17,340
but I think where the real challenge

00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:20,730
comes is where you step into wanting to

00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:23,310
do mastery to it to become an expert at

00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:25,920
it and I would say in some ways you can

00:46:23,310 --> 00:46:29,160
never really be an expert there's always

00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:33,110
room to grow and improve good question

00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:33,110
though yeah good one yes

00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:49,330
great question and a really hard one

00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:51,640
what do you do when the person you need

00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:54,160
to communicate with doesn't want to

00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:57,630
communicate but they're shut down and

00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:57,630
they're I've got an answer here

00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:21,010
[Music]

00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:48,440
so I'll see it I'll see if I can

00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:50,540
summarize that because I agree it's like

00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:52,160
the that the the reason for the message

00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:54,050
is really important so if they if

00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,610
they're not understanding that that this

00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:57,410
communication has a reason and it's

00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:59,210
going to be make something better you

00:47:57,410 --> 00:48:00,800
know the action that comes out of it is

00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:02,660
going to make things better then that's

00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,310
a that's a real challenge but I think

00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:06,470
one of the things I don't think we

00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:08,560
covered it is open-mindedness and how to

00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:11,450
encourage someone to take a step and

00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:13,100
unfurl those crossed arms I think

00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:14,510
there's a key in there is like making

00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:16,910
sure that they understand what the

00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:18,940
purpose of that communication is perhaps

00:48:16,910 --> 00:48:21,590
they're closed because they're afraid

00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:22,580
perhaps making sure that it's a safer

00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:24,740
space for them to have that

00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:26,390
communication in might encourage it

00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:29,420
there are so many reasons though why

00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:32,000
that where that door is down finding

00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:35,810
asking what would open the door might be

00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,950
a way forward really nice one I'll come

00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:39,950
back deal to see if there's one more

00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:42,880
because you've had a few guys any other

00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,880
thought any other question

00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:04,140
so I think this is similar to the

00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:06,930
doesn't want to communicate but a little

00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:08,850
step even further away which is they

00:49:06,930 --> 00:49:11,910
don't they don't want to come along on

00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:14,160
the same journey I guess that they have

00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:16,950
an opposite view I think that goes

00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,590
beyond communication to enter conflict

00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:22,470
resolution we've basically got

00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:23,910
oppositional perspectives and do you

00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:26,670
need to resolve it or can those

00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:30,840
different perspectives still be part of

00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:32,100
the moving forward so it's a I think

00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,120
that one's a tricky one I think that

00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,810
one's a tricky one

00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:39,540
all right I'm conscious of time I would

00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:41,730
love to have this conversation not like

00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:43,560
this but round tables and continuing on

00:49:41,730 --> 00:49:46,800
because I think we could all go on for

00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:48,780
for ages I will put the slides up

00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,490
there's some references here of

00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:55,050
different bits and pieces that I kind of

00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:56,940
tapped into as I develop the talk most

00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:59,720
importantly join us for the contribution

00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:03,180
sprints or encourage others to do so

00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:05,790
great that's happening on Friday and

00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:08,330
finally I would really have an appeal to

00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:12,300
you it's difficult to have a dialogue

00:50:08,330 --> 00:50:15,780
when there's a stage and an audience but

00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:17,760
I would really love you to give me the

00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:21,450
other side of the dialogue let me hear

00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:24,420
from you as my audience and evaluate

00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:27,660
this session I've put the short short

00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:31,110
hand in there 1882 9-node where Drupal

00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:35,150
lists right we know what nodes are if

00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:36,480
then stop drupal.org / node / 18 8 to 9

00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:40,920
got it

00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:42,660
say it with me 18 8 to 9 I want to get

00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,680
more evaluations for this session that

00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:45,690
I've ever had before

00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:48,480
and they can be terrible I don't care if

00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:49,890
they're bad but I would just love to

00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,650
hear your feedback and your ongoing

00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:55,650
thoughts what have you taken away what

00:50:52,650 --> 00:51:00,410
are going to be your action steps going

00:50:55,650 --> 00:51:00,410
forward thank you

00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:08,780
