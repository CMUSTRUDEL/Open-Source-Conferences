Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Trust in eCommerce with Amazon Pay
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	Amazon Pay gives Amazon customers a secure, trusted, and convenient way to log in and pay for their purchases on any store. Shoppers use Amazon Pay to share their profile information (name and email address) and access the shipping and payment information stored in their Amazon accounts to complete their purchases.

Commerce Guys developed and maintains the Commerce Amazon Pay module that Drupal Commerce users can install to immediately begin accepting payment via Amazon Pay. This session explains the benefits of using such a service in the context of Drupal, especially as it pertains to payment security, customer trust, and conversion.

After this session, you will understand:

The capabilities of Drupal Commerce 2.x as an eCommerce platform
How Drupal 8 / Commerce 2.x increases team productivity
The features and benefits of the Amazon Pay service itself
How Amazon Pay increases trust and security, increasing conversions
How to begin using Amazon Pay with Drupal Commerce
Where to go for help or support with either of the above

on the floor to questions equally if

00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:06,660
anyone's got a question as we go through

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:11,240
I'm very happy to take those as we run

00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,240
through the deck and I'll speak format

00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:20,670
so in short Amazon payee came into

00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,100
existence to try and address both a set

00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:25,019
of fire problems and assess and merchant

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,390
problems we need the buyer problems

00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,160
because we surveyed actual Amazon

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,840
customers and understood that the key

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,850
causes of friction that they were having

00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,960
when shopping off Amazon were that the

00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:40,200
extension of trust they were being us

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,809
who essentially provide was quite a big

00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,760
step for them and unless there were a

00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:46,829
lot of things that would I guess

00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,210
generate that trust and change that gut

00:00:46,829 --> 00:00:50,070
feeling for them that this was not a

00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,020
site to be trusted extending trust

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,660
shopping in a situation they're

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,850
encountering for the first time was a

00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,800
big ask and was a cause of friction for

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,989
them the next would be registration

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,539
process on a website and forced account

00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:06,570
creation and 86% of the people that we

00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:08,310
surveyed essentially cut that out as one

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:10,530
of the key issues and frustrations they

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,720
felt when shopping off Amazon and then

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:15,390
finally that it was just simply taking

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,490
too long to complete a purchase tied in

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,590
with the forced account creation and the

00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,590
length of time amount of fields it would

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,850
take create to finalize that purchase

00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,640
they've gone through the magical

00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:30,000
experience with wonderful content great

00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,770
product imagery really seamless user

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,450
experiences online and then suddenly

00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,950
they're confronted with this barrage of

00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,829
information fields that they need to

00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:40,500
fill out in sequential pages merchants

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:41,790
cited some slightly different problems

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,649
is you'd imagine on the other side of

00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,299
the equation one was being increasingly

00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:47,729
responsible for fraud and risk

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,470
management in other words how to convert

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,200
visitors on to their sites into new

00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:54,689
customers prevent that person actually

00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,390
just browsing online but converting

00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:59,610
in-store it's weird we often hear about

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:00,869
the inverse of that being the case but

00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,579
we found certain merchants were

00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,070
concerned that people actually would

00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:07,439
prefer to convert in-store but browse

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:11,970
online and not necessarily convert in

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,930
their store and then offering easy and

00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:15,250
frictionless checkout processes

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,230
when there's still a requirement to

00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,810
gather enough information to ship the

00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:20,620
product to that buyer and to complete

00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,280
their purchase

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:26,110
so we basically generated or created

00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,799
Amazon pay around providing trust

00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:33,220
convenience and speed and simplicity to

00:02:29,799 --> 00:02:37,180
that final part of the online execution

00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:47,230
I guess in terms of Amazon pay at a

00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:49,870
glance then so the figure that you see

00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:52,959
there is what our customer base actually

00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,310
should be it's 300 million plus Amazon

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,609
customers worldwide

00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:59,859
so far we've penetrated around 10% of

00:02:57,609 --> 00:03:01,420
those with Amazon pay so there's still a

00:02:59,859 --> 00:03:03,040
lot of work to be done but that's been

00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,049
done through organic growth through

00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,629
making Amazon pay available on sites

00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:10,620
that are not Amazon and activating new

00:03:07,629 --> 00:03:13,480
buyers from there however there is no

00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,579
there is nothing someone needs to do to

00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,680
become an Amazon pay customer other news

00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:19,299
Amazon pay for the first time if you

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,010
have an Amazon account they can use

00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:23,319
Amazon pay it's as simple as that

00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,299
of the customers that have used Amazon

00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:27,699
pay so far 50% of them are prime

00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:30,819
customers were known to transact more

00:03:27,699 --> 00:03:34,690
often and transact in greater or average

00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:35,829
or Diwali and spend more online and over

00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,079
the last year we've seen that

00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:39,849
activemerchant base grow by 120 percent

00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:44,079
so that organic growth is starting to

00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:45,699
take off the solution which Matt and I

00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:48,579
will take you through in greater detail

00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:51,669
but simply put in a nutshell is one

00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:54,010
account with your shipping addresses and

00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:55,690
your digital wallet access through one

00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:59,199
username and password which is your

00:03:55,690 --> 00:04:01,299
Amazon username and password it provides

00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,209
speedy and simple checkout 90%

00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:06,359
conversion rate we're sorry up to 90

00:04:04,209 --> 00:04:08,590
percent conversion rate I should say and

00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:10,989
checkouts that can be conducted in less

00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:15,760
than 30 seconds and it's seamless across

00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:17,799
mobile and desktop and some parts that

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,449
we often overlook here but it also can

00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:21,729
provide a customer a greater sense of

00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:26,039
assurance through the a-to-z guarantee

00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:26,039
being extended to those customers

00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:53,139
yes should we skip to the I mean we

00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:56,490
could run through sorry we just have to

00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:56,490
quick comes laughs because there was

00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:22,130
you had the URL available by chance do

00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:27,890
you know enough how many where the demo

00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:30,460
site cuz I just always have it put it up

00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,460
quite easily

00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,120
nope don't want it here

00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:14,160
I died there's no way I'll be able to

00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,160
find it quick

00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:23,420
yes

00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:52,099
quarter video so we wouldn't have to do

00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:56,900
it live because nothing ever goes well

00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:58,310
when you have to do a demo live but so

00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,590
we go through it and I'll just give a

00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:02,539
quick overview so one of the interesting

00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:05,539
things about the Amazon pay integration

00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:09,319
is it's not just a payment gateway is it

00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:14,409
does involve the whole flow so that way

00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:14,409
you can get the greater conversion rates

00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:29,000
how do I get it to

00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,830
how do you just make Safari work with

00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:42,300
does it not let you accept a bad

00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:50,430
certificate okay that's what I was going

00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:53,069
to do see it's it so as I said it takes

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:55,560
over the entire flow so it allows you to

00:07:53,069 --> 00:07:58,289
get those greater conversions because

00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,000
you're able to use the Amazon components

00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:03,919
inside your Drupal commerce site that's

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,919
why you said it needs to be dragged over

00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:13,650
so we'll go ahead real quick and we're

00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:17,039
gonna buy a let's go buy and head in buy

00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:20,569
a t-shirt or a hat that's right there

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,569
I'm gonna add it to the cart

00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:31,590
so when they come here they can see the

00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:35,969
Amazon pay and we will go ahead and log

00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:39,419
in so typically a site either allows a

00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:42,570
guest account or more times they want

00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:45,600
you to log in so you can track your your

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,800
user account and as Jem said many times

00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,649
some people aren't necessarily

00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,690
comfortable doing so so actually when

00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:53,100
we're logging in right now it's using

00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,200
like a single sign-on approach it

00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:57,360
provisions a Drupal accounts now they're

00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:00,149
actually logged into Drupal you can see

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,440
it says my account so this is one of the

00:09:00,149 --> 00:09:03,360
great things about is when they actually

00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,680
authenticate with Amazon it creates a

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,610
Drupal account that they can come back

00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:10,050
to and login to via Amazon again kind of

00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,500
gathers that trash and lowers that

00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:16,980
Garner's trust and lowers that barrier

00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:18,810
to gain more conversions so one thing to

00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:21,420
notice is that the address with address

00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:24,029
book is actually replaced by an Amazon

00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,490
widget so in Drupal commerce one to get

00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:29,550
an address book that's a module now

00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:31,350
using the Amazon using Amazon pay it's a

00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:34,080
widget rendered on their side managed on

00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,360
their side it's all tokens you know you

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:40,080
just you have an order reference token

00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,279
and Amazon says oh here's the here's a

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,660
shipping address they pick for that

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:47,580
address for that order so go continue to

00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:50,160
the next step and we're able to fetch

00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,870
that data and you can still use it with

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,680
the shipping methods and the commerce

00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:58,020
shipping module and then when we come to

00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,709
review we had the same thing with the

00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,850
wallet so reusable payment methods in

00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:05,160
Drupal commerce one you have to have

00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,779
card on file and your payment provider

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,750
your payment gateway module has to

00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:12,990
support card on file the Amazon pay you

00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:14,970
get the address book or the the wallet

00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,709
widget automatically to reuse different

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:21,029
payment methods and they can add them

00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:23,040
actually in site I believe you can yeah

00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:24,990
you can add a payment from here if

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,339
there's invalid payment handling let's

00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,020
say the card is declined you can edit

00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:29,880
the information all from within here

00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,860
they don't need to leave your site to

00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:35,029
change any information that might have

00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:35,029
been inside Amazon pay

00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:44,630
and then go through and pick a card you

00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:45,050
continue to next step and well it's all

00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,240
done

00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:51,560
so just for real quick I'm gonna log in

00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:53,180
and just kind of show what that looks

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,640
like and that is one thing too is they

00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,980
could have it where when there's login

00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:59,420
form it does embed to login you could

00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,130
actually turn off true people's

00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:04,400
registration and have your sites solely

00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:06,110
be login with Amazon and Amazon pay if

00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,030
you just want to kind of use Drupal

00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:11,480
commerce to extend your already existing

00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:14,300
like marketplace inside Amazon as a

00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:17,360
footnote this is for just Amazon pay it

00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:19,010
doesn't actually provide like Amazon

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,690
catalogues thinking that like merchants

00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:24,380
web services might do this is just for

00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:26,030
Amazon pay and when it said it kind of

00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:30,380
takes over a lot of your workflow so if

00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:34,550
I go into the settings here so general

00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:36,110
settings if the Us site doesn't support

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:39,800
the language code but if you're in the

00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:41,180
the German or the UK you can actually

00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,530
pick different languages that are

00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:46,760
available to it so that way you can

00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:49,610
localize your experience for the payment

00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,930
settings it allows asynchronous

00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,580
transactions which I thought was really

00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,500
cool there's a lot of payment gateways

00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:56,360
don't support asynchronous transactions

00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,430
very well so how that works is that

00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,800
checkout flow we went through let's say

00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,690
the card was declined we would still

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,000
complete checkout because it may take 60

00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:08,360
seconds or whatever your fraud detection

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,300
may want to have an on a decline this

00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,920
Amazon pay will alert this site

00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,150
hey the payment is declined and it

00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,010
actually sends an email telling them

00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:18,770
like please visit paid on amazon.com

00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:20,600
with their localized URL they update the

00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:22,460
payment method and then it tries to

00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,650
reauthorize the order so it has this

00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:27,080
robust workflow that's just part of a

00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:28,640
module or part of our integration which

00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,380
there's no other payment gateway that

00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:33,760
does this there's no other integration

00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:36,620
that has this kind of robust integration

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,500
and one thing we also have is order

00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,660
management so you can automatically

00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,220
capture an authorization or capture on

00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:45,500
shipment you fulfilled your order you

00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,790
marked it complete it'll capture it for

00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,399
you automatically you don't need to go

00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,829
to another you

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,389
so that's why I actually really like the

00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:53,980
Amazon pay integration especially in

00:12:52,389 --> 00:12:55,779
Drupal commerce one because it has a lot

00:12:53,980 --> 00:13:00,819
of these things that you kind of expect

00:12:55,779 --> 00:13:02,439
and it's all tied in and then there's a

00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:03,790
few other things in here but that's the

00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:05,800
general flow

00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:11,170
you've managed orders the same way you

00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:12,819
go to the payments tab but it's more so

00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:18,839
that customer experience and some of

00:13:12,819 --> 00:13:18,839
those backend things that are powerful

00:13:21,329 --> 00:13:28,709
just that that's the quick demo there

00:13:24,249 --> 00:13:28,709
how do we get back to the presentation

00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:41,170
I did it Rob did you want to go to the

00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,870
strengths or how do we go what's the

00:13:41,170 --> 00:14:04,810
next slide after that is it just so we

00:13:43,870 --> 00:14:09,310
did we can go into the house Norma just

00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:11,260
go over houses oh yeah so when we go

00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,400
through the evacuation of this part so

00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,010
it was really interesting because it

00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,570
does take over a huge part of the Drupal

00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:19,210
commerce check out if anybody here has

00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:21,220
developed for Drupal commerce one it's

00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:23,200
not like there's ways that you can

00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:25,660
customize the check out but it's not

00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:28,300
exactly easy so it provided some really

00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:31,300
interesting challenges it is powered

00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:33,070
using check out panes so you can you can

00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,700
still customize the check out and

00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:38,410
configure it as you would like it can

00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,330
work alongside your existing checkout

00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:42,370
flow so we have a lot of people that

00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:44,290
have it integrated they were able to

00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:46,660
take their existing sites and just

00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:48,040
implement it alongside of it I'm hoping

00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,260
we have a good case study out of this

00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,850
company called RiffTrax there's a huge

00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:54,400
Drupal commerce user they're a huge do

00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:56,710
Burkhardt user and I believe next week

00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,480
they're going to put it in production

00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:00,250
they Amazon pay so it'd be really great

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,690
to have them show so in this conversion

00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,270
how they implemented it with their

00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:07,570
highly custom site RiffTrax they sell

00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:09,700
Mystery Science Theater 3000 style like

00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:11,470
sound bytes and they have digital and

00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,120
physical products and they said that

00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,920
Amazon pay will help them you know

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,640
hopefully convert their existing Amazon

00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:20,470
customers and this actually this

00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:22,780
integration had a really big impact in

00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,220
Drupal commerce too because we're we

00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:26,050
were writing this as we were developing

00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,460
Drupal commerce to and along the way I

00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:29,680
was like wait we need to make this

00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:33,970
architecture change to better support

00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:35,620
integrations like this so over the week

00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:37,480
over the past week and ready for Vienna

00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,430
I worked on the Drupal commerce 8 or

00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:40,870
Drupal commerce 2 port and I actually

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,060
have a demo that I'll be giving at our

00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:46,630
booth downstairs that shows a

00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:48,130
multilingual multi domain single

00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:51,730
platform site where you can go

00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:53,650
to the dot the de Amazon pay version and

00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:56,470
it's translated into the German it takes

00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:57,670
you to the German Amazon pay merchant

00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:59,830
unless you go through the different

00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:03,610
flows and harnesses the multi-store

00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:05,290
concepts and Drupal commerce - so a lot

00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:07,750
of what we learned when developing

00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:10,180
Amazon pay went into Drupal commerce -

00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:15,700
and we'll help you get larger

00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:19,450
conversions in multiple regions yes I

00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:22,720
guess where pick up from his question of

00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:25,240
like why is this important so what it's

00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,520
great that you could have a payment

00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:29,800
solution like Amazon pay but the real

00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,230
reason why this is important is up there

00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:35,920
really it's the sixty nine point two

00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:39,270
three percent cart abandonment rate now

00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:42,340
that's not a figure that we necessarily

00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:44,200
have produced that's from a report that

00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:47,680
we ran with a company called the Bay mud

00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:50,080
Institute to a century UX specialists

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:53,340
they've done over two hundred and forty

00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:56,560
thousand hours of UX research with

00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:59,140
mostly with enterprise level customers

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,180
but also small medium businesses to mid

00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:03,100
market and across thirty seven different

00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:05,650
studies that's the cast abandonment rate

00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:09,850
they saw and the important thing here is

00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:11,589
it's not something that's fixed like it

00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:13,839
will not always be the case that we will

00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:15,550
see 69 percent abandonment rate in

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,740
e-commerce it's not something we just

00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:20,560
have to grin and bear and accept there

00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:24,640
are certain key drivers key reasons for

00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:27,280
that abandonment rate and these are some

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,530
of the ones that they pulled out now in

00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,860
terms of extra costs too high for

00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:35,440
shipping web site having errors and

00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,850
crashing or the delivery being too slow

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,000
that's not something necessary that

00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:41,650
Amazon pay can help a merchant with but

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,300
there are you know there are other

00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:45,580
Amazon businesses that may be able to do

00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,830
that such as FBA a AWS I'm not here to

00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:50,800
talk about them instead but one is that

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:53,290
we can see being addressed and in some

00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:56,970
ways these are want of a better word

00:17:53,290 --> 00:18:00,520
low-hanging fruit in terms of addressing

00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,660
checkout conversion that forced account

00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,760
creation

00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:06,340
over a third of people that is a reason

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,980
for a cut cut abandonment over a quarter

00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:13,330
people abandon carts because the process

00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:15,340
is too long or too complicated I travel

00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:18,520
every work today for my sins on the

00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:21,400
London Underground basically pressed up

00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:24,970
against the unwashed masses of London

00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,250
and as anyone that has ever gone through

00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:30,190
that can attest to a couple of things

00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:32,170
it's an unpleasant experience and in

00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:35,530
modern times everyone's on their phone

00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:38,590
often in areas that have signal about to

00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:40,300
make a purchase it's that sort of period

00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:42,310
in the day where people want to while

00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,720
away time doing some shopping and I see

00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:45,940
time and time again so I'll be shopping

00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,500
on mobile they'll even have the product

00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,780
they've got time to complete that

00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,270
checkout before they go underground and

00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:54,820
leave reception and the phone just goes

00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:56,980
back in the pocket we set them up for

00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:00,220
the goal but it's just too hard to go

00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:02,230
through that process of a guest checkout

00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:05,140
or a new account creation on their

00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:07,840
mobile the same is true of desktop or

00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:10,540
they're in a different situation

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,820
Trust is again a key driver and we'll

00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:15,640
also just touch upon that there weren't

00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:18,370
enough payment methods so I guess first

00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:20,920
looking at the top two highlighted and

00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:23,320
read the process of forced account

00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:26,050
creation and the fact that it's too long

00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,240
and complicated checkout process a

00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:30,730
couple of things I think to touch on

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:34,510
here one would be this sort of

00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:37,120
proliferation of forced account creation

00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:40,390
has seen an average in the UK at least

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:43,480
of 19 username and password combinations

00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:46,870
per user for their online shopping which

00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:49,090
is apparently beyond the cognitive reach

00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:51,010
of most of us it's certainly beyond my

00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:52,720
cognitive reach to remember those

00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:55,330
different combinations in which sites

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,210
they apply to and going back to the

00:19:55,330 --> 00:20:00,780
original slide for the customers that

00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:02,860
we've surveyed at Amazon that is a key

00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:06,960
source of frustration

00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:11,050
so as Matt touched upon from here in the

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:14,650
experience with Drupal commerce from the

00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:14,770
cart page can essentially skip through

00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,570
the

00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:19,420
check out step and jump straight into

00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:22,270
checking out for Amazon pay once the

00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:26,580
username and password have been entered

00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:30,550
and it's been authenticated with Amazon

00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:32,710
the emergent will receive that name of

00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:34,480
the customer and their email so two

00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:38,380
fields of information but the crucial

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,990
parts for a new account what their

00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,910
merchant you know gem com wishes to do

00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:46,020
with that information later is up to

00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:48,490
them it's your customer and if you need

00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:52,480
certain things like the customer's age

00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:54,460
or gender or phone number for other

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,950
parts of the account creation that can

00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:58,480
be done sequentially but the important

00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,940
thing is the account can be created

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,130
there and then even if that person

00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:06,490
decides yeah I'm going to enter my

00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:09,340
username and password and the fire alarm

00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:11,110
goes off and they don't complete the

00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:13,000
next step which is to select their

00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:16,390
shipping and payments information about

00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,550
username sorry that name and email

00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:21,820
address will still be passed new

00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:24,340
customer acquired then and this is an

00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:28,390
example of a one-page template it can be

00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:31,120
done sequentially but every shipping

00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:33,070
address and every card or payment detail

00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,740
that person's ever entered into Amazon

00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:38,320
that's eligible on this site and for

00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:41,920
that purchase will render so if Amex is

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:46,150
pressed Amex will be grayed out if that

00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:50,020
person has entered a you know a shipping

00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:53,470
address in the like I don't know Rua

00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:55,900
Tora Islands in the Cook Islands I go

00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:58,390
then and that's not place that merchant

00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,670
ships to you that will be suppressed but

00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:02,950
we're getting past here the point where

00:22:00,670 --> 00:22:05,710
that customer has been forced to enter

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:09,220
into more informational fields to

00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:11,590
complete their checkout that's important

00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:14,170
because the average amount of fields

00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:19,590
that a merchant sorry a buyer is forced

00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:21,970
to enter 14.8 fields at the moment of

00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:26,050
information just to complete their

00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:27,399
purchase here then typing in the

00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:29,440
username and pass

00:22:27,399 --> 00:22:33,629
and then the information is already

00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:36,399
stored just to be selected with one tap

00:22:33,629 --> 00:22:38,730
what does this translate see it

00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:41,289
translates to a faster checkout

00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:44,139
experience so on the left there we've

00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:46,659
got the average checkout time and that's

00:22:44,139 --> 00:22:50,289
from goods in the basket ready to

00:22:46,659 --> 00:22:52,779
checkout via either a guest checkout via

00:22:50,289 --> 00:22:55,210
the hosted checkout or via an

00:22:52,779 --> 00:22:58,299
alternative payment solution that's the

00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:00,039
industry average for all with Amazon pay

00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:04,600
we're looking at an average checkout

00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:06,070
time of 29 seconds now it probably come

00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,190
as no surprise to you all but this is

00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:12,029
kind of a strong correlation purchase

00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:15,429
purchase completion rate to time is

00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:16,749
positively correlated I don't know if

00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:18,940
anyone's ever heard of the golden hour

00:23:16,749 --> 00:23:21,940
and sorry if this is a bit of a strange

00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:23,919
analogy that the golden hour is a term

00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,169
that's used for like first responders so

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,639
in a previous life I used to be in the

00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:29,799
military and we'd get drummed into us

00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:31,659
the golden hour so if someone becomes a

00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:34,740
casualty that golden hour is when you

00:23:31,659 --> 00:23:39,309
get them into a place where they can get

00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:42,129
basically beyond first aid and the

00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:43,779
faster you get them into that period

00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,850
within the golden hour the greater the

00:23:43,779 --> 00:23:49,899
chances of survival now this is a very

00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:50,710
dramatic analogy for checkouts so goes a

00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:53,169
step too far

00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:55,450
but I always think it kind of applies

00:23:53,169 --> 00:23:57,279
here we don't know what the golden

00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:59,769
period of time is is it a golden minute

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:02,139
is it Gordon thirty seconds and to be

00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:06,059
honest that golden period of time is

00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:09,639
getting forever and ever restricted as

00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:12,519
basically by our expectations go up but

00:24:09,639 --> 00:24:14,919
what we do know is that the greater the

00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:18,190
speed and the greater the simplicity of

00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:21,249
the experience the greater the chance of

00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:25,570
that purchase completion rate going up

00:24:21,249 --> 00:24:27,369
and this is not like what we want our

00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:29,249
end solution to look like we would like

00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:33,340
that time to be reduced

00:24:29,249 --> 00:24:35,320
the steps to be reduced and part of that

00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:38,139
will be in terms of looking at new ways

00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:40,360
to identify the customer and also reduce

00:24:38,139 --> 00:24:42,309
those steps to completion

00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,520
are there any questions at this point by

00:24:42,309 --> 00:24:44,520
the way

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:57,020
and so looking back again here I think

00:24:53,900 --> 00:25:01,220
we looked at forced account creation and

00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:02,780
how Amazon pay can assist with I guess a

00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,630
negating the need for forced account

00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:08,380
creation and also speed and simplicity

00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:12,080
of checkout looking at trust then and

00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:16,970
I'll touch very briefly on the there

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:23,840
weren't enough payment options so Trust

00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:26,090
is at the heart of of the Amazon my that

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,280
suppose say Amazon model so it's not

00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:30,559
just pidgin English but trust is it the

00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:33,500
sort of heart of solution that's come

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:36,380
from trying to consistently deliver on

00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:39,799
customer expectations over a number of

00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:41,600
years but it hasn't come easily and

00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:43,970
that's been a hard-fought battle from

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:47,299
selling books out of a garage in Seattle

00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:48,799
in nineteen ninety four three two you

00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:52,940
know the current position of Amazon I

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:57,830
think last year was forbes is most

00:25:52,940 --> 00:26:01,309
trusted brand and what we've seen from

00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:04,400
certain research is with the user

00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:07,520
engagement company SDL is that it takes

00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,950
around two years of continuous

00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,620
engagement with the brand to feel that

00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:15,890
strong sense of trust and then five

00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:18,169
years of continuous engagement until

00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:23,660
that starts to translate into actual

00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:26,419
uptick in the average order value so how

00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:27,950
does that information help anyone who's

00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:29,240
starting out in their own business for

00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:33,679
the first time because it's very

00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:35,900
difficult to and that trust well and

00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,940
sorry to take a step back we also see

00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:40,400
that for 78% of people they consider

00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:41,960
trust extremely or very important in

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,600
where they choose to shop from payments

00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:48,740
calm so what we're looking to try and

00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:51,380
achieve with Amazon paid is essentially

00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:54,710
taking the trust that's been built in

00:26:51,380 --> 00:27:00,140
Amazon over period of over 20 years now

00:26:54,710 --> 00:27:01,340
25 years almost and implant that onto a

00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:04,280
person's site for the

00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:06,920
time I missed the show of hands earlier

00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:09,290
but who kind of develops ecommerce sites

00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:13,430
or is an e-commerce merchant in the room

00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:16,850
and I take it for you then it's nothing

00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:20,570
new to put some trust symbols on to a

00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:25,040
site so Komodo or and you know even an

00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:27,170
ssl certificate or Norton AntiVirus we

00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:29,150
want to position Amazon pay as that sort

00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:32,210
of trust symbol certainly in the

00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:34,840
checkout site we find that users tend to

00:27:32,210 --> 00:27:37,220
react more with gut than with logic and

00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:41,000
sometimes we can see a bit of a

00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:43,550
confirmation bias within the industry

00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:45,980
for both Amazon pay but also with

00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:48,560
merchants with developers we know that

00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:50,750
your sites are secure we know that some

00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:55,840
of the solutions you're using to make

00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:58,940
that site very secure best-in-class the

00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,680
average buyer transacting online doesn't

00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,470
know this and they don't have the same

00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:05,180
level of technical sophistication but

00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:06,590
they know what they like and they know

00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:08,720
what they're familiar with and they know

00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:15,680
what they trust and that can come down

00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:18,020
to certain I guess like almost

00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:20,180
intangible things but like the look and

00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:22,820
feel of a site and how trustworthy does

00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:27,650
it feel you could see certain sites

00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:30,290
where you know every part of the payment

00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:32,750
information and the address is just in

00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:35,090
the same field it looks all the same

00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:37,610
even though the actual value of that

00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:39,230
information and the level of security

00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:42,170
that would need to be provided to that

00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:44,900
information is vastly different my

00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:47,240
middle name looks exactly the same when

00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:51,320
I have to fill that out as does you know

00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:57,410
the county I live in as match or credit

00:28:51,320 --> 00:29:00,560
card number and the you know the expiry

00:28:57,410 --> 00:29:02,150
date on that card sites that sort of

00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:04,370
present that information in a slightly

00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:07,490
different field that as trivial as it

00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:09,590
sounds but is maybe bordered by a

00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:13,070
different color can give people a

00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:14,570
feeling that that site has you know is

00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:15,020
treating that data in a different way

00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:19,340
that we

00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:21,800
be more secure we want to extend Amazon

00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:24,350
pay as I said as a trust symbol on to

00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,240
people's sites to increase that level of

00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:29,060
trust that they feel engaging in that

00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,800
brand for the first time that's a I

00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:33,230
guess part of the value proposition for

00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:35,240
small to medium-sized businesses and

00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:38,510
we've seen good results with that we a

00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:40,250
couple of quotes up there from sue

00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:42,350
Taggart the digital marketing manager

00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:44,540
it's so you can sleep a sort of UK

00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:47,870
merchants dealing in very luxurious bath

00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:49,550
in products but she noted that Amazon

00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:52,180
synonymous with shopping online and

00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:54,470
that's basically seeing that Amazon logo

00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:55,880
immediately creates that feeling of

00:29:54,470 --> 00:29:57,890
trust in the sight of something it

00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,780
resonates with brands and I don't know

00:29:57,890 --> 00:30:02,690
if anyone's ever encountered see blip

00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:05,800
drinks but they're kind of a UK startup

00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:08,900
in going for a couple years now selling

00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,970
non-alcoholic gin which sounds strange

00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:13,040
and an oxymoron but it's actually quite

00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:15,140
delicious if you ever the designated

00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:17,810
driver you just want a adult drink for

00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:20,300
the night but when their site started

00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:22,520
even though the brand itself now

00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:25,010
features in many restaurants initially

00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,720
it think it's partnered with the top

00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:28,490
hundred michelin-starred restaurants in

00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,350
the world now to provide seed lip drinks

00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:33,350
to them but actually to the average

00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:35,720
buyer online it's a new brand and they

00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:37,940
saw that basically having that trusted

00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,890
source that people already know was

00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:44,560
helping them to drive new customer

00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:47,480
acquisition and an increase in sales and

00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:49,340
so just going back one step as well the

00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:53,270
final point that there weren't enough

00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:55,580
payment methods now this can be slightly

00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:58,670
misleading and I think this should be

00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:02,780
Kavi acid if you're selling something

00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:05,270
that can only be found on that site and

00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:09,040
is the best in class in the world and is

00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:12,500
unique to your site in your product line

00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:14,810
then a buyer will pretty much crawl over

00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:17,420
broken glass to purchase that no matter

00:31:14,810 --> 00:31:19,280
how many metaphorical barriers are put

00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,410
in their place they will find a way to

00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:24,560
complete that checkout can purchase that

00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:26,720
product in reality there's always

00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,990
another option online there's always

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,360
someone else

00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:34,440
selling something similar if not the

00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:37,290
same product in their own shop and been

00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,630
best-in-class in terms of providing a

00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:41,460
convenient user experience for the

00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:46,440
merchants while they're on your site is

00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:49,200
a key point to to making sure they

00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,180
convert while on your site now in terms

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,990
of not offering enough payment options

00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:56,940
what this study by Bernard kind of threw

00:31:54,990 --> 00:32:00,900
out was that there's a real particular

00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:03,950
subset of customers who prefer to see

00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:06,090
certain third party so to speak or

00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:09,060
tentative payment solutions such as

00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:10,380
Amazon pay such as PayPal or Apple pay

00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:14,160
or Android pay and these are

00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:16,010
international buyers now certainly where

00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,790
I'm working at the moment in the UK

00:32:16,010 --> 00:32:20,880
internationalization is a big focus

00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:23,280
given a backdrop of political

00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,360
uncertainty and certainly people want to

00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:32,070
make sure that their brands are able to

00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:34,050
you know trade and sell across

00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:36,210
international boundaries and I expect

00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:39,120
that's the same for merchants within the

00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:42,330
US within the rest of Europe as well and

00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,520
the subsets of buyers to whom there not

00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:47,040
be enough payment methods available

00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:49,470
really counts is international buyers so

00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:52,170
people buying off their home nation of

00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:53,790
site it's again touching upon that trust

00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:55,650
symbol I've seen a sort of

00:32:53,790 --> 00:32:58,770
internationally recognized brand on a

00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:01,310
site and there's a greater part of this

00:32:58,770 --> 00:33:05,310
in terms of the convenience for that

00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:07,890
purchaser if I'm purchasing something

00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:11,070
from a site that I've not engaged with

00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:13,020
before I really want it I'm trying to

00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:15,660
think of an example now you know I want

00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:19,920
to get this beautiful jacket that I've

00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:22,610
seen from Italy now my foreign language

00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:26,370
skills are dire at best

00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:28,490
and they're not going to be necessarily

00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:30,660
improved by having to go through a

00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:33,690
process of going through a returns

00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:36,330
policy or refunds policy in a different

00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:39,330
language so we're having international

00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:39,960
payment methods that can be localized in

00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:41,720
multi-language

00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,980
really

00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,870
addresses a by a pain point is for those

00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,850
buyers by an internationally we want

00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:50,010
that trust symbol but they also want the

00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:51,540
convenience of if something goes wrong I

00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:54,600
know I can deal with that

00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:58,590
payment method not necessarily the

00:33:54,600 --> 00:34:00,630
merchants themselves so if I'm buying

00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:02,940
this Italian jacket and I know I can

00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:04,770
purchase with Amazon pay I know if the

00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,940
goods don't arrive in time if they don't

00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:08,730
arrive in the condition they were

00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:12,090
described to I will be able to get my

00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:14,100
money back and that payment solution

00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:16,500
will act as that middleman with the

00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:19,740
merchant rather than me having to go to

00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:21,540
someone who you know he's in a different

00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:24,120
location to myself different country

00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:26,490
potentially different regulations around

00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:31,380
returns policies and certainly a

00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:37,020
potential language barrier that any

00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:38,550
questions so one final thing that I

00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:42,390
think can be overlooked sometimes

00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:43,800
because we focus on by atrocities part

00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:47,790
of these that he should we've tried to

00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:52,409
make sure it's trustworthy for merchants

00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:54,470
as customer as well sort of account

00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:57,660
management team will often complain that

00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:59,190
one of the headwinds you can face is

00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:02,040
such as the retailers will have

00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:04,680
sometimes mixed feelings towards Amazon

00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:06,210
and that by having amazon pay on their

00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:09,150
side there would be a concern that this

00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:11,940
is i guess some form of digital Trojan

00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:14,070
horse that's there to harvest data from

00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:17,750
their site feed it back into Amazon and

00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:17,750
run everyone out of business so that

00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:23,220
that like feeling of mistrust would not

00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:24,390
I think be negated by me just saying

00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:27,720
that's not the case

00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:30,000
so what we've done is basically coded it

00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:32,730
into our solutions so the information

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,570
that will be passed to Amazon or Amazon

00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:38,910
pay is simply the order value well and

00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:41,490
also the time of the execution but no

00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:44,040
product line information is passed

00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:47,250
so what's actually being sold we don't

00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:49,740
know obviously unless it's a single

00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:52,500
product site and then that would be

00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:54,690
fairly obvious but we don't have an

00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,670
interest necessarily info

00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:59,040
that product information we just want to

00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:01,530
facilitate the buyer and the merchant

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,569
making that transaction instead what the

00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:05,280
customer receives as in the merchant

00:36:03,569 --> 00:36:07,500
will be the customer name email address

00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,770
the telephone number shipping address

00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,630
billing address payment confirmation

00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:16,230
these are the main lines of information

00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:18,180
there's I think another 17 16 and 17

00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:22,079
information fields it can be passed as

00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:24,839
part of the product now that's basically

00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:27,810
coded in within the solution it's also

00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:30,210
within our terms as well so we don't

00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:33,500
share data and I guess the final thing

00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:36,839
that I'd say on this is it would also be

00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:40,619
business suicide for Amazon to and

00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:43,140
Amazon pay to act in that way over 60%

00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:45,210
of Amazon's revenues now come from

00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:49,829
outside of retail the majority of which

00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:52,770
come from services so if one subset of

00:36:49,829 --> 00:36:56,790
Amazon started corroding that trust in

00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:58,920
Amazon is in a rural organization that

00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:01,589
would be the equivalent of just taking a

00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:06,500
shotgun to your own foot and pressing

00:37:01,589 --> 00:37:10,349
the trigger and 40% of all e-commerce is

00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:13,770
in some ways traced back now to AWS as

00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:17,790
well so if we were to do that there

00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:19,589
would probably be a more you know a more

00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:22,530
efficient way of doing it via AWS but

00:37:19,589 --> 00:37:24,319
that's not the case in like many

00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:30,000
hundreds thousands brands or companies

00:37:24,319 --> 00:37:32,069
already trust AWS so I'll just turn now

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,589
to a couple of case studies and then

00:37:32,069 --> 00:37:37,440
we'll see open up for questions or if

00:37:34,589 --> 00:37:39,569
you have anything more we'd like for the

00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,010
order when we create the order reference

00:37:39,569 --> 00:37:43,589
what happens in that check out is the

00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:45,210
widgets then say here's your ID you know

00:37:43,589 --> 00:37:49,079
this is the ID you can talk to Amazon

00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:51,440
with - no merchant information which the

00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:54,720
UK you get payment right you get billion

00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:57,630
right away or after payment and then in

00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,450
the US you don't get any but all you

00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:02,339
pass is the order value and currency and

00:38:00,450 --> 00:38:04,859
then like when it was created you're the

00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:06,150
store it was for it's like in Drupal

00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:08,220
commerce - you can actually send that

00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,339
different store label like the name of

00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,380
the

00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:13,049
store but that's it there is no line

00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:15,329
item data there's no how much in tax

00:38:13,049 --> 00:38:17,519
that should be sent it's just this much

00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:19,880
and that much convened whatever percent

00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:22,170
of shipping charges taxes promotions

00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:24,299
whatever it's not known like we just

00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:25,650
send that flat amount so that is one

00:38:24,299 --> 00:38:28,019
thing that's nice tubes we don't have to

00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:33,569
calculate all that and set and replicate

00:38:28,019 --> 00:38:34,859
all that data impassable so yeah a

00:38:33,569 --> 00:38:36,359
couple of case studies now what the

00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:39,059
first ones he'd lip who I mentioned

00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:40,589
earlier and as I mentioned is it's a bit

00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:43,109
unfair to call them a start that they're

00:38:40,589 --> 00:38:44,880
becoming quite well established but in

00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:49,259
many ways they're still online at least

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:51,930
a you know a small growing business and

00:38:49,259 --> 00:38:54,749
the key things really that we look to

00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:57,269
help them here with was the element of

00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:59,640
trust online and also a new customer

00:38:57,269 --> 00:39:03,539
acquisition and the figures here of

00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:06,630
within sixty percent six months of going

00:39:03,539 --> 00:39:08,880
live with Amazon pay we saw starts with

00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:10,829
the thirty percent of increase in

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:15,349
conversion and that's an increase in

00:39:10,829 --> 00:39:18,359
conversion versus their native checkout

00:39:15,349 --> 00:39:21,359
the only alternative payment option they

00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:22,950
have is Amazon pay so it rates well in

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:26,519
terms of conversion versus their need to

00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:30,420
check out and it quickly assumed 50% car

00:39:26,519 --> 00:39:32,640
share as well and what we believe the

00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:34,769
case the reason for that is because it

00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,650
was a relatively nascent business in a

00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:40,019
small business so the cart share

00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:41,309
naturally would go to a solution or a

00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:42,900
payment option that people were more

00:39:41,309 --> 00:39:46,049
familiar with on a site that they were

00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:47,759
unfamiliar with the reduction in

00:39:46,049 --> 00:39:50,549
checkout time with sixty percent and

00:39:47,759 --> 00:39:52,589
again that's correlated in many ways to

00:39:50,549 --> 00:39:53,910
the increasing conversion and one thing

00:39:52,589 --> 00:39:56,430
that I really like about this and it's

00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:58,289
worth touching upon now in light of the

00:39:56,430 --> 00:40:01,369
Drupal commerce integration is it took

00:39:58,289 --> 00:40:04,979
them 15 minutes to you implement so with

00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:06,809
Drupal commerce we will hopefully very

00:40:04,979 --> 00:40:09,479
soon be bundled into the commerce

00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:11,420
kickstart which will correct me if I'm

00:40:09,479 --> 00:40:14,130
wrong but like it eliminated a lot of

00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:17,219
friction in terms of implementation and

00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:20,069
I said anything the solution in terms of

00:40:17,219 --> 00:40:21,540
a plug-in solution to repel commerce has

00:40:20,069 --> 00:40:23,610
designed

00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:26,850
a lot of the friction out of information

00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:27,990
to get set up in Drupal commerce one for

00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:29,580
Drupal seven you know you download the

00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:32,280
module and we hook into the library's

00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:33,750
module and you download the SDK so that

00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:36,090
takes some time because there's no way

00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:37,440
to automate that process really so you

00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:39,360
know let's say that's 10 minutes to

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:40,830
download that you install it and you

00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:43,530
plug in your merchant details it'd

00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:45,870
probably take more time to copy over

00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:47,700
your details from your seller central

00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:50,310
account into the Drupal commerce store

00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:52,440
but you do that and you're done

00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:54,960
and Drupal 8 it's even easier because of

00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,520
composer you literally could start with

00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:59,460
a blank Drupal site run composer

00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:02,280
required Drupal / the module name and it

00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:04,410
will download the module the SDK and

00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:06,810
commerce itself and in ten minutes

00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:08,580
you'll have your whole site ready so it

00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:10,530
is one that you know you don't have to

00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:15,500
manually implement it the module does

00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:15,500
you just plug in your information and go

00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:26,210
and then then a case study from

00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:28,140
AllSaints

00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:29,670
what we would consider like an

00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:32,580
enterprise level brand with an

00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:34,860
international footprint so the trust

00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:37,950
element for AllSaints maybe he was less

00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:41,940
important they're very well established

00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:44,130
certain in the UK the u.s. they you know

00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:46,260
both their online shopping experience

00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:48,210
and their checkout was already pretty

00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:50,010
well optimized but what we saw was

00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:52,260
really through providing that speed and

00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:54,480
convenience of checkout some pretty

00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:57,270
compelling results so again there was a

00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,610
34% increase in conversion this time for

00:41:57,270 --> 00:42:01,830
a 24% cart share and as I mentioned the

00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:03,860
sort of fact that the site was already

00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:07,290
well established we believe kind of

00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:11,400
provides slightly a glass ceiling in

00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:13,470
terms of eventual cart share but as

00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,410
they're already customers set up with

00:42:13,470 --> 00:42:18,720
accounts on also and so would be happy

00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:22,200
to consider continued transacting with

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,210
those it did see a 15% higher average

00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:27,900
order value however so customers that

00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:29,910
were checking out with Amazon pay we're

00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:32,430
going to spend 15% more on average than

00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:34,170
those using the native checkout now

00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,830
there's a number of different drivers

00:42:34,170 --> 00:42:37,170
for this

00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:40,830
one that we believe is potentially

00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:42,540
because of the sort of disproportionate

00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:46,790
amount of Amazon pay users who are also

00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:49,440
prime users so Prime users tend to be

00:42:46,790 --> 00:42:51,600
more affluent than average and as I

00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,280
mentioned earlier more frequent

00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,810
purchases online and when they purchase

00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:01,970
online they also tend to spend more

00:42:54,810 --> 00:43:04,950
online and also the fact that if it's a

00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:06,900
quick and convenient checkout and you

00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:09,830
know that's going to be the case you can

00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:13,440
free up more time for your shopping and

00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:15,690
purchases and browsing which can lead to

00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:18,030
more items getting into the cart itself

00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:20,360
and then a seventy percent reduced

00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:23,280
checkout time from what was already a

00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:28,380
fairly well optimized checkout for all

00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:30,450
things so thank you very much for

00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:32,820
bearing with us well we had a few

00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:35,460
technical issues the start of the

00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:37,140
presentation this has given me exactly

00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:39,600
the case I need to go back to work with

00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:44,670
to get them to give me a Macbook rather

00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:46,920
than this antiquated laptop very happy

00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:49,980
to take questions now I just a sort of

00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:52,410
final I guess note for myself like is

00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:55,710
Amazon pay we're not newcomers to

00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:58,140
e-commerce by any stretch of the

00:43:55,710 --> 00:44:00,510
imagination but we are getting to know

00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:04,050
Drupal and the Drupal community in

00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:05,910
Drupal commerce more so very happy to

00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:08,190
speak to you all I'll be on the booth

00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:10,410
for the rest of the week co-located with

00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:11,630
commerce guys and be great to understand

00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:15,000
more about sort of businesses that

00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:16,380
you're involved in at the moment what

00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,390
customer pain points you're looking to

00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:21,000
solve and you know looking at how we can

00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:24,200
work together in the future as well but

00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,200
but he's any questions

00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:34,680
not having a few things I can add so at

00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,820
the booth we will be doing a demo and I

00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,840
have it set up I have a local

00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:38,910
environment so I don't have to worry

00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,380
about the Wi-Fi crashing well I can't

00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:43,380
talk to Amazon if the white flight

00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:45,900
crashes but it's a Drupal commerce 2

00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:48,120
site that has multiple stores in it and

00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,560
it's one domain one site in the current

00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:52,560
domain you're on controls the active

00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:54,630
store and translation which relates to a

00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:57,210
specific seller account so let's say

00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:59,310
that you do you have a your based in the

00:44:57,210 --> 00:45:01,650
UK but you also have a German store save

00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:04,350
a German merchant account you go to the

00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:06,570
web site without a domain prefix and it

00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:09,800
seems this is the main site that this is

00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:12,840
the UK store uses the UK seller central

00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:14,580
when they get to the German site it will

00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:17,970
be in the German translation and it will

00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:20,670
be localized and have your German Amazon

00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:22,920
pay account setup with also that

00:45:20,670 --> 00:45:24,420
localization so that's the demo I have

00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,770
to kind of go through it so we can show

00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:28,410
off these new features in Drupal

00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:30,570
commerce too and also how the Amazon pay

00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:32,190
integration works where it shows you

00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:34,350
know you can it's one account it's still

00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:35,850
the one account inside Drupal but they

00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:37,740
sign up for the different channels so

00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:39,450
one interesting thing you brought up

00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:41,700
when somebody logs in and they didn't

00:45:39,450 --> 00:45:43,580
convert you have their information so

00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:46,080
you can send them an email and say hey

00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:48,210
why don't you know did we make you upset

00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:50,850
you didn't finish your order like what

00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:52,560
could we do for you which is crucial a

00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:55,080
lot of time with cart abandonment there

00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,390
is no way to reach out to them so that

00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:59,310
is a huge step and one thing that we're

00:45:57,390 --> 00:46:01,380
really looking to do in the next with

00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:03,510
this new version of Drupal commerce 2 is

00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:06,240
be more opinionated and give best advice

00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:08,070
in e-commerce which I really think our

00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,720
partnership with Amazon pay is doing

00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:11,190
that because with building this

00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:12,450
integration we're also learning and

00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:13,890
we're also able to take those best

00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:15,810
practices and build them into this

00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:17,880
platform as well and deepen our

00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:20,880
integration with Amazon pay so it's a

00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:23,180
really good mutual relationship in that

00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,180
effect

00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:37,619
thank you

00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:37,619
