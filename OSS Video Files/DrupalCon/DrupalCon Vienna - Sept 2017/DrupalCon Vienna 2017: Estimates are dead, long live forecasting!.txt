Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Estimates are dead, long live forecasting!
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	In May 2013 at Drupal Camp Dublin I gave a presentation titled "The lost art of estimation" it outlined some approaches and methods which I hoped would aid in everyone getting better, more accurate estimates. You could be forgiven for thinking that the naming of this session means I've changed my mind about estimates but, I still believe they're valid... in the right situation. The trouble tends to be with how estimates are used and as the figures we produce will always be used in a particular way, we should make sure to provide sufficient supporting information whenever figures are in the wild.

In this session, I'll outline the issues with using estimates, averages and other single-figure predictions and then walk-through an alternative approach using probabilities and Monte Carlo Simulations.

You do not need to be a mathematician to attend this session, everyone will come away with an understanding of:

How estimates can give a false picture for a project.
The cognitive bias involved during an estimation process.
What data, at minimum, should be captured.
When to run forecasts.
How to communicate probabilities.
Whilst this session will show the benefits and potential of forecasting, a subsequent BoF/Workshop has been proposed to allow everyone to be guided through their first use of the available Open Source tools.

all set okay

00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,500
morning everyone

00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:12,750
firstly I'd like to thank you all for

00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:18,109
coming along to my session my name is

00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:20,340
Mike King I've got a bit of a cough I'm

00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:22,080
depending on where you work and who you

00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,430
are and what you do I could be called a

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,140
project manager a product manager a

00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,710
delivery manager or something along

00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:30,630
those lines

00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,590
effectively what I try and do is make

00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:39,000
sure that the end user gets a loveable

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:42,890
product I've been working in the web

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,989
industries for well since about 1995

00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:48,059
managing projects and teams since about

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:53,699
the year 2000 so I've been doing it for

00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:58,920
a little while wanted to initially

00:00:53,699 --> 00:01:01,320
establish what an estimate is as a

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,110
little definition for you it's a rough

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,869
calculation or judgment regarding the

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:09,540
value number quantity or extent of

00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:13,619
something now what that something is

00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,210
that you're calculating or judging it

00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,119
depends based on exactly what you're

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:21,090
doing but all in all it feels a bit

00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,380
brittle it feels like it's a guess it

00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,560
feels like something that's not really

00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,290
based on too much science and in my eyes

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,630
that's not great can I just do a quick

00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,759
stand-up poll if everyone's happy

00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,310
standing up that is to see who uses

00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,750
estimates and how they used could you

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,570
all stand up or at least put your hands

00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:41,729
up okay that's good if you're not happy

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:47,040
standing or not able to just put your

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:50,850
hands up yeah okay good so now if

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,509
everyone could leave their hands up put

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:57,240
your hand down if that wasn't an

00:01:54,509 --> 00:02:01,500
instruction put your hand down

00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:04,860
if you estimate between 0 and 50% of

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,960
your cards your features your tickets

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,360
whatever you do so somewhere between

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,569
zero and fifty percent of the stuff that

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,049
you complete in your teams or your

00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:19,219
work not many hands went down there okay

00:02:15,049 --> 00:02:20,540
okay so if you have ten things that

00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:22,879
you're doing in a day do you have to

00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:23,900
estimate all of those things to figure

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,459
out what you're going to do do you

00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:27,290
estimate none of them do you estimate

00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:29,450
some of them so I'm asking if you

00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:32,049
estimate up to five of them out of those

00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:35,510
ten then you put your hand down

00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:40,060
if you estimate so less than between

00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:44,000
zero and fifty yeah so if you estimate

00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:45,859
more than 50% of your cards your

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,840
features the work that you complete on a

00:02:45,859 --> 00:02:54,439
daily basis put your hand down that's

00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:58,129
everybody okay so what I want to try and

00:02:54,439 --> 00:03:00,829
figure out is everybody uses estimates

00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:04,069
but we need to find out why they don't

00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:05,870
always work and in my eyes they

00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:09,639
definitely don't work so they're broken

00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:12,169
I'm not the only person who thinks that

00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:13,370
another quote or a quote for you

00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:16,489
estimating tasks will slow you down

00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:18,139
don't do it and that's from someone who

00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:18,919
people might recognize called Jeff

00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:21,349
Sutherland

00:03:18,919 --> 00:03:24,470
he's the co-creator of scrum and he

00:03:21,349 --> 00:03:26,299
thinks the estimates are kind of broken

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:35,359
and they're not really good for you then

00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:37,069
I'm gonna listen as well so the the next

00:03:35,359 --> 00:03:39,109
part of this session will take into

00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:43,220
account as all good clickbait articles

00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:44,720
should a top three or top five but I

00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:48,739
couldn't fit five into the time we've

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,889
got so we go over the top three go over

00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:53,870
the top three issues for estimation

00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:55,790
they're harmful and personal and I

00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,109
apologize immediately because I said I

00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:00,470
was going to have a top three and the

00:03:57,109 --> 00:04:01,150
first one's got two points but we'll

00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,519
keep going

00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:07,250
estimates are harmful because they build

00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:11,299
a bridge back into the non agile

00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:15,650
development world so we know that in an

00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:19,009
agile situation we need to make sure

00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:21,109
that that we're working to a fixed

00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:22,830
budget and a fixed time frame and we

00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:24,970
flex our scope

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,550
estimating what we can get done in a

00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:30,460
certain amount of time takes us back to

00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:33,070
the world prior to agile or prior to

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,630
projects that we're using agile where

00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,720
we're estimating everything we're saying

00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:40,510
what will be done in that time and for

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,520
that budget that's why they're harmful

00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,650
and they're personal because in my

00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:47,980
experience a lot of the time people are

00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,630
given estimates as a fait accompli as to

00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,910
how long it will take them to do a piece

00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:55,240
of work they didn't necessarily estimate

00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:57,910
how long it would take and even if they

00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:04,510
did they didn't estimate with the right

00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:08,560
information I'm sure everyone's been in

00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:11,200
this situation where they've got let's

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,470
say it's our mythical 10 cards our 10

00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:18,460
features that have gone into the sprint

00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:21,070
or being planned for a sprint and you've

00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,590
estimated each of them and you've given

00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:25,150
them each a single figure to say this is

00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,560
how long it will take and then you add

00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,080
all those figures together and you say

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,790
this is how long this whole sprint will

00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:34,450
take or how low many things we can get

00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:36,760
done in this sprint that's great for

00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:38,650
estimation it's really good but if you

00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:42,640
look at a single figure estimate per

00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:45,810
card you find that it gives you a binary

00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:48,150
situation so if you have a feature and

00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:51,430
you say that there is one point in time

00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:54,340
up to where it's successful to be

00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:55,960
completed if it's a one-day feature and

00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,030
you say yeah ok it's going to take us

00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,229
one day to do this if you complete it in

00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:01,510
anything more than one day it's a

00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:04,120
failure if you complete it prior to that

00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:07,060
it's successful it's a binary outcome it

00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,830
feels very much like flipping a coin so

00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,180
you have a 50/50 chance whether or not

00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:14,440
your estimate is going to be achievable

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:17,260
and this issue is compounded when you

00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:19,450
add all of those together so your 50-50

00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:22,200
chance for flipping a coin completing

00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:24,400
your estimated item on time is

00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,550
compounded by the number of times you

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:30,880
add those chances together so it's a bit

00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:34,090
like instead of having to flip head once

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,830
to complete your estimate or complete

00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:39,340
your card within your estimated time

00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:41,980
you have to flip your coin ten times and

00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:44,440
get heads ten times in a row I'm not

00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,240
sure if anyone is mathematically brained

00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,310
enough to figure that the odds of that

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,460
one out but it's just over one thousand

00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:52,990
to one does that feel like something you

00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:55,030
want to stand by when you are completing

00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:56,530
a project you say yep we've got a 1,000

00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:02,350
to one odds that we will complete this

00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:05,500
on time in fact if you said to the

00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:07,510
person you were giving these numbers to

00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,610
you give them to you right now that

00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,860
there's a 50-50 chance that you might

00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:20,680
not meet the estimate would they be

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:22,870
happy and estimates most importantly for

00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,300
me in this one and it's probably the

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:31,300
simplest to illustrate estimates are

00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:35,470
incomplete they don't include such

00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:38,010
things as context switching studies

00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,390
indicate that every time we change

00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:42,250
context from one subject matter to

00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:45,250
another let's say for example changing

00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:47,110
from one feature or working on one card

00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:49,810
to working on a different one we lose

00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:53,170
approximately 25 minutes of quality

00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:54,760
working time if you're somebody working

00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:57,190
in support and I can see if you're out

00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:58,360
in the audience you may be context

00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:00,490
switching three or four times a day

00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:04,720
think of the amount of time that you're

00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:07,360
losing there and estimates don't include

00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,660
these switches so if you fill up your

00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,750
sprint if you fill up your iteration

00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:15,580
completely with cards or with features

00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,410
you won't take into account the fact

00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,710
that you're losing time every time your

00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:23,950
context switch they don't include

00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:25,510
waiting time okay I'm gonna work on this

00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:29,920
card but the person who's working on it

00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:31,720
prior to me has run over so I'm waiting

00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,590
that's lost time it's dead time it's not

00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,780
included in the estimates debugging time

00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:40,060
your estimates include some time for

00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,770
debugging a lot of time for debugging do

00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:45,270
you pad your estimate if you're padding

00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:47,830
your estimate is no longer an estimate

00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:49,660
this didn't understand the problem

00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:52,779
problems when you estimated

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:55,120
shuuyu were told it one way or you read

00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:59,110
it one way when you came to fix the

00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,069
issue or create the new product you read

00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,480
it a different way

00:09:00,069 --> 00:09:04,899
so you didn't understand the problem the

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:08,139
first time you looked at it holidays now

00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:09,910
holidays are kind of okay in a way

00:09:08,139 --> 00:09:11,680
because you can see when somebody's got

00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:13,829
leave booked but there are often times

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,420
when people need to take emergency leave

00:09:13,829 --> 00:09:19,500
that can't be included in estimates and

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,790
the time that's available in your team I

00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,040
don't know many teams who don't suffer

00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:26,379
from this problem who have urgent work

00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,149
that pops up so they're working away

00:09:26,379 --> 00:09:30,069
they have a sprint all of a sudden our

00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:32,350
sites down and apps down something's

00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:35,589
gone wrong they have to go and work on

00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:38,290
it that time is lost it's not included

00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:39,879
in your estimates broken computers this

00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,800
happens very often could be a server it

00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,240
could be someone's laptop it could be a

00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,829
development environment it could be

00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,980
anything it could be a third party API

00:09:44,829 --> 00:09:50,680
if it's broken it's not included in the

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:52,959
estimate you get the idea I think really

00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,339
technical debt something that we can't

00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,990
really judge for because we don't know

00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:57,509
every line of code and exactly what

00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:02,380
we're going to want to do with it

00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:04,360
queuing it's an interesting one that the

00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,550
more items you have waiting to complete

00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:08,769
the longer it takes to complete the item

00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:11,139
you're doing there's a whole nother

00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:12,639
session about queueing theory but the

00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:15,759
fewer things that you're being asked to

00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:17,380
do mean that you take less time because

00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,600
of the mental cueing and the mental

00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:23,160
capacity that you have to store the

00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,930
information about what you have to do

00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,189
building a release that I know some

00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:30,189
people when they're looking at

00:10:27,189 --> 00:10:32,350
iterations and looking at Sprint's do

00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:34,449
have a particular card for building a

00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,709
release maybe that's one release per

00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:38,399
sprint what if you want to do five or

00:10:35,709 --> 00:10:40,630
six what if you to do ten a day in

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:44,319
continuous integration you should have

00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:45,910
cheap releases being built but is that

00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:49,180
factored into your estimates what if one

00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:51,730
goes wrong refactoring along the same

00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:54,160
lines as technical debt at solution

00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,449
earing is one of my favorites so it's

00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,800
possible that you didn't understand the

00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:58,750
problem so now you're gonna have to sit

00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,699
down with the team and solution

00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,440
something you've got to now dig up an

00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:04,510
idea from now

00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,600
to solve this problem still within a

00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:09,070
finite amount of time

00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,450
sickness is the obvious sister of

00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,480
holidays but it is completely

00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:19,890
unpredictable and there are more but

00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:24,870
this is my list so I say don't estimate

00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:27,700
forecast let's not give single figures

00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:32,740
let's start talking about ranges of

00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:34,390
possibilities if you come to the buff

00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:36,850
tomorrow if and it was interested we can

00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:40,630
see those that graph working and create

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:42,370
your own version of that so what is a

00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:45,579
forecast will do the same treatment to

00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:47,440
this that we did to the the word

00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:52,380
estimate or an estimate the first time

00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:55,480
around already we're seeing the words

00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:59,230
calculation and prediction based on

00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,209
analysis it feels more scientific to me

00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:09,970
at least it feels like something that

00:12:01,209 --> 00:12:13,440
you might rely on so let's work through

00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:17,610
our list our clickbait article top 3 and

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,720
compare estimates to forecasting

00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:23,170
estimates we saw were harmful and

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,270
personal well forecasting is agile

00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:27,760
forecasting as we mentioned or as I

00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:29,950
mentioned earlier excludes the fact that

00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,240
you're estimating exactly what needs to

00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:33,070
be done and when it's going to be done

00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:36,160
and how long it's going to take what

00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:38,440
we're using is evidence based on the

00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:42,000
past experiences or recent experiences

00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:44,860
of the team to suggest what might happen

00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,709
so you can start giving a range to say

00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:50,829
yeah we will we're sure we can get this

00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:55,779
amount of work done but if we change the

00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:57,070
scope or if we change the level of value

00:12:55,779 --> 00:13:00,430
that we're delivering we might be able

00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:02,079
to get more done and it's evidence-based

00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:06,839
rather than being personal because we're

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,839
using recent evidence from the team

00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:12,100
estimates were binary in compound

00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:14,380
whereas forecasting is based on a

00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,670
probability it's not a promise we don't

00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,640
give people a single

00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:21,430
and say here we go that's our success or

00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,530
failure point that's our winning line we

00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:26,890
might tell them that there's an 85%

00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:29,530
chance of an outcome a bit like a

00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:31,510
weather forecast so you could say

00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:34,390
there's a 23% chance of rain

00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:37,690
you don't expect every time for there to

00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:39,790
be rain you expect there to be a 23%

00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:42,910
chance of rain so in our case we're

00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:45,730
saying an 85% chance of successfully

00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:48,720
completing the cards we have an arse

00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:51,940
print the other good thing about a

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,310
forecast in this instance is that it's

00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:57,160
updated every day so it's updated based

00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:59,140
on the evidence that we've had over the

00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,450
few days of the sprint as well as the

00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,830
previous days whereas an estimate

00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:08,380
wouldn't be updated because it would be

00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:11,500
too expensive to do so and I won't go

00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:14,440
through the list again but where as an

00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:17,890
estimate excluded all of the items on

00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:19,840
that list previously forecasting can't

00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,720
help but include them or at least

00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:25,600
includes the routes recent patterns of

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,850
them you're still going to full foul of

00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,470
a stomach bug that brings down your

00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:30,460
whole team you're never going to get

00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,590
away from that and that's not

00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:36,330
predictable at all but at least you'll

00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:36,330
be able to get closer to reality

00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:46,269
whenever I start talking to people about

00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:49,089
this one of the things that they say is

00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:50,980
well this this sounds perfect it sounds

00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:54,970
really really great but it won't work

00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:58,089
for us because we have different size

00:14:54,970 --> 00:15:00,430
cards we have we have big tasks coming

00:14:58,089 --> 00:15:02,709
through our our queue we have small

00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:05,019
tasks coming through our queue so how

00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:08,230
can you predict these things when we can

00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:11,800
we can't even predict the size of the

00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:14,019
work and my response normally is that we

00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,509
have to go back to that one of the core

00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:17,740
tenets of of agile and pretty much one

00:15:16,509 --> 00:15:23,259
of the first things I ever learned about

00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:26,160
agile about sizing cards and effectively

00:15:23,259 --> 00:15:29,199
leveling the flow of the incoming work

00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,439
it's a lean tenet heijunka as you can

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:34,509
see there if we make sure that all of

00:15:32,439 --> 00:15:36,699
third or as many of the cards as

00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:42,160
possible are of a similar size it

00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:44,680
becomes much more easy to predict and to

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,689
see the flow happening so if we level

00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,920
the flow of the work coming in it'll be

00:15:46,689 --> 00:15:53,009
more predictable going through the

00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,009
system as well as for castable

00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:02,700
whenever I go to a session I love to

00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:06,150
have a take home something that I can at

00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:09,720
least get started with if if not use

00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:11,160
straightaway and I wanted to give

00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,330
everybody here something like that who

00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:18,770
uses Fibonacci numbers in their

00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:21,990
estimates lots of hands great good stuff

00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:24,540
now Fibonacci numbers have built-in

00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,100
uncertainty so the larger the Fibonacci

00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,500
number oh here we go look we can see the

00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:31,140
numbers here there are a few numbers the

00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:33,060
larger the number the more uncertain you

00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:37,650
are because the larger the gap between

00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:40,800
the numbers that you're able to use so

00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:44,730
for example the gaps between those

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:46,740
numbers increase so what you can start

00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:49,610
doing instead of telling people that

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:52,110
okay the estimate will take eight days

00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,880
or eight units I don't know if people

00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:58,170
use story points or hours or days or

00:16:53,880 --> 00:17:00,360
whatever it really doesn't matter if you

00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:02,339
estimate eight you could say to them but

00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:05,970
if we'd make some changes we could do it

00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:07,770
in five so you give them a range of

00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:10,890
possibilities you can say it could be

00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:15,660
five between five and eight units days

00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:18,630
hours weeks whatever so that's a simple

00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,449
way to get started with forecasting if

00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:22,770
you want a more in-depth way of getting

00:17:21,449 --> 00:17:26,400
started with forecasting we've got a

00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:26,939
buff tomorrow I've got the details on

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:33,000
that in a minute

00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:34,470
so tomorrow 10:45 in gallery 13 to 14

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,290
there are a bunch of open source tools

00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:40,500
that allow you to start forecasting

00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:42,990
really really easily and very quickly so

00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:47,250
any previous evidence and you'll be able

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:49,500
to get going straightaway feedback is

00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:51,990
really important to all the speakers so

00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,030
if you would be so kind as to head to

00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:56,040
that bitly link it will take you

00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:58,200
straight to the the session page on

00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:00,000
Drupal events and if you could leave

00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,580
feedback that would be wonderful

00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,429
and also please attend the Friday

00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:08,790
sprints they're very important to

00:18:05,429 --> 00:18:13,000
keeping us where we do work where we are

00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:14,620
it's a bit of a reading list here these

00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,470
are the things though the books that

00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:22,720
I've gleaned a lot of this information

00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:25,960
from the lean side of things obviously

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:28,000
this is lean it would give you a lot

00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:30,430
more information around that efficiency

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,920
paradox how centering and focusing on

00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:35,980
the flow of work going through your

00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:37,810
business or your chain is really

00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:42,120
important and not to focus on people

00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:42,120
being 100 percent utilized all the time

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,660
okay so I should have another slide with

00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:52,150
questions but that's it so if you have

00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,890
any questions pills please feel free to

00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:55,270
step up to the microphone and please

00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,750
make sure you use the microphone for the

00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:57,750
recording

00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:12,270
[Applause]

00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:23,250
I must have given you all the

00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:26,070
information you need yes so if you have

00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:27,270
any more questions or if you want to

00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:29,520
talk about it in more detail because

00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,260
it's a bit of a different way to look at

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,179
things then the buff will be the place

00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:37,049
to do it but we have one question yeah

00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:39,510
just a little funny story I think before

00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:41,309
today I went was a taxi and I asked him

00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,809
how long would it take and he said 40

00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:45,150
minutes unless there's a traffic jam

00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:48,570
yeah I guess that would be a forecast

00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:51,240
and nothing estimate yes so he's given

00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:53,700
you a focus range absolutely it was good

00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,159
yeah because if he would have missed

00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:58,830
like that forty minutes more then he

00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:00,870
would have had the excuse already or

00:19:58,830 --> 00:20:02,280
rebuilt in the estimate that's it so if

00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:06,330
you look at something like Google Maps

00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:08,250
if you try and get a route for a or if

00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:10,409
you try and get a timing for a busy

00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:12,450
route it might give you between one and

00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:15,740
four hours because the evidence is that

00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,740
people have taken that long

00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:36,669
I think it's a really pretty good talk

00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:39,580
we also struggle with estimates I really

00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:41,230
like the idea of the range and sounds a

00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,110
really good concept I was just wondering

00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:46,419
if you had any thoughts or examples on

00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:48,760
how that's worked with clients whether

00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:51,519
they're receptive to that or yeah you

00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:54,130
know you you give them a range low

00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:56,590
medium to high and let's say it comes

00:20:54,130 --> 00:21:00,159
back at the top end how they react to

00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:02,019
that yeah I suppose it comes back to

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,610
again that that idea of talking to the

00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:07,299
client every day and updating the

00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:09,760
forecast all the time so if you've got

00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:12,549
evidence from the day previously you

00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,860
plug it into your forecast generator and

00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:16,720
you keep that information updated and

00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:18,850
you keep showing it to the client so

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,769
there's no surprises you'll never get to

00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:23,710
the end of your sprint and go we'll hang

00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:25,720
on we're at the high end because they'll

00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,730
have known that from the day or the

00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:30,070
second day of the sprint that they'll be

00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:33,010
able to see how progress is going it's a

00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:35,860
bit like velocity it's in some ways but

00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:44,279
it's it's forecast driven rather than

00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:47,049
the just immediate evidence estimate and

00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:48,279
the other one forecast yeah because they

00:21:47,049 --> 00:21:50,440
still have this idea that you have a

00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:53,529
task and this task takes some time or

00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,690
some cost and this is in the end the

00:21:53,529 --> 00:21:59,260
cost the cost of the project is like the

00:21:55,690 --> 00:22:01,539
cost of the tasks but there's sometimes

00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:03,970
there's like a cost that is not specific

00:22:01,539 --> 00:22:05,799
to a task like the refactoring sometimes

00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:10,690
doesn't belong to a specific task you

00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:12,490
could do it so it's like if you sell ice

00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,049
cream and someone could ask you how much

00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:15,639
does it cost you to make this one ice

00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:16,870
cream and of course it's a stupid

00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:19,120
question because you also have to pay

00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:22,929
like the shop and everything yeah yeah I

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:29,500
think these these items are the hidden

00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:31,600
costs percentage no no absolutely not

00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,000
because these hidden costs are included

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:38,380
in your forecast you're not looking and

00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:40,779
saying how long did it take me to do

00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:43,450
this specific card or the work on the

00:22:40,779 --> 00:22:44,450
card itself you're saying this one item

00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:48,530
of work took

00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:50,480
an amount of time to complete and that

00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:52,160
includes the fact that you had to build

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,890
a release and there was someone was off

00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:56,240
sick and yeah we had to debug some other

00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:58,270
bits and pieces so that's that's

00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,100
packaged into your forecast

00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:03,200
whereas if there's really nothing tastic

00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,540
if you have a short distance to go with

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,550
a car and you also need to refuel the

00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:09,590
car which maybe it takes a lot more time

00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:12,710
than just the short distance it's not

00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:17,780
really related to this one trip but it's

00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:19,820
still part of the yeah yeah so if we get

00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:21,500
away from the idea of cards and features

00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:25,460
then we're actually talking about

00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:27,200
delivering value so don't worry about

00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:30,910
the card worried about the value how

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,910
long did it take to deliver this value

00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:41,570
yeah I'm not a native English speaker so

00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:44,390
differentiating between estimates and

00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:46,610
forecasting I don't really see it all

00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:49,940
the estimates all the points you're

00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:53,030
making there I would put that into

00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:55,220
estimates but the the thing I'm missing

00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:58,400
from from what you're talking about here

00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:02,720
is who and what are we doing it for is

00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:05,420
it for before we do the project to to

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,510
sort of size the team we need is it for

00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:11,360
the customer ahead of time so they know

00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:14,030
roughly like an have an estimate of how

00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:19,160
much money to spend on this project is

00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:21,800
it during sprints and and I don't think

00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:24,500
we can forecast the the project ahead of

00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:27,680
time so we do need estimates and and if

00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:31,220
I if I say the project or a customer

00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:33,650
comes with a project then I mean

00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:35,120
sickness and holidays and so on I mean

00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:39,560
there are certain things that I can

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:41,990
factor in I think that it becomes more

00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,330
conceptual so it takes it away from

00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:46,809
looking at the particular features of a

00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:50,240
project

00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:51,679
and it effectively says instead of

00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,600
worrying about the detail instead of

00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,990
worrying about every single item and

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,549
estimating it you say on a whole how

00:24:56,990 --> 00:25:01,759
long does it take us to do projects

00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:04,309
projects of all sizes but most

00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:07,159
businesses work on projects of a similar

00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:10,340
size because that's where their market

00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:12,320
is if there are a small outfit maybe

00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:15,590
they're working on smaller projects yeah

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:17,450
generally yeah

00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:20,330
so we're that this is the assumption

00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:23,860
that we're saying smaller teams smaller

00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:28,129
projects or if not it's a longer project

00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:30,909
but you're you're estimating sorry with

00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:34,100
forecasts yeah I know you kill me sorry

00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:35,779
we're we're forecasting based on very

00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:40,580
little knowledge but you can't forecast

00:25:35,779 --> 00:25:43,129
based on prior experiences so without

00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:46,519
seeing what the the project is you can

00:25:43,129 --> 00:25:50,200
still guess how long it will take you

00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:52,759
can say with certainty with a 50% 70%

00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,639
85% certainty this project will be

00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:58,850
finished in 3 6 9 months I don't know

00:25:55,639 --> 00:26:01,009
what the scales are but without with

00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:03,340
just with somebody coming to you you can

00:26:01,009 --> 00:26:07,279
say a project will be done in 9 months

00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:09,169
that's your first forecast but without

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,970
calling it I mean thinking about

00:26:09,169 --> 00:26:13,190
estimates and forecasting I think like a

00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:15,289
seasoned senior project manager would

00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:17,029
probably say oh we've done this million

00:26:15,289 --> 00:26:19,250
times it'll take you six months I know

00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:22,129
exactly how this goes and you land

00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:25,610
somewhere around like five months in two

00:26:22,129 --> 00:26:27,769
weeks and six months in two weeks but

00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:29,240
for maybe an unexperienced probably

00:26:27,769 --> 00:26:30,980
meant it's super-hard

00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,200
I can only second what you're saying

00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,120
let's all go to the buff and learn about

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:40,789
forecasting especially the ones who are

00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:42,169
struggling with estimates thank you okay

00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:42,769
so no further questions and thank you

00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:43,940
very much

00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,730
and hopefully see you at the boss

00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:53,690
tomorrow

00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:53,690
