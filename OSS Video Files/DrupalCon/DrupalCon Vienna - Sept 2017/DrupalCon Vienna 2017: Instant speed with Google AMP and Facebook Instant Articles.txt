Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Instant speed with Google AMP and Facebook Instant Articles
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	As the mobile web has overtaken desktop as the primary way people access content online, the way publications design and display webpages has taken on increasing importance. Mobile is a notoriously tricky platform. Limited data plans, fickle networks, and slower processing speeds mean that website owners need to be especially conscious of how their pages are built and displayed. Especially on mobile devices, poorly designed or slow-loading pages can dramatically increase bounce rates and result in lost ad revenue.

In 2015, Facebook and Google introduced initiatives designed to improve the mobile web experience for users. Both share the goal of making content load super fast and use less data than desktop pages would. But it's not all glory: some big publishers just stepped out due to lower profits or other reasons.

By attending my session, you'll learn:

what Facebook Instant Articles and Google Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) are and how they compare;
why it would be great to implement them (pros);
why you might want to think again (cons);
which one to pick if you had to choose, and why?
Attendees will get a basic idea of the concept and how to implement it in their website. The session is platform-agnostic (I won't dive into the Drupal implementation) and it is relevant to everyone (business owners, developers, end-users and decision makers).

	00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:06,990
so hello everyone I'm glad you came in I

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,000
hope you enjoyed the lunch thanks for

00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:11,219
showing up and you know the thing is

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,929
with a with a with a room this size is

00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,690
that they're just playing you in a room

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,400
it happened to me once in Munich before

00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,740
that I spoken in a room that could fit

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:21,449
like 150 or 200 people and then about

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:23,850
400 people showed up so everyone's like

00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,130
this in there against the walls and now

00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:29,010
they decided to put me in there in the

00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:32,160
keynote room and we have like 100 people

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:35,309
for the guys and all the people in the

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:38,280
back feel free to take a seat in the

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:42,420
front then I won't be so alone like up

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:46,559
here so yeah pretty anxious I never

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:50,370
spoke to in such a big room but that

00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:53,520
being said let's go so I'm back a

00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:56,699
songstress I'm a founder co-owner of a

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,920
company in Amsterdam called Lee moon I'm

00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:00,629
a front-end developer by origin I love

00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,420
accessibility and everything related to

00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:06,030
accessibility I'm also the chair of the

00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,159
Dutch Drupal foundation founded the

00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:10,200
foundation about seven years ago and

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,689
I've been the chair since I think three

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,880
or four years now now and then I like to

00:01:12,689 --> 00:01:17,340
work on Drupal code as well I maintain a

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,590
few Drupal modules I now and then work

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,860
on Drupal core mostly accessibility

00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,650
related issues so for example for those

00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:28,320
who you are into accessibility in the

00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,030
Bartik theme there's an underline under

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,720
the links that's one of the patches I

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,759
worked on and also the language of parts

00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:39,030
Britain in the ckeditor I think it's

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:41,400
released in 8.2 it's a button that you

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,780
can use to mark a piece of text and say

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,729
what this piece of text this is not

00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,649
English but it's French or whatever so

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,420
the screen reader will pronunciation

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:53,369
prop around the piece of text in the

00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:56,430
correct accent language so I said

00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:58,799
foundry corner of Lee moon it's a Dutch

00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,180
word meaning lime green we based in

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,759
Amsterdam a five minute walk from the

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,820
Central Station and in the last five

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:09,360
five years we grew from three people to

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:10,920
14 at the moment this is our opening or

00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,930
here I have shouldn't point at the

00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,860
screen here I should point there so this

00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,460
is the opening

00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,320
for our new office 10 months ago and we

00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,140
focus on building websites that last

00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,600
that's our slow go sustainable websites

00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,810
and we want to build websites that are

00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:30,150
accessible so our websites are built

00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,730
with accessibility in mind so everyone

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,600
can use a website disregard place

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:37,860
location disability or whatever if you

00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,390
want to learn more about why we chose

00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:43,459
accessibility as a business proposition

00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:45,900
I have a session on Thursday in Schubert

00:02:43,459 --> 00:02:49,410
please attend and the session is this

00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:50,850
business talk but go go into that it is

00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:52,440
good to have a niche as a Drupal

00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,150
development agency to focus on a

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,360
specific part of the market or a

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,590
specific task and Excel in that so we're

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,530
talking about accessibility as a

00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,420
business proposition

00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,760
so recently we we build a website for a

00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,500
fight Enoch and a Enoch she's a kind

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,890
of Hank anchorman she's a talk show host

00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:15,500
on a daily talk show popular daily talk

00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:17,850
show on a ditched public public Channel

00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,450
and the website attracts about half a

00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:22,620
million unique visitors per month and

00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,299
the website won a prestigious award

00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,690
called the Dutch interactive Awards

00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:28,620
which we were thrilled to 1 and a part

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:32,670
of this project was to integrate

00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:35,730
Facebook instant articles and amp so

00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:37,350
what is it and how do they compare both

00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:39,690
techniques are used to display content

00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:42,810
on a mobile device very very fast

00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,040
Facebook instant articles it's only used

00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:46,709
on the Facebook app on your mobile

00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,480
device and I'm talking about like a

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:52,890
telephone not not an interpretor an iPad

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,500
and if you click on an article it loads

00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:57,720
like instantly really really fast and an

00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,209
accelerated mobile pages it's kind of

00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,670
similar only used within Google Chrome

00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:03,989
on a mobile device and used in the

00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:06,019
search results so if you perform a

00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:09,090
search action on Google it will display

00:04:06,019 --> 00:04:10,739
articles which are M enabled higher in

00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,680
the search results and very fast and

00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:15,690
you'll see some examples of this

00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,419
but most important speed like both

00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:21,000
techniques mainly focusing on speed this

00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:23,010
is what Google say themselves I mean

00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,300
think about it for a second if you had a

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,740
bus station and click on a link in your

00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,680
Twitter feed you wait five seconds

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,240
you wait ten you keep thinking it must

00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,759
be amazing Condit if it takes so long to

00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,650
prepare and right then you get pulled

00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,720
back into reality a full-screen

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,180
interstitial asking me to buy sunscreen

00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:41,500
please like me dialog ad set describe

00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:44,410
from the content and make the page so

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,300
small you can't even scroll in as if

00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:47,650
that was enough a bunch of competing

00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,720
analytic scripts in the background at

00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,509
party hard every second and kill your

00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,919
phone's battery or maybe the analytic

00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:55,509
scripts just want to stop the phone from

00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:00,849
suffering I put it out of its misery

00:04:55,509 --> 00:05:03,159
quickly I really don't know so speed is

00:05:00,849 --> 00:05:05,139
key and research shows that 40% of

00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:06,970
website visitors leave if a website web

00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:10,090
page isn't loading within three seconds

00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,830
and I I see that myself if I click on a

00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,150
link from Google and I'm waiting like

00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,729
one or two or three seconds I already

00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:17,620
clicked away probably recognized that as

00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:19,210
well and these slow loading times are

00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,490
often caused by an overload of assets on

00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,900
a web page like a lot of JavaScript

00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:26,919
advertisements tracking software images

00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:28,599
videos making the page load very slow so

00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:30,340
Pingdom can't comb its website so

00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:32,770
monitor time of websites and they did a

00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,419
research in back in 2015 and they

00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:35,860
launched a report with these numbers

00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:37,960
like they found out that the average

00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,560
number of HTTP requests on a single web

00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,930
page is 89 caused by average of 42

00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,259
images 21 java scripts making it an

00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:49,240
average base size of 3 megabytes and

00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:51,070
these numbers make that the page load on

00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,710
average for a single web page is 5

00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:56,080
seconds so there are a lot of pages even

00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,849
slower than 5 seconds and I think I find

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,349
his name is very shocking and this is

00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:02,440
why my companies like Facebook and

00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:05,259
Google step in with their solutions so

00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,639
how does it work but it's kind of

00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:09,219
similar that a lot of similarities both

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,870
were by prefetching content storing just

00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:13,810
the content the text and images on their

00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:15,699
own surface and they allow a specific

00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,400
set of HTML elements that you can use to

00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:20,080
build up your page because they have a

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,020
limited set of elements that they use

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,050
their full control on how they can can

00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:28,030
preload and build the page and they know

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,949
exactly which content is being displayed

00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,229
on your screen and which content is

00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:36,110
below the fold so which content they can

00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:37,729
like like lazy load when you scroll

00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:39,560
and both techniques require a specific

00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:40,820
page for Ireland both the Facebook and

00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:43,970
Google you need a specific client of

00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:47,750
your HTML page so let's have a look at

00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:50,240
Google there's a small icon on the only

00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:53,360
news item you can see this small flesh

00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,310
must cool thunderstruck icon with the

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,620
word amp next to it giving you an

00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,810
indication that this article North Korea

00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,449
accused Trump of declaring war is amp

00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:04,190
enabled and then there is a streamer

00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:06,830
carousel with with news items in this

00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,539
case all about the subject trim I

00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:12,800
couldn't find a better examples where it

00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:16,130
is and if you scroll down you can see

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,930
some some some other related items to

00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,690
shrimp I'll show you the example in a

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,370
second if you click on an item you get

00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:25,190
onto a detail page and from the detail

00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:27,260
page you can scroll through other news

00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:29,960
items around the same subject but from

00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:31,190
other sources or publishers and if you

00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,479
want to share an item you can use the

00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:34,370
sharing tools that your mobile device

00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,470
gives you so I have an Android phone for

00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:39,229
example and I can share to whatsapp and

00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:42,949
Twitter and telegram and whatnot so

00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:44,539
here's an example a Google Trump and I

00:07:42,949 --> 00:07:47,120
get some results first item is amp

00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:56,510
enabled I can see the carousel with amp

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:57,740
items these are all my terms and that's

00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,810
on Twitter integration and Wikipedia

00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:05,180
integration and then there's regular

00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:07,729
search results so and if you click on an

00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:09,139
item in the carousel loads pretty fast I

00:08:07,729 --> 00:08:13,430
was recording this on a bad connection

00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:16,430
so usually it's even faster and if you

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:19,970
scroll down you get some some some items

00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:21,560
below the article and if you click on an

00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:26,000
item you can also swipe you can see all

00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,289
these bullets on top those went fast you

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,750
can see the bullets like just under the

00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:32,779
title indicating you that you can slide

00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:35,440
to other pages or there are items around

00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,440
the same subject

00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:44,120
so for the visitor of your code for the

00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:45,650
person googling for information this is

00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,390
a really nice feature gives you a lot of

00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,830
information about this subject from

00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,010
different sources

00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:54,620
and as a publisher it's nice that Google

00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:56,660
displays like M articles on top of other

00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:59,510
search results so your amp enabled

00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:01,700
article will be highlighted and the

00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:04,700
regular search results are way down at

00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,769
the page so Facebook is kind of similar

00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,709
there you see and the the exact same

00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:11,060
icon as M plus and if you click on a

00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:13,010
detail page it will bring you to the

00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,019
bottom of the page showing you other

00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,820
articles but only articles from the same

00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:18,980
Facebook page so you won't be clicking

00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,360
you won't be sliding through to other

00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,300
publishers you stay within the same

00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:25,070
Facebook page and if you if you want to

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,410
share stuff you can only share that

00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:29,089
within Facebook so you can post a link

00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,010
to an article to facebook Messenger you

00:09:29,089 --> 00:09:33,079
can post it on your Facebook wall you

00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:34,880
can like it on Facebook but you can't

00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:40,240
share an item for example to whatsapp or

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,240
Twitter so here's an example

00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,710
of content and then we get the articles

00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:57,230
you can see the same icon so this

00:09:51,710 --> 00:10:00,380
article is enabled this one as well see

00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:02,570
it's loading really fast they offer some

00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,430
other tools as well so if you have like

00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,290
photos within the body content you can

00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:18,590
like each photo or Sherry's photo as

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:20,360
well this is very long article but all

00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:25,730
the way down you will see other articles

00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:28,460
from the same Facebook page that's kind

00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:30,800
of how we how I would do like relevant

00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:32,600
content and Drupal like related articles

00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,670
but these are not alike related they are

00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,740
just from the same Facebook page and

00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,060
they have the same like bullets on top

00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,400
that you can the gives you an indication

00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:48,710
that you can swipe but the swiping is

00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:50,960
only within the Facebook page you could

00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:57,530
see it's pre-loaded so it's really fast

00:10:50,960 --> 00:11:00,260
to navigate through these items so why

00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:02,480
would you use it right obviously speed

00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:04,640
loading times are really fast less than

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,770
a second for Facebook Google as well

00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,570
facebook says they're ten times faster

00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:10,370
and they have 20% more reads seventy

00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:12,320
percent less chance of people abandoning

00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,970
the website because of these loading

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,700
times Google is a bit slower than

00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:18,680
Facebook but still four times faster and

00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:22,040
using ten times less data than on a

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,680
regular mobile search and both have more

00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,960
control over how they can like there's a

00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:29,060
limited set but it gives you a snappy

00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,790
feeling because they have full control

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:33,620
over how they can build the page so

00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,940
here's some examples of how age what

00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,360
Facebook offers on their instant

00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:45,620
articles layout you can auto play video

00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:46,880
for example in a pretty nice way if you

00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:50,270
have images you can click on an image

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:53,200
tap on an image to zoom into the works

00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:53,200
pretty nice fullscreen

00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:00,440
and if you have like landscape photos

00:11:58,010 --> 00:12:03,170
you can also use your phone too if you

00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:08,540
tilt the phone you you like navigate

00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:10,279
through the photo and they have maps

00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,320
like interactive maps like this and I

00:12:10,279 --> 00:12:14,960
think these features are pretty hard to

00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,580
do in a mobile website but come out of

00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:20,839
the box if you use Facebook instant

00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:22,640
articles and according to Facebook like

00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:24,020
their marketing sheets as well twenty

00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,790
percent more clicks and thirty percent

00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:30,529
more shares so if it's up to Facebook

00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:32,750
start using it today but there's also

00:12:30,529 --> 00:12:34,550
some reasons not to use it because it's

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:37,610
harder to implement like tracking codes

00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:40,010
advertisements for us developers it's

00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,450
extra work usually we are used to

00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,670
building a website like responsive

00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:45,110
desktop and mobile but now we have to

00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:46,339
have another version for Google and

00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:49,430
another version for Facebook instant

00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:51,080
articles and not all html5 elements that

00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:53,600
we are used to are supported by Google

00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:55,910
or Facebook so that they both have their

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:58,820
own set of elements that you can use to

00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:01,550
communicate to display your content not

00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,839
all features are supported Drupal great

00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,430
community software if you build a

00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:06,290
community around your news articles or

00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,550
your recipes with photon comments or

00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:10,190
whatnot

00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:12,110
you can't display all these features on

00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,640
your article Facebook only allows

00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:15,740
Facebook comments for example but if you

00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,780
have comments in Drupal it's very hard I

00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:22,100
think impossible to show them on the

00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:24,770
only on the article and for now you saw

00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,540
the example of Google displaying the

00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:28,910
content the amp enabled articles on top

00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,230
of the regular search results and that

00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:32,570
might be a great reason for publishers

00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:34,370
to to enable amp but we're not sure what

00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:36,200
happens in a year or two maybe Google

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:39,230
stops displaying these articles on top

00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,810
of the search results also it's no

00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:43,459
guarantee that amp or Facebook instant

00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:45,830
articles still work in two or three

00:13:43,459 --> 00:13:47,540
years so it might take a lot of work and

00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:50,000
energy now to to implement it in the

00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:51,650
website but who knows maybe in two years

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,410
Google kills it or Facebook kills it

00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:56,180
like and it sounds ridiculous but Google

00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:59,750
Checkout is one example there we as

00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:01,550
developers cost us a lot of energy to

00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:03,350
implement Google Checkout and check-out

00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:06,140
processes in our e-commerce solutions

00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:07,610
and then Google killed it so not sure

00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:09,670
what happens with amp and Facebook and

00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:12,860
articles

00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:13,910
so let's continue a little bit more on

00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:16,730
amp what is it

00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:19,850
to start with it's open source which is

00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:21,920
nice the full source code of amp is

00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:23,720
published on github you can check the

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,330
code you can even submit pull requests

00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,240
if you want to add new plugins and it's

00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:31,400
open for other companies to use it so

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,560
for example Twitter could check the

00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:36,530
links that are shared on Twitter and see

00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,270
if their links have an amp for ient as

00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,950
well and then prefetch the amp version

00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:42,410
so if you click on a link from Twitter

00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:46,070
it will load instantly just as Google

00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:47,330
does I don't think Twitter does it at

00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:51,770
the moment but education their couse

00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:53,540
since the source code is open source so

00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,770
how would you implement this I'm not

00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,210
really diving into the Drupal

00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:59,240
implementation this is more like broad

00:14:56,210 --> 00:15:00,770
overview but for every HTML version that

00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,330
you have you you need to have a specific

00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:05,180
information as well so in Drupal this

00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:07,880
could be no - one - amp for example and

00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,950
then you have to tell Google on the HTML

00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,420
version like here is the URL of my amp

00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,220
version and on the amp version you have

00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:15,290
to tell them here's the URL of my HTML

00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:19,010
version so you can use the link tag to

00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:21,980
do so you need to add a little piece of

00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:24,140
schema.org code to explain the page to

00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:25,550
Google so you have to tell Google you're

00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,440
looking at a news article this is not a

00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,000
recipe or another piece of code that

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,930
this is a news article this is the

00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,310
headline this is the date of

00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,660
modification and this is the order in

00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,010
the publisher and there's a few other

00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:38,360
fields that you can use like a

00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:40,340
description this is basic schema.org

00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,620
really interesting stuff if you haven't

00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:46,700
checked it out do so it's pretty amazing

00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:48,650
what you can do with it if you want to

00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,240
use CSS to give your own style your

00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,040
markup on Google that's possible but

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,990
they are limited but you can only use

00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:57,350
inline CSS and there's it's limited to

00:15:53,990 --> 00:16:00,650
50k so it's a pretty small amount of C&S

00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:02,360
that is allowed to tell your articles

00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:07,160
and then you have to use the style and

00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:09,320
custom attack and it's not possible to

00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,950
AK your own JavaScript you're limited to

00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:15,230
the JavaScript Google offers you and the

00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,480
reason behind this is that they only use

00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:19,910
Java scripts that load a synchronous

00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,040
asynchronous so all the Java scripts are

00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:24,470
really optimized to load as fast as poss

00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,060
and by doing it in an acing way it's not

00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:28,460
blocking the page load so Google can

00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,630
start building the page or your device

00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,100
can start building the page without

00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:33,740
having to wait for the Java scripts to

00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,750
be loaded so this is an example of how

00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:38,060
you would embed a tweet you just add the

00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:40,220
the Twitter JavaScript that that the end

00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:43,220
project gives you and then you have an

00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:44,840
amp Twitter tag with a twitter ID so

00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,910
Google knows like I have to fetch this -

00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:50,150
it is tweet and then display it in an

00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:52,910
embed tag and they have order like

00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:55,070
JavaScript as well like Google Analytics

00:16:52,910 --> 00:17:00,040
or chrome score or well there's a lot of

00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:02,540
JavaScript like you can already use and

00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:05,600
images for example you need like

00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:07,670
specific tags for all the html5 text

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,130
that we know for example video and image

00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,870
and audio advertisements you need em for

00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:15,980
ions of these tags so this is how you

00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:18,350
would display an image we didn't amp you

00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,450
use the M image tag and the thing with

00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:22,640
amp images it's required to have a width

00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:24,650
and a height on an image which is

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,560
basically a good principle anyway we

00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:29,450
should do that always since it enables

00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,760
the browser to allocate the space needed

00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:34,160
to display the image without having to

00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,690
wait before rendering the page or seeing

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,460
the content jump when the image is

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:38,960
finally loaded so this is a good

00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,250
practice anyway to do but for Google

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,500
it's required if you don't have the

00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:46,490
width or the height attributes it won't

00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:48,290
display the image and there's a few

00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:51,290
other tags and I listed a few here so

00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:53,450
you get an idea of what's possible but

00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,920
they have a really good documentation on

00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:56,240
all the available text but you can see

00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,010
there's like facebook comments and

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:02,080
SoundCloud and there are some available

00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:04,400
integrations to add to your content page

00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,770
there's also an iframe so you can use

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:11,270
the iframe for example - to create your

00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:15,140
own advertisement if you want and if we

00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:16,880
look at Facebook apart from having your

00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:19,940
own Facebook for all of your HTML

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,970
there's also a workflow process that you

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:25,250
need to follow to kick your items on

00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:29,600
your facebook page like displaying the

00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:32,039
facebook it's the article version so

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,539
let's look a bit into that

00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:35,369
first you have to sign into Facebook

00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:37,580
obviously and enable Facebook ancient

00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:40,259
articles on a page that you maintain

00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:43,259
it's also very useful to download the

00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:45,479
Facebook page manager app which is not

00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:46,830
the Facebook app but another app that is

00:18:45,479 --> 00:18:49,529
useful if you manage Facebook pages

00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:52,229
since you can use the app to to preview

00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:55,470
all the different articles in the styles

00:18:52,229 --> 00:18:56,509
that you are going to use I'll come back

00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:59,279
to that later

00:18:56,509 --> 00:19:00,749
so then you come to a screen like this

00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,909
and you have to connect Facebook to your

00:19:00,749 --> 00:19:06,090
website so you have to have a meta tag

00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:10,470
in your HTML explaining to to Facebook

00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:12,239
which Facebook page belongs to the to

00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,460
the to the website and then you have to

00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:19,679
add some URLs like testing URL staging

00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:22,320
production and if you're gonna use the

00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,379
RSS workflow to tell Facebook about your

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,869
articles which is a one option you can

00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:29,249
tell Facebook visit the URL of RSS feed

00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:33,239
put my development articles or with my

00:19:29,249 --> 00:19:36,599
production articles there's also a way

00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:38,729
to push articles using the API so you

00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:40,200
don't need to use the RSS workflow but

00:19:38,729 --> 00:19:43,679
this is how we how we do it did it with

00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:46,830
a fennec you can create some styles if

00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:49,590
you want so they have an editor that you

00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:52,049
can use to to select colors or to set

00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:54,479
phones or to I don't know do a logo it's

00:19:52,049 --> 00:19:56,309
called the style editor and they have a

00:19:54,479 --> 00:19:58,200
preview option so you can look like on

00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:00,659
the right side how the image would look

00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,070
in this Styles indie styles for every

00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:04,379
gimmick we just needed one style with

00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,940
with the orange color but suppose you

00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:07,289
have a news website with I don't know a

00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:10,049
sports section and then a cooking

00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:11,849
section you can say to Facebook like all

00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:13,710
the sports articles I want to have green

00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:15,239
green header and for the cooking

00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,340
articles and one a purple heading or

00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:22,879
whatever you can set quote styles and

00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:25,970
whatnot so it is limited but you can do

00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:28,470
you can you can do some things with it

00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:29,729
so there's an interface with the the

00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:32,340
articles this is the development

00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:33,539
articles overview it's using it's

00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:35,159
displaying all the articles that it's

00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:40,440
fetched in our case from the development

00:20:35,159 --> 00:20:42,389
RSS feeds and one more thing here is it

00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,399
will display if one of these articles is

00:20:42,389 --> 00:20:45,900
corrupt for instance if you use an image

00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:47,970
tag instead of the specific

00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:50,430
Facebook instant articles image tag and

00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:52,350
we'll give you like warning this is an

00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:54,210
infinite article and we will not be

00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:56,370
publishing this article and you can use

00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:57,930
a small pencil to update the content in

00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:00,830
the Facebook interface changing the

00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:03,030
image tag to the correct tag for example

00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:04,890
in a production environment you won't be

00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:07,260
doing that but you can use the filament

00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:08,910
interface to debug your code and make

00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:11,700
sure the Drupal outputs the correct

00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:14,010
version and then obviously also have the

00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,420
production of a few same same interface

00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:20,700
but then you can see the status as well

00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:22,770
that the article is live and one more

00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,120
thing if you want to enable this on your

00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:27,630
Facebook page you have to go through

00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:30,720
refute you refute process so you need

00:21:27,630 --> 00:21:32,580
five articles that Facebook can review

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,790
and then it will take a few days to get

00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:38,490
feedback in my view it seems like a

00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:41,880
formality since I just added some random

00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:46,620
articles and it was published proofed

00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:48,150
upon without any issues so it's an

00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,610
example of how this article would look

00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:51,870
let's zoom in a little bit there's three

00:21:50,610 --> 00:21:53,970
things I want to highlight you have the

00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:56,850
canonical tag the link tag to point to

00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:59,340
the HTML version then you have also have

00:21:56,850 --> 00:22:01,830
the Facebook article style that you can

00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:04,620
set in this case telling Facebook to use

00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:06,630
the test article style and here's an

00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,120
example of how you would publish your

00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,470
video and with the loop attribute you

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,330
can make sure that the video will

00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:15,510
continues continue playing after it's

00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:18,960
done good loop so basically kind of

00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:21,450
similar to HTML right and then scroll

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,060
down a little bit more you see an

00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:26,010
example of time elements where you can

00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,930
tell Facebook that the public the

00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:31,650
publish date and the modification date

00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:34,080
of your article so and if you are done

00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:37,710
making of this all HTML you wrap it if

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:40,140
you want to use RSS in regular RSS item

00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:44,220
and then within the content semicolon

00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:46,200
encoders let me check here there you

00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:48,090
just wrap in in the C data you just wrap

00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,660
in the full HTML that we just saw before

00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:54,720
and this is the pretty easy way to get

00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:57,710
your content to Facebook in this project

00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,110
we did integration in custom code

00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:01,790
using the Facebook instant articles SDK

00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:04,309
it's a great software development kit

00:23:01,790 --> 00:23:06,350
that you can use for PHP it's published

00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:09,920
on github the full source code here

00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:12,080
isn't get up it's basically around three

00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,940
three elements sorry three three parts

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:16,940
of the of the code you can use the

00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:18,680
elements to render single elements HTML

00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:20,720
elements into Facebook and article

00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,420
elements so for example an image into

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,059
your acquired image tag or a video or a

00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:27,440
piece of text or block code we use the

00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:29,450
elements a lot since the website is

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,800
built around the paragraphs module and

00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,660
it's really nice if you have a quotes

00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,580
paragraph or an image paragraph or a

00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:37,970
slideshow paragraph to transform these

00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:41,240
be single pieces of content into

00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:43,400
Facebook elements if you use for example

00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:45,410
a body filled with a huge WYSIWYG field

00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,240
and the editor is allowed to enter

00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,210
images and whatnot in this WYSIWYG field

00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,980
you can use the transformer and that

00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,840
transforms a bunch of HTML into into

00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:56,900
separate Facebook into the article an

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:58,040
immense and it also contains the client

00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:03,080
and you can use the client to push

00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:05,510
articles to Facebook using the API so

00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,830
here's an example of such a how you

00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,650
would create an article with the with

00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:13,130
the SDK and in this case I just said

00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:15,860
well I won't have an insert article with

00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:18,770
a title with a subtitle and a publishing

00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:20,480
time and in the end this is just a very

00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:24,679
small one but in the end she just say

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,720
article render - doctype HTML so I think

00:24:24,679 --> 00:24:29,630
it's pretty easy to use in the SDK is

00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:33,410
pretty good so our back-end team was

00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:35,030
really happy with the way it worked so

00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:38,450
he's a nephew of some elements Facebook

00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:40,490
supports they have a few more but what

00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:42,740
you can see it's mostly elements to

00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:44,090
build up the HTML on your page is not

00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:46,070
really about integrating external

00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,570
systems like Google does it's more about

00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:51,100
we have a block world we have a caption

00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,100
we have a feedback forum etc

00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:58,220
there's a very small link on these

00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:59,659
slides I will publish my slides

00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,869
obviously after my talk and you can

00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:04,700
click all these links so what about

00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:08,869
Manas monetization how to Facebook and

00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:10,369
Google compare at wise so Facebook is

00:25:08,869 --> 00:25:12,440
basically a business partnership you as

00:25:10,369 --> 00:25:14,539
a page owner you have an agreement with

00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,889
Facebook saying well this is the way I

00:25:14,539 --> 00:25:17,600
want to publish advertisements on my

00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:19,369
page and then you can use for example

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,549
the Facebook audience network in which

00:25:19,369 --> 00:25:24,169
case Facebook takes a 30% cut or you can

00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:25,879
publish your own or advertisements put

00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:27,889
in iframes and then you can keep the

00:25:25,879 --> 00:25:32,269
revenue yourself but it's a bit more

00:25:27,889 --> 00:25:35,509
work to integrate so this is basically

00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:36,919
Facebook now for Google it's kind of

00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:38,259
comparable you can use the Adsense

00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:40,129
Network you can use your own

00:25:38,259 --> 00:25:43,249
advertisements within an iframe if you

00:25:40,129 --> 00:25:44,539
want and the reason that you have to use

00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:46,309
the iframe is if you want to have your

00:25:44,539 --> 00:25:47,389
own JavaScript you need it's the only

00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:50,389
way to get you out your own JavaScript

00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:52,759
is within this iframe and there were

00:25:50,389 --> 00:25:55,009
some major media companies reporting

00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:58,279
less income since they switched to amp

00:25:55,009 --> 00:26:01,129
on Google and they said the ads were

00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:04,039
loading slower than they used to before

00:26:01,129 --> 00:26:06,619
and they're missing income Google

00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:08,809
responded on this on these complaints

00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:10,490
saying that the advertisement companies

00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:12,950
under the the publishers weren't using

00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:14,960
the advertisements as they shoot could

00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,249
they could have done better and plus

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,610
they said they work they were going to

00:26:16,249 --> 00:26:23,330
increase to improve these the way it's

00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:25,159
displayed and they did since 2016 since

00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:28,460
last year so here's a few examples of

00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:32,779
how Google improved their they're at

00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:35,119
this place so for example the banners

00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:36,919
themselves are also loaded via amp now

00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:40,490
and on the right you will see an example

00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:42,980
of the m4s as they call it on an emperor

00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:45,049
it's enabled advertisement and you will

00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:47,860
see a difference in speed the banners

00:26:45,049 --> 00:26:47,860
are on top of the page

00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:58,869
so you can see a huge difference and you

00:26:56,619 --> 00:27:00,190
can imagine if you scroll down like I

00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:02,949
would scroll down within three seconds

00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:05,349
yet rule already be disappeared before

00:27:02,949 --> 00:27:07,329
even is loaded so the amp version is

00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:09,879
really so it within a second is pretty

00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:13,959
nice also if you click on an

00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:16,179
advertisement now there it is if you

00:27:13,959 --> 00:27:18,579
click on an advertisement the the detail

00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:21,879
page you'll end up on it's also loaded

00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:28,389
for your hand nowadays so another

00:27:21,879 --> 00:27:29,709
example if you click on link same

00:27:28,389 --> 00:27:31,929
advertisement I click it and then like

00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:34,719
within a second I have the

00:27:31,929 --> 00:27:37,059
advertisements landing page and it's

00:27:34,719 --> 00:27:41,259
obviously it's also possible to display

00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:43,649
and have content now the amp version is

00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:43,649
on the left

00:27:54,810 --> 00:28:01,140
so you can see the difference so if you

00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,420
have to choose like M Facebook instant

00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:05,280
articles and budget or time is a

00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:07,520
limitation which one would you choose

00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,600
and I find it very hard to answer

00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,610
because it really depends on your target

00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:16,680
audience and if the target audience of

00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:18,180
your clients mostly it's mostly landing

00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,930
on your web page via social shares

00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:23,400
Facebook might be beneficial but if

00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:25,800
people find your website using organic

00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,800
search Google might be very interesting

00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:30,690
since it displays the the Articles above

00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:32,640
the regular search results so for

00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:35,210
websites that are mainly around news or

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:38,520
recipes I would say amp is really useful

00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:40,740
people Google for a name of a recipe or

00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:43,410
they Google for a new subject and then

00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:46,380
it would be really nice if they come in

00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:48,570
via amp however in our case with genic

00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:50,610
they have a huge fan base and the fan

00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:53,160
base is it's interacting with Facebook a

00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:54,420
lot so they saw an increase since they

00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,420
enabled Facebook instant articles were

00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:59,070
30% more traffic to the website and less

00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:01,440
people have been abandoning the website

00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:03,090
but they hardly see any difference since

00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,740
they enabled amp and it's mainly because

00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:07,260
the content on the website is like

00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,150
opinionated deep blog posts is not

00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:12,720
really news it's not it's not something

00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:14,850
that people's Google for also Facebook

00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,800
launched a way to convert Facebook

00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:19,380
instant articles to amp like 2 or 3

00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:21,600
months ago so if you manage to get this

00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:25,110
is the Facebook insert article article

00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:26,460
using this SDK for example just like you

00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:28,890
would render it to HTML you can also

00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:30,990
render it to M making it's very easy to

00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:35,610
create a version of Facebook and article

00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:38,310
and then also create an impression but

00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:40,710
before we cheer and celebrate I think we

00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:43,560
should twin think twice if we want to do

00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:46,980
this because do we want to hand over our

00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:49,530
data to Google or Facebook people won't

00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,390
be visiting your website anymore mainly

00:29:49,530 --> 00:29:53,010
for if for example Facebook if you click

00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,150
on an article people only see these

00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:55,800
articles that are shared on your

00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:57,060
Facebook page but all the other nights

00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,580
are the course and relations that you

00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:01,440
set up in Drupal I know in the Drupal

00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,450
site you usually have like a news

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,710
article and then a sidebar maybe you

00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:05,880
have a link to the author and if you

00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,930
click the order you'll see a listing of

00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,850
all the news articles from this author

00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:11,680
on all these features you lose these and

00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:15,310
people only read the articles that you

00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:16,830
share on your Facebook page so people

00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:19,060
won't be visiting your website anymore

00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:20,980
and what about the open web and the open

00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:23,290
data that we used to these two companies

00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:26,290
now kind of creating a second web in my

00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:29,110
opinion in parallel with the open web

00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:30,580
and what does the impact for us

00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:32,740
developers do we still need to build

00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,360
websites in a few years time or should

00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:39,430
we just give our data to Google or

00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:40,780
Facebook and I don't know future will

00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:42,010
tell but I think you can do it without

00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:44,770
them

00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:46,660
the reason these two companies stood up

00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:48,310
with these these techniques and tools is

00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:51,190
because the web page that we build are

00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:52,750
very slow these numbers went from 2015 I

00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:54,940
think at the moment it might be even

00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:57,970
worse since we like to have big images

00:30:54,940 --> 00:31:02,620
big videos on our web pages and we

00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:03,660
developers are our I would say so

00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,280
correcting Li for it

00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:07,990
we use glass fibre we have huge screens

00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:11,140
to develop websites and we hardly test

00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:13,780
if a website loads on a slow device or a

00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:15,220
bad connection making these websites

00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:17,590
bigger and bigger and blow it and load

00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:19,960
it so if we look at Google and Facebook

00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:22,930
and see the rules and the tips that they

00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:24,460
have like the requirements and use these

00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:26,650
techniques to improve our own web pages

00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:29,410
by being reserved for javascript by

00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:32,110
varying resurface with CSS combining CSS

00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:34,870
into one file using a CDN to deliver

00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:36,430
your assets for example use lazy loading

00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:39,780
for images that are not being displayed

00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:42,100
above the fold and make sure the goys

00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:44,530
loading the web page within one second

00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,970
it's very achievable best software to

00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:48,250
test it and three it's not even that

00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,660
hard I think if you spent a few hours at

00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:51,790
a current web site that you built you

00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:54,610
can make it much faster within a few

00:31:51,790 --> 00:32:00,070
hours of work and you you help your

00:31:54,610 --> 00:32:01,810
clients a lot with it so it's a bit of

00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:03,490
pain yet but I would say I think we can

00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:05,830
do most of the work as Facebook and

00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:07,780
Google do ourselves as developers just

00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:11,380
look at what they're doing and their

00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:13,840
techniques and I'm not sure but my gut

00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:17,320
feeling would say be careful with

00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,850
implementing him so this is basically

00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,909
what I had to say and I would love to

00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:23,249
hear your experience is your question

00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:26,099
your opinion I'm not an expert so if you

00:32:23,249 --> 00:32:28,289
have more to tell the audience please do

00:32:26,099 --> 00:32:30,659
but step up to the microphone since this

00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:38,639
is all recorded so people at home can

00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:40,710
hear your questions and remarks hi

00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:42,479
thanks for a great talk sorry I don't

00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:44,729
have any experience to share myself but

00:32:42,479 --> 00:32:47,519
just a quick look at Drupal dogs jess is

00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:51,149
at least three modules there's an amp

00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:53,279
module a simple M and an amp theme do

00:32:51,149 --> 00:32:55,950
you have anything to say about how they

00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:58,169
support this and they sure if you could

00:32:55,950 --> 00:33:00,840
and the sound is a bit soft on the

00:32:58,169 --> 00:33:02,249
microphone so the question is there are

00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:04,340
a lot of Drupal modules and themes

00:33:02,249 --> 00:33:08,220
already available and what's my

00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:10,889
experience right so during the FAQ neg

00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:14,099
website we tested the both the Facebook

00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:17,129
and the amp modules and if you have a

00:33:14,099 --> 00:33:19,769
basic website or just Drupal core with

00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:21,269
some fields it works pretty good within

00:33:19,769 --> 00:33:23,629
a few minutes you have up and running

00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:25,889
however the website that we've built is

00:33:23,629 --> 00:33:28,919
usually built around paragraphs for

00:33:25,889 --> 00:33:31,289
example filled collections and it wasn't

00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:33,269
possible to implement paragraphs there

00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:35,009
is an issue for it might might be in

00:33:33,269 --> 00:33:37,950
future but we couldn't we couldn't use

00:33:35,009 --> 00:33:39,899
it in our project like yeah if you have

00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:43,590
a basic Drupal fields it's pretty good

00:33:39,899 --> 00:33:46,259
pretty good modules for it there is a

00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:48,090
talk by the way tomorrow about about

00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:49,349
Google amp how to implement it in Drupal

00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:55,759
so it might be interesting to check that

00:33:49,349 --> 00:33:55,759
out hey I know you

00:33:56,989 --> 00:34:07,249
not a good Dutch guy thinking

00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:24,770
accessibility you also mentioned

00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:35,620
was it worth implementing these tools

00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:39,020
over optimizing the websites yourself

00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:42,320
that's a good question in this case the

00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:44,389
clients basically told us to implement

00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,649
these techniques so we didn't we didn't

00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:46,790
check it out but that's it's a really

00:34:45,649 --> 00:34:49,760
good question I think in the time that

00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:52,669
we spent implementing amp and in

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,710
Facebook cases articles I think in 20

00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:56,870
percent of the time we could have get

00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:58,640
the website to load within a second for

00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:07,820
sure it took I took a pretty much amount

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:13,520
of time to implement this is there much

00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:14,570
difference according to I didn't build

00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,190
it myself according to a back-end

00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:18,260
developer he was really fond of the

00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:20,420
Facebook implementation the SDK that you

00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:22,610
can use it's really easy to implement

00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:25,970
and he had open running like within I

00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:28,490
believe a day of developing so he was

00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:30,740
very excited about the Facebook SDK and

00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:35,330
he wasn't he was a little less excited

00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:37,780
about amp but I'm not really sure thank

00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:42,370
you thank you

00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:42,370
any more questions remarks tips

00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:51,540
buyers saying thank you for your talk

00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:54,000
and really great presentation

00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:57,810
besides Facebook and Google there are

00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,870
two big players in this industry or area

00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:04,140
it's a telegram the messaging app they

00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:06,030
have also instant articles but it's too

00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:08,850
different from Facebook and Google and

00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:11,100
there is then it's technology from a

00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:13,560
Yandex it's Russian search engine and

00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:15,630
it's also different from this what's

00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,120
your opinion about the future of this

00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:22,170
are they going to have a war like it's

00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:25,770
between react and angularjs right now or

00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:28,230
they will merge to something United

00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:34,440
unified something unique and they will

00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:37,530
actually well and as one technology so

00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:39,630
you know I don't know for sure but I

00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:42,720
would say like competitors for Google

00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:45,210
such as unnatural Russian search agency

00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:48,150
or company or Chinese search company

00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:49,950
they probably gonna gonna make their own

00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:53,340
software and competiting cooperating

00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:55,470
software such as M but for tools such as

00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,850
telegram might be very beneficial to use

00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:59,250
the M since it's open source and they

00:36:56,850 --> 00:37:02,880
can use it already I'm not sure what

00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:05,360
happens but I think it's it's not a

00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:08,160
coincidence that Facebook now enables

00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:10,800
the way a way to like generate an

00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,440
impression of your of your page with

00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:15,210
their software since they they had a

00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,550
feeling that like most a lot of

00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:20,010
publishers have to choose between either

00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:22,650
Facebook or Google if time or budget is

00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:25,500
limited a limiting factor but now since

00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:29,790
they enabled like publishing and via the

00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:31,770
Facebook SDK they make like the

00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:34,830
publishers choose Facebook maybe above

00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:37,310
Google but I'm not sure about the other

00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:37,310
competitors

00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:46,170
nope so before you run away please

00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:48,030
remind you to the contributions prints

00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,420

00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:50,880

it's really amazing experience attended

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,710
