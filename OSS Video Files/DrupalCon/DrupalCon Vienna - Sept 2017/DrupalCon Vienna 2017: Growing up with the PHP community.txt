Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Growing up with the PHP community
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	Year 2000 was the year of functions2.php. Today we write fully engineered Object Oriented software. All in the same language. PHP has grown and we as developers and people have grown with the new changes over the years. Let me show you what truly changed my life as I grew up being a 12 year old girl learning PHP 4 while women got treated like shit online to today making people's lives better with PHP 7 and an amazing community where we grow further together, men, women and elePHPants alike.

	00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:09,389
hi everyone let's talk about growing up

00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:12,480
in a vhv community I have stage fright

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:16,470
I'm trying to get rid of this by dancing

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,210
on stage before and jumping the reason

00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,380
I'm here is that I have something to

00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:25,830
share that I think is really important

00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:28,260
so as code rabbi another PHP low per PHP

00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,210
developer once said learn the most by

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:37,020
sharing your knowledge with others so

00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:39,620
here I am this talk is about experiences

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:45,090
and every one of you have your own

00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:48,989
experiences and this is sharing mine and

00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:51,449
it will be quite a personal journey so

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:55,559
if my voice breaks during some points

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:57,449
you know why and if my journey is not

00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:02,520
that interesting at least here's a cute

00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:04,409
picture of a kitten and my mom is a

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,500
really talented graphical artist she

00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:10,799
made this picture of me with a dragon

00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:15,210
I'm Michelle's son where I'm president

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,400
of PHP women and I do speak with an

00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,100
accent so if you don't understand me at

00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:23,700
some point let me know and I will try to

00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,380
speak slower or try to clarify and if

00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,909
the speed and speaking out it's wrong

00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:32,299
also let me know I work at leap

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:37,829
how many here have heard of leap before

00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:40,500
cool two of you I'm not a Drupal

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:47,460
developer I'm a symphony developer I'm

00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:51,110
an API expert and I love my job so let's

00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:54,689
talk about PHP and why it's so magical

00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:59,070
because PHP really really is a magical

00:01:54,689 --> 00:02:03,829
language to welcome him in here worked

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:06,619
with PHP for ever in their life okay

00:02:03,829 --> 00:02:11,009
morning ah you that's pretty cool

00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:12,460
when pH before came out I was 12 years

00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:16,810
old and I had

00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:19,030
started using the language and started

00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:21,790
programming I started programming when I

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,520
was about ten years old as an April

00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:26,710
Fool's joke I wanted to change the

00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:29,050
colours of my mum's and display on

00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:33,070
random intervals it was a lot of fun and

00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:36,880
I loved doing that now my first

00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:40,540
experience with PHP was mixing some PHP

00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:45,000
into HTML and tried to make some kind of

00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:47,290
website about myself and add this

00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,430
guestbook because everyone makes a

00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:55,360
guestbook as the first thing right and I

00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:58,620
had so much fun doing that and PHP

00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:03,310
really taught me a lot a truckload and

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:05,830
then I guess time went on and I realized

00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:08,590
I needed to do more than just this

00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:13,960
guestbook and I started getting an

00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:17,400
interest so then I realized okay so

00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:22,750
mixing HTML and PHP is not that good so

00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:25,780
let's change it and grow my PHP and try

00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:28,840
to abstract it so made functions dot PHP

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:31,980
and when functions that PHP creates

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,900
large I made functions to the PHP I

00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,300
realized the naming wasn't that great so

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,940
I made database functions dot PHP and

00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:44,250
now I felt like a professional developer

00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:47,800
around 14 years old I was quite cool and

00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:51,610
then I started University and learning

00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,770
about object-oriented programming and a

00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:56,380
loved object-oriented programming and

00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:59,680
fell in love with it my code was the

00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:03,010
most beautiful abstracted mess I'd ever

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,640
written and no one understood any of it

00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:10,300
and that's the cool thing about PHP you

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:13,780
can do pretty much anything in it I like

00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:16,780
to compare it a bit with an RPG game so

00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:18,670
I'd love the one you start and you have

00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,580
this new character and it's really

00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:24,340
pretty amazing and you level up really

00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:27,910
really fast and you learn so much

00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:31,900
in such a short amount of time and

00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:34,690
that's cool now but once you're level 60

00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:37,960
out of 9th - you start slowing down a

00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:39,669
little bit and once you slow down maybe

00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:44,010
start another character and he call her

00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:47,020
Ruby him there you go but this talk is

00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:50,470
mainly about my journey when I tried

00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:53,050
getting into the PHP community my love

00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:57,669
for the language should be pretty clear

00:04:53,050 --> 00:05:00,460
now PHP itself it had many features over

00:04:57,669 --> 00:05:03,580
the years that really grew me as a

00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:06,040
developer when namespaces came out and

00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:10,900
outer loading how many people here loved

00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:14,320
that instead of include and all that

00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:17,169
stuff was really really amazing but I

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,440
was almost set back from programming and

00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:23,350
being a developer at all so first I want

00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:30,789
to start with lots of hugs to all of you

00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:32,979
you heard a whole amazing uni and let's

00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:35,440
talk a little bit about our rings

00:05:32,979 --> 00:05:40,300
because our brains is this really

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:43,539
complex structure imagine that this is a

00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:45,729
brain I'm clearly not a designer and in

00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:49,030
here it's all your memories and feelings

00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:53,130
and a past experiences everything you do

00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:57,150
in life and it's all connected and

00:05:53,130 --> 00:06:00,460
everything into everything is just this

00:05:57,150 --> 00:06:02,560
emotional thing and when you want to

00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:05,500
learn something new let's say you want

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,660
to know Drupal 8 then you take from all

00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,000
those experiences and because you have

00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:13,060
so many experiences you learn it a lot

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:18,460
quicker and it goes into this network of

00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:21,340
things you learned and our brains are

00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,860
wired that way but what happens if you

00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,570
have this experience that's really

00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,139
traumatic for you what does your brain

00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:30,400
do

00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:32,729
so there's several cases one of them is

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:38,300
that you put this traumatic experience

00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:41,479
into your brain and your brain

00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,370
kind of tries to integrate it with who

00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:47,509
you are and when you're learning new

00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:51,110
things and it works out you may be a bit

00:06:47,509 --> 00:06:55,250
sad when you remember those things it

00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:57,620
may not work out for you that well but

00:06:55,250 --> 00:07:01,780
what could also happen is that your

00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:07,880
brain tries to shut out that experience

00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:10,880
and that's what happened to me my brain

00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:13,660
tried to disassociate certain parts of

00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:18,650
putting programming and my code public

00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:21,560
and it tried to not know what I was

00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:24,139
doing if my code had to go public in

00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,330
private it was fine in public my brain

00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:32,000
shut down it took me a long time to

00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:36,800
understand brains and why my brain would

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:48,050
do this and then looking back when I was

00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:52,550
12 years old then it was kind of going

00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:54,979
to this artsy channel in PHP and using

00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:58,130
my name as a handle Michelle I thought

00:07:54,979 --> 00:07:59,719
that would be pretty cool right I got

00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,310
kicked out of the IRC room for

00:07:59,719 --> 00:08:05,539
pretending to be a girl to get help

00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:08,419
quicker so okay I could not be a girl

00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:11,800
and I are seeing that was clear but as

00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:15,430
soon as that was known during my entire

00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:18,889
career until quite recently I got

00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:22,070
statements like build so get the

00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:26,300
off Wow a girl or an FBI agent that's

00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:29,570
cool these things they happen to me

00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:34,880
daily and it got tiring but those were

00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:37,849
not so bad and the worst thing was

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:42,800
people deeming me and saying oh there's

00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:46,250
not so many girls are see and especially

00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:50,900
programmers are a single it became this

00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:52,399
thing that I still today yeah but very

00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,660
very very

00:08:52,399 --> 00:09:00,109
and what happened in community is that

00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:01,959
these things became not so okay nowadays

00:09:00,109 --> 00:09:04,549
where code of conducts and we have this

00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:07,999
awesome networks like we do in the

00:09:04,549 --> 00:09:11,989
Drupal community and what I want to

00:09:07,999 --> 00:09:19,220
avoid is that we ever ever ever go back

00:09:11,989 --> 00:09:22,549
to an environment like that so how do we

00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:24,919
avoid going back to this and what helped

00:09:22,549 --> 00:09:27,859
me to actually still stay in this

00:09:24,919 --> 00:09:31,309
industry and what will help other people

00:09:27,859 --> 00:09:35,029
to stay in this industry that is so much

00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:37,009
better today than it was back then one

00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:39,350
of the things that helped me is that my

00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:40,399
passion for programming never ever

00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:43,459
disappeared

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,160
my passion for program stayed and always

00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:48,259
stays the same and one of the reason is

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,230
the supportive parents that I always had

00:09:48,259 --> 00:09:53,959
I just became a mother a year ago and

00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:56,480
it's so important to support your

00:09:53,959 --> 00:10:01,360
children in anything they want to do

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:03,980
it's a passionate about it support them

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:10,819
other things that really helped me in my

00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:13,480
life was when I was 18 I went to my

00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:17,089
first conference after being pushed

00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:19,879
really pushed to my first conference and

00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:23,809
in there I got to meet some people I

00:10:19,879 --> 00:10:26,509
looked up to they were really ordinary

00:10:23,809 --> 00:10:30,230
people like me Wow other geeks that's so

00:10:26,509 --> 00:10:33,529
cool and they didn't have this that a

00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:35,689
lot of people online hat they didn't say

00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:41,149
boobs who get it off or anything

00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:42,769
like this and it was pretty amazing and

00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:48,489
I was hooked and started going to youth

00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:51,199
groups until about three years later

00:10:48,489 --> 00:10:52,879
where it didn't work out so well and I

00:10:51,199 --> 00:10:57,880
had a traumatic experience at a

00:10:52,879 --> 00:11:00,519
conference but

00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,759
it's all okay and I'm not gonna be

00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:09,790
renting any more I just wanted to share

00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:13,630
some to try to kinda understand what it

00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:16,800
was like and to build an empathy for

00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:20,740
everyone in this community and that's

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:25,569
when something is said to someone who

00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:29,829
has experiences like today innocent

00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:34,420
conversation really made my brain kind

00:11:29,829 --> 00:11:36,670
of shut down so it was we were talking

00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:39,339
about how I don't do Drupal development

00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:42,699
oh cool are you from them they're done

00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:45,790
oh no I'm a symphony developer oh

00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:48,160
there's not many girls in symphony

00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:51,730
that's really cool that's a that's an

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:54,699
innocent thing to say but the thing I

00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:56,410
was thinking at that point was oh wow

00:11:54,699 --> 00:11:59,160
that person really doesn't think that

00:11:56,410 --> 00:12:04,389
girls can be so funny that's horrible

00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:08,620
yeah so we have to try to get into

00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:15,819
everyone's brain somehow I don't know

00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:18,880
how that works out so therefore I guess

00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:21,850
what I'm asking for is that we stop

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,130
looking at groups of people and we start

00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,199
looking at individuals because

00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:28,959
individually we all have these

00:12:26,199 --> 00:12:36,630
experiences and our brains do these

00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:43,630
weird different things now back to PHP

00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:46,899
PHP is pretty pretty amazing and the

00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:50,680
speaker after me we'll talk about PHP

00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:55,000
7.1 and all the cool features it ass I

00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:59,829
fell in love with tie painting I have an

00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:03,870
apprentice at work and at first I tried

00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:06,910
to teach him symphony and throw him into

00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:09,240
Symphony just randomly let's do Symphony

00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:12,110
you had never been programming before

00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:17,090
that didn't work out so

00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:18,770
for some it does for him I throw them

00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:20,750
into the deep water and that's the

00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,780
strength with PHP and we could say okay

00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,700
let's not do this let's start over and

00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:36,230
that worked really really really well

00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:38,600
for him so now let's talk about how I

00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:40,010
think we can fix this with all the

00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:44,810
people who have different experiences

00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:49,490
and how we can be one unity and maybe

00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:52,550
try to be together as one and try to

00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,810
avoid people feeling like I was feeling

00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:59,170
earlier today from an innocent

00:13:53,810 --> 00:14:04,580
conversation so let's talk about unity

00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:05,120
imagine you have 13 kids 13 kids in

00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,490
school

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,730
it's a tweet that I saw and it explains

00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:14,120
it really well three of them were yellow

00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:22,190
t-shirts and ten of them were blue

00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:24,830
t-shirts now the problem is that six of

00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:28,430
the blue shirts start stealing the

00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:32,750
yellow shirts lunch money and the other

00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:35,090
blue shirts and they they're just in

00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:39,560
between they hate that the other blue

00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:42,920
shirts are stealing the money but they

00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,810
want to try to help but they can't they

00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:47,660
just say it's not my problem I'm not the

00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:50,210
one stealing the money so the problem

00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:53,900
persists day after day after day the

00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:58,240
money gets stolen but then one day the

00:14:53,900 --> 00:15:01,480
other blue shirts said we had enough and

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:04,490
they unified with the yellow shirts and

00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,940
said okay let's not let's not do this

00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:08,480
anymore

00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:11,810
don't steal their lunch money and all of

00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,060
a sudden instead of saying it's not my

00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:16,610
problem because I'm not the one doing it

00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:20,770
they became unified and they could have

00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:20,770
a conversation and in this conversation

00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,939
they decided that okay the reason you

00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:27,589
stole the lunch money

00:15:25,939 --> 00:15:32,179
is that you couldn't actually afford to

00:15:27,589 --> 00:15:34,039
eat yourself and they talked about it

00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:35,899
and therefore they decided to old put

00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:38,119
all the money together and share it and

00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:42,739
everyone could eat and the goal here was

00:15:38,119 --> 00:15:44,689
to be green yeah everyone's green so

00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:46,099
community toughs working community is

00:15:44,689 --> 00:15:50,449
really really amazing

00:15:46,099 --> 00:15:52,879
I got a mentor in the community in PHP

00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:55,819
mentoring that org and it taught me

00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:58,220
about cold confidence I would start

00:15:55,819 --> 00:16:00,499
showing my code to him and he would

00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,470
start telling me this and this and this

00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:06,259
and this is amazing before he told me

00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:08,199
this little part could need tweaking and

00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:12,109
that's something that I wanted to

00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:14,329
introduce as maybe an example we started

00:16:12,109 --> 00:16:17,479
doing this at work as well in our mesh

00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:21,249
requests we try to always point out

00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:25,220
something positive so that you Dan

00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:27,439
the negative becomes less negative so if

00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,869
there's one thing you can take away with

00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:32,449
you today start pointing out positive

00:16:29,869 --> 00:16:35,179
things that people do and notice the

00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:37,849
change in the mood in the atmosphere and

00:16:35,179 --> 00:16:40,249
how much more productive they will be it

00:16:37,849 --> 00:16:44,809
does one thing you can take away take

00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:48,079
that away so community does really work

00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:50,449
but we need to be more positive and we

00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:53,269
need to hug each other more Larry one

00:16:50,449 --> 00:16:57,470
thing self more hugging community does

00:16:53,269 --> 00:17:01,059
work then we can only only fix the

00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:01,059
problems together

00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:16,069
so hugs to all of you and now I thought

00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:19,680
we could have an open conversation last

00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:22,370
ten minutes so if everyone comes a

00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,370
little bit closer

00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:01,160
someone's at a conference in a keynote

00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:03,350
there was this exercise how many of you

00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:13,580
have ever contributed to open source

00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:15,410
stand-up it's really really cool the

00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:18,470
thing with this thing is everyone is

00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:22,670
stood up they felt kind of cool when I

00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:28,190
was sitting down I felt okay

00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:31,070
this is this is horrible I felt like I

00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:33,920
should contribute to open source but I

00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:37,790
didn't know where to start because how

00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:41,630
do you start when you feel the way I

00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:46,460
just explained how do you start when you

00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:52,070
believe that because of your experiences

00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:53,510
and because I'm a woman in tech people

00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:58,730
will look at my code and it would judge

00:18:53,510 --> 00:19:03,050
it harder how do I put my code out there

00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:06,830
and I didn't have an answer until we

00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:09,020
started with this positivity so now as a

00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:11,240
group exercise does anyone have an

00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,960
answer how you do when someone feels

00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,810
that way

00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,800
to get them started in a project where

00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,800
they don't know anyone

00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:42,580
so to repeat that for the recording and

00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:45,070
what this end was to try to find people

00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:50,970
who have common goals and then you can

00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:50,970
work together that's a really good point

00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:09,990
start with something small and

00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:13,650
controversial that's really good

00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:13,650
anything else you can do

00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:50,710
identify people you look up to and talk

00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:53,419
to them and have a one-to-one

00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:58,270
conversation and that way you can get

00:20:53,419 --> 00:21:02,299
involved more directly really cool okay

00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:05,900
so the thing is I was sharing all these

00:21:02,299 --> 00:21:09,980
really negative things but it's really

00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:12,919
really so cool to be here today because

00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:15,740
of the community and its really nice

00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:17,539
that cuz of the community and only

00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:20,740
because of the community I still do

00:21:17,539 --> 00:21:23,690
programming today because of the

00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:27,230
conferences I went to and because of

00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:28,309
these people and my mentor I'm the

00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,400
person I am today

00:21:28,309 --> 00:21:33,500
so I would like to encourage everyone

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,230
even if it's small just share something

00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:39,080
positive with everyone you encourage

00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:41,690
everyone you meet every cone you see

00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:46,250
share something positive about it and

00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:47,960
people like me will always be and also

00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:52,299
don't be the employee shirts in the

00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:58,520
middle because I wasn't pointing yeah

00:21:52,299 --> 00:22:02,440
you missed example because don't be the

00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:06,740
one who says it's not me I always try to

00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:11,929
work together and bring unity I don't

00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:14,500
like when the segregated groups okay any

00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:14,500
questions

00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:09,899
okay so my fears before contributed to

00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:12,779
open source versus how it was after I

00:23:09,899 --> 00:23:17,549
contributed to open source was it

00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:19,620
validated or how was it so to this day I

00:23:17,549 --> 00:23:21,960
still haven't contributed that much

00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:24,419
double source I didn't affect issues and

00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:28,020
they were really cool and I wanted to

00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:32,070
contribute more to Symphony but this day

00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:35,360
I still haven't because I read the

00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:38,340
comments and they are discouraging

00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:43,460
people say thank you but they never say

00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:45,630
exactly what was good and that's for me

00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:49,710
discouraging me to do my code either

00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:51,929
it's merged with a thank you or there's

00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:55,470
only negative things and that's

00:23:51,929 --> 00:23:58,080
something I want to try to change if you

00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:00,690
take this a way to try to have positive

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:04,169
comments I might feel more comfortable

00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:06,090
contributing because I feel like I do at

00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:08,250
work when we started practicing this

00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:12,059
where we have positive comments I

00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:13,950
actually feel like I can code and that's

00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:18,029
something really really important to me

00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:20,880
I had a job interview once I was

00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:22,740
interviewing for a few jobs and I shall

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,070
sleep because they're the only ones who

00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:28,140
made me feel also but the one of the job

00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:32,000
interviews that stood out to me was a

00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,000
company in Sweden and

00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:38,250
during this job my potential employer

00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:41,280
asked me how would it feel to be the

00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:44,130
only woman working here and I said don't

00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,919
feel pretty normal but that's my

00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:49,409
everyday job it's what I do and he said

00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:53,100
okay but really we had a woman working

00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:56,100
here before and she wasn't a good

00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:59,010
programmer so we had to fire her and now

00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:02,070
everyone else thinks women can't code

00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:06,419
and we're trying to hire someone who can

00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:09,630
prove them wrong I laughed and said well

00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:12,539
I'm not that person well I wanted to

00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,900
laugh but I just silently walked out the

00:25:12,539 --> 00:25:17,760
door

00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:19,200
but still it's yeah you can't blame them

00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:24,659
for the honesty but it's still a

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:28,770
horrible horrible experience lucky

00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:33,900
escape okay and the next talk is going

00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:37,380
to be about PHP 7.1 which is something I

00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:39,690
have really really really fallen in love

00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:45,289
with so I was talking a little bit about

00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:50,549
this journey that I had from PHP for and

00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:53,190
how PHP grew I didn't get that into my

00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:55,710
talk that much but when PHP became

00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:57,600

having type in ting that was really cool

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:04,730
so thank you all and I would like to

00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:04,730

00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:11,590
