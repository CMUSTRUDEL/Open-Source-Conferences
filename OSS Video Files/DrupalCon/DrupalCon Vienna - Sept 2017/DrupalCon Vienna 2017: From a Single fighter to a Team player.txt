Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: From a Single fighter to a Team player
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	I am going to share my experience working with drupal for the last 11 years.

I started developing drupal as a hobby working alone without financial incentive. After 11 years, I have been working in a team of 2-6 of a pan-european company, in team where I collaborate with multiple companies and helping a government body creating in-house drupal team.

In this session, I am going to share the transition that I had, the change of mindset I had and of course, the challenge I faced as a south-east-asian developer working in Europe.

After the session, the audience should know about

How to face your language barrier.
How to cope with social dan cultural differences.
How to deal with different organization cultures.
How to change a mindset from “I can do everything” to task delegation.
How it is “done” is better than “perfect”.
Hopefully we can have a insightful discussion in the Q&A session of this presentation.

right so it's a 1450 and I'm just going

00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:21,630
to start presentation yes so this is

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,789
what we are going to do we're going to

00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:25,590
have like housekeeping and about me for

00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:27,930
five minutes say actually less than five

00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:30,330
minutes it's just like I usually have a

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,279
five minutes buffer so if there is a

00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,390
lateness and so on and so forth we still

00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:39,390
have time but I'm going to have

00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:43,290
housekeeping descriptions explanation

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:47,489
and about me about housekeeping

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:50,670
this talk will not relate it to any

00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:53,309

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:09,390
with your friends or with your team this

00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:14,010

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,899

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:54,119
that's the disclaimer and then if you

00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,060
want ask questions up listed your name

00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:01,290
your role and what you want to do maybe

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,659
is related to what you are and what you

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:07,710
are going to become or what you willing

00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,840
to have in the future and also please

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:11,250
remind me that I should repeat the

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,790
questions

00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:21,750
I usually forget so please remind me

00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:25,410
about that right so back to the agenda

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,850
we will learn but the housekeeping we'll

00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,850
talk about the different types of roles

00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,740
that I have and their evolutions and

00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:35,070
then how I will talk about the

00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:37,950
challenges and lessons learned and qan

00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:39,990
discussions so hopefully we can have a

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:44,760
fruitful and really nice discussion

00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:47,070
after war now originally I apply for one

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,020
hour sessions but they taught me that

00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:52,320
can you do it in 30 minutes and then I

00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:54,960
say I take that challenge so I'm

00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:58,950
probably going to agree I'm going to

00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:00,750
speak really fast and cool - really I'm

00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,160
not going to explain every points but if

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:05,780
you have questions for each point and

00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:07,920
you can just ask me afterwards right

00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:12,440
housekeeping about me all right this is

00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:16,950
about me my name is Sara Dino Rizal and

00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:19,770
in Drupal I'm called Neil safier and

00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:25,320
that's my user ID still five digit so I

00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:28,770
created my triple ID around LF L ever

00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:33,830
eleven and half years ago I started with

00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:36,930
Drupal 4.4 and before that I was doing

00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:45,020
web development and other stuff so I

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:50,790
started doing development from 1997 and

00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:52,650
that's me with the Drupal Guba in in

00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:56,220
cities I don't know how do you call it

00:03:52,650 --> 00:04:00,120
Drupal dough in English and I took it

00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:02,489
when I was working in the in Stockholm

00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,070
so my old colleague is in the front

00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:07,080
really nice they call themself different

00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,760
name at the moment hopefully they don't

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,250
change their name next to port on

00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,620
because I might meet them they have

00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:17,040
different name and then I'm wearing a

00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:19,680
traditional indonesian clothes called

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,460
party we have international phonetic day

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,410
and then this is i took it when we

00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:26,569
after international automatically I went

00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:29,930
to the office with these quotes so

00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:35,270
pretty interesting oh yeah fun fact is

00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:37,069
the most favorite close by so Nelson

00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:39,650
Mandela really liked this close

00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:43,280
so you probably see Nelson Mandela using

00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:46,099
these buttocks and then there is a map

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:49,190
over here this is basically my life I've

00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:53,449
been working living and studying in

00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:55,669
those places so it's quite a while and

00:04:53,449 --> 00:05:00,710
at the moment I'm working for loon

00:04:55,669 --> 00:05:03,410
University in Sweden okay I don't see

00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:08,750
any people that speak Hindi so there is

00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:13,180
no joke there because it means something

00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:17,650
else in Hindi you have to okay next

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:23,120
different types of roles and I have and

00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:28,720
then in the revolutions right I cannot

00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:32,960
actually see this I have to yeah this is

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:36,680
the role I had when I was a single

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:38,360
factor so at first at first I start as a

00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:43,130
cobbler's what is cobblers cobblers

00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:45,500
basically you do things randomly if you

00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:48,169
see shoes cobblers basically they

00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,659
recycle existing shoes and then to patch

00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:52,639
another shoes that's what GG has a shoe

00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:55,669
scope block when I was a website

00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,699
cobblers obviously took down an existing

00:05:55,669 --> 00:06:00,590
website and then regret the stuff in it

00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:03,050
and then publish it as my own

00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:07,159
basically so that's how I learn web

00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:09,889
design by reverse engineering assisting

00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:14,060
website in the internet with not bad

00:06:09,889 --> 00:06:14,719
back then and then out of that I became

00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,530
a hobbyist

00:06:14,719 --> 00:06:21,860
the difference is that I do it more

00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:25,060
regularly as as the things that you do

00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:28,400
after work the things that you do after

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:30,620
after school after universities so I was

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,589
working in oil and gas company not

00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,240
related to any website but I feel like

00:06:33,589 --> 00:06:38,840
I'm enjoying doing

00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:42,259
you know solving stuff solving

00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:45,680
challenges in web development related

00:06:42,259 --> 00:06:50,210
and then I had purpose with my hobby

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:53,300
like my purpose was we started when my

00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:55,430
friend asked me to do their website and

00:06:53,300 --> 00:07:02,539
then oh I think I can help them with

00:06:55,430 --> 00:07:07,639
this and that and then again out of that

00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:11,979
I get a real client that pay me with

00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:14,810
exposure you probably know this like I

00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:17,060
think a lot of people in graphic design

00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:19,430
know about this right can you do me a

00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,919
logo but I cannot pay you but you get

00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:25,699
exposure because I show you look logo

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:30,349
everywhere stuff but it was fun because

00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:33,259
I had something to show people and this

00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:35,210
is the reason why I'm I'm where I'm

00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:38,630
making website because as soon as you

00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:40,400
finish your stuff suddenly like an

00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:44,650
instant everyone in the world can access

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:47,300
your creation it's not the same in

00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:49,699
biopharm Icicle company right you need

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,139
to have like past the colossus and this

00:07:49,699 --> 00:07:54,979
is a reason why i choose web development

00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:59,810
not the desktop programming or other

00:07:54,979 --> 00:08:03,199
type of programming and then i became a

00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:06,320
major developer that doing it part time

00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,139
because of I still had my work and then

00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:15,680
I do the development as a freelancer on

00:08:09,139 --> 00:08:18,440
weekends and then I became professional

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,380
developers I mean is that well this is

00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:24,380
happened when I was in Sweden I did

00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:26,990
personally means that that was the only

00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:29,030
source of income that I have I was

00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,699
studying and then I was doing website on

00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:34,250
the side and then I was epic and then I

00:08:31,699 --> 00:08:38,000
became portion of the former developer

00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:43,099
in company so the difference here is

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,390
that when you are doing it yourself and

00:08:43,099 --> 00:08:48,769
then

00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:51,800
the the client is yourself you don't

00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:55,190
have to think about it alone right I

00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:58,100
mean you're the client is yourself so

00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:59,300
you have like a big picture of what the

00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,220
end product will look like

00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,410
and then you basically doing that but

00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,690
then if you work with other people like

00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:08,329
the client is other person you need to

00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:10,820
have some kind of a first communications

00:09:08,329 --> 00:09:12,820
and then some kind of expectation

00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:15,920
management expression management is that

00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:19,990
what you expect and your client expect

00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:22,820
supposed to be the same thing otherwise

00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:24,290
they will have like I thought that you

00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:26,149
can do this where you don't have this

00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:29,240
that kind of stuff and then it will bite

00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:32,120
you in the end and then if it's your

00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:37,339
friends then the cost will be your

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:39,950
friendship if if it's freelance if

00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:46,850
you'll answer then the cost will be your

00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:49,790
pet testimonial in your used to be like

00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:55,250
freelancer.com right now we have other

00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:59,480
website that and then if it's in company

00:09:55,250 --> 00:10:02,839
that then it will cost your job but the

00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,630
point is that you have to think about if

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,269
you do it yourself you don't need to

00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:09,680
care about other people if you work with

00:10:08,269 --> 00:10:13,459
someone you have to care about their

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,810
opinion so you don't you cannot push

00:10:13,459 --> 00:10:18,410
your opinion you have to think about

00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:24,320
what the other people thinks about the

00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:27,649
end result of your product next is a

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,440
team player hours in depth of to

00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:33,459
development team of two people and hours

00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:38,930
in development in a team of five people

00:10:33,459 --> 00:10:42,560
in with a child workflow and I was an

00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:44,300
adept in where the front end is another

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,699
company and we are doing the back end

00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:51,829
and the UX is another company and I was

00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:53,839
let developer team builder project

00:10:51,829 --> 00:10:54,960
manager a social and social architect

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,790
and productive over us

00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:01,290
so I will tell you the difference

00:10:56,790 --> 00:11:08,149
between these two in the death of a team

00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:11,100
of two so before that the big minds have

00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:13,500
changed between the single factor and

00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:17,070
the team player is that you have the

00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:19,649
thing about first the scope of your work

00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:21,959
I mean used to be like you do everything

00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:24,720
and then if you work with the team you

00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:26,459
have to stick with your scope even

00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,620
though you can do from and you can do

00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:30,420
system administrator but if your role is

00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,300
a peg and developer don't mess with

00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:35,940
other people it's like do you know the

00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:38,220
backseat driver things right you are

00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,500
driving and you don't want to be the

00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:43,680
backseat driver for that person because

00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:48,480
you will create unnecessary debate and

00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:55,470
unnecessary discussion that will prolong

00:11:48,480 --> 00:12:01,850
the the project and there that may cost

00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:01,850
a lot of money because of that and also

00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:08,100
the difference between the team of two

00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:11,339
and a team of five is that you just need

00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:14,130
to have more time to plan and then the

00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:16,500
more you go down the more time you spend

00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:19,980
on planning rather than on development

00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,930
of things so right now 80% of the work

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,959
will be planning not actually the flop

00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:27,270
in the codes and when you work a lot you

00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,670
don't need that much of planning because

00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,240
you know especially if you work for

00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,880
yourself

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:35,610
the client is yourself you don't have

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,620
that enough expectation and you don't

00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:45,450
need to build your reputation or around

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:49,079
it right and yes and if you are a part

00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:51,390
of a team development team in company

00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:53,670
then you work with other company then

00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:58,860
you have to have this kind of a shared

00:12:53,670 --> 00:13:02,940
charge ownership share lingo because one

00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:04,589
company may think one word means

00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,860
something and the other company means

00:13:04,589 --> 00:13:08,579
something else that kind of shared

00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,709
lingual

00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:13,259
to be addressed or in is to be discussed

00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:15,299
in the beginning of the project it's

00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:18,619
part of the communication skill that you

00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:22,410
need to when you when I see when when we

00:13:18,619 --> 00:13:24,720
say features is the features model or is

00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,519
it the features for the website for

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,199
ensalada we have to have like that

00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:32,069
description when you work with other

00:13:28,199 --> 00:13:32,910
people so otherwise there will be

00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:36,480
confusions

00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:40,610
there is a story with ISS International

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:46,790
Space Station some Lockheed Martin

00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:49,769
engineers build the model with imperiaz

00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:53,100
measurements not metrics so it doesn't

00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:55,049
fit even though it says this is 5 and

00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,239
this is 5 but the other gave 5 meters

00:13:55,049 --> 00:14:00,329
the other guy is 5 feet so it doesn't

00:13:57,239 --> 00:14:03,269
match that's kind of like even though

00:14:00,329 --> 00:14:08,249
they are our technical engineers they

00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:12,929
still have that problem as well and then

00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:16,139
when you move to lead developer or when

00:14:12,929 --> 00:14:19,110
you are actually leading something most

00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:21,509
of your time will be spent on actually

00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:24,299
taking care of other developers not

00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:27,239
actually doing the work the work is done

00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:29,220
by the specialists as a leader you work

00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:30,480
is taking care of the other developer

00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:33,660
which is make sure that the other

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,249
developer has whatever they need like do

00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,720
you have a good connection or do you

00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:40,949
have a good environment they can also

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,699
their specialist can work as efficient

00:14:40,949 --> 00:14:47,100
as possible

00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:50,069
and our our had the privilege helping

00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:55,110
University to build a team so you have

00:14:50,069 --> 00:14:59,910
to think about what is the workflow

00:14:55,110 --> 00:15:01,980
between the developer and I help as well

00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:08,579
with the infrastructure I helped as well

00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:10,919
with this is the I'll say the knowledge

00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:13,049
that you have to have first before you

00:15:10,919 --> 00:15:18,749
to a triple development something like

00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:21,389
that then in in this position you have

00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:23,490
to think about not about one week but

00:15:21,389 --> 00:15:26,610
like one year from now what happened in

00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:31,350
one year right is your solution or is

00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:35,129
your priority shion's

00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:38,160
match what we match with what will

00:15:35,129 --> 00:15:40,709
happen in the next year or next two

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,199
years so for instance if you are helped

00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:45,119
to build a team that we know cell phone

00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,919
and you know in like in the next two

00:15:45,119 --> 00:15:49,679
years there will be triple eight you

00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:55,079
have to make sure that the developer in

00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:57,179
that team knows about object-oriented or

00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:59,459
if they don't know what object-oriented

00:15:57,179 --> 00:16:03,389
then you have to set a plan to educate

00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:05,629
them and educating our people takes a

00:16:03,389 --> 00:16:09,360
lot of time so you have to plan that

00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:11,819
outside of the real world so maybe you

00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,019
said that I know Friday

00:16:11,819 --> 00:16:22,169
workshop where you do that and something

00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:27,720
kind of education seminar every month

00:16:22,169 --> 00:16:31,049
for instance and also if you are in the

00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:33,689
head of project manager you don't do the

00:16:31,049 --> 00:16:35,999
code you basically this plan is about

00:16:33,689 --> 00:16:38,879
planning and your role is about planning

00:16:35,999 --> 00:16:41,309
things finding the resources the human

00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,199
resource the infrastructure the the

00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:48,269
other resources so you have to make sure

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:50,999
that that's your priorities and as a

00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:53,850
solution architect you have to know the

00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:56,459
goal of the project that's that's the

00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:59,129
things I mean if the goal is to make

00:16:56,459 --> 00:17:03,179
your site faster if the goal is to

00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:05,970
reduce costs of the existing solution or

00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:08,659
the goals other things and then you have

00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:08,659
to create

00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:17,280
the solution that matched the goal and

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,050
the important part here is again

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,730
expectation management and then

00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:24,510
communication with the end user or the

00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:29,820
clients what do what do what do they

00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:32,640
need like for the project to to be

00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:35,190
finished maybe you can split the project

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:37,110
into two phase like first one or first -

00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:39,500
maybe you can split the project the

00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:43,380
first one refers to or phase three the

00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:45,540
point is if you have the client

00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:48,740
expectation match with your expectation

00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:52,650
there will be easier to communicate and

00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:58,590
then it will be easier to ask for

00:17:52,650 --> 00:18:00,960
resources for instance and if if you are

00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:08,040
a product developer you have to match

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:11,460
your you have to match your excitation

00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:14,730
with what the company is about I mean

00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:16,560
what is the company things you will have

00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,990
in the future like what is the vision of

00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:22,710
the company and the product supposed to

00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:27,660
have and then fulfill that vision and

00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:30,330
again the different big difference

00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:33,330
between the single players and then team

00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:38,790
player is the communications expectation

00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:43,140
management and if you are from different

00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:45,120
culture you need to understand the

00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,850
clients college of course how do you

00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,560
talk with each other like if you have if

00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:52,920
you are in open company and you have our

00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:55,500
Chinese compliant do you guys have

00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:59,120
different way of this communicating

00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:01,830
things and then I don't know like maybe

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,510
the Italian company worked with the

00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:08,130
German company I mean they have

00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:10,320
different view of time right and the

00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:13,110
italic and the Spanish probably a bit

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,270
more linear on time and the German is

00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:19,440
really static on time and then if you

00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:20,679
say like five days you want to finish in

00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,690
five days if

00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:26,110
German thing about it but the Spanish

00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:31,960
probably 50-ish must mean pulse - one or

00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:34,840
two maybe I don't know somebody have

00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:37,090
that experience probably that's

00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,850
including as well because like if you

00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:43,149
have a plan a timeline that these

00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:47,049
resources or this port or this firewall

00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:48,820
needs to be accessed tomorrow and then

00:19:47,049 --> 00:19:53,440
you work with some other people that

00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:56,350
yeah maybe plus - and then you know what

00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,480
I understand as well if you work with a

00:19:56,350 --> 00:20:01,169
Swedish company you have to take up the

00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:05,110
thing about the June and July because

00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:07,360
that's a holy day in Sweden so a lot of

00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:09,850
people I actually try to avoid that

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:12,940
money if you want to send stuff twitcher

00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:14,110
to sweden you will send it on out goes

00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,360
or before June

00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:20,700
otherwise we are not much with your

00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:22,809
expectation again again the emphasis is

00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,360
understanding your prior understanding

00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:28,840
your bills - a lot of communication make

00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:34,210
sure you have the same definition on

00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:37,480
something and then understand the

00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:42,879
culture it if you understand the culture

00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:46,149
you can have two choices comply with the

00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:52,929
cloud their culture or basically make

00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:56,230
sure they change to your culture but in

00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:58,119
my view is better - if you can be more

00:20:56,230 --> 00:21:01,350
adaptable and more flexible to the

00:20:58,119 --> 00:21:04,450
client's culture and then you can have

00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:06,279
better communication and then you will

00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:12,629
give you better reputation with our

00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:12,629
testimonial with our feedbacks right

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,450
and then this is the challenge then

00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:24,890
unless alone the challenge is the scope

00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:27,320
of work like again if you work alone and

00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:29,900
you work everything by yourself you the

00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,180
scope is the whole project if you work

00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,310
with other people you have to have clear

00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:35,690
definition of the role I'm doing this

00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:38,390
you're doing that so there is no overlap

00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:40,250
because if there is no because because

00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:43,610
if there is overlap you're probably

00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:45,200
doing half way in this part and they are

00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:47,840
doing half way in that part and then

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,990
after that you have to have a discussion

00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:54,280
how you merge those things that will

00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:58,730
take time and a chance of mindset a

00:21:54,280 --> 00:22:01,160
chance of mindset of you don't care

00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:03,200
about everyone and now you have to care

00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:05,510
about everyone like you have to care

00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,420
about everyone else like in Drupal if

00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:15,920
you look at the Drupal issues a lot of

00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:18,650
the things is not about ok if you have

00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:22,790
time go to the node a there is a farmers

00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:25,610
not 8 that's an issue that finish after

00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:30,920
8 years so there is a lot of discussion

00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:33,140
about that and this if you have a lot of

00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,270
people working on the same project does

00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:37,400
and that you want to make everyone happy

00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:40,280
happy then you have to spend time on

00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:46,430
that then you have to put it in your

00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:49,010
timeline again empathize this is a

00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:52,550
challenge because if you are not grew up

00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:57,140
in the culture where you emphasize a lot

00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:59,480
of things and then maybe you are lonely

00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:00,860
or maybe you grew up by yourself in the

00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,310
high school and you don't have a lot of

00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:05,990
friends you don't have this concept and

00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:08,390
then you have to love this but this can

00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:11,780
be love because I was that guy I didn't

00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:14,300
know how to empathize other people I was

00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:18,530
thinking like I was the one that know

00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:20,900
everything and then well my way or my

00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:22,900
way or there is no other way and then

00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,490
you have to understand other people and

00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:28,370
emphasize start with listening

00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:30,110
and listening is not the same as hearing

00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:36,460
you can hear words but you're probably

00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:40,790
not listening to them listening have

00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:43,910
more than just hearing and putting the

00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:45,980
words inside your yes you have to

00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:49,820
understand them you have to know what

00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:58,840
they mean they if they mean a doesn't

00:23:49,820 --> 00:24:03,020
mean ABC or Easter is that adhara

00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:06,679
background that makes them say a you

00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:09,980
have to know that and then it is related

00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:13,970
to cultures specifically because I'm

00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:16,130
coming from the east culture in the

00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:18,679
nations of this Asia and I'm working in

00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:20,390
Europe and the work ethics the

00:24:18,679 --> 00:24:24,350
communication style and the formalities

00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:27,650
are not the same so the work actus in

00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:32,500
certain countries in Asia is not that

00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:34,640
hard but in Western countries is pretty

00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:39,530
there are some people are a workaholic

00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:46,070
there and then in Indonesia also our

00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:47,750
work ethics is after 6:00 p.m. a lot of

00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:51,140
people still working in Japan they

00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:53,750
finish work at 10:00 and in Germany when

00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:56,360
I was working in Germany they sat down

00:24:53,750 --> 00:25:00,830
the computer after 5:00 they kick me out

00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:03,950
of the office for 45 and then because of

00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:06,670
that I learned that I cannot walk more

00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:09,740
after 5:00 then I have to reprioritize

00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:12,950
my work so you have to understand if you

00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:14,840
are just came from Asia and then you

00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:18,910
work in Europe you have to think about

00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:26,900
what the other people expectation of you

00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:30,730
and in Asia is this is if it's not

00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:30,730
suggested a people are

00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:39,630
of all time teams offer time is common

00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:42,299
in Asia but not him and you know as I

00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:44,039
thought as far I know and the

00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:47,960
communication style and the formalities

00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:52,559
is also important if you have if you are

00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:55,020
from Europe and you're not familiar with

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:59,280
formalities that you call your boss or

00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:00,870
your call your client without your name

00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:04,700
or without the soul or something like

00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:08,700
that and then you work with Japanese

00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:11,130
that may be and there will be

00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:13,919
unnecessary tension between that because

00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:16,289
in Japanese culture racing formally this

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,070
is really important then you have to

00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:22,740
think about the target culture as well

00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:26,789
right and then the next one is lesson

00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:28,620
learn done is better than perfect when

00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:29,220
you work alone you want everything to be

00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,559
perfect

00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:34,260
but if you are working with other people

00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:36,120
and then you have plan done is better

00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:40,230
than perfect the reason because there is

00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:42,750
a money involved agenda and then you to

00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:46,650
get that money some organization you

00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:51,210
need to go certain lengths to get that

00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:54,210
funding for your project so and then the

00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:57,210
organization also want to see the result

00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:59,730
of the money that they spend so they can

00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:04,830
justify to the taxpayer for instance or

00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:07,169
the larger organizations so then is

00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:12,780
whether the perfect is related to the

00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:16,559
priority stations 95% the liver is

00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:18,720
better than 100% is not delivered right

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:23,520
and then after that you can improve the

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:26,400
5% over time and then you are not a

00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,590
super man so you have to delegate some

00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,080
stuff if you are single factory you

00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:33,330
think you know everything

00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:34,830
and that you can do everything when you

00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:37,500
are working with other people you have

00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:39,360
to delay it like I'm doing this you're

00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:42,130
doing that and now we're going to touch

00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:44,260
that because that's your work

00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:49,090
and then we can do it if we can do

00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:51,970
everything parallely yes your don't be a

00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:54,280
Superman be offender source or Justice

00:27:51,970 --> 00:28:00,180
League depending on what religion you

00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:03,730
are means that a friend Justice League

00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:06,130
has they have different skill but they

00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:10,150
have the same goal this is what we are

00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:12,460
supposed to be assertive and the member

00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:14,350
of our vengeance or justice Li can

00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,790
change over time but the name is the

00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:18,520
same and the goal is the same

00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:21,100
that's what team or a group supposed to

00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:26,710
be like an organization or company

00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:28,510
especially just a group of people and

00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:32,110
again listening is not the same as

00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:35,680
hearing this is cause for sale for the

00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:38,110
people that sang the sang the things and

00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:40,600
then listening to the things because if

00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:42,100
you just hear the word like in the yeah

00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:47,290
I'm hearing the work but you don't

00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:52,390
actually act upon the words that you

00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:55,510
hear then the one saying it will not say

00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:57,040
to say it again to you and then you as a

00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:59,980
project manager for instance

00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:02,140
oh this developer is really nice I think

00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,990
the problem is gone because he never

00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:07,000
tell me any complaints again maybe

00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:08,830
because the project managers never

00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:14,080
listens and then developer doesn't want

00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:16,090
to tell the project manager again and as

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,320
some there is to more stuff assumption

00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:23,820
is your worst enemy to not assume just

00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:28,450
confirm that what you hear is actually

00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:32,170
what they meant do not assume if you

00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:33,520
don't and you don't know just pretend

00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:36,100
that you don't know anything and you

00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,950
just ask questions because when you ask

00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:41,050
question you may learn something new if

00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:44,250
you just talk then you just repeating

00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:44,250
yourself right you don't

00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:52,809
yeah and then what you need or what day

00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:54,580
one is what you want or what they need

00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:58,809
is probably not what you need or what

00:29:54,580 --> 00:30:01,149
they need use that as a basis so maybe

00:29:58,809 --> 00:30:03,070
you want the new cool stuff but probably

00:30:01,149 --> 00:30:06,570
that's what not what you need at the

00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:10,059
moment use the data right do we need

00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:12,249
Facebook M or Google and something like

00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:16,029
that oh because it's your stuff but then

00:30:12,249 --> 00:30:18,369
when you look at it from the data if you

00:30:16,029 --> 00:30:21,840
implement that probably there is no use

00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:25,110
so probably don't match up for that

00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:33,159
features to be implemented at the moment

00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:37,450
right and then this we have both

00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:39,279
sessions on 28th of September but

00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:41,529
sharing configuration in multi sat

00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:44,169
environment in Drupal 8

00:30:41,529 --> 00:30:47,259
please come and then sure your thoughts

00:30:44,169 --> 00:30:49,600
were it will have will show our

00:30:47,259 --> 00:30:51,460
experiments with features hang on

00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,070
figuration management in Drupal 8 and

00:30:51,460 --> 00:31:00,330
there will be other of people that will

00:30:54,070 --> 00:31:05,919
share they are set up as well right and

00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:11,139
then join us for contributions pin if

00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:13,389
you have not been in a sprin you can go

00:31:11,139 --> 00:31:15,490
to the first time spin to intern

00:31:13,389 --> 00:31:21,269
workshop and in the end of the session

00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:23,919
they usually have live Corp comments

00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:25,749
maybe there is an interesting stuff

00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:29,049
because last time there was a baby that

00:31:25,749 --> 00:31:31,779
took or commit they put they attack the

00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:33,539
baby on stage and they prayer and let

00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:35,619
the baby press the enter button

00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:38,409
it's pretty insane I don't know what

00:31:35,619 --> 00:31:45,519
they will have to do next

00:31:38,409 --> 00:31:49,419
right so what do you think about it you

00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:52,840
can send the software there and this is

00:31:49,419 --> 00:31:58,299
a question and discussion I don't know

00:31:52,840 --> 00:32:03,909
how many times we have I think we still

00:31:58,299 --> 00:32:10,570
have around 8 minutes or so or less what

00:32:03,909 --> 00:32:12,609
is finish right I don't think that I I

00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:15,249
don't think we have more time but if you

00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:20,850
have questions just approach me after

00:32:15,249 --> 00:32:20,850
decisions and then we can talk more

00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:27,699
