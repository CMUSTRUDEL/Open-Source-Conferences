Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: From a Single fighter to a Team player
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	I am going to share my experience working with drupal for the last 11 years.

I started developing drupal as a hobby working alone without financial incentive. After 11 years, I have been working in a team of 2-6 of a pan-european company, in team where I collaborate with multiple companies and helping a government body creating in-house drupal team.

In this session, I am going to share the transition that I had, the change of mindset I had and of course, the challenge I faced as a south-east-asian developer working in Europe.

After the session, the audience should know about

How to face your language barrier.
How to cope with social dan cultural differences.
How to deal with different organization cultures.
How to change a mindset from “I can do everything” to task delegation.
How it is “done” is better than “perfect”.
Hopefully we can have a insightful discussion in the Q&A session of this presentation.
