00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:50,160
Thunder distribution developers and I'm

00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:55,829
a media core contributor the last couple

00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:58,910
of days and years and working a lot with

00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:58,910
media stuff

00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:05,970
I'm Adam than approxima on dro I'll look

00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,010
at my own credentials here

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,590
I currently rock the lightning

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,810
distribution for Acquia I might help to

00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,180
maintain the media module and migrate

00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,790
subsystem in core currently been doing

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:23,400
this for 10 years and I make mistakes

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:25,560
all the time so okay well if everybody's

00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,200
introducing yourself I'm Sean I'm a

00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,270
freelance developer doing Drupal for 8

00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,729
plus years and now a media core

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,729
maintainer so yeah that's about it

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:46,030
okay so first we want to show you what's

00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:51,810
the current state and Drupal 8

00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:54,939
so with current state we mean until 8.3

00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,159
so we just have yeah

00:01:54,939 --> 00:02:00,250
file upload image upload you all know

00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:05,049
that you can add responsive images you

00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:07,539
can place images in busy week we have

00:02:05,049 --> 00:02:10,299
some accessibility features like you

00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:14,230
have to add I I'll tie it I'll take and

00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:19,030
title tag and just basic file listing so

00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:25,959
yeah just basic integration not nice

00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:28,329
things so what we currently cannot do is

00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:31,000
reuse media so you have to upload an

00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:32,650
image every time you want to use it so

00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,060
if you want to reuse an image it's not

00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,329
possible to use symmetry already

00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:38,950
uploaded you have to upload it again

00:02:36,329 --> 00:02:41,170
yeah we don't have a site-wide media

00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:43,150
library that's what I said

00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:46,299
we have no support for any remote stuff

00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:48,430
so just support for uploading images or

00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:50,859
files but it's not possible to add

00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:54,819
YouTube stuff Twitter stuff and other

00:02:50,859 --> 00:02:59,709
remote media and we are not able to

00:02:54,819 --> 00:03:03,819
attach metadata to all these to the

00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:07,120
files so just title tag and all check

00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:10,030
what you can do currently and we have

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,950
like upload yeah you can upload two

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,950
images for five field that's it

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:20,500
in contrib space we are having file

00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:22,569
entity which extends the file

00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:26,980
functionality a bit so that you can

00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:29,349
attach fields to files but you shouldn't

00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:32,739
use it because yeah it's outdated and

00:03:29,349 --> 00:03:34,329
there's no maintenance anymore and if

00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:37,959
you're looking for something in contrib

00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:41,280
space you should use media entity which

00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:43,660
has support for remote staff and

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,159
integrations for image and file uploads

00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:47,159
and stuff like that

00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:59,900
so in contrabass we have yeah

00:03:52,580 --> 00:04:04,070
advanced eco media ecosystem that grown

00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:08,300
in the last years you can use entity

00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:14,560
browser which is really powerful you can

00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:18,140
embed videos you can embed anything with

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,750
with entity embed and you have crop

00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:27,220
functionality for yeah setting focal

00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:35,000
points or creating crops out of images

00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:37,820
so media initiative okay so as

00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,180
Christiane just described the ecosystem

00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:43,430
around media is in mostly in contributed

00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,680
the box with Drupal 8 mostly coalesced

00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:47,330
around media entity and all those

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,490
modules he just mentioned the media

00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:52,100
initiative aims to bring a significant

00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,240
amount of this into core there will the

00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:56,870
overarching goals of the media

00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:59,930
initiative of which we are part is to

00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,820
implement in Drupal the basic media

00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,170
handling you would expect in any CMS you

00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,760
know and okay we're all thinking

00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:08,810
WordPress I was thinking WordPress when

00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:10,640
I wrote that you know and also but

00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:11,930
because this is Drupal we don't just

00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,750
want to stop there we want to have an

00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:16,400
API in place so that you can extend that

00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,640
customize it you know integrate with

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,570
more stuff and by integrate with more

00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,360
stuff I'm talking about third-party

00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:24,740
media services i'm talking about dams so

00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,990
it has to be very flexible it has to be

00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:30,530
very drupal Drupal II the good parts a

00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,420
good way of Drupal II so the media

00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,950
initiative has three phases phase one is

00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:37,060
the current one and we're calling it

00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:39,110
essentials and the goals of the

00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:43,370
essentials or the first phase of the

00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:45,890
media initiative are to define the api's

00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:49,630
in core that support media handling and

00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:52,190
drupal it's also to have parity like

00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:54,470
interface parity user interface parity

00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:56,660
with the core file and image modules

00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:58,280
because out of the box the two types of

00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,600
media the core actually supports our

00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,790
files and images and if we

00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,410
people to start using the new media

00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:07,410
system we're going to have to make damn

00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:09,630
sure that they can use file and image it

00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:12,300
files and images with as much ease as

00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:15,180
they are used to we also want to bring

00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,470
in a media library so that as Christiane

00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:18,270
just said you can no long you currently

00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,720
can't reuse files and images you have to

00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:23,430
re-upload them well we're gonna fix that

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,350
we want to support Oh embed media so

00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,210
like YouTube is an example of that which

00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:31,140
is a very nice and easy way to support

00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:33,120
remote remote media in core most of this

00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,460
stuff is targeted for Drupal 8.5 and so

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,930
far it's looking pretty good then we

00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,090
want to tackle embedding all this stuff

00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,060
into a WYSIWYG because that's obviously

00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:44,490
pretty crucial a little bit harder looks

00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:47,820
like it's gonna be 8.6 but hopefully

00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:50,510
we'll be able to accelerate that phase 2

00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:53,730
of the media initiative is the extras

00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:56,190
the extras phase and that's all taking

00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:58,710
place in contribs base and that's shiny

00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:02,160
things built on top of the relatively

00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:06,270
spare core media API so like multi image

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:09,530
upload cropping you know really awesome

00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:11,640
you know browsing for files media items

00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:13,020
cooler things you can do with embedding

00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:21,840
I dunno the possibilities are endless

00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:25,020
its contributor realises in contribute

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,690
into core but that's don't you know you

00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,130
didn't hear from me and then the third

00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,690
phase of the media initiative is pretty

00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,370
far off in the future right now it's

00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:33,960
called the extend phase and this is

00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:36,990
again all in contribs space and this is

00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:39,890
really about integrating drupal's media

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:42,900
system providing the tools to really

00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:44,430
cleanly integrate Drupal's media system

00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,530
with third-party dams and stuff like

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:49,020
that because Drupal is really really

00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:50,690
flexible but sometimes you know you just

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,830
want to use another system that has

00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:54,510
solved a lot of the really hard problems

00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,490
Media can get complicated you could have

00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,960
like geo things licensing things adverts

00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:01,550
I don't you know I don't know the

00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,360
problem space that well personally but

00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:05,570
we want to be able to integrate with

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,970
those services that handle it better

00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:10,740
rather than roll it all ourselves

00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:16,840
so on you want to cover this part

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:18,280
okay so the architecture dad what's

00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,230
really important is we try to make use

00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:25,510
of the standard API so it's already in

00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:28,570
core so media entity is core content and

00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:30,100
II just like notice for example then we

00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,320
have the media types that are config and

00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:35,190
these just like no types are so nothing

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:39,820
new is going on here then we have a new

00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:44,370
situation going on with the source

00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:47,590
plugins like media has a kind of

00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:50,050
reusable situation where you could have

00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:52,630
like a Facebook plug-in that could

00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:55,330
provide the integration with the

00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:57,730
Facebook ID and maybe an author or

00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:01,780
whatever and you can have multiple types

00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:04,750
of sources for a situation so you have

00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:07,750
like an image you can have like logos or

00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,610
maybe some other types of images you can

00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,030
have meat different media types that are

00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,650
all using the same source plug-in and

00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:17,950
let me just dive into that a little

00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:20,830
deeper so each media type is associated

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:22,510
with one source plug-in like I said for

00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:24,430
images for example you can have logos or

00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:27,250
flyers or whatever they can all be

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:29,590
separate media types the media source

00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,980
will be responsible for the logic how

00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:36,310
its saved so you have like a file ID

00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:39,160
that's saved for a specific type also

00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:43,200
the validation and the metadata you can

00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,200
have different types of metadata

00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:52,960
associated with a specific source

00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,900
plug-in so you can have an author of an

00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:58,830
image you can have the width the height

00:09:54,900 --> 00:10:02,380
all types of stuff that could come in

00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:06,600
for a source we can also store that and

00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:09,430
the media source is handling how the

00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:13,330
actual source is providing the data to

00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:18,940
your media type and like the

00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:20,560
configurable field situation is when you

00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,760
want to store the metadata you just

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,310
define the fields like you would

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,440
normally do for a note just put a few

00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:28,600
in your media type and every type of

00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:31,620
metadata liked an author or width or

00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:34,510
height just store it in those fields

00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:41,290
it's really a complex situation I hope I

00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:44,980
explained it okay so the media library

00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:46,360
is the second thing we want to have like

00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,900
a parrot down version of what's already

00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,420
happening in other situations so we have

00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:55,180
like the entity browser is already

00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,490
providing a great solution for picking

00:10:55,180 --> 00:11:00,339
different types of picking different

00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:04,120
media entities right now and we also

00:11:00,339 --> 00:11:06,790
looked at other systems just to provide

00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,250
a good way to reuse media and it's not

00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:13,270
an API so you won't be able to extend

00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:16,650
the core media library we just provide

00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:19,060
like a 80% use case and make sure that

00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:24,820
we solve that and if you want to do

00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:26,740
something special just do it in contribs

00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,660
will be done through a regular View mode

00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:36,730
so you can basically configure that how

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:38,170
you want and yeah just the way you just

00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:40,480
add that to a field

00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:42,730
it's a widget for a regular and the

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,890
reference field so just configure that

00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:49,290
on your view mode or if you're on your

00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:49,290
form sorry and then it will just work

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,670
the creation part of the media library

00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:58,030
would be really nice to have but it's

00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:00,280
not part of our plan for the MVP like

00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:05,920
the the valuable the minimum valuable

00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:09,700
product product so sorry and it will be

00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:13,750
in a separate module so we have a media

00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:15,850
in core right now but the media library

00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:19,089
will be in a separate module and will be

00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:22,839
experimental at first and we can work on

00:12:19,089 --> 00:12:28,300
that in a separate situation so yeah

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:31,510
it's it's not storing any data so this

00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:34,780
is a image of what we are working

00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:37,990
towards this will probably not be the

00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:41,110
MVP as we call it but

00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:43,089
this is yeah basically something that we

00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:46,149
created to just keep in mind where we

00:12:43,089 --> 00:12:48,310
want to go and like what I said this the

00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:51,700
creation part will probably not be in

00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:55,870
there we are looking at the tabs and

00:12:51,700 --> 00:13:02,620
just being able to select just different

00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:10,810
types of media and add it but yeah we're

00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:16,180
working hard on its butts complex so so

00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:18,520
next topic our roadmap what's already

00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:28,480
done we have media entity module in core

00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:33,180
yay and we renamed it to media so don't

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:36,970
be confused we also have plug-ins for

00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:39,910
document and images so that's already

00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:43,480
working and yeah we have a stable a

00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:46,300
stable API so media module went in a

00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:50,860
stable so you can rely on that and it's

00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:52,480
no experimental phase before some things

00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:56,649
we are where we are currently working on

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:59,740
is the migration path from media entity

00:13:56,649 --> 00:14:02,410
to media in core so this migration path

00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:05,470
will happen in new branch of the media

00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:07,329
entity module so there will be a to

00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:11,529
latex front for media entity and this

00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:14,110
branch will probably just just have the

00:14:11,529 --> 00:14:16,660
yeah the upgrade path and no other code

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:22,240
so that's our plan how we will do the

00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:25,120
updates we have to implement widgets for

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,480
media reference fields that we have

00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:34,029
parity with the current situation in

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:36,459
core for files and end images and of

00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:39,730
course we need migration paths for

00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:43,959
violent image this is all targeted for

00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:48,880
f85 and as Sean said media library is

00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:50,350
targeted for 86 so other smaller issues

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,160
we are working on is per bundle

00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:55,329
permissions

00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:56,620
maybe this will go in a Drupal con I

00:14:55,329 --> 00:14:59,260
hope so

00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:03,820
new sauce plugins for all embed support

00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:07,510
so that you can use can add media types

00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:11,279
with for for YouTube or Vimeo or stuff

00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:16,420
like that yeah code improvements and

00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:18,850
improved metadata mapping so it's just a

00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:22,089
short overview if you want to look

00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:31,900
deeper in it there is a road map issue

00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:34,150
with all the tasks and so one of the

00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:36,160
things Christian just mentioned was the

00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:37,810
migration path that's more I would use

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,120
the word cross grade to describe that

00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:41,500
because you have all you have media

00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,660
entity you have all these modules built

00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:47,079
on top of media entity with media entity

00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:48,850
as a dependency media entity is going to

00:15:47,079 --> 00:15:50,949
have as he mentioned a two point X

00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:54,550
branch and all that two point X branch

00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:59,079
is gonna do is turn off

00:15:54,550 --> 00:16:00,699
media entity and turn on core media so

00:15:59,079 --> 00:16:03,459
what that means is that we have to have

00:16:00,699 --> 00:16:06,630
all of those modules that currently rely

00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:10,089
on media entity they have to start using

00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:11,500
the the core media API so we have to

00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:14,050
port those we're sprinting on that here

00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:18,160
at Drupal con help us out please

00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:19,600
but anyway so how do you port your

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,829
module that's been integrated with media

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,410
entity if you've written a custom module

00:16:20,829 --> 00:16:25,510
that has a dependency on media entity

00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:27,040
uses some of its features or some of its

00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:31,870
api's we wrote a really good change

00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:34,180
record to 8 6 3 992 if you can't see

00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:36,250
that which describes exactly what you

00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,050
have to change you know use this

00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,730
interface instead of that interface you

00:16:38,050 --> 00:16:41,620
know extend this class instead of that

00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:43,570
one stop calling this method stuff like

00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:47,140
that it's actually pretty

00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:51,850
straightforward if for any coders should

00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:54,670
be so yeah when you want to start with

00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:56,020
Drupal 8 right now watches use as much

00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:57,850
as it pains gonna say it continue to use

00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:00,040
media entity for now just because we

00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,490
haven't finished the cross grade paths

00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,320
for all

00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:04,179
of media entities ecosystem but once we

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,339
have you should use core media and media

00:17:04,179 --> 00:17:08,949
entity will be deprecated and we will

00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:12,370
update its project page on geo to say as

00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:13,809
much and I just realized the third

00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:18,339
question is basically the same one as

00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:20,740
the second but yeah you can use so once

00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:23,170
your based I think the main point here

00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,689
is once you're using core media you can

00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:29,890
use any other control that is built on

00:17:25,689 --> 00:17:31,300
core media pretty simple you know and if

00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,730
you're gonna be using a control it still

00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:35,140
needs media entity well you're probably

00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:40,300
have conflicts and maybe should upgrade

00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:41,620
that module yeah I think that's that so

00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:44,500
we can always use all the help we can

00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:46,059
get with this stuff and as I just

00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,220
mentioned the most important thing right

00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:50,740
now for us is to pour it all with the

00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:52,630
you know 8.4 is about to come out and

00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,650
you know the media module is in there so

00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:55,900
people are going to want to switch to

00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:57,340
this and so all of the at least at the

00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:59,920
very least we want to have the top 10

00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,720
most used contribute equations with

00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:03,160
media entity to be ported over to core

00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,380
media that's what we're mainly sprinting

00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:08,350
on here so if you have module authoring

00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,910
experience by all means help us out if

00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:12,900
you want to join our initiative meetings

00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:16,420
it's in the Drupal media IRC channel on

00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,730
IRC every Wednesday at 3:00 Greenwich

00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,260
Mean Time and us three can be caught

00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,300
contacted or Gabor

00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:27,900
wherever he is I don't think he's here

00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:31,320
and yeah that's it I guess so thank you

00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,320
any questions

00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:44,019
if you have questions then the mic yes

00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:47,049
yeah let's come up with mine so one of

00:18:44,019 --> 00:18:49,750
the last things you mentioned is that if

00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:52,720
you need to rely on a contribute that is

00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:55,419
not has not been ported yet to the core

00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:58,539
media entity you should do that with

00:18:55,419 --> 00:19:01,690
care because generally that would force

00:18:58,539 --> 00:19:04,690
you to rely on media entity on the media

00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:08,409
entity entity type if you have budget

00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:11,379
would it make sense to work on porting

00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:15,000
the the country module yeah of course so

00:19:11,379 --> 00:19:17,070
that is what you would recommend so the

00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,110
maintainer of the model should

00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:22,570
definitely accept this as a proposal

00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:24,039
okay this is the right way to move

00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:25,450
forward right yes

00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:28,090
I mean media entity is going to be

00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:30,039
deprecated anyway so if they're gonna

00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:31,509
clear stubbornly insisting on relying on

00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:59,620
media entity and I don't know why they

00:19:31,509 --> 00:20:01,659
would then that sounds like a great

00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,820
start to things but one thing that I

00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:07,299
didn't understand the reasoning behind

00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:10,659
was you're saying that the library

00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:13,090
browser would not be extensible that

00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:14,590
feels like the wrong decision to me well

00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:17,799
not being extensible made it sound

00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:19,750
scarier than it actually is by not

00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,200
extensible maybe that yeah that was

00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:23,390
actually pretty bad

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,580
it's just we just mean it's not an API

00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,960
it's not gonna have classes that you can

00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,520
extend right think that it is gonna use

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,350
views and it's gonna use like a

00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,910
configurable view so like if you want to

00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,290
change the filters or whatever that we

00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:44,720
give you in the media library you will

00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:45,800
be able to do stuff like that yes we

00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:54,710
wouldn't lock you down to one thing

00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:58,610
because everybody would hate us yes hi

00:20:54,710 --> 00:21:00,710
so when Drupal 8 came out the only sort

00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:05,600
of media as such that it handled his

00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:07,880
images and they were image fields but so

00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,790
my question is about when we bring

00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:14,930
things like video and audio into Drupal

00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:16,430
we have an opportunity to manage the

00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:19,040
other stuff that goes around without

00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:23,180
like captions and transcripts and so on

00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:25,550
and so if you add like video videos

00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:29,000
which were files that lived on your own

00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:31,790
Drupal installation you could maybe you

00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,520
you know how would you manage captions

00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:37,580
and transcripts there especially when

00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,410
you might have a mixed media thing where

00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,420
some of the videos are on your own site

00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:44,120
and some come from YouTube and some come

00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:48,460
from Vimeo or whatever and they have

00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:50,690
their own like ways of handling

00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,990
transcripts and captions is do you think

00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:56,150
there could be an API level type thing

00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:58,070
or where in the structure would it be

00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,750
with your being core or controlling I

00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:01,550
think you could already do that the way

00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:04,580
I would do that is I would create two

00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:06,950
media types right so as I think Sean

00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:08,480
said every media type has every media

00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,980
type must be associated with one source

00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,620
plug-in and the source plugin is really

00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:14,150
the heavy hitter in a media type it sort

00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:17,120
of determines it's really the bridge

00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:18,950
between sort of Drupal and whatever the

00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,780
media actually is like if it's YouTube

00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:24,590
Vimeo or just some video file on your

00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:26,420
hard drive somewhere so the source

00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:28,940
plug-in is responsible for being able to

00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:30,980
say like oh can it's like oh hello

00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,080
Vimeo plug-in can you get me a caption

00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:34,669
for this video and it could maybe talk

00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,759
to Vimeo and then get that back and then

00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:40,279
you could handle that differently for a

00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:42,499
local video plugin for example or a

00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:45,109
local video media type

00:22:42,499 --> 00:22:47,690
so essentially yet we already have that

00:22:45,109 --> 00:22:49,249
API already exists and do you think

00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:52,220
that's gonna be so stuff that will have

00:22:49,249 --> 00:22:55,299
sensible like defaults or stuff included

00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:58,419
in core or it's not more something that

00:22:55,299 --> 00:23:01,340
contributing needs to take into account

00:22:58,419 --> 00:23:03,019
I mean in core is not going to have that

00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:05,659
core only has 2 media types to start

00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:07,820
with it has file and image and we I

00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:36,230
think we have sensible defaults provided

00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:43,549
for those right yeah but you know TLDR

00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:52,629
the API exists thank you yeah gotcha

00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:55,850
okay sorry I juices more you mentioned

00:23:52,629 --> 00:23:57,230
Facebook and Twitter and like the new

00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,269
standard when it comes to like you know

00:23:57,230 --> 00:24:00,379
uploading media and stuff like that

00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:03,379
is there any part of the initiative

00:24:00,379 --> 00:24:05,480
that's like concentrating on the UX of

00:24:03,379 --> 00:24:08,570
the whole deal you know is it gonna be

00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,549
JavaScript is it gonna be some nice you

00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:15,980
know ways of like actually uploading the

00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:17,749
content for the editor I don't you know

00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,919
it's that's a really advanced question

00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,909
in the sense that I don't even I don't

00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:23,330
even think I've thought about that

00:24:19,909 --> 00:24:25,489
before yet um I don't think we're

00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:28,809
thinking about that right now I

00:24:25,489 --> 00:24:31,970
certainly wouldn't be opposed to having

00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:34,549
you know I like I like nice you eyes I'm

00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:37,909
only human you know so and I think we

00:24:34,549 --> 00:24:39,529
all do so I don't know if we're gonna

00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,820
have like really nice JavaScript to you

00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:42,919
eyes for dealing with this stuff and

00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:45,440
like there's also a certain you know

00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:46,759
there's there's like certain limitations

00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,570
of what we can do with just cores

00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:49,830
toolkits you know now granted

00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,990
we end up getting like a JavaScript

00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,730
framework in core maybe and you know

00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:55,320
things start changing on that front end

00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:57,120
quite possibly but I don't think that

00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:59,850
the initiative that the media initiative

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:19,919
is necessarily concentrating on that in

00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:21,629
all honesty that's true the users are

00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,980
gonna see it we always check with UX

00:25:21,629 --> 00:25:26,250
people to make sure it makes sense

00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:27,929
before we commit it you know yeah so

00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:30,299
yeah I think I think that's all the time

00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:32,779
we got okay well sorry but we have a

00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:35,850
ball so if you have more questions mama

00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:38,750
can I do one more one more pretty please

00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:41,399
come on okay go ahead

00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:43,679
thanks for representation for me that

00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:46,139
them work for a big organization having

00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,570
a lot of large websites building Drupal

00:25:46,139 --> 00:25:50,970
and the fine management causes us two

00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:53,399
main problems we don't have publication

00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:56,220
walkthrough for files and secondly it's

00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:58,320
not as search translatable so are you

00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,759
gonna address that and if you have an

00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,690
idea of when that will be addressed

00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,409
thank you

00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,710
well it's an interesting question

00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:07,850
because the difference like one of the

00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,850
