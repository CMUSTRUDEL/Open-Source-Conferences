Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Know your teams, Know your customers
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	Managing developers and serving customers all around the globe could be very challenging.

This goes for outsourcing projects to developing countries, to onboarding developers from different countries.

Nowadays, cultural differences become more critical aspects of an organization globally-- multicultural team and multicultural customers. Statistics say that 6 out of 10 projects fail due to cultural difference. Cultural difference has a great impact on business activity for any organization.

A cross culture competent organization can increase their business activities and facilitates to become more effective at team and customer level. On the other hand, failure in managing cultural differences can lead to project failure and also restricts the business activity within the smaller area.

In this session, you will learn

What is Intercultural management?
Dimensions of studying cultural difference.
How an organization can become cross culture competent and can make a business around the globe.
Also, a couple of examples ( from US, UK, France & India) which would clearly show how cross-cultural competencies are important to build a productive team and also serving the customers globally. 

How different members in the project team has different perception and are bound to different cultural tastes?
What are their perception of the time, quality and the commitments?
How they behave in a complex situation (Power Distance, Individualism, Uncertainty Avoidance).
Relationships, Trusts, Contexts, and Control.

create problem for my Drupal team so

00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,720
because I know stuff so they feel very

00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:57,630
conserved while sharing like

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,759
implementation with me but yeah I used

00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:03,180
to check them so I used to keep eye on

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:06,630
them so I work in multicultural

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:10,379
environment so a DX has like more than

providing Drupal solutions to

00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:20,300
international clients before addicts I

00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:22,990
was working with platform assets so in

00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:25,970
Paris I worked with platform message and

00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:29,090
prior to platform message I was working

00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:32,120
in India so in Drupal company's region

00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:34,040
technologies so yeah all three companies

00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,780
are here so all three companies are

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:41,120
Drupal sponsors yeah so quick agenda

00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:42,860
what I'm going to be talking about so

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,330
I'm going to talk about intercultural

00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:50,210
management so why it's important and

00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:52,940
then managing intern cultural team

00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:55,450
cross-cultural team and also serving

00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:59,210
international clients from the front

00:02:55,450 --> 00:03:01,430
geographical region and then my second

00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:03,380
part would be like talking about culture

00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:07,130
I know culture is like very sensitive

00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:10,370
topic but these are my observation so I

00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:13,040
put some of my findings for analyzing

00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:15,710
cultural difference and studying

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:23,900
cultural difference and also in the last

00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:26,270
to become a cross culture competent yeah

00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:29,660
so definition says intercultural

00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:33,770
management is interdisciplinary human

00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:36,650
resourceful for managing communication

00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:39,590
effective interactions between personal

00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:44,090
and customers across body so this

00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:47,270
definition seems hard so I simplified it

00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:49,760
here so what I mean from intercultural

00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:52,070
management so it's like managing

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,160
international team building a new

00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:58,820
culture by analyzing existing difference

00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:01,360
in culture and then providing solutions

00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:04,090
if you have like conflicts in your

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,220
multicultural team and different

00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:10,100
perception of your clients for getting

00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:13,100
requirements in project model project

00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:15,709
development model and also linking

00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:17,799
different cultural difference to come up

00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:20,840
with like International Strategy

00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:22,600
International we can make our like

00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:26,380
international culture for our

00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:29,840
multicultural team so I put like this

00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:33,320
so why intercultural management is

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:35,900
important so first so it's like getting

00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:39,410
international markets getting business

00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:42,290
from from across the globe

00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:45,170
so serving customers across the globe

00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:47,240
and then if you have customers and if

00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:50,300
you have international market then you

00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,670
need to analyze your international

00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,400
customer needs and for that you will

00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:58,400
need multicultural team so some members

00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:01,400
in your team from your local market so

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,490
that they can analyze needs requirement

00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:06,950
for your customer and if you have

00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,280
multicultural teams then obviously you

00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:12,590
will have cross culture conflict so

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,780
intercultural management's provides

00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:18,040
knowledge with dealing with this

00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:21,710
cross-cultural conflict and based upon

00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:24,860
different cultures so based upon culture

00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:27,830
difference we can come up with like a

00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:30,580
common strategy coming with implementing

00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:33,650
major cultural change in your team and

00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:36,770
last one is situation where classical

00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:39,950
management model doesn't work so by this

00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:44,570
I mean so we used to follow more US

00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:46,760
culture and our model in IT so if you

00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,680
have team members from different culture

00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:51,070
and they will have different style of

00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:55,780
working different style of thinking

00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:58,880
manipulating so this can help so having

00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:04,400
different win-win situation win-win a

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:08,300
strategy for your team so I put two big

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:11,390
challenge so one is very common I think

00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:14,690
we all are working in multicultural

00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:18,110
environment so quick questions so how

00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:20,750
many you have a multicultural team so

00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:26,000
yeah it's common and how many you have

00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:30,350
remote teams yeah okay nice and how many

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,630
have a multicultural remote teams No so

00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:35,539
my findings are going to be interesting

00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:37,760
for you so a second challenges are you

00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:39,590
moving to a new country and the European

00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:42,140
Union this was mine case

00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:46,390
so two years back I moved to France and

00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:50,150
I came in a group like 40 members from

00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:54,230
23 countries so I started living a

00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:56,270
working playing with them so 23

00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:59,840
countries and that was like tough for me

00:06:56,270 --> 00:07:02,920
from India from high context culture

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,770
from high power distance I came in

00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:09,230
people with so I have Germans colleagues

00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:12,500
British colleagues Americans so there

00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:15,080
are lots of cross culture conflicts so

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:19,400
that's why I try to put all of them and

00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:21,290
that so maybe you all are not agree with

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,280
those points but these are like my

00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:27,320
personal observation so here so I put

00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,800
just a definition of culture what

00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:33,800
culture means so culture is very vast

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:36,110
topic so I just put like it's different

00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,600
set of values and norms which our

00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:41,690
society follows and which comes with

00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:44,930
different ways of thinking and can be

00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:47,720
adopted at large scale so at mass level

00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:52,100
and that brings culture and if you have

00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:54,440
different norms and those norms come out

00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:57,130
with difference cultural difference so

00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,690
there is an interesting topological

00:07:57,130 --> 00:08:03,920
steady I'm sorry

00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:07,670
so from hostel a hostel II and says a

00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:11,660
culture is a software of the mind so

00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:15,320
here I put all common problems so we all

00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:18,320
have multicultural remote teams and so I

00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:22,520
put all common problems here so first

00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:25,910
one is communication style so at most of

00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:28,430
the workplace in Europe as well we have

00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:30,800
English as a common language so I work

00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:33,770
in France so I work in French culture

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:37,340
but we still have English as a common

00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:39,620
language at workplace but and in France

00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:44,720
we have people from different European

00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:48,590
countries so same in like in my group so

00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,990
having like members from 23 countries so

00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:53,580
they all have their different accents

00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:57,060
different fluency

00:08:53,580 --> 00:09:00,660
and so those were like creating problem

00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:03,540
for native speakers so in India so in

00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:11,220
India we have our language but most of

00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:13,560
the time we speak English so okay sorry

00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:21,710
so yeah first time I'm trying with this

00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:21,710
mic so that's why not really high so

00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:42,960
it's okay okay so first is linguistic

00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:46,320
issue no okay so a linguistic issue in

00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:49,380
linguistic issue I put like if a project

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,840
manager from a high context culture and

00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,970
having English as a native language and

00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,640
if you have a team members from

00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,710
different European countries having

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,110
members having English as a like second

00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:03,630
and third language so they will have

00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:05,640
like different fluency so most of the

00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:08,220
time you will struggle hard to

00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:11,010
understand them so every time you will

00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:14,010
try to understand them by asking like

00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:17,190
questions double sure so that will

00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:19,680
create problem so sometimes most of the

00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:23,060
times I can say like creates problems

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:28,380
with my team so my team is based in

00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:29,880
Ukraine Russia so and they are more they

00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:32,400
are not using English as a first

00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:34,980
language so this is like common problem

00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:38,820
which I observe working with Europeans

00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:41,880
and also with my team second is high

00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,280
context and low context so this is very

00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:47,850
interesting for me high context and low

00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:50,760
context so by this I mean like indirect

00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:53,610
and direct communication so if you have

00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:57,300
a team member from high context culture

00:10:53,610 --> 00:11:00,090
then instruction will not be clear so

00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,760
there can be like many hidden astruc and

00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:05,760
instruction and your team member from

00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,180
low context culture will not understand

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,270
and

00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:12,390
if you have a project manager from

00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:14,779
low-context culture then everything will

00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:17,399
be like more communications or lots of

00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:21,660
communication your team member may not

00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:24,990
like that so a tone challenge so it's

00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:27,750
interesting so I talked about fluency in

00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:31,230
every culture we have different tones

00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:34,709
for expressing our ideas expressing our

00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:37,140
emotions so in some culture having high

00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:41,459
tone let's say if you have idea so

00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:44,459
Germans Germans used to share ideas at

00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:48,480
broader level so they used to have like

00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:52,410
high hype high sound that may be a

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:56,850
problem for team members from Southeast

00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:59,760
Asia Japan China China China India so

00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:02,160
for them like but low tone is more

00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:05,459
adequate so they share ideas with low

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:12,510
tone so this is a common problem so

00:12:05,459 --> 00:12:15,060
which I faced verbal and textual

00:12:12,510 --> 00:12:18,089
communication so this is again related

00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:21,000
to linguistic issue so let's say if you

00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:25,320
have team member who has not so much

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:28,260
comfortable in English so he will prefer

00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:32,300
to have textual conversation with you in

00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:35,459
which he can use Google Translate and

00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:37,650
other translation tools to understand

00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:39,600
you and if you have a native speaker

00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:43,589
then they will prefer to have more

00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:47,720
verbal communication so this is dicey

00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:50,400
for me so in in my team so I have

00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,190
members team members having like English

00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:55,560
as a native language and English as a

00:12:53,190 --> 00:13:00,120
second third language so I used to

00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:02,120
maintain balance between all team

00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:04,170
members some prefer to have verbal

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,920
communication some prefer to have

00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:10,980
textual communication and last one in

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,470
communication is unfamiliar words so by

00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:16,890
this I mean so in some culture we have

00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:19,079
slang we have we used to have some

00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:19,649
sarcasm so some of your team members

00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:22,829
will not

00:13:19,649 --> 00:13:25,170
understand so here so a one incident

00:13:22,829 --> 00:13:29,339
happened with me last week when I was

00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:33,209
coming here so ex person in my company

00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:35,999
asked about why person and I shared ok

00:13:33,209 --> 00:13:37,889
that X person is in godown so I was

00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:41,040
telling that that person is in

00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:44,189
downstairs in storeroom so I used go

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,679
downward and French colleague was lost

00:13:44,189 --> 00:13:49,199
what does mean go down and then I

00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:51,240
quickly checked on Internet go down is

00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,360
more family here in eastern Asia

00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:57,449
so that means warehouse so yeah

00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:01,769
sometimes we use these kind of words so

00:13:57,449 --> 00:14:03,929
that's create like confusion so here so

00:14:01,769 --> 00:14:06,480
I checked on Internet and then came so

00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:11,970
this word is go down is more popular in

00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:14,279
Asia so if you have different

00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:17,129
communication style then you will have

00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:19,910
conflicts in your team so it's I think

00:14:17,129 --> 00:14:23,699
so so this this is very common in

00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:28,259
multicultural team so conflicts happens

00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:31,069
due to a different understanding so

00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:35,329
different misunderstanding we can say

00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:37,889
different perception for rules for

00:14:35,329 --> 00:14:41,550
responsibilities at social and

00:14:37,889 --> 00:14:43,709
professional level so it's if you are in

00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:46,199
a cross-cultural environment then it's

00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:50,399
important to know culture at social

00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:52,860
level as well so I used to get lots of

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:56,519
information lots of insights of

00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:59,160
different cultures over lunch and so I

00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:01,769
came with different disagreement so

00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:07,319
that's why I put conflicts can happen at

00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:10,949
social and professional level so team

00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:14,309
are individual so in a team if you have

00:15:10,949 --> 00:15:16,889
members from similar culture same

00:15:14,309 --> 00:15:20,009
culture and if they have conflicts and

00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:22,339
you are alone from different culture

00:15:20,009 --> 00:15:26,369
then there will be a problem in

00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:29,970
resolving those conflicts so maybe your

00:15:26,369 --> 00:15:31,980
team can be like biased so they will not

00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,930
support you because they belongs to same

00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,630
culture

00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:38,690
and so if you are alone then you can't

00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:41,570
hear a team level and if they are like

00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:43,610
in a group they have same concerned and

00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:46,310
they will prefer to share them at team

00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:48,800
level and this can be a problem for

00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:51,640
leader for project manager from the

00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,640
friend culture

00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:58,550
face to face again so it's like having a

00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:01,370
high context and low context culture so

00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:04,070
some some of your team members will

00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:07,820
prefer to resolve conflicts face to face

00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:10,640
and if you have a problem with your team

00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:13,700
member and he is not a native speaker so

00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:16,880
then he will try to solve conflict over

00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:21,860
a textual conversation this happened to

00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:24,200
me so I was not happy with my one of

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:27,440
team member so he was not meeting

00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:30,470
expectation and I shared lots of concern

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,870
and in the end he shared so I can't

00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:36,380
speak in English so I can't share my

00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:38,959
ideas I can't share my concern so it's

00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:42,140
better to have textual conversation so

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:44,750
so that's why I put this is a common

00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,760
problem in multicultural team for

00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:51,050
resolving problems for resolving

00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:53,959
conflicts body language body language is

00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:56,209
also important so if you are a native

00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:59,300
speaker then you will be more strong in

00:16:56,209 --> 00:17:02,450
body language and that can bring

00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:05,030
confidence of bring down confidence of

00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:07,910
your team number a team member so there

00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:09,910
were multiple problems in my team so

00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:13,760
because of body language so sometimes

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:16,189
they were not preferring to have visual

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,400
conversation over video call because

00:17:16,189 --> 00:17:21,350
they were not comfortable in English so

00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:25,579
it's all about language and

00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:27,770
communication style so task completion

00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:30,140
so this is interesting so in different

00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:33,380
cultures so we have monochronic

00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:37,100
polychronic people so monochronic people

00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:39,740
so used to work on one task at one time

00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:42,800
for them time and commitment is more

00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:45,800
important and if you have polychronic

00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,400
team member then polychronic team member

00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,280
will have

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:53,150
multiple tasks in multiple direction and

00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:55,190
so in in our model so in project

00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:58,550
development model let's have an example

00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:01,430
let's say if you you had stand up in the

00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:04,010
morning and you shared what's like our

00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:06,470
daily tasks so what are like today's

00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:08,630
delivery you shared that with your team

00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:11,270
member and if you have like from

00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:13,520
monochronic background and few of them

00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:16,220
from polychronic background so

00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,950
monochronic people monochronic team

00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:21,170
member will oppose your priority because

00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:23,690
you already shared priority with them in

00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:26,330
the morning and if you are let's say you

00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:29,270
discussed some some problem with clients

00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:32,780
and clients asking just to resolve this

00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:35,990
issue leave everything behind so here

00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:38,390
your pani polychronic team member will

00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:42,320
pick that task while monochronic will

00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:45,230
not so this will create team conflict so

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:48,410
because Manu for Manu cronic it's like

00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:50,810
working on one task within timeline with

00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:55,010
in deadline and for polychronic it's

00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:57,650
interesting he can pick mixed his eye to

00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:01,460
details so it's again so it's my

00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:03,980
observation so I got one requirement

00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,440
from client and for this requirements I

00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:09,470
I was not having like much clarity I

00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,660
asked my team member to provide solution

00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:15,080
and those team members let's say are

00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:18,860
from low context culture so they will

00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:20,930
ask for more details because there may

00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:24,530
be situation your client is not aware

00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:26,780
what what's the solution and your client

00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:30,500
asked you to provide that solution and

00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:32,930
you have a low context team member and

00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:35,660
low context team member will ask for

00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:39,760
more details and you don't have so this

00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:42,260
is a problem so and in polychronic in

00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,270
flexible so if your team member is

00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:47,300
flexible then they can have ok let's

00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:50,570
start let's see but monochronic will not

00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:53,960
give you a favor so this is a problem so

00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:56,720
this problem is more common in agile so

00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,320
if you have low context team member then

00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:03,550
you can follow agile and you

00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:06,730
and working Kanban model with peace so

00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:09,070
time and resources provided so it's

00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:12,180
again related to a monochronic culture

00:20:09,070 --> 00:20:14,980
so if you shared some requirements some

00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:17,200
commitments with your team members in

00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:19,960
monochronic culture so they will treat

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:22,800
deadlines as a return on stone so they

00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:25,990
will try to finish those but maybe

00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:28,180
polychronic not so they can't become

00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:30,940
complete on time because they can have

00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:34,300
excuse like we are working on multiple

00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:36,250
tasks so we are polychronic so a task

00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:39,520
completion is also more related to

00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:42,850
personality traits in every team we have

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:45,220
different rules so different roles like

00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:50,290
finisher implementer resource

00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:55,000
investigator planta task completer so

00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:57,340
these so these tasks completion is also

00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:04,720
more related to personality in different

00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:07,960
culture so a revised Association so this

00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:11,020
is interesting so in a team if you have

00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:14,080
ten tasks and your monochronic team

00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:17,440
member pick - and polychronic picked all

00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:19,780
and started working simultaneously on

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:23,470
all tasks then your monochronic team

00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:25,900
will not be happy because polychronic

00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,700
person will think okay so this task is

00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,070
going to bring more business value

00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:33,280
better relation with clients better

00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:35,800
relation with project manager lead so

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:38,650
maybe he will pick before monochronic

00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:46,330
will pick so this is a common team

00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:49,450
conflict so this is also interesting for

00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:53,440
me so decision making so in different

00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:56,200
cultures so cultures we have team

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:58,870
members from high power distance low

00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,030
power distance so they will have a

00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:03,940
different perception for making

00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:06,280
decisions so let's say I'm here so my

00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:09,400
team is working there if they came up

00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:12,070
with problem same mm then there is no

00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,880
one to take solution no one to guide

00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:15,280
them

00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:19,600
maybe they are from high power distance

00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:22,060
culture and taking decisions is not in

00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,960
their hand so they will think okay let

00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,510
them

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,970
let's project manager come he will

00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:31,140
decide so what we are going to take it's

00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:34,900
not part of our job so boss is always

00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:39,040
boss so yeah this this happens so this

00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:42,100
happens this is very common in team for

00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:45,310
taking decisions if there is no lead no

00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:47,860
project manager and team is facing some

00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:51,070
technical problems so they will they

00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:54,760
will look for this isn't from higher

00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:57,640
members and responsibilities so again so

00:22:54,760 --> 00:23:00,850
problems where there is problem there

00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:05,380
will be less less responsible person so

00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:09,880
if problem is like crucial so if your

00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:12,970
team members belongs to high uncertainty

00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:14,680
avoidance culture then they will not try

00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:17,890
to resolve them they will not try to

00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:19,840
take a responsibility so this is again

00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:23,520
common problem and it's related to

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:26,080
decision so problems and taking

00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:30,700
decisions on problem addressing those

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:34,510
problem facts and consequences this is

00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:37,780
interesting in in some culture so we

00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:40,330
follow facts we follow like what we have

00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:43,150
in our past what we have in present and

00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:45,850
so based upon past and present we

00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:49,870
predict future so if your team members

00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:52,930
are having that consensus mind so they

00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:55,510
will try to focus on facts so let's say

00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:57,640
a project manager is not there but they

00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:01,480
will try to take decision on facts and

00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:04,000
and if you are a project manager and you

00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:06,190
are not aware of like things in the

00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,590
background and if you are taking your

00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:11,320
own decision then your team will not say

00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:13,960
anything so this happens because you are

00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:16,330
responsible for taking this season so

00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:20,590
this happens this happens in many

00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:24,670
cultures in low in low power distance

00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:26,740
culture so team members don't want to

00:24:24,670 --> 00:24:29,680
take part in decision-making process

00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:35,020
and in high power distance if your boss

00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:38,830
are run then it's okay his boss so

00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:42,100
individual expectations so it's related

00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:45,070
to team personality traits so ways of

00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:47,980
task completion so some some team

00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:50,950
members will have high expectation from

00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:53,500
themself and some team members will have

00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:56,230
less someone will try to work within the

00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:59,440
job roles description and being

00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:06,100
monochronic and follow polychronic will

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:09,040
set their expectation so epistemology so

00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:14,710
this is interesting so this so this was

00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:17,380
main point of conflicts so what I faced

00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:22,000
in my experience so during professional

00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:26,230
and social activity so in some cultures

00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,480
so people used to analyze facts so if

00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:30,550
you share some incident some some

00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,070
insights with them they will try to

00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:38,080
analyze them they will check on Google

00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:42,010
they will ask for cognitive means like

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:44,740
facts and so maybe that will be annoying

00:25:42,010 --> 00:25:47,620
at some point so let's say if you shared

00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:50,020
some idea and you are not sure and in

00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:52,930
front of you your team members start

00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:55,750
looking looking for more insights so

00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:59,530
that summer I think sometimes it happens

00:25:55,750 --> 00:26:03,220
in the friend culture verbal / textual

00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:04,980
so it's like in some culture so people

00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,750
used to prefer having verbal

00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:10,600
communication so if you are a project

00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:14,170
manager from a high context culture and

00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:16,600
having like English language so you will

00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:19,090
prefer to have like verbal communication

00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:22,420
so that you can explain stuffs to your

00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:24,490
team but let's say you have like

00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:27,160
European team members where English is

00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:30,550
not a native language so again they will

00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:32,350
try to have like textual conversation

00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:34,540
and they will ask you a specification

00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:36,940
most of the time like detailed

00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,910
requirements they will try to get

00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:41,700
insights from them with

00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:44,100
they will try to show like they are

00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:47,430
understanding you but they are getting

00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:55,670
nothing so this happens so they will ask

00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:55,670
for more specification more use cases so

00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:04,830
so yeah it's again so related to low

00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:07,470
context and high context so in my team

00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:11,130
so I have few members so I was working

00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:13,710
with Germans and British so they were

00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:16,170
like very comfortable in getting like

00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:19,440
precise information you just need to

00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:21,480
sheer requirements what they want that's

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,720
all and they will provide you solution

00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,900
but in some some in my other team so I

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,510
have like team member from low context

00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:33,090
culture so always they look for more

00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:35,700
details so it's contradictory for me

00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:38,940
like in one team providing like detail

00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:41,040
is specification in one team just just

00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:43,140
providing requirements in project

00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,180
management tools and they have that

00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:48,000
understanding like we are expert we can

00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:50,150
provide solutions and in low context

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:53,760
culture I need to come up with long

00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:57,990
specification so this is interesting so

00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:02,760
I'm still like observing different

00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:05,250
cultures different my team members and

00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,470
like to help countries in Europe so I

00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:10,380
have team members from Eastern Europe

00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:13,050
Scandinavia in countries so it's

00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:19,770
interesting for me so I put all these in

00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:22,500
five categories so here so so we in

00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:25,800
culture so I put this a half's today so

00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:28,860
this topology is very widely used very

00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:32,370
popular for analyzing culture so

00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:35,310
analyzing culture their friends so quick

00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:39,110
background so Hoff's today so he's the

00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:42,930
founder of Institute doing research in

00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:46,320
intercultural management so his studies

00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:50,730
are based on IBM employees 100k

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:52,200
employees of IBM so main Hofstede a

00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:54,659
topology is based

00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,330
upon like six dimension so I mentioned

00:28:54,659 --> 00:29:01,039
five here so and these are power

00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:03,860
distance or uncertainty avoidance you a

00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:07,289
individualism collectivism masculinity

00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:11,000
long-term orientation and there is one

00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:14,639
indulgence so it's like more related to

00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,679
desire so controlling your desire for

00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:21,029
getting short-term and long-term

00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:24,419
benefits so power distance so power

00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:27,690
distance in simple so it's like extent

00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:30,899
to which we have variations so here

00:29:27,690 --> 00:29:34,169
achill difference in our organization

00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:38,389
and also at social level so I put some

00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:43,440
artifacts here so this would help us to

00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:46,429
analyze like culture having high power

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:48,299
distance and low power distance so

00:29:46,429 --> 00:29:51,590
centralization so these are like

00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:56,700
organization stuff steep pyramid

00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:59,039
supervisors so one interesting fact I

00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:02,909
came to know from my Russian team member

00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:07,200
in Russia so powerless since is too high

00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:10,380
it's near 200 so in some situation they

00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:14,760
have like five six people to report in a

00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:17,330
team and just one developer to work so

00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:20,760
it's interesting power distance so I put

00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:23,940
illustration here so high power distance

00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:28,260
and low power distance or pictures is

00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:31,620
lot and here are artifacts low power

00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:35,850
distance culture so subordinates expect

00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:39,539
to be consultant bosses are accessible

00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:42,630
so I think in Drupal so we are small so

00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:47,279
every company used to have like 1500

00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:50,010
maximum 200 and we follow flat hierarchy

00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:54,029
so we can relate like we all are low

00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:56,700
power distance culture but in low power

00:30:54,029 --> 00:30:59,250
distance culture we have some high power

00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:01,940
distance that belongs to like country in

00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:05,490
which country you are living so and

00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:06,060
startup you do have lower low power

00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,790
distance

00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:11,760
flat hierarchy but if your startup is in

00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:16,460
France in Germany in Ukraine so there

00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:19,260
will be a problem so here so these are

00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:23,100
artifacts of low power distance and high

00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:26,630
power distance subordinates expect

00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:31,100
subordinates expect to be consulted boss

00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:31,100
to be told what to do sorry

00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:39,750
privilege and Status are normal

00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:42,570
superiors in ssible so I put so these

00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:45,000
these I think this this is more

00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:47,190
interesting so putting all countries on

00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:51,480
low power distance and high power

00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:56,220
distance so I put all European countries

00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:58,530
so north north east south and west

00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,510
so Scandinavian countries Denmark

00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:04,500
Finland Sweden are like low power

00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:08,030
distance Austria Austria has very low so

00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:11,880
it's like 10-15 percent power distance

00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:14,700
Luxembourg hungry United State and UK

00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:17,130
I'm still not sure why on Hopf stated I

00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:21,690
mentioned US and UK are in low power

00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:24,630
distance so it's contradictory for me so

00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:29,040
high power distance so Greece Portugal

00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:31,470
France Belgium India so I was in high

00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:33,690
power distance culture back in India and

00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:38,040
again I'm in high power distance in

00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:41,250
France and my team are in Russia and

00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:43,250
Ukraine so it's a problem for me so

00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:47,940
having like all people high power

00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:51,570
distance culture so sometimes so I have

00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:53,460
like deadlock in my team so every time I

00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:55,410
need to follow I need to follow them

00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:58,020
what to do because it's not my

00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:58,290
perception it's their path perception as

00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,080
well

00:32:58,290 --> 00:33:03,060
they are like from high power distance

00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:08,010
culture they want to work in their role

00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:12,120
so this is interesting uncertainty

00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:16,290
avoidance so degree to which we accept

00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:19,140
ambiguity so if you have a team members

00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:20,420
if your team is like having high UA then

00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:24,150
I think you can't

00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:28,770
agile so high you is straight too agile

00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:31,350
for me so in agile so most of the time

00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:34,320
requirements are not clear project is

00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:36,510
like evolving you you can't predict

00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:40,050
what's going to be happen with your

00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:42,300
client so maybe they are like evolving

00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:46,890
with their requirements and if you have

00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:48,840
your team members from high high UE then

00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:52,080
they are not going to work so things

00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:54,630
will not good for them so every time

00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,750
they will ask for lots of details from

00:33:54,630 --> 00:34:00,390
you and and you will you will ask your

00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:03,540
client and the client is also not ready

00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:09,000
to provide you all details so this this

00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:11,610
is a big problem so for me so so for

00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,250
some clients so I faced this problem so

00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:16,050
a project was evolving so project was

00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:18,720
from a start-up so we were building

00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:21,990
products and clients was like coming

00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:23,880
from requirements with their partners so

00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:26,159
this was like problem this was like

00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:29,280
changing requirements suddenly and

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:32,310
having like hot discussions with team

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,470
why I'm changing requirements first like

00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:37,020
putting my perception and then again

00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:39,990
putting clients perception why client

00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:45,870
won't change a white lines when things

00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:48,270
in that way so here I put you a so it's

00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:50,310
interesting Scandinavian country just

00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:55,890
Denmark and Sweden has low UE

00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:59,010
again you US and UK India in India so we

00:34:55,890 --> 00:35:02,760
have low UA so we used to accept

00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:07,800
surprises we do accept surprises at last

00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:10,410
minute so and here in France Austria so

00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,630
why I like highlighted Austria so being

00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:15,930
a low power distance culture Australia

00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:18,840
is on high UA so it's like implementing

00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:22,290
agile in Austrian team is like big trade

00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:24,300
so yeah for me it's a big trade and I

00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:27,660
have team member from Russia and Ukraine

00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:30,420
so most of the time I discuss like no we

00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,920
are not whatever we are doing agile so

00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,080
for them it's not clear because

00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,840
requirement is not here so

00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:38,310
we can't freeze requirement so with this

00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:40,650
print we used to evolve with

00:35:38,310 --> 00:35:44,850
requirements for a few projects so I

00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:48,620
have lots of discussions so to come up

00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:51,240
with solutions having like providing

00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:55,350
detailed requirements so freezed

00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:58,650
requirements to my team members so

00:35:55,350 --> 00:36:01,700
another dimension is individualism and

00:35:58,650 --> 00:36:04,140
collectivism so it's interesting so in

00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:07,140
individualism so ties between

00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:09,780
individuals are loose people like to

00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:12,960
work more relationships are less

00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:15,510
important for them tasks are like having

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,510
more priorities and in the other hand in

00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:23,550
collectivism so people like to work in

00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:26,070
group so here so I put some artifacts

00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:28,950
for high individualism cultures so these

00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:32,970
are like identity based on individuals

00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:35,400
so we respect boss so so high

00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:38,130
individualism comes with like high power

00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:41,910
distance culture so task prevails over

00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:43,980
relationship so it's like a work to

00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:47,010
leave or leave to work so I mentioned

00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:50,280
somewhere so here in collectivism its

00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:52,590
opposite so the team likes to work in

00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:57,690
groups so relationships are more

00:36:52,590 --> 00:37:01,140
important so let's see infographics here

00:36:57,690 --> 00:37:05,640
so week a low individualism so Greece

00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:08,100
Portugal India China so we work in India

00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:11,610
so it's hard so task prevails over

00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:16,880
relationship Indians work a lot and we

00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:20,390
have Austria Japan and in high

00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:25,260
individualism we have Finland Denmark

00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:27,990
Scandinavian countries you UK us little

00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:32,700
and Belgium France France is again high

00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:37,290
individualism masculanity and feminity

00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:41,100
so it's very close to individualism and

00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:44,490
collectivism so masculinity is more for

00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:48,000
material success and feminity is quality

00:37:44,490 --> 00:37:51,300
of life so I put some artifacts

00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,330
so these are my observations so if I'm

00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:57,630
not correct so you can you can ping me

00:37:54,330 --> 00:38:01,680
you you can share with me your insight

00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:04,290
so these are my observations so in high

00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:07,290
masculinity we have like leave to work

00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:09,990
distinct gender roles managers are

00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:13,980
expected to be assertive in direct

00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:17,430
communication high context and in - et

00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:20,520
it's like France so friends prefer to

00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:22,680
have like work-life balance quality of

00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:26,820
life is more important they work to

00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:28,620
leave not leave to work so here I put my

00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:30,990
again so country wise so it's

00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:35,970
interesting Scandinavian countries

00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:41,310
having low masculinity and here so high

00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:44,280
masculinity India US UK Austria so

00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:47,310
Austria is there in high masculinity so

00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:50,160
so a long term orientation so it's like

00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:53,580
fifth dimension of HOF stately topology

00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:56,730
so it's like if you are going for an

00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:59,850
engagement so in some culture we prefer

00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:02,630
to have like long-term orientation so we

00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:05,760
look for like long-term benefits with

00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:07,590
certain loss in the beginning and in

00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,560
some culture we are like short-term

00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:14,130
goals short term orientation for making

00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,790
more profits so here so these are like

00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:20,820
some artifacts of long-term orientation

00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:24,690
persistence ordering and observing

00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:29,400
relationship by status loss of face save

00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:31,530
by thrifty so if oriented towards future

00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,900
avoid so yeah again it's related to

00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:36,270
long-term goals so short terms looking

00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:38,580
for more benefits people try to spend

00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:42,000
more for getting long-term benefits

00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:44,120
higher profits and I think like

00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,880
short-term orientation are related to

00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:50,550
culture having like low UA and low PD

00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:56,280
low power distance where people like to

00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:59,100
have like more profit so here I put

00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:01,630
again so some classification so I put

00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:03,549
again so so all my op

00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:05,500
duration revolves around European

00:40:03,549 --> 00:40:09,730
countries so Scandinavian countries

00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:11,769
Spain US India UK and hi Austria

00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:15,430
so it's interesting France having

00:40:11,769 --> 00:40:21,730
long-term orientation hi Russia and

00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:25,029
Ukraine so so here so we recheck a

00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:27,940
common problems in cross-cultural team

00:40:25,029 --> 00:40:32,319
so I put all together how to become

00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:35,410
cross-check um so for me first thing is

00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:38,079
like a reduce into a into a centrosome

00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:40,180
so by this I mean like having

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,880
understanding like my culture is the

00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:44,980
best so most of the time people used to

00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,190
think like his culture or her culture is

00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:51,069
the best so we need to do some

00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:53,589
gratification here so we need to observe

00:40:51,069 --> 00:40:57,250
other cultures so we need to have like

00:40:53,589 --> 00:40:59,650
perceptions so maybe we need to explore

00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:02,170
more other cultures so that we can come

00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:04,930
up with their interesting dimensions so

00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:07,569
first thing I think this one so it's

00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:11,259
important so I have seen problems in

00:41:07,569 --> 00:41:14,259
many Germans and British so they have

00:41:11,259 --> 00:41:25,630
this feeling so so this this is my

00:41:14,259 --> 00:41:29,619
observation so again so understand

00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:33,519
communication style so why it's not

00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:36,460
working so communication style so if

00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:38,890
English is not an at native language so

00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:42,640
you can have like some some loose points

00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:45,339
in your team so if you have team members

00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,130
from different culture and some are from

00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:51,430
same culture then you can accommodate

00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:53,740
another language so maybe internally so

00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:56,049
they can discuss their problems their

00:41:53,740 --> 00:42:00,190
concern in that language set ground

00:41:56,049 --> 00:42:02,829
rules so this is important so so in

00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:05,380
every project so before starting having

00:42:02,829 --> 00:42:09,309
like kickoff I used to have ground rules

00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:11,079
ground rules cover all points like

00:42:09,309 --> 00:42:13,839
having low context high context

00:42:11,079 --> 00:42:16,420
monochronic polychronic you have to be

00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:18,970
on time if you have concerned then you

00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:21,130
need to be like more precise if you have

00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:23,680
problem and if you have like better

00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:25,660
suggestion if you if you are not liking

00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:28,299
things then you need to come up with

00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:30,490
solution better way so you can suggest

00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:32,890
like this problem this solution is not

00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:34,690
going to address this problem so if you

00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:36,730
have better solution then come up with

00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:39,640
that otherwise just just follow

00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:41,619
so what know what all are doing so yeah

00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:46,990
so this is interesting setting ground

00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:49,569
rules setting guidelines for team so so

00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:52,210
in a multicultural remote team most of

00:42:49,569 --> 00:42:56,279
the time we have like different time

00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:59,410
zones so in different time zone so this

00:42:56,279 --> 00:43:02,109
there was problem so I when I was like

00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:04,420
working at platform message so we were

00:43:02,109 --> 00:43:08,650
working around the clock we were having

00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:11,529
team members from North America to

00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:14,859
Australia so people were working like

00:43:11,529 --> 00:43:16,930
from the cloth we have someone to

00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:19,779
address your problem so address

00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:22,809
customers problem so in that case team

00:43:19,779 --> 00:43:27,069
guidelines will work so if there is any

00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:29,289
problem if your team like different

00:43:27,069 --> 00:43:33,369
departments of your project development

00:43:29,289 --> 00:43:37,269
looks for some information so they can

00:43:33,369 --> 00:43:39,329
refer to team guidelines so like raising

00:43:37,269 --> 00:43:42,579
issues raising concerns

00:43:39,329 --> 00:43:45,609
checking a specification and if you have

00:43:42,579 --> 00:43:47,859
any question and if your project manager

00:43:45,609 --> 00:43:50,259
is sleeping at that time so what you can

00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:54,849
do so those things are in team

00:43:50,259 --> 00:43:57,430
guidelines so you can see my chrome bra

00:43:54,849 --> 00:43:58,900
here so I used to put like different

00:43:57,430 --> 00:44:03,880
time zones so this is very interesting

00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:06,099
plugin so these time zones from my team

00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:08,289
members so this is very interesting in

00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:11,140
the beginning I used to put but yeah I'm

00:44:08,289 --> 00:44:14,799
still using so these we can put in a

00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:18,039
team guideline and cultural flexibility

00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:21,489
so it's again a reducing into centrism

00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:24,430
so you need to explore different culture

00:44:21,489 --> 00:44:25,819
so you need to be like sometimes

00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:28,640
friendly with your

00:44:25,819 --> 00:44:32,719
team members from different cultures so

00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:34,670
if they are alone like having some soft

00:44:32,719 --> 00:44:37,430
corners for them like having more

00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:40,339
lunches with them discussing problems

00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:42,499
where they are facing if they have

00:44:40,339 --> 00:44:44,959
problem in language if they have problem

00:44:42,499 --> 00:44:47,599
in communication then coming up with

00:44:44,959 --> 00:44:50,569
solution like providing written solution

00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:54,349
written instruction for them so these

00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:57,380
these things brings like flexibility so

00:44:54,349 --> 00:44:59,569
I think so I'm doing this for having

00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:03,910
like win-win situation for my different

00:44:59,569 --> 00:45:03,910
team members from different backgrounds

00:45:04,299 --> 00:45:11,209
also shared responsibility so by this I

00:45:08,209 --> 00:45:13,940
mean so it's not project manager

00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:15,229
although or your business product owner

00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:18,349
business analyst

00:45:15,229 --> 00:45:22,069
guy so who will be responsible for all

00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:25,609
like budgets and timeline so if we have

00:45:22,069 --> 00:45:27,469
so in every team we have expertise so we

00:45:25,609 --> 00:45:29,660
can share some responsibilities

00:45:27,469 --> 00:45:32,359
technical responsibilities with

00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:35,779
different team we can ask suggestions

00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:39,019
from them solutions from them and we can

00:45:35,779 --> 00:45:41,239
discuss those solutions at team level

00:45:39,019 --> 00:45:44,359
and we can take like individual

00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:48,499
decisions how they feel and we can

00:45:44,359 --> 00:45:51,229
challenge not challenges I think so we

00:45:48,499 --> 00:45:53,930
can ask for like individual feedback so

00:45:51,229 --> 00:45:56,719
maybe some team member will not be

00:45:53,930 --> 00:46:00,559
comfortable on sharing at team level

00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:03,469
during meetings but it's good to touch

00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:06,680
them individually so politely silently

00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:09,440
that would help and if you are like a

00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:11,989
boss your project manager then you can

00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,779
share openly at team level getting

00:46:11,989 --> 00:46:17,150
inputs individually from different team

00:46:14,779 --> 00:46:20,119
members and also follow-ups in the

00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:24,999
meeting so it's very important so I have

00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:28,400
seen this problem in many cultures so if

00:46:24,999 --> 00:46:30,589
people are like having it's related to

00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,259
personality as well like introvert and

00:46:30,589 --> 00:46:35,509
extrovert so if you have team members

00:46:33,259 --> 00:46:38,539
from low power distance and low context

00:46:35,509 --> 00:46:39,619
so they will they might not take more

00:46:38,539 --> 00:46:42,439
part in your meeting

00:46:39,619 --> 00:46:45,469
so they can they might not take part in

00:46:42,439 --> 00:46:49,130
decisions and they might feel shy for

00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:51,019
sharing updates for sharing problems so

00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:53,359
in this case again you can ping them

00:46:51,019 --> 00:46:56,089
individually and you can follow-up them

00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:58,969
after meetings so this will bring like

00:46:56,089 --> 00:47:01,579
more and more trust between you and your

00:46:58,969 --> 00:47:04,400
team members from different culture and

00:47:01,579 --> 00:47:06,559
also good for like team-building and you

00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:10,309
can also plan like team-building

00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:11,630
activities in in agile in a scrum we

00:47:10,309 --> 00:47:14,599
follow like sprints

00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:17,809
so after sprint you can have like some

00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:21,380
social activities for a stand-up you can

00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:26,089
have like rotation for hosting stand-up

00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:27,279
so that after some time you're like team

00:47:26,089 --> 00:47:28,759
member having like

00:47:27,279 --> 00:47:30,949
english-as-a-second-language

00:47:28,759 --> 00:47:36,619
can become comfortable at least in

00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:39,289
sharing updates at team level so these

00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:41,479
are my observations so now I'm in France

00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:46,400
in high context high power distance

00:47:41,479 --> 00:47:49,089
culture so I put my observation so

00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:54,199
comparing France with Germany with

00:47:49,089 --> 00:47:56,839
United State so these are interesting

00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:59,839
facts you can see japanese or japanese

00:47:56,839 --> 00:48:03,819
like high values on all cultural as i

00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:07,729
mentioned so is there any italians here

00:48:03,819 --> 00:48:11,119
okay so i think you will often have you

00:48:07,729 --> 00:48:31,759
have you watch this video it's very

00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:35,059
interesting this ok sound is not working

00:48:31,759 --> 00:48:39,180
for me bad luck but yeah this video is

00:48:35,059 --> 00:48:48,510
interesting so you can also get like

00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:51,659

00:52:29,069 --> 00:52:33,089
this one is interesting

00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:49,130

00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:16,340
[Music]

00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:27,280
yeah so at the end there is no hard and

00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:30,550
fast rule for like doing project

00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:32,710
management for managing cultural cross

00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:35,160
cultural team so we can have like

00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:39,130
win-win so we can come up with like

00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:43,210
solutions in different culture so here

00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:46,030
so I put again interesting so in ideal

00:53:43,210 --> 00:53:48,870
world so the policemen would be like

00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:52,660
English car mechanics would be German

00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:54,730
cooks would be French in kippers would

00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:58,480
be Swiss because Swiss are like more on

00:53:54,730 --> 00:54:01,540
time organised and lovers would be

00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:03,850
Italian so that because of that video I

00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:06,220
think that's why it's so they put like

00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:09,870
levels would be Italian so they will not

00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:14,790
know and there will be no rule for them

00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:17,650
so in living hell just opposite so

00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:20,260
policemen would be German so Germans are

00:54:17,650 --> 00:54:23,910
really strict so cooks would be English

00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:28,270
I don't know this one so I copied from

00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:32,170
Google so yeah so these are interesting

00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:35,260
innkeepers would be Italian so that's

00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:37,990
all about my session so these were all

00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:40,840
my personal observations so it's not

00:54:37,990 --> 00:54:43,240
about like hitting any culture so not

00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:45,660
pointing any culture just to come up

00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:48,430
with like solutions for leading

00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:51,250
multicultural teams and delivering

00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:54,880
customers from different cultures so

00:54:51,250 --> 00:55:05,830
that's all from my session so do you

00:54:54,880 --> 00:55:07,870
have any question no no it's I think

00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:10,980
it's a common problem with like people

00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:16,210
who has like intercultural management

00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:19,360
knowledge so but no I think no so yeah

00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:21,610
it's not good so let's say if I have

00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:23,770
like new member from different location

00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:27,100
or if I'm going to have like meetings

00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:27,579
with my team so I do check from where

00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,559
they will

00:55:27,579 --> 00:55:32,469
so what earlier there are cultural

00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:35,890
dimension so I do check so it's yeah

00:55:32,469 --> 00:55:38,950
it's far like some pre pre works some

00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:41,920
homework for me so it's always like good

00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:44,529
for me so I used to do but it's not good

00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,329
like judging any team member on their

00:55:44,529 --> 00:55:50,380
culture so it's it's bad

00:55:46,329 --> 00:55:53,890
I would not prefer to select any fun one

00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:57,279
from and right now I have like 12 15

00:55:53,890 --> 00:55:59,859
members from Russia and Ukraine so all

00:55:57,279 --> 00:56:04,059
are from like high power distance low

00:55:59,859 --> 00:56:07,209
you a high us re so it's problem but

00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:10,569
yeah so after like my 4 or 5 months of

00:56:07,209 --> 00:56:14,349
work so I came up with solution so now

00:56:10,569 --> 00:56:17,170
things are moving ahead so I I have like

00:56:14,349 --> 00:56:20,559
couple of like 8 9 projects with Russian

00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:24,759
and Ukrainian team so 3 or 4 of them are

00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:27,009
live now so no problem at all now yeah

00:56:24,759 --> 00:56:30,069
it's always interesting if you have like

00:56:27,009 --> 00:56:34,469
some intercultural knowledge so every

00:56:30,069 --> 00:56:44,910
time you will analyze people on culture

00:56:34,469 --> 00:56:44,910
so more question no ok thank you then

00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:52,030
[Applause]
