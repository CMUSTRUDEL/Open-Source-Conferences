Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Using typed data and configuration schema for maximum flexibility
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	In this session, we will explore the power of typed data API in Drupal 8 and how it makes modules like configuration translation possible. We will also have a look at Configuration translation module which provides dynamic routes for most of the configuration entities (fields, block types, content types etc) to be translated in place, instead of using interface translation.

Configuration schema is another piece of the puzzle that every contrib/custom module can easily add (YAML file) to get the great benefits.

I'll also give a quick introduction of Configuration views module, a contributed module that uses configuration schema (similar to configuration translation) to convert most admin pages of core as views.

Attendees should have a basic knowledge of Drupal 8 module development.
