Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Introduction to decoupled Drupal
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	Among the industry trends currently upending the Drupal landscape, perhaps none has as significant an impact as the paradigm known as decoupled or headless Drupal. In decoupled Drupal architectures, core content management responsibilities such as database access, content modeling, and content workflow remain intact, with one crucial caveat — content presentation, whether located in a web application, a native mobile application, or an IoT application, are decoupled entirely from Drupal.

Decoupling Drupal comes with both benefits and drawbacks for organizations. While application developers will enjoy their newfound independence to build wholly decoupled applications, editors and marketers may suffer from the lack of in-context administration and live content preview.

Join me as we explore this new and exciting paradigm in our industry. We’ll dive into the nitty-gritty of what makes decoupled Drupal tick, why it’s so compelling for developers, and how it works from a technical standpoint.

Here are some of the topics we’ll cover:

What is decoupled Drupal?
How is a content service different from a traditional website?
Why decouple Drupal's front end from its back end?
What is a web service? What is a REST API?
Why are SDKs important to application developers?
What does API-first mean?
How do I decide whether it’s appropriate to decouple Drupal?
How does decoupled Drupal help or hurt the developer experience? the editorial experience?
