Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	When talking about performance of Drupal, personalization and the traditional page serving model gives a setback to Drupal 7.Even a small personalization breaks the cacheability of the entire page.Aditionally it follows the the traditional model wherein the entire page is generated before it is sent to the browser,keeping the browser idle for the given time.

Drupal 8 has solved a lot of its speed issues from previous versions with powerful cache system and incredible anonoymous user caching out of the box.But is caching sufficiently working towards making your site fast ? Does your web page loads on one go ? The answer is No.

Here it is where Bigpipe comes into action.Bigpipe is a browser rendering system coined by facebook.The complete feature is called  BigPipe as it breaks the web pages into logical section of content, called Pagelets, and pipeline the generation and render of these Pagelets. BigPipe not only reduces the load time of pages but also makes them seem even faster to users since seeing partial content earlier feels faster than seeing complete content a little bit later.

In this session, we will cover:

What is BigPipe.
How does Bigpipe actually works.
How to use BigPipe.
Implementation of BigPipe module in drupal 8.
Demo of Bigpipe along with illustration of useful cases where Bigpipe can be used.
