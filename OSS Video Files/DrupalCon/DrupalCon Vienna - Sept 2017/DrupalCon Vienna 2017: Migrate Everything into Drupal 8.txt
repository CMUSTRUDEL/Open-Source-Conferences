yeah it's want to say if you are still

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,189
working with the Drupal 7 it's easy you

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,369
can directly when you want to do it with

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,659
the drupelets you can directly go and

00:01:19,369 --> 00:01:23,280
start migrating it you don't need to

00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,220
worry about anything only you need to

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,030
take couple of clicks then it will

00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:36,630
migrate I will show you how to do that

00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:40,799
sorry ok so these are the condense we

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,659
are going to talk about it as first is

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:48,659
of migration modules are in Drupal 8

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:53,630
core then d7 to d8 migration migrating

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:56,100
from CSV data yes just an or CSV data

00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:58,229
comma separated values if you get a data

00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:03,479
in comma separated values how to do

00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:08,340
migration and source plugins and process

00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:12,060
plugins and how to use my migration

00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,260
modules through drush modules would like

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:18,200
to know

00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,200
many of you guys migrated six to seven

00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:28,230
how you guys migrated anyone please

00:02:24,829 --> 00:02:29,700
feeds module yes I mean a so we looking

00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,989
forward to how the fields module Drupal

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:38,819
8 anyway again anyone else use the

00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:41,310
migration class yes again there is

00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:43,950
another way of importing Nord import as

00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:47,250
well as Norden board modules are there

00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:51,629
they need you can easily migrate it yeah

00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:53,549
but for now you don't need any any more

00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,810
modules actually technically speaking if

00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:58,739
you know a little bit about developing

00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:03,359
you can directly go and use the CSV data

00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:04,799
to migrate yeah let's check out the what

00:03:03,359 --> 00:03:07,790
are the core modules what are the

00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:12,389
contributed modules involved with

00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:16,170
migration process migrate module and

00:03:12,389 --> 00:03:18,720
migrate Drupal migrate Drupal you a that

00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:22,349
is a core module sis or originally ships

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,510
with Drupal 8 point X so you don't need

00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:26,940
to download any of this modules and you

00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,810
can download the modules who will be

00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,260
maybe added in future not sure about

00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,169
yeah

00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,840
but can be migrated plus and my great

00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:39,269
tools and migrate upgrade as well as

00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:44,120
migrate so CSV I'm just going to say how

00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:47,220
to process the CSV data to migrations

00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,230
till now any questions I would like to

00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:53,730
have an interacting session because of

00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:57,299
it's sort of difficult session making

00:03:53,730 --> 00:04:00,030
I'm taking this is a third time it's

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:02,760
always lot of problems and like it was

00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:07,889
in Baltimore it's when day we try to do

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,569
it in workshop that is also whatever you

00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:12,419
are not understanding just raise the

00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:15,810
hands we stop and we discuss then we'll

00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:19,859
go forward so these are the modules

00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:21,860
available and you can download those

00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,160
contributed modules through drache or

00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:30,160
console anything

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:31,930
yeah so when you want to do a d7 to d8

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,960
migration what do you need to take care

00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:38,260
of it obviously you need to how the

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:42,180
instance her d8 install install in your

00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:45,160
system and you need to have this migrate

00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,290
migrate Drupal migrate Drupal you a

00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,510
module installed then you need to run

00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:51,550
the migrate upgrade module as well the

00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:55,710
four modules you can you can start using

00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:58,480
it then then you will go to the

00:04:55,710 --> 00:05:00,490
configuration for the migrate

00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,920
upgradation you'll get this kind of page

00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:05,830
it's very straightforward

00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:08,050
you can see what all the database you

00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:11,950
are using it what are the database

00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:14,520
you're gonna use it and its if it is

00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:17,910
where it is getting hosted and what is a

00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:22,050
database name it's very straightforward

00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:26,560
this is you'll get the UI part in d8

00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:27,660
this UA then click is update that's all

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,880
you need to do it

00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,680
b78 but still there is a lot of critical

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,400
issues around 12 critical issues a

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,840
surprisement sin n price not we welcome

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,490
you all to come and work with the

00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:45,730
migrate excuse any help

00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:48,610
maxi or wiki or me or Adam or just any

00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:54,340
come to the course print room ask any of

00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:57,730
us like we can help you if if that only

00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,530
shows more than Tala I think if we spend

00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:02,350
for another six months in a very brute

00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:06,430
force I think it will be easy for any

00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:10,510
one of you or me can symbol clicks can

00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:13,510
be migrated from seven to eight and one

00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:17,230
more thing you want to add it this

00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:19,240
should be the last most upgrade you are

00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:22,420
doing it manually

00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:25,060
that's what dry says in the notes so if

00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:27,370
you do seven to eight migration that

00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:30,220
when you're nine comes Drupal nine comes

00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:34,600
you don't need to do in the use I hope

00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:37,389
you all see that slides dry sirs

00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,939
presented in Baltimore

00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:42,699
there will be you have you ever find it

00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:43,270
deprecated in your coding Drupal

00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:45,219
encoding

00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:50,860
it's called drip irrigated how many

00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:55,810
heard that debris content system it it's

00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:58,689
still support at some and it will be

00:06:55,810 --> 00:06:59,770
removed in future but it will support

00:06:58,689 --> 00:07:03,699
with the current system

00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:09,479
ok I'm not changing the topic so D 728

00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:09,479
migration is just like this and yeah

00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:21,610
yeah so there are some changes on this

00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,590
form as well we're at the top which you

00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,389
can't see you have to choose Drupal six

00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:27,400
or seven as your source that's quite

00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:31,210
simple it's just a little click and no

00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,680
so for the source files you can set it

00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:37,360
now accepts both your public and your

00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:41,770
private files yeah I didn't one more

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:44,020
thing yeah how do you one more thing the

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:47,260
same way you can do the eight migration

00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:50,020
six to eight migration also there is not

00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:54,070
much difference how many of you guys are

00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:57,669
still working with Drupal 6 it's ok I

00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:58,120
think it's it's not it's not a big

00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:00,880
problem

00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:04,930
right yeah I started with the Drupal 6

00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:07,870
and I saw the changes of ndd then when I

00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:10,419
come he said I need to study this then I

00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:14,320
came to hate oh I need to study a lot of

00:08:10,419 --> 00:08:18,490
things it's it's it's ok it's totally ok

00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:20,470
and you can in fact you don't need to

00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:24,130
know j'adore in your program if you want

00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:28,419
to be able decide now so I would say if

00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:32,229
you want to build a multilingual site is

00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:34,240
far easier than d6 and d7 you don't need

00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:36,570
to be anything else like you don't know

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,620
you don't need to do install a

00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:41,680
multilingual sites or multilingual

00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:45,300
modules or download any of this it is

00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:50,620
very easy I want to say that same way

00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:52,980
you can do the d6 to d8 migration same

00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:56,950
screen you need to do what are the

00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:59,380
versions like a database as well as the

00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:01,330
where is getting hosted all the stuff

00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:04,660
getting updated then you need to do it

00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:10,320
so moving forward we going to find out

00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:12,730
how to migrate other legacy systems

00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,190
anybody works on I personally worked on

00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:19,510
cold fusion migrated called phishing

00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:23,890
website to Drupal 8 two times and one is

00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:25,059
a normal website other one is Drupal 8

00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:28,499
commerce I

00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:32,339
migrate to interpolate commerce actually

00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:38,229
how many of you guys familiar with this

00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:42,159
that first block is CSV file yeah you

00:09:38,229 --> 00:09:42,959
want to how question a bliss asking

00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,209
questions

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:49,389
okay no problem yeah the first one is

00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:53,379
block is CSV files comma separated

00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:56,219
values first one is IDs the one two

00:09:53,379 --> 00:10:00,099
three the second column is titles and

00:09:56,219 --> 00:10:04,959
third column is the body so in this

00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:09,969
slide we have a second block is the dot

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:12,369
yml file excuse me note by ml files we

00:10:09,969 --> 00:10:15,119
have a three process I mean three

00:10:12,369 --> 00:10:18,579
plugins involved three actually

00:10:15,119 --> 00:10:20,559
technically is three process when you

00:10:18,579 --> 00:10:24,699
have a migration you need to have a

00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:27,699
source where the data is placed and you

00:10:24,699 --> 00:10:30,309
need to have a processor and so you

00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:33,039
process the data for your purpose in d8

00:10:30,309 --> 00:10:36,579
like how it has to be placed then the

00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:39,639
reset destination so three-way first is

00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:45,909
cross first is source then process and

00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:48,519
this net have you so in the source you

00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:51,879
are saying which which is the CSV file

00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:57,009
you gonna migrate it from where is the

00:10:51,879 --> 00:11:00,009
data is placed where is your CSV files

00:10:57,009 --> 00:11:04,259
are placed yeah you can give a absolute

00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:09,039
path as well as the relative path and

00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:12,249
the second one is process process use do

00:11:09,039 --> 00:11:15,189
all the mapping remember you guys you do

00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:19,509
the feeds module and do the field

00:11:15,189 --> 00:11:22,239
mapping node import module we do the

00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:23,919
field mapping also right the same way we

00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:27,189
can map the fields what all the things

00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:31,319
title is title is what is a CSV columns

00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:34,629
as well as the body and we can create

00:11:31,319 --> 00:11:37,989
what is a type there is a again process

00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:41,179
plugin I will come to that and then

00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:43,279
destination destination i say i am going

00:11:41,179 --> 00:11:47,389
to create a node i'm going to create

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:51,799
article so from the csv file i'm going

00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:55,489
to create node that's what this slide

00:11:51,799 --> 00:12:02,689
see like this process do any questions

00:11:55,489 --> 00:12:07,759
still now okay yeah i'd like to add a

00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:09,439
tidbit there and that it can be tempting

00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:11,540
when you're writing a process plugin to

00:12:09,439 --> 00:12:13,249
do more than processing like if you want

00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,699
to do something in the destination and

00:12:13,249 --> 00:12:19,929
in fact in one of the considers their is

00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:22,639
a thing to generate an entity in a

00:12:19,929 --> 00:12:25,279
during the process but that has lots of

00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,480
bad things around it and we're doing

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,040
with simple things here so i won't go

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,299
into all that i just want to point out

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,220
that if you're getting into writing

00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:33,589
these things remember this process this

00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,839
is just about changing the data you've

00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:39,410
provided it into something else

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,209
nothing more okay and then your

00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:43,039
destinations tend to be quite simple

00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:45,019
like as you can see this is that that's

00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:47,029
the destination for entity node that's

00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:51,109
it the rest of it is handled by the core

00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:53,839
mind great if you look in core they're

00:12:51,109 --> 00:12:56,059
very few destinations in the other

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,009
modules you node and they're all quite

00:12:56,059 --> 00:13:00,139
simple so if you find you're making a

00:12:58,009 --> 00:13:02,839
destination plugin that's complex stop

00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:04,819
and think about it you know seek some

00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,209
support come to meet us in drupal

00:13:04,819 --> 00:13:07,209
migraine

00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:16,510
process all these are plugins the three

00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:18,870
steps I told you it's getting so much

00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:23,140
light sorry

00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:27,820
source process and destination three of

00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:31,420
them are plugins so what is the basic

00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:34,540
idea of plugins all of you guys know you

00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:36,550
can plug you can plug and play how many

00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:41,200
of you have asked familiar with these

00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:46,150
plugins okay so let me tell you this

00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:48,300
example so you have a you're a fan you

00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:52,480
have a lot of plugs around this room you

00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:55,720
can plug anywhere and it will work

00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,810
what is according to work correctly it

00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,060
plugs to the where it has to be it has

00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:03,730
to be cup for the electric and you can

00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:06,370
plug it wherever you want and it play

00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:08,350
according to that so plugins is like

00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:10,480
that you can extend I mean you can

00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:14,080
create your own fan and plug it anywhere

00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:17,170
also still its give you the so rotates

00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:21,310
the fan still works or that's where the

00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:23,350
Plex plugins play plugins work so three

00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:25,620
of them are the plugins me gonna explain

00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:29,110
you how or what is a sauce plug-in and

00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:32,140
what is the process plug-in this will I

00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:35,470
will show you in a developer perspective

00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:39,010
with the online demo will show you how

00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:43,000
to do that also so this is the easiest

00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:45,070
way to migrate from any kind of you

00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:49,000
getting any kind of WordPress or

00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:50,770
anything any data get that value get

00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,330
that data into the comma separated

00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:57,220
values and just write this yml file then

00:14:55,330 --> 00:15:05,500
you can import into the Drupal eight

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:08,500
variously yeah this is a source plugin

00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:12,970
you can see the right hand of this slide

00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:15,840
that is a XML files and the left side is

00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:19,500
the source plug-in we written for how to

00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:23,470
read this XML files

00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:26,709
the left side is a YAML file the for the

00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:31,570
reading this XML file it's pretty

00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:32,949
straightforward you it's already you

00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:35,170
don't need to write any of this code

00:15:32,949 --> 00:15:37,060
okay it's already there it's already

00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:41,740
there in Drupal 8 I just want to explain

00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:46,120
you so there it's a source plugin is

00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:49,509
written and says where is the path the

00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:52,300
source the plug-in states a URL we go

00:15:49,509 --> 00:15:55,420
from the URL we gonna pass it and say

00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:59,259
you are list this is the URL and data

00:15:55,420 --> 00:16:02,589
fetcher we say is HTTP and that the

00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:05,259
parser we say XML straightforward and

00:16:02,589 --> 00:16:07,990
say item selectors laughs snorts laughs

00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:11,350
snorts then we say what are the things

00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:14,170
we need to map it we say the fields come

00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:18,699
name label selector it's be page title

00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:21,269
and title and body so this is source

00:16:18,699 --> 00:16:26,079
plugin if you have a custom table

00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:30,190
suppose like you have a set of data in a

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:32,889
MySQL table and how you can easily write

00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:35,319
a sauce plug-in for that or you have a

00:16:32,889 --> 00:16:37,000
different way of data is processed you

00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:39,970
can write this was plugin for that and

00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:42,339
get it migrated or you can give your

00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:47,319
online streaming data and you can

00:16:42,339 --> 00:16:48,910
migrate to the system it's you don't

00:16:47,319 --> 00:16:51,250
need to worry about it all these codes

00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:53,769
are available there is lot of examples

00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:56,560
available available in the core itself

00:16:53,769 --> 00:16:58,870
my great examples you can look at that

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:01,600
code and you easy to find out how to do

00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:05,439
it so this is a source plug-in source

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:10,020
plugin when is getting created XML is

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:13,990
already there and JSON already there and

00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:16,990
CSV already there in Drupal system

00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:19,689
Drupal ecosystem if any data present in

00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:22,959
any other way if you want to if you feel

00:17:19,689 --> 00:17:27,579
like ok I need to have it in a source

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:31,030
plugin so just write it off and one more

00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:34,120
thing if you have a any piece of data

00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:36,520
that can be converted in the CSV that is

00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,930
very easy way of migrating that

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:43,390
from other system to your local system

00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:47,710
we're gonna talk about nest process

00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:51,910
plugins yeah a process plug-in is

00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:54,310
basically we are using for we use feeds

00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:57,400
module right all of you guys

00:17:54,310 --> 00:18:02,260
I think used fields module you suppose

00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:05,410
you get data have a unit of migrated

00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:09,220
address so addresses comes generally

00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:11,950
like street numbers and address line 2

00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:14,970
is comma separated just like that in a

00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:17,470
single row but when you going to the

00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:23,200
system it has to be placed in a proper

00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:25,270
way or let's say you have a user

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,340
migration you are doing it you have a

00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:31,300
first name and last name but you have

00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:32,890
field called full name so it will attach

00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,930
first name and last name together rate

00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:38,200
that this works the process plug-in will

00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:42,190
return here so if you think about the

00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:46,180
Drupal 7 side you use the tampering for

00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:49,420
speeds module for particular field how

00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:52,870
it should behave it how we should read

00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:56,800
the data from the source file and how

00:18:52,870 --> 00:19:01,330
should get imported in Drupal so those

00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:05,050
part you processing it here so you can

00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:07,810
see this this is the class you read

00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:10,150
process plug-in class in the right side

00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:12,580
the right side is written is a process

00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:18,250
plug-in class in the left side it is the

00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:20,170
YAML file you gonna migrate from the yml

00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:22,990
dot yml through the configurations I

00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:25,840
will show you how to do that yeah the

00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:29,410
let me explain this process class and

00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:33,310
you can see that in the process class

00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:39,400
it's safe full name and class name and

00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:41,800
you have the annotations for the what

00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:45,490
should be the IDs migration process ID

00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:48,310
then you you get a function called

00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:49,389
transform transform is the method that

00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,789
we you

00:19:49,389 --> 00:19:54,089
you to tamper the fields you can make

00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:57,639
your own fields how should be up here it

00:19:54,089 --> 00:19:59,799
suppose you get you want to split the

00:19:57,639 --> 00:20:02,079
fields I mean split the data you're

00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:04,209
getting a raw data straight one two

00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:06,459
three together you can split it with

00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:08,769
comma separated explored it or implode

00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:10,389
it that's what we're doing it here we

00:20:08,769 --> 00:20:13,450
wanna get the first name and last name

00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:16,479
you can see that and we are returning it

00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:20,649
together as a single field so in the

00:20:16,479 --> 00:20:23,609
left side you can see in the field full

00:20:20,649 --> 00:20:26,499
name are able to see the field full name

00:20:23,609 --> 00:20:28,739
they feel fearful name you say the

00:20:26,499 --> 00:20:31,419
plug-in name is called full name and

00:20:28,739 --> 00:20:33,759
source is the unique ID what is

00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:36,639
generally you passing it that has to be

00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:38,979
present don't matter what source you can

00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:41,799
check out the full name that full name

00:20:38,979 --> 00:20:45,039
will close call this class migration

00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:47,169
process class and say check for the

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:50,019
first name and last name and concatenate

00:20:47,169 --> 00:20:55,719
together and return back that's what the

00:20:50,019 --> 00:21:09,909
process plug-in does any question still

00:20:55,719 --> 00:21:12,159
on okay so the bit there about the

00:21:09,909 --> 00:21:15,579
process plugin and the example provided

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,899
of the full name process plugin in core

00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:18,999
there's a whole bunch of existing

00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:20,769
process plugins so if you look in the

00:21:18,999 --> 00:21:21,879
core migrate module you'll see a bunch

00:21:20,769 --> 00:21:24,729
and there's simple things in there like

00:21:21,879 --> 00:21:25,989
concat just a cat two fields there's

00:21:24,729 --> 00:21:28,209
extract to pull something out of an

00:21:25,989 --> 00:21:34,690
array it comes to mind and then there's

00:21:28,209 --> 00:21:40,409
some more tricky ones like oh it changed

00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:42,399
its name hang on migration look up so

00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:43,599
more advanced won't go they're just

00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:45,369
saying there's more advanced ones in

00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:48,579
there as well and it's worth a read of

00:21:45,369 --> 00:21:50,739
the api is to find out the ones that you

00:21:48,579 --> 00:21:53,429
need so look there first before you go

00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:53,429
off writing ones

00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:05,159
so we will I will show you how the

00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:07,020
process plug-in works also yeah next one

00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:12,000
is so what is the drache modules help us

00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:14,669
to do it so we need to find out how its

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,940
get runs so when you installing brush

00:22:14,669 --> 00:22:19,860
modules then migrate tools you need

00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,320
install once you install my great tools

00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:25,620
modules that will allow you to give this

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:27,779
- commands the first - commands give you

00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:30,059
option to check the status of the

00:22:27,779 --> 00:22:32,820
migration files then you can see the

00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:35,100
import then you can roll back that one

00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:37,649
if you are not happy with that then you

00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:39,960
can stop it then you can reset it and

00:22:37,649 --> 00:22:41,789
you can find out the migration messages

00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:45,299
what is a message happen if there is an

00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:46,529
error happens or those stuff so this is

00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:47,610
the basic commands you need to

00:22:46,529 --> 00:22:55,830
understand when you're doing the

00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:58,580
migrations yeah okay let's do a any

00:22:55,830 --> 00:23:01,850

00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:47,490
I'm from the dialogue shmita here in

00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:49,110
Vienna and I'm like my question is so

00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:51,269
basically when I'm migrating custom

00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:55,049
modules from my functionalities that I

00:25:51,269 --> 00:25:56,940
need from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 yeah I'm

00:25:55,049 --> 00:26:00,179
basically needing the slides you showed

00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:06,620
before with the Status Messages and all

00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:09,960
these basic status yeah things okay

00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:12,590
that's my question thank you yeah thank

00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:15,840
you for asking the question mark oh it's

00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:19,320
it's a good question all of us this even

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,750
I when I started I also has it would

00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,330
like to say all of the contributed

00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:30,240
modules we are trying to getting into

00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:33,090
the migration upgraded and custom

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:36,000
modules you need to do the upgrade one

00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:37,679
by yourself the content actually be

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,740
getting migrated through the migration

00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:44,279
process after that if you want a very

00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:46,860
particular functionality but do upgrade

00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:49,500
a module upgradation modular that will

00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,809
give you the overview what all the

00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:53,970
things you need to change as hooks or if

00:26:51,809 --> 00:26:55,919
it is hook underscore main oh that is

00:26:53,970 --> 00:27:00,299
converted into the menu dot link it

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:03,919
links dot yml file so and if you have a

00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:09,740
very particular process but those custom

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:13,259
areas you can develop by yourself and

00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:15,629
majorly migration we meant for the data

00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:20,549
migration first and custom module

00:27:15,629 --> 00:27:22,860
migration you you need to module you

00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:25,110
need to upgrade first then you need to

00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:29,070
work on those specific functionalities

00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:31,470
yeah yeah even even that's it that is

00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:34,200
the only part you need to do it but rest

00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:36,740
of the Aveda content as possible even

00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:41,190
the translation also we trying to get it

00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:42,720
it's take if you do it very manually it

00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:45,150
will take three or four funds

00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:48,270
to do it but if you do it in this way

00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:50,210
how much time you need it may be one

00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:55,350
hour three hours

00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:57,750
thank you yeah just to clarify the

00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:59,940
policy on what we migrate in core

00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:01,289
anything that's in core will migrate but

00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,360
if it's contributed module like

00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:04,740
paragraphs it's a responsibility of the

00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:10,380
paragraph maintainer x' to write the

00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:12,360
migration for that just yeah just a

00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:14,690
quick question on police Multi

00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:21,539
multilingual content is is it possible

00:28:14,690 --> 00:28:23,760
current using the current multilingual

00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:25,559
content is it is it possible using the

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:31,140
current migration tools to migrate

00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:32,520
multilingual content very good Maxime is

00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:43,830
probably the best one for this but it's

00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:45,299
much it's mostly my first thing that

00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:47,789
comes to mind is to read the known

00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:50,929
issues page about migrate there's a

00:28:47,789 --> 00:28:54,299
known issue pages but a lot of the

00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:58,880
translations are done but I don't know

00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:58,880
the nuances of it that's why I'm pausing

00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:14,400
the notes from Drupal 6 opposed and

00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:17,090
Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 are migrated there

00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:21,480
are still some work to be done like with

00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:23,490
menu items blocks and other things but

00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:28,110
it's hard to find people to work on them

00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:30,750
because you have to be to know the

00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:32,640
multi-language multi-language system and

00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:37,669
the migrate system so it's kind of

00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:40,620
tricky issues but we are working on that

00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:42,870
and I will gladly say that on monthly

00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:45,480
I'm sadly monolingual so I've had to

00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:48,929
learn Drupal 6 and 7 my translation

00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:52,730
stuff enough to write patches so please

00:29:48,929 --> 00:29:52,730
come join us if I can do it so can you

00:29:55,010 --> 00:30:00,030
yeah and when you when you migrate

00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:01,710
there's a migrate all the tables

00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:04,559
including the content types

00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:06,900
and so when you want to start working

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,840
with the new Drupal 8 you can start

00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:11,990
adding content to the all to the same

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,669
content types

00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:16,380
so I think you said can you please

00:30:14,669 --> 00:30:19,710
repeat the question once again yeah yeah

00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:21,510
when you migrate from from 7 to 8

00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:22,470
using the migrate doesn't migrate also

00:30:21,510 --> 00:30:26,220
the content types

00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:27,780
it's kinda dives and the fields to you

00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:35,280
what are the fields you have is

00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:38,789
automatically get created here too so

00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:41,250
it's just run this click click click

00:30:38,789 --> 00:30:47,070
it's everything translated there I mean

00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:49,559
yeah yeah in your example it's pretty

00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:52,850
simple content structures yeah

00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:56,510
but what if I have like more complex

00:30:52,850 --> 00:31:00,240
architecture with node references and

00:30:56,510 --> 00:31:01,830
categories taxonomy tags how do is it

00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:03,570
possible right now in the state of the

00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:07,500
current API to handle all these

00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:09,990
relationships thank you yeah entity

00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:14,100
reference are we having it you have a

00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:18,510
taxonomy we you can you can have it if

00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:20,580
you have a lot of level of taxonomy you

00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:23,760
need to do a process plugin if you have

00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:29,360
a lot of taxonomy and a lot of very high

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:31,440
level Arkadiy to a plug-in specialist

00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,960
and all that but it's possible right

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,360
yeah ok yeah and just another quick

00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,600
question you say that like you think it

00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:41,789
can take some time yeah what would be an

00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:47,340
estimate for like 4,000 nodes for

00:31:41,789 --> 00:31:49,530
example it's it's it's a lot of things

00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:53,130
in factor actually so if you run it in a

00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:55,350
8 gb ram system or 16gb or 32gb ram

00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:57,600
system that is also factor I don't know

00:31:55,350 --> 00:32:01,440
if you have a heavy system a good system

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:03,929
and also if we cannot have that X at

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,990
times yeah yeah like like a ranch like

00:32:03,929 --> 00:32:10,200
yeah you have an hour

00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:12,870
time yeah it's unit a you little time it

00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,880
will do a little time it won't work it

00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:16,500
won't break

00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:19,679
I'm sure they do it because I've done

00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,809
that it won't break but you need to be

00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:23,460
little patience come on you can be

00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:25,380
patience because you don't you're not

00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:27,240
it's not asking you to do it couple of

00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:30,900
months patience maybe couple of hours

00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,490
that's okay okay thanks also with those

00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:34,890
Josh commands you can tell it just to do

00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:45,630
a couple there's some fields you can

00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:49,040
send so yeah please yes I have a

00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:54,050
question yeah could you give us a

00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:58,350
workflow to migrate from a multi-link

00:32:54,050 --> 00:33:02,030
site in Drupal 6 but this site is not

00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:06,809
updated so it's not using the last

00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:13,440
version of Drupal 6 and and it has also

00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:15,270
custom models so so you you okay you

00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,650
want to upgrade this is what I

00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:19,380
understand I'm sorry

00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:22,620
making it correct if you you have a

00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:24,390
Drupal 6 side is a multilingual correct

00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:29,460
yes so you want to update you to the

00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:31,620
Drupal 8 correct is that yes no don't do

00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:34,530
it with them anything anything you don't

00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:40,020
need to with 6 to 7 directly go and do

00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:44,370
it the 6 to 8 so in 6 to d8 nor d6 to d7

00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:47,970
d6 to d8 and if you're doing it that is

00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:50,340
very correctly that will be last very

00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:52,380
high level update you're doing it so so

00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:54,840
after that you need to create your own

00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:57,720
modules check the deprecated ones has to

00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:59,940
be removed and you keep doing it it will

00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,340
be Drupal and when this Drupal 9 comes

00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:05,370
your site is also automatically

00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:08,730
automatically updated and upgraded so

00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:13,310
what I am Telling 6 to 8 node 6 to 7

00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:13,310
yeah and coming back to your question

00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:23,640
11:45

00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:26,460
20 means we okay six to six to eight

00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:29,280
migration with the multilingual actually

00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:33,000
we are not very much capable but still

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:36,450
we are capable yeah some of the things

00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:38,880
if it is not you want it in a very

00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:41,850
direct way of this one may be little bit

00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:45,350
breaks you will get it but all the nodes

00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:48,930
you will migrate at the couple of

00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:51,180
taxonomy or entity reference we are not

00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:56,130
we are working on the same plugins so

00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:58,410
sixty-eight migrations translations the

00:34:56,130 --> 00:35:00,870
translation it has to be work little

00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:04,530
more issues are there we are working on

00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:06,720
it always welcome anyone wants I went to

00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:09,360
speed up the stuff come on issue queues

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,600
and just ask because migration issues

00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:16,650
queues are one of the good initiative

00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:19,020
and be very proactive come on ask

00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:21,600
questions or what you are doing it

00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:25,080
anyone you can find any or no fast all

00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:28,680
you can find Lucas or Adam or Maxie

00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:31,290
quite quite one or anyone like find out

00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,680
they will be answering your questions as

00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,680
well as

00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:39,980
just just a second in records at the

00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:41,660
roadmap if you have the old d6 site you

00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,250
really do need to upgrade it to the

00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:45,530
latest because obviously we can't

00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:47,900
support every version of d6 and all the

00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:52,400
modules so start with that lovely task

00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:54,080
and then move on the d6 translation

00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:58,970
migrations are further along than the d7

00:35:54,080 --> 00:36:02,360
ones so the the the migration of

00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:05,210
translations in d6 is further along than

00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:07,670
the what the translation migrations in

00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:12,140
d7 so you're you're better off in a way

00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:13,790
I have got a real quick question

00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:16,940
mm please on one of your first slides

00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:19,400
you showed the migration form and you

00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:21,170
could select mysql or mariadb or

00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,640
equivalent yeah it's Postgres it

00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:27,980
considered an equivalent because it

00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:30,310
wasn't on the list otherwise and saying

00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:33,160
that you included Postgres basically

00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:37,660
that's a good question actually

00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:41,960
I think it's work but I'm not I'm not

00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:43,160
done it but yeah definitely I gonna take

00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,440
it forward that one

00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,270
yeah we'll discuss that thank you for

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,850
asking that really appreciated over is

00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:51,320
if it's included which may be totally

00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:55,790
agreeing it totally agreeing it will

00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:58,250
we'll be doing that yeah I do know there

00:36:55,790 --> 00:37:02,270
were some issues that some stuff way

00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:03,800
back wasn't working with Postgres and I

00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:05,210
thought it was all fixed and it could

00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:13,580
just be an anomaly that it's not up

00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:18,620
there so hey I'm talking I'm working in

00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:22,400
a digital list group I have to question

00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:25,190
publish first one is that I have a d7

00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,320
site where I have content in the text

00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:31,670
tsunamis like text for me with of

00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:35,660
different fields and in d8 hello yeah

00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:38,180
please yeah I have a d7 site where I

00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:42,500
have a taxonomy with a lot of fields and

00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:44,690
in d8 I move it to content type with

00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,070
fields can i migrate the text tsunamis

00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:47,230
into the content types

00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:51,340
in d7

00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:54,010
these proc d7 to d8 repeat me once again

00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:56,170
please I have a text on away yes with

00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:59,500
lot of fails the d7 yep

00:37:56,170 --> 00:38:03,430
but the same thing I have in d8 but as a

00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:06,340
content type mmm you already create the

00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:09,430
two systems then you you need this data

00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:13,330
from there to there okay so better you

00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:16,660
get it in a CSV file and do it the other

00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:19,270
ways you need to incremental migration

00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:22,570
that can cause little problem for you

00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:24,670
but it's better you can have it in a CSV

00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:30,640
file and you can I am gonna show that

00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:33,190
how to migrate a CSV file to d8 so so in

00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,410
the CSV plugin i will map it with the

00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:38,320
fields which i'll show you I'm gonna

00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:40,869
show you you may have minute so I'm

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:43,950
gonna demo this what we told the process

00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:48,580
plug-in as well as the how to create a

00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:52,840
data migrated data from CSV so this is a

00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:57,880
fresh Drupal 8 site you need to go and

00:38:52,840 --> 00:39:01,290
install migrate module and you need

00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:14,830
migrate Plus and you need my great

00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:18,400
source CSV and migrate tools so once you

00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:23,790
install these modules yeah as you

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,790
install this module yeah I am having a

00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:33,150
let's do this we gonna I have a CSV file

00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:43,890
yeah this is the CSV file can you get

00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:43,890
see it how to make it bigger in idea

00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:47,580
sorry

00:39:48,579 --> 00:40:03,190
anyway you know anyone know how to make

00:39:51,650 --> 00:40:08,890
it bigger it's small work please come

00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:11,590
now okay anyway this is the if you can

00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:12,400
dude what it's not working okay no

00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:15,250
problem

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,200
this is a pretty straightforward CSV

00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:28,090
file which I showed you in the plug-in I

00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:33,310
think this is the first block that same

00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:51,160
CSV file I am keeping it there and I

00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:54,940
have a yml file this is my yml file once

00:40:51,160 --> 00:41:02,200
you install this module you need to go

00:40:54,940 --> 00:41:04,990
here in the configuration and you need

00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:11,350
to go to the configurations you need to

00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:21,670
import it single import group is

00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:27,220
migration you gonna say say you can see

00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:30,610
before is there any there is no users

00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:43,350
present now we have the users already in

00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:47,080
the CSV file I I kept that in a CSV

00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:51,790
folder here and checking the absolute

00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:54,930
path and this is my yml file presenting

00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:58,660
here and this is my absolute path and

00:41:54,930 --> 00:42:01,180
you can see the path I am giving it this

00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:04,900
is my absolute path for the CSV file

00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:08,080
I've done and in the CSV file there is a

00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:13,000
columns called name email rolls same as

00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:16,520
I am a pin with the fields in the people

00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:23,810
field and I added

00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:25,930
I need to add the first name and last

00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,930
name

00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:44,410
then I need to add the last name

00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:02,300
then one more field line Edward that is

00:43:03,349 --> 00:43:16,200
that is the full name so I made sure

00:43:11,369 --> 00:43:18,690
that those fields are added and we're

00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,840
gonna we need to import the CSV file the

00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:27,740
same CSV file like this just one click

00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:29,720
import yeah and then you go to the

00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:35,030
terminal

00:43:29,720 --> 00:44:01,470
just type migration status M as Thomas

00:43:35,030 --> 00:44:03,570
you can see one CSV unprocess no no I

00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:10,200
didn't I didn't imported it actually you

00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:12,300
can see this I'm gonna import it so I'm

00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,430
gonna import it now it's not imported in

00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:17,430
now I'm just seeking the migration

00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:24,180
status you can see the file ID is called

00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:27,359
CSV the same ID you given here CSV that

00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:29,250
is the ID you getting hit here group in

00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:31,890
the group CSV then you say there is a

00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:34,800
idealist status area ideal there is a

00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:37,380
three rows of data are there and it's

00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,930
not imported it's not unprocessed so I'm

00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:45,839
gonna use - mi that is called -

00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:53,150
migration in board so three files are

00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:53,150
created and you can see

00:44:56,470 --> 00:45:05,630
c35 circle three users are created this

00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:06,350
is how it is I mean like if you want to

00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:09,050
roll back

00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:14,590
so you you got some mistakes suppose

00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:18,580
like you found the dummy username it's a

00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:43,000
there is no first name last name so

00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:46,370
you're gonna roll back sorry

00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,350
so you if you want to roll back you

00:45:46,370 --> 00:45:50,510
created those three files you okay you

00:45:48,350 --> 00:45:56,450
found some mistake you can roll back

00:45:50,510 --> 00:46:03,500
through same ID you can give its roll

00:45:56,450 --> 00:46:07,130
back so when you go here this it's roll

00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:10,670
back so it's easy to do the migration

00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:16,550
condemned and to and fro till when you

00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:19,040
get him updated silly costumes yeah so I

00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:21,350
saw that you are using trust to migrate

00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,270
I was following the official

00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:25,670
documentation it was saying to his

00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:28,580
composure to install brass and it was

00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:30,890
installing then nine version but the

00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:35,120
first command fails because it wants the

00:46:30,890 --> 00:46:38,680
eighth version so which version of trust

00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,680
is recommended to make the migration

00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:48,920
mission of brush use brush eight plus

00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:52,670
more brush eight about rachet this works

00:46:48,920 --> 00:47:01,160
but not the rest 9-9 also works alright

00:46:52,670 --> 00:47:03,109
that - - nine yeah you can see yeah the

00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:05,539
set - name

00:47:03,109 --> 00:47:07,339
you can see that it's a brash name and

00:47:05,539 --> 00:47:09,259
there's a really interesting page

00:47:07,339 --> 00:47:11,960
somewhere about drush and what version

00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:14,089
it works for I don't it must be in the

00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:16,089
drush dock somewhere which might answer

00:47:14,089 --> 00:47:19,599
your question and so really clear

00:47:16,089 --> 00:47:19,599
description of which one to use

00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:38,200
yeah and just for the recording you with

00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:44,710
the gentleman okay gentleman is going to

00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:48,460
use the microphone again yeah with with

00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:50,740
install and rush via composer it all

00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:53,559
depends and we've installed rush if it's

00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:57,430
an if you've got block rush eight in

00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:59,559
global and then you've installed rush

00:47:57,430 --> 00:48:01,900
nine and your projects and your local

00:47:59,559 --> 00:48:03,190
project then it all depends on which one

00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,710
it's running and there can be some

00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:07,710
conflicts between what's in your vendor

00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:09,880
stuff and what's and your global and we

00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:14,140
what you're running so you got to make

00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:17,910
sure that those two are aligned yeah so

00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:25,809
I have a to dress running on my system

00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:29,319
which let me see you can see this is my

00:48:25,809 --> 00:48:32,230
da dress I mean that's version eight so

00:48:29,319 --> 00:48:36,010
I got this conflict sometimes so I

00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:38,589
because of I need a Drupal seven so -

00:48:36,010 --> 00:48:40,960
name one work with the Drupal seven so I

00:48:38,589 --> 00:48:43,990
install this as separately and created

00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:46,799
an alias for this brush a and using a

00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:54,940
said this is my - eight yeah if you can

00:48:46,799 --> 00:48:58,859
see run this it will still work see

00:48:54,940 --> 00:49:03,099
still is create so one more question

00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:05,020
yeah I about migrating modules so it is

00:49:03,099 --> 00:49:06,910
recommended in the documentation to

00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:09,130
install all modules that you have in the

00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:13,510
Drupal seven sides on the Drupal eight

00:49:09,130 --> 00:49:16,359
before the migration so you go all the

00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:18,220
way all this process let's say and

00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:21,040
eventually there is no more migration

00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:24,010
path so there is no added value into

00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:27,700
that if if the most of you do not have a

00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:30,190
migration path so is there a way to know

00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:32,980
that beforehand if the most present

00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:36,359
migration somehow so you save the time

00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:36,359
of installing or everything

00:49:37,650 --> 00:49:42,690
so the question is about determining

00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:45,779
beforehand before you enter it waiting

00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:47,700
for it to decide what's available is

00:49:45,779 --> 00:49:50,089
today I know what modules have an

00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:52,980
upgrade path a migration of new paths

00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:55,109
the answer is that anything that's in

00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:57,809
core any modules that have moved into

00:49:55,109 --> 00:50:00,900
core does have one or it's in the

00:49:57,809 --> 00:50:02,130
process yeah has some bugs if it's not

00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:04,230
you actually have to go and look at the

00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:05,309
module itself look at their own

00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:08,579
documentation it's their responsibility

00:50:05,309 --> 00:50:12,539
to do it and I can say that address

00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:15,150
field does have one I looked there for I

00:50:12,539 --> 00:50:16,140
knew so if you have a lot of modules

00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:19,549
that could be difficult it might be

00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:23,160
easier to let the UI do it for you okay

00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:25,079
thank you yeah related to that because

00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:27,329
you've rightly pointed out that if if

00:50:25,079 --> 00:50:29,940
it's contributor it's the responsibility

00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:31,140
of the contribute people to deal with it

00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:34,980
but what happens if it's contributing

00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:37,019
seven its core in d8 and obviously the

00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:39,029
biggest one here is views is there any

00:50:37,019 --> 00:50:41,369
process even if it's an import rather

00:50:39,029 --> 00:50:42,900
than a migration views okay there's

00:50:41,369 --> 00:50:45,960
there's two parts in that the first part

00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:48,720
is that if it was a contributory 7 and

00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:51,109
its core in d8 because it's corn d8 it

00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:55,109
has a migration path except for views

00:50:51,109 --> 00:50:56,609
users unique and challenging and the it

00:50:55,109 --> 00:50:59,749
is documented in the known issues that

00:50:56,609 --> 00:50:59,749
it's just way too difficult

00:51:00,529 --> 00:51:05,190
yes and the general consensus is if I

00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:09,900
remember the discussion correctly with

00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:12,239
the other core migrators was generally

00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:13,619
you'd want to do that anyway because so

00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:15,749
much other things have changed and you

00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:18,180
might want to improve things and at leat

00:51:15,749 --> 00:51:20,249
and the views it has a UI so it's

00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:25,349
accessible you don't need a developer to

00:51:20,249 --> 00:51:27,239
do it yeah please hi so my question is

00:51:25,349 --> 00:51:29,789
about the specific use case where you

00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:32,759
have a Drupal 7 site which is being used

00:51:29,789 --> 00:51:34,650
and you have a Drupal 8 side on the side

00:51:32,759 --> 00:51:37,799
where you would like to have the same

00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:40,980
content flowing into so it's kind of a

00:51:37,799 --> 00:51:43,230
rolling thing my question is do you

00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:46,999
think migrate is to use the right tool

00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:49,289
to use that case or is there any other

00:51:46,999 --> 00:51:51,670
possibilities that would work better in

00:51:49,289 --> 00:51:55,210
your opinion

00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:57,040
can you once again Joe so you have two

00:51:55,210 --> 00:52:00,280
sides one is close to the mic please

00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:02,020
sorry two sides one is the Drupal seven

00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,970
side the people are using and adding

00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:05,800
content to all the time yeah and then

00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:08,110
you have this Drupal eight side which is

00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:10,420
basically on the side where you would

00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:15,280
like to have the same content flowing

00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:19,750
into you know on a rolling you can do it

00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:22,690
with the web service all the time do it

00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:24,370
web service rest services I mean you can

00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:29,590
do the same thing because you wanted in

00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:33,730

00:52:29,590 --> 00:52:38,800
