Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: API-First Initiative

In doing so, we need:

frustrations! to hear where Drupal 8's API-first support in core (and contrib) is currently failing, in terms of DX, capabilities, and so on.
roadmap feedback. (We need to hear what you think is important and why.)
help! We can provide mentoring: if you help out with patches, we'll provide reviews to help you land things in core!
This is an update of the sessions in Dublin & Baltimore.

At this core conversation:

We'll start with a succinct overview of what's going on, what has happened so far, and our long-term ambitions. Then we'll open the floor for discussion! When necessary, we'll explain subjects in more detail.
You don't need to be an expert in anything, just rudimentary knowledge about web services is sufficient.
You'll walk away knowing what's happening in the API-first initiative, and will hear about other attendees' concerns/thoughts/requirements/….
