Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: API-First Initiative
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	We are working on making Drupal 8 truly API-first: API-first initative.

We are:

Improving Drupal 8's REST API, to become best-in-class.
Bringing JSON API support to Drupal 8 core (stable in contrib during 8.4.x, hopefully experimental in 8.5.0).
… and there's so much more we'd like to see happen, such as: GraphQL, OAuth 2, UUID/revision support, CouchDB support.
In doing so, we need:

frustrations! to hear where Drupal 8's API-first support in core (and contrib) is currently failing, in terms of DX, capabilities, and so on.
roadmap feedback. (We need to hear what you think is important and why.)
help! We can provide mentoring: if you help out with patches, we'll provide reviews to help you land things in core!
This is an update of the sessions in Dublin & Baltimore.

At this core conversation:

We'll start with a succinct overview of what's going on, what has happened so far, and our long-term ambitions. Then we'll open the floor for discussion! When necessary, we'll explain subjects in more detail.
You don't need to be an expert in anything, just rudimentary knowledge about web services is sufficient.
You'll walk away knowing what's happening in the API-first initiative, and will hear about other attendees' concerns/thoughts/requirements/….

good afternoon everyone I'm gonna get

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,000
started it's 1:00 o'clock sharp

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,790
because after me there's two Brown who

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,750
is presenting as well on the on another

00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,719
core initiative

00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,820
my name is wim I'm Emily r sy I'm one of

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,619
the API first initiative coordinators

00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,300
matteo is the other one

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:22,529
unfortunately Matteo isn't here today he

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,910
is no better he's in a better climate

00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:26,939
than this one he's in my orc at home

00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:30,660
today I think so I'll you'll have to do

00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:33,480
with me I'm sorry so the goal is to give

00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,719
you an update of where we are at where

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,410
we are going and just to give everyone a

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,149
good sense of how things are progressing

00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:44,070
questions there will not be a whole lot

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,170
of time because there's another session

00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,120
right after this one but you can come

00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,770
and find me or anybody else who works or

00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,239
helps out with the API first initiative

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:54,300
if you have concrete questions as well

00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:57,030
of course so the things we'll cover the

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,530
vision the overarching goal then

00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,690
translated these specific goals a

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,550
roadmap of things that we are trying to

00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,729
get done as fast as possible

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:07,799
the ecosystem surrounding API first and

00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:10,530
then some outstanding challenges and

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,790
open discussion as time allows so before

00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,159
we do that actually I have a quick

00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,140
questionnaire we have I think well I'm

00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,520
relying on somebody else there who

00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,950
counts the number of people in the room

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,409
but basically I want to have a sense of

00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:25,710
how many of you are using which parts of

00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:27,090
API first and who are just interested we

00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,979
have experienced that what not so who of

00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,670
you raise your hands have worked on

00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:38,780
decoupled Drupal projects in the past at

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:42,150
all it seems like about it's 20 or so so

00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,939
that seems like about 1/5 probably so

00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:51,390
interesting if yes was it more than a

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:56,060
year ago about it's 8 let more than six

00:01:51,390 --> 00:02:00,210
months ago or less than six months ago

00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:03,450
seems all about the same interesting and

00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,070
the Drupal the decoupled aspect was it's

00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,750
critical to the overall project like

00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:08,599
that he couples a part of the project

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:14,930
was it essential or was it an add-on

00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:17,390
essential ok about 15 from

00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,580
if you haven't worked with the couple

00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:25,340
tuple yet in the past who if you would

00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:27,680
like to interesting only 40% I guess so

00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,380
some of you are here just to hear what

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,300
it's all about I guess which is fine if

00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,580
you have been using the couple tribal

00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:37,310
were using the core rest module or

00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:41,870
something else core rests

00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:44,840
it seems voice of you but when you I

00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:47,500
guess were you using the country abreast

00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,720
UI module to configure it to set it up

00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:53,480
who is used core rest UI alright sorry

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,340
the contract module rest UI seems like

00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:01,010
only a handful of you know about that

00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:03,020
module did you not use did the core rest

00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:04,910
api noticeably improve in the past year

00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,270
or so in your experience if you've

00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:12,140
worked with it did it get better

00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:14,630
no hands that's pretty sad well okay

00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:17,690
thank you I guess

00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:20,810
so that you've in this and have you used

00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:23,750
JSON API or if you use JSON API instead

00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:27,830
of chorused okay so about 50 you know I

00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:29,510
think if you haven't used core rest and

00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:35,330
you haven't used stationary I have used

00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:39,170
graph QL three four five people have you

00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:43,490
used relaxed web services CouchDB two

00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:44,660
people three four okay or have you used

00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,850
a combination of all of the above

00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:50,750
basically just some JSON API some rest

00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:53,270
some graph QL some relaxed one one to

00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,070
three people okay so now that that's

00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:58,190
interesting right so we have some sense

00:03:55,070 --> 00:04:00,020
of what people are actually using so we

00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:02,030
offer you a lot of options and that is

00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,230
actually kind of division this is what

00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,300
Greece has stated in the past he

00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:07,850
believes that it's important to have Web

00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:10,070
Services be first-class in Drupal so

00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:14,060
that Drupal has talked much support for

00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:15,830
api's and people are able to use them

00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,290
really well really easily with great GX

00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:20,390
and whatnot so API first is about being

00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:22,700
able to access your data your

00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:26,720
configuration or whatnot via API is very

00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,260
easily so the overarching vision is for

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,830
us to have

00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:33,020
and unparalleled API first platform the

00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,810
point is any data that Drupal stores

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:38,240
manages you can retrieve restfully in

00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:40,310
any format so the JSON format the Drupal

00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,740
core ships with the XML format that you

00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,020
have ships with but also to help Plus

00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:48,050
Jason formats that is an optional module

00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:51,110
in Drupal core but and also not just

00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:52,580
have pure representations of data stored

00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:55,040
in Drupal but also have it available in

00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,930
multiple flavors Drupal core s does it

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,600
in the HTTP purest way but there's also

00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:03,040
the JSON API spec which is also restful

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:05,480
but has a particular set of conventions

00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,920
both of those are restful but there's

00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,630
also non restful ways of interacting

00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:12,320
with data

00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:13,850
examples are graph QL and courage DB but

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,260
I encourage you be specifically for a

00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:17,750
narrow use case offline first

00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:19,430
replication and syncing and all of this

00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:21,110
should be available using any

00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,270
authentication mechanism basic auth

00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:26,810
cookie Oh F 2 whatever the future brings

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:29,660
and so if we get to this point then you

00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,910
can point any SDK any tool at Drupal and

00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:34,640
have easily interact with it get data

00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:36,950
art get data in which would make it a

00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:40,430
great connector a great hub for

00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:42,340
everything to be working together so

00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:45,650
that is kind of the whole goal and

00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:48,110
increasingly we are seeing that people

00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:49,970
not just want this but neeta's we have

00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,410
seen a lot of sessions about it that you

00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:54,020
become Baltimore there were 12 sessions

00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:55,250
one training I haven't checked actually

00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,890
for this triple comb

00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:00,980
there was an entire event just for a tea

00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:04,190
couple triple so it seems the need is

00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:07,610
strongly increasing the goals that we

00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:09,710
have we we try to take those days over

00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:11,300
are the overarching vision and translate

00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,560
into massive should have could have

00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:15,440
because you need to start somewhere

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,450
right so the first thing was Drupal 8

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,780
shipped with the REST API but it wasn't

00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:22,670
very usable so that was the first the

00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,990
first thing to get done then of course

00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:25,220
we want to go further we want to make it

00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,800
best in class and we won't have

00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,690
excellent documentation so those are the

00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,520
must-haves and happy to say that it is

00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,850
actually usable now we're making good

00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,050
progress on making it best-in-class and

00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:38,890
documentation automatically generated

00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,910
for your content type 3 entity types

00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:43,760
that is also proceed

00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:46,880
pretty well should have JSON API we

00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,680
would love to see that be used far more

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,840
because it solves certain problems that

00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:54,050
the core arrest module has for example

00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,970
you have collection querying filtering

00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:58,730
sorting and so on which Drupal core s

00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:58,970
doesn't so that's also a very important

00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,620
one

00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:03,410
well glad to say that there's also a

00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:06,290
stable module for that mostly thanks to

00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:08,060
matteo and daniel who is in the back and

00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:10,910
looking at his phone and not hearing

00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:13,760
this and also many other contributors of

00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:15,200
course graph QL is also shaping up

00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,570
really well and they're about to release

00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,670
a first stable version so if you haven't

00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:21,320
tried that in the past because it hasn't

00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:25,160
had a stable release yet well it's about

00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,960
to get one there's a workflow initiative

00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,690
with which the person who is making a

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,980
photo over there now is working on a lot

00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:33,800
along with several people here in the

00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,630
France that is great and it enables new

00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,660
possibilities but we also need to be

00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:40,670
able to do those things via API s so UID

00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,770
support and chorused doesn't exist yet

00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,330
we should have that revision support

00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:46,550
doesn't exist in core rest nor json api

00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,860
we should have that as well so there's

00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,030
more work to be done there that hasn't

00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,510
really started yet but as you can see

00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:55,250
quite a few things are taking shape

00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:57,890
things that we should have or at this

00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,290
point could have os/2 supports that is

00:07:57,890 --> 00:08:02,390
also progressing really well

00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:05,720
couchdb supports I was just talking to

00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:08,690
Dickson here at France about that module

00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,340
it turns out that is just at the

00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:12,050
beginning of September it has had its

00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:14,210
first beta release and they're using it

00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:16,160
in production so CouchDB supports if you

00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:18,500
want to use that relaxed web services

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,110
module income trip it's also getting to

00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:24,140
a really good good place so if we

00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:26,900
compare that with six months ago there's

00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:30,230
quite a bit more weight lifting going on

00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:32,419
as in progress being made one another

00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,950
another goal reached and so on so we are

00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:35,750
making good progress so hopefully this

00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:41,599
gives you a sense of where we were where

00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:43,789
we are today so why these things well

00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,860
four core rest the reason we have that

00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,570
is it supports multiple formats

00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,710
sometimes you want to have a format

00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,170
specific for your needs

00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:53,120
it supports any kind of data so it can

00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:54,100
be used for non-entity data basically

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,230
and

00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,810
super configurable which is great in

00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:01,480
some use cases and kind of checks the

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,190
post with that is JSON API which doesn't

00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,040
support multiple formats which is not

00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:07,750
very or not as configurable but it makes

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,920
your life a whole lot more easier

00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,440
it doesn't require extensive

00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,000
configuration and so on so because it is

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,350
opinionated you can have better tooling

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,830
you can avoid bike shedding and

00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:20,020
researching various competing potential

00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:21,940
tools it just answers those things

00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:24,930
because it has an agreed set up an

00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:27,460
agreed-upon set of decisions basically

00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:30,220
collection support as I mentioned is

00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:35,350
something at rest doesn't have so JSON

00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:39,720
API is very very easy to use module in

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:43,060
comparison to the REST API graph QL is

00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,130
at this point really the thing mostly

00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:46,870
used for UI components that don't fetch

00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:48,730
their data and just the data that they

00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:51,730
need which is harder to achieve with

00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:54,130
Korres and JSON API and rest is already

00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:57,880
in core it's in stable core JSON API is

00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:59,860
currently stable income trip we're

00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,930
working on maturing it in eight fork on

00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:05,140
trip and hopefully we're going to get it

00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:06,370
into triple eight five core which would

00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:10,060
make your life a whole lot easier

00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:11,530
graph QL is about to be released as a

00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:13,900
stable module I haven't checked today's

00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:16,690
Twitter feed but I think it's going to

00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:19,750
happen any day you know so these are

00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:22,570
REST API JSON API graph QL these are all

00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:24,430
modules to interact with data but the

00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:26,430
problem also is that sometimes it's hard

00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:29,620
to figure out how to do that interaction

00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:31,570
documentation is often missing and

00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:33,340
that's why we have open API we're

00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:36,280
working on getting data to a stable

00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:38,710
place in aid for calm trip so the point

00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,660
is that starting was very painful like a

00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:43,390
year ago because documentation was

00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,680
lacking things were brittle well rest is

00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:47,620
much more stable now were chasing a

00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:50,580
bi-stable documentation via open API

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:55,650
which works for both rest and JSON API

00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:57,760
so this works for both this and this

00:10:55,650 --> 00:11:00,880
well that will make things a whole lot

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,770
easier so hopefully that gives you a

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,050
sense of why we are working on specific

00:11:02,770 --> 00:11:06,250
things if you then look at what we are

00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,660
currently working on what our current

00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:10,150
focus is to

00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,920
to go to the next level kind of REST API

00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:14,680
we're working to make it best in class

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,740
what is actually missing right now is

00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,420
translation support so it's it's

00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:21,220
somewhat possible but it's not fully

00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:23,110
supported yet to retrieve for example a

00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,300
Dutch or French or German translation of

00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:27,630
a node but you can you definitely cannot

00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,010
patch it post it so you can't modify it

00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:32,410
modifying configuration is impossible

00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:34,300
configuration entities you can retrieve

00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:37,810
it retrieve them but you can't modify

00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:39,940
them file uploads are not supported and

00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:41,500
the thing is because JSON API builds

00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:45,400
upon this infrastructure that core

00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:47,500
provides the same gaps translations

00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,110
config modification and file uploads are

00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,850
also not yet supported in JSON API

00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:54,160
obviously these are pretty important so

00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:57,310
we are working to add them to core and

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,020
then JSON API will benefit as well we

00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:02,050
are working on them but it required it

00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:04,330
takes time because we need to expand API

00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,700
is in Drupal core in the subsystems that

00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:08,320
all of this builds upon so everything

00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:11,740
needs to support it in order for the

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,690
REST API is to support this for JSON API

00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,130
the key thing that is missing besides of

00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:18,340
things that are already in rest is

00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:20,800
comprehensive test coverage which to be

00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:22,480
fair rested and half at first either at

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,980
this point is almost at a hundred

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,140
percent coverage in the sense that all

00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,580
entity types have a very solid set of

00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,790
test coverage so that we know that we

00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,500
break things if we do for JSON API we

00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,750
still need to do that but because core

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,580
already paved path it should be much

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:40,690
much faster for JSON API and that will

00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:42,460
help it get into core krav ql what is

00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:45,340
missing there is more sites using it

00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:47,350
more feedback amazing is using it in

00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,660
production they are using it very

00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:52,000
productively they're using it to well

00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,830
they're very satisfied but we need more

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,830
people and with more different use cases

00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:59,890
who also use it and give feedback and so

00:12:56,830 --> 00:13:02,080
on of course the next one is excellent

00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:03,970
documentation via open API as I

00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,220
mentioned before the interesting thing

00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:08,650
is that just six months ago there was

00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,870
competition we didn't have a clear path

00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:13,150
forward it was the rest api dark module

00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,950
from a year and a half ago the schemata

00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,780
module that talks on a module and the

00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:20,290
open API module and then I think a few

00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:22,630
more sand boxes so there was no clear

00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:24,550
on how to move forwards at this point

00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:27,220
there is so we are standardizing on the

00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:29,440
open API module which is also a spec

00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:33,630
that we didn't invent so it also

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:36,819
integrates with other tools so REST API

00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:39,850
further gaps being addressed JSON API

00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:42,160
the same gaps plus tests graph QL also

00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:43,660
being stabilized an open API getting to

00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,470
a point where it is actually working for

00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,970
all these cases of course that is a lot

00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,940
of work to to get all of these things

00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:54,100
moving forward and yet more like UUID

00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,139
revision support CouchDB support in core

00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:58,600
and whatnot so we would love to see more

00:13:56,139 --> 00:14:00,310
help and the good news is that a Korea

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,769
is hiring more people to help out

00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:05,970
specifically with API first rupal so if

00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:09,009
you are interested in that let us know

00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:11,980
the people working on all these things

00:14:09,009 --> 00:14:13,540
so core rest relax Web Services and so

00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,180
on but specifically the things that

00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,790
we've been working on so far matéo is

00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,889
zero episode and I are the initiative

00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:23,560
coordinators and we are working on

00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:24,880
various parts daniel is also working

00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,639
very much on the rest of civilization

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,769
and json api so pretty much all over as

00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:31,899
we know daniel to be all over all the

00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:34,089
things that bowman is working in open

00:14:31,899 --> 00:14:36,819
api but also core essence realization

00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:38,380
and damien cloy jamie lee is also

00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:40,569
helping out with serialization arrest so

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,829
if you are specifically seeing problems

00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:43,300
with any of these areas or you have

00:14:41,829 --> 00:14:45,399
feedback or you have a feature request

00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,589
or you want help out and you don't know

00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:50,500
where to get started come talk to these

00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:54,370
specific people in IRC you can find all

00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:56,410
of us the ecosystem so what we talked

00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:58,540
about so far was the overall vision like

00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:00,760
Drupal should be able to support all of

00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,649
these things but there is also tooling

00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,560
being built around it to make it easier

00:15:02,649 --> 00:15:07,779
to get started some of the tooling is

00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,399
waterwheel it's a it's a library to a

00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:12,550
JavaScript library to make it easier to

00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,209
start talking to Drupal core rest and to

00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:17,170
drupal's

00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:18,939
JSON API to take away some of the drupal

00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:20,769
isms to make it easier to get started

00:15:18,939 --> 00:15:23,490
and to make requests in just the right

00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:25,000
way and so on distributions

00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:28,360
distributions to make it a whole lot

00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,819
easier to get started content is the

00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,620
short version is content up is a massive

00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:33,820
productivity boost if you want to build

00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,590
if you are familiar with

00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:37,810
pupil and you want to build a decoupled

00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:40,600
Drupal site it has example apps for

00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:42,910
various JavaScript libraries makes it

00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,800
very easy to get a sense of how that

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:46,600
works that specific library that

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,250
specific SDK being integrated with

00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,440
Drupal

00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:53,560
Reservoir is specifically targeted at

00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:55,690
NAM Drupal lists it aims for simplicity

00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,760
so it has is far less feature complete

00:15:55,690 --> 00:16:00,550
feature-rich add-on content I'd chooses

00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:02,380
to focus on simpler things it's a

00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:05,380
different audience probably for you guys

00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:07,720
most of you would be best to use content

00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:10,360
I would say give it a try play with the

00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:16,270
example apps get a sense of what you can

00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:18,340
do those are the key ecosystem things

00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:20,020
waterwheel content a reservoir but

00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:22,960
outstanding challenges things we haven't

00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:24,850
even really become to tackle or don't

00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,740
know really how to begin to tackle or

00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:29,440
just because we haven't gotten to it yet

00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,450
things like image styles for responsive

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,580
images should should they be embedded in

00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:35,050
responses or notes there are some

00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,780
reasons to do it one way some reasons to

00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:40,230
it another way if you have entities and

00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:42,940
you're patching or creating entities

00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,650
things like validation error responses

00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:46,570
how would you expose it properly on the

00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,800
client side when you do that patch or

00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,290
post requests and how would you present

00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:52,060
that you need to get enough metadata in

00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:54,520
order to be able to represent it clearly

00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:58,240
that's also not yet in a good place

00:16:54,520 --> 00:17:00,400
Drupal core is not yet using any of the

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,930
rest API so it's only you guys using it

00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,420
essentially at this point so ideally

00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:06,370
Drupal core would be using it and the

00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:09,100
scariest of them all API versioning

00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:10,600
which nobody has solved yet not in

00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:13,839
Drupal not outside true poll not

00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:15,790
anywhere so how do we solve that for

00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:17,980
drupal very any site builder can add new

00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:20,520
fuel types and can change a single value

00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:24,310
to a multi value field and so on that's

00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:26,709
stuff of nightmares unfortunately so

00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:28,209
yeah that's I hope that's a that gives

00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:29,590
you a good sense of where things are at

00:17:28,209 --> 00:17:32,260
where things are going what we're

00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,430
working on and I talked fast I'm sorry

00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:37,450
but I wanted to leave some time for

00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:39,580
questions or discussion so any questions

00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:42,510
any feedback any concerns any

00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:42,510
frustrations

00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:54,520
or maybe everyone is here for the next

00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:57,100
talk this is maybe just for you way more

00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:59,470
maybe people in the room how do you feel

00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:01,870
progress over time has been are we

00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:03,790
moving too fast too slow just at the

00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:07,570
right pace or do we need to move even

00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:09,940
faster it can use be a little more

00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:12,340
specific in what sense for a core arrest

00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:14,380
the overall API first stuff I think

00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:19,240
Drupal as a project the overall API

00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:22,270
first stuff okay I think interestingly

00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,520
enough quite a few things are moving

00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:26,200
forward really fast simultaneously like

00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,910
ruff who else moving for Jason ups

00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:30,370
moving for it Olaf is moving forward

00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:32,950
GB support is moving forward so a lot of

00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:35,620
things are moving forwards quite nicely

00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:37,390
to me personally I'm working on core

00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,880
arrests and trying to get that to move

00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:41,770
to a really good place and JSON API I

00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:44,620
took really good place which requires

00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:46,420
fixing a lot of subsystem edge cases

00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,190
that weren't taken into account when

00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:50,590
those subsystems were fair first built

00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,630
and I wish those things were going

00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:54,220
faster because it takes a lot of time

00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:56,830
and effort back and forth consensus

00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:58,390
building and so on so that part I wish

00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:00,130
could go faster I'm not sure it can

00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:02,620
because that's the thing about it open

00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:04,420
source and consensus building if I think

00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,190
something is ready Oh but apparently

00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:08,200
then Andre thinks of something that I

00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,730
hadn't thought of and then we should fix

00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,100
that and then Daniel thinks of something

00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:14,230
and that's the thing about its Drupal

00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:16,450
lots of people come together and think

00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:18,820
of additional edge cases which makes the

00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:21,760
whole much better much more reliable

00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:28,690
more robust but it makes more takes more

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:31,660
time everything was crystal clear or

00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:37,059
really everybody came for cheaper on

00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:39,610
stock Daniel I have a really simple

00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:41,860
question how do we talk food I mean you

00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,450
said we should talk food yeah how do we

00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:45,520
talk food I think you had a really good

00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,710
great idea a few weeks ago where you

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,500
said it would be interesting if as soon

00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:52,929
as you install the core rest module we

00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:56,020
would change for example the the node

00:19:52,929 --> 00:19:57,190
forum to not call PHP code but do an

00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,000
arrest request

00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,910
enter

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,470
to save the node and then if the

00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:05,200
validation error so that was one of the

00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:07,179
things that we don't really have in a

00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,190
great place the air responses in case of

00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:10,900
a validation error like if that were

00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,130
being dark fed and you would get a

00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,720
validation error that we'd have to

00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,520
continue to work the same way so we

00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,830
would have to fix this and we would know

00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:21,179
when it would break so that could be an

00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:24,010
interesting interesting way to do it or

00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:25,450
other uisce like layered Builder stuff

00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:39,309
that is being worked on and so on for

00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:42,070
example that my name so it's obvious to

00:20:39,309 --> 00:20:45,130
me maybe not to anybody else that the

00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:47,650
core rest api was not designed at least

00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:49,780
initially to be used to build like a

00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:51,840
decoupled website mm-hmm just the

00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:56,169
structural responses and whatever else

00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:58,870
and json api getting more stable is do

00:20:56,169 --> 00:21:01,299
you see a future where we deprecate

00:20:58,870 --> 00:21:07,179
chorus if you and that is replaced with

00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:09,910
something like json api I would like the

00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:12,669
answer to be yes because JSON API is

00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:14,650
like there's fewer things that are

00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:18,549
configurable therefore fewer edge cases

00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:20,200
therefore it is more stable the problem

00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:22,750
is that a JSON API only supports

00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:24,370
entities and so some I actually am

00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,590
surprised myself but quite a few people

00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:28,900
are using are creating custom rest

00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:30,970
resources to generate a specific XML

00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:33,460
response that they need to integrate

00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:35,710
with some external system that is

00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:37,600
apparently a thing and it like that's

00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:40,990
fine and it makes sense but so it's it's

00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,900
I think we would maybe deprecated a REST

00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:46,570
API or the core rest module for entity

00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:47,950
use cases as soon as we have JSON API on

00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,690
core because it is just far more

00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:53,080
pleasant to work with you don't have to

00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:54,970
create a rest export view to be able to

00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:57,850
list all comments for a node for example

00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:59,950
you can just make a request with a

00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:02,950
specific query string in the URL and

00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:06,100
then you can get just that data so I

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:08,710
would say fate we would probably

00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,980
recommend JSON API over rest for certain

00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,980
use cases

00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:16,220
and Matt is asking is there any timeline

00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:20,780
for that well it depends on when JSON

00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:24,610
API sink or hopefully 85 no firm

00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:27,410
timeline as is the case in open source

00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:31,010
related to that I think I think we can

00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:33,500
do a better job as as kind of a

00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:35,720
decoupled community if you made to like

00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:38,630
put together resources and document all

00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:41,179
those different use cases help users to

00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:44,500
really understand like use content uh

00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:46,820
for that or use Jason just JSON API or

00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,130
relaxed web services for this and that

00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,960
and like have a comprehensive yeah it's

00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:53,510
to really guide you know I think cuz

00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,220
there's so much activity there's so much

00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:57,620
progress right everywhere

00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,570
I think we've become a lot better yeah

00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:01,610
collaborating over the past six six nine

00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,900
months yeah and there's come some really

00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,760
good stuff out of that but I think we

00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:07,309
can do much better job that sort of

00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:09,320
guiding you know I think that's kind of

00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:10,880
the the task I don't want to put words

00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,039
in the mouth of the contents of people

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,980
who are present but I think that's kind

00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:17,450
of the goal of content to to show how to

00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,370
do it and what is the current best

00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:21,320
practice and if something is no longer

00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:24,260
the best practice I'm assuming content I

00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:26,720
will evolve towards to better practice

00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:28,429
but but that's a best practice for a

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,590
particular use case deal where you have

00:23:28,429 --> 00:23:33,590
like the traditional it doesn't do much

00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:36,320
with offline first or it doesn't do much

00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:39,380
where you decoupled to Drupal sites and

00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:43,159
you want to write maybe you should write

00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:47,500
some blog post so it's a GB so are you

00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:47,500
just proposed to get more work yourself

00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:55,460
another question so you list like image

00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:59,360
styles and stuff do you have any idea

00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:00,970
about revision support like do you think

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,419
it's important for the couple

00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:09,440
application I think I think also we'll

00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:11,450
have some thoughts about that and it's

00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,419
important for different use cases I

00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:16,490
think when you'd like the couple to

00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:18,620
Drupal sites or two systems not

00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,419
necessarily a browser front end and a

00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,220
back end then certainly you need

00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:23,310
revision support that's also form of

00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:26,670
decoupling right

00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:31,410
we shouldn't have this done many use

00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:33,810
cases so I think it's a good feature but

00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:37,020
it's also like exposing that and working

00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:38,820
on that in through our API so it also

00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:41,220
fix a lot of stuff in court you know

00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:42,870
like it's one of those things where we

00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:44,820
you know that we've discovered that

00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:47,190
throughout the workflow initiative you

00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:49,200
know we have to fix all these things and

00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:51,150
exposing revisions and giving people the

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,040
opportunity would then uncover and just

00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:54,930
fix a lot of good stuff and then whether

00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,630
or not you want to expose revisions on

00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:59,160
your publish side I think there was some

00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,230
good points raised there by the content

00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:02,970
the team in their presentation probably

00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:06,660
not a good idea but that's one use case

00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:09,350
right yeah I guess the answer would be

00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,350
it depends

00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:21,770
have him thanks for a good summary on

00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:25,090
API first initiative I have two

00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:29,020
questions one is before given that that

00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:31,700
headless CMS is so popular in Greece

00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:34,190
presentation that is it grows 500

00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:38,390
percent year-on-year mm-hmm why this

00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:40,190
room so small that's an interesting

00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:44,000
question and more interesting and

00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:46,220
perhaps is that these numbers are like

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,480
only about 20% of the people in the room

00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:49,250
actually have worked on the couple

00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,720
projects if everybody was awake and

00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,110
raise their hands of course but I'm

00:25:50,720 --> 00:26:05,650
assuming that is the case

00:25:53,110 --> 00:26:05,650
yeah I I don't know your second question

00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:24,290
okay according to the jury's

00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:28,160
presentation this morning it looks like

00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:31,270
we are targeting to decouple the admins

00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:33,650
of interface of Drupal mm-hmm

00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:37,280
is that that mean that we're gonna have

00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:41,780
to navigate differently in the future oh

00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:44,810
you mean UI wise navigate differently in

00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:46,820
this unit is it tuning ourselves in the

00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:48,800
right direction towards that or oh yeah

00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:50,360
okay so the question is basically is

00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,910
this initiative helping to make that

00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:55,910
possible at all yeah I think that's

00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:57,650
really getting at yeah or I mean or are

00:26:55,910 --> 00:27:00,770
we going to depend on what pretty more

00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:02,570
we choose or have to do oh well this

00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:04,610
this is basically just making that a

00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:06,590
possibility so this is making such

00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:09,080
decoupled admin interface as possible

00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:11,330
it's also making things like content a

00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,590
possible react front as possible like

00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:15,500
it's making all of those things possible

00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:18,050
without good API is to get the data out

00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:21,020
of Drupal and get data into Drupal you

00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:23,420
can't do any of it right so I would say

00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:26,270
yes is a necessary step along the way

00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:28,310
but this is not specifically to enable

00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,750
that this is to enable a lot of things

00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,850
that otherwise are not

00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:34,450
or just are very painful to do this

00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:37,160
should make it so that it's painless

00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:39,470
maybe it sort of lightful to get to

00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:42,230
interact with drupal okay so hopefully

00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:47,750
when we get to that point we'll be ready

00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:50,090
- yes yeah yeah I think I should wrap it

00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:55,790
up and maybe there's one more you

00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:58,460
remember your question it's more general

00:27:55,790 --> 00:28:02,690
again Drupal but given that you're so

00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:07,990
involved in in this initiative you know

00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:11,210
and the popularity of API first size

00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:14,660
it's not only that we are making Drupal

00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:20,860
and more and more able to work

00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:20,860
headless it's we are beheading

00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:26,450
which may be a good thing but I would

00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:31,430
like to hear it you're abusing this how

00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:33,860
does it feel Wow okay

00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:38,750
and the truth how I should feel about

00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:40,640
that to be honest I I don't

00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,070
okay so I would say that I'm not

00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,020
beheading Drupal I would say I'm turning

00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:47,720
Drupal into a multi-legged

00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:50,750
and multi-armed thing so you can do more

00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:56,600
things an octopus kind of ma'am I don't

00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:58,580
know but yeah okay that's perfect I'm

00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,330
giving Drupal more heads as in the

00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:06,430
ability to grow more heads

00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:06,430
yeah indeed thank you

00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:14,549
