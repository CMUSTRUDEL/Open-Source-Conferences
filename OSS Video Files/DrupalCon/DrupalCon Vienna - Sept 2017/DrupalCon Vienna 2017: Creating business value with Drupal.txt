Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Creating business value with Drupal
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	On the bottom line business decisions are always based on value, where value is the benefit in relationship to the cost.

Drupal 8 has a number of strong value propositions for enterprise customers:

Open Source
Configuration management
Distributions
Multisite capabilities
Strong and flexible API
Built on standards 
Sourcecode management with composer
Extensible features (commerce, media, headless, etc.)
In this session I will show how we position Drupal 8 as a value creating platform towards our enterprise customers.

Standardizing all applications to Drupal allows on the one hand to achieve significant value creation due to cost reduction in the areas of security auditing, quality assurance, deployment, hosting, and servicing. On the other hand new investments can largely be spent on innovation and improvement. 

The information in this session will be backed by real case studies from our clients.

Target audience

C-Level, sales reps, account- and project managers of software companies
Managers and decision makers at enterprises that are either already using Drupal or considering using Drupal.

also have a husband and I've been doing

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,199
Drupal since 2007 so since Drupal was

00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:56,579
version 5 and we basically did

00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,760
everything wrong back then but we've

00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:03,359
learned a lot since then so I own a

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,960
through pulse job in Frankfurt and we

00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,780

different nationalities in our team and

00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,650
but most important we use distributions

00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,200
a lot and we contribute to bit

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,939
distributions we use Drupal 8 mainly

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,840
except that the projects that we are

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:45,479
actually just maintaining but we since

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,770
two years now we only create Drupal 8

00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:52,229
projects and we are maintaining the de

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,509
cough distribution for the German

00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:56,399
government we have a booth here too so

00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:58,619
please come and visit us we are

00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,939
partnering with Emma tax on open ad who

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,520
with the distribution for higher

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:04,469
education we are working with the funder

00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,049
distribution and the commerce guys we

00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:08,970
launched the first webshop in 2009 now

00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,190
when in April and beginning of April in

00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,290
commerce too and we have done a couple

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,030
of them since pretty pretty good

00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,219
I advise you also to go and meet them

00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:20,700
but most important I'm really involved

00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:22,500
in the community and organize camps and

00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,469
organize local events both in Germany

00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,120
and in Iceland and one of my one of the

00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:30,629
highlights are probably the Northern

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,519
Lights camp that was a little bit where

00:02:30,629 --> 00:02:34,799
people flew in from the states and flew

00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,900
in from the Europe or where we are now

00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:38,819
and they met in Iceland and did a lot of

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:43,170
sprinting and we had a lot of fun there

00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:44,760
so we're gonna do this again but what am

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:46,739
I gonna be talking about I'm definitely

00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,019
not gonna be talking about Drupal nor

00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:52,019
triple 7 or 8 symphony open-source

00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:54,750
license fees or anything like that the

00:02:52,019 --> 00:02:58,620
session is going to be about how

00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:02,310
enterprises oral arts organizations can

00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:05,280
create value by using Drupal and how we

00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:08,879
actually Pitts Pitts this when we go to

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,650
large organizations and how we like this

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,799
is basically our pitch that I'm gonna be

00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:15,060
presenting so I only have 20 minutes so

00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:17,430
it's gonna be a little bit quick but I

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:19,560
hope that I will at least be five

00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:23,129
minutes before I have an end to it so

00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,199
you can ask questions so what do we mean

00:03:23,129 --> 00:03:27,030
by large organizations or you know that

00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:29,760
is like large companies like for example

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,040
put a meteor in Germany Pfizer

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:36,060
Johnson & Johnson it's also about

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:39,780
government universities it's about

00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:42,180
agencies marketing agencies that that

00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,370
are always doing the same thing again

00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,340
and again and again so the bottom line

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,940
is it's basically for companies or

00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:55,349
organizations that have very many

00:03:49,940 --> 00:04:00,449
projects and this is of course happening

00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:02,159
all over in large organizations so what

00:04:00,449 --> 00:04:05,340
are the problems that these companies

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:10,349
and organizations enterprises are

00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:12,449
actually having today so I try to make

00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:14,459
this light nice I couldn't because I

00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:17,489
have to say so much on it so the

00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,440
problems that enterprises are having is

00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:20,940
that they have very many websites so it

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,430
means they often have very many

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,529
different technologies so they have like

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:28,349
Drupal WordPress site courtoom locker

00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:30,990
media Adobe homemade solutions Wow that

00:04:28,349 --> 00:04:33,930
is in Iceland that is the thing in

00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:36,210
Iceland or worse at least so when you

00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:37,680
have very many technologies what the

00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,150
other need to have you have to have a

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,550
different experts you have to have

00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:44,250
different teams different deployment

00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,110
mechanisms different Hosting's so these

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,620
are all the problems that you have and

00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:51,539
you have very many large but projects or

00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:55,529
not even largest in general many

00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:57,750
projects so basically you will need an

00:04:55,529 --> 00:05:04,260
expert for every single site that you

00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:07,380
are maintaining or creating this causes

00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:09,029
high risk high cost and burn ups and

00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:14,250
this we've been seeing again and again

00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:17,820
and therefore I want to tell you about

00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:21,139
the example that as I said before I come

00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:23,219
from Reykjavik and we are a country of

00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:27,570
300,000 people and we are really good in

00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:30,150
football and soccer so the city of

00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:34,560
Reykjavik we have 120,000 people living

00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:36,719
there and of weights 10% work for the

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,279
city of Reykjavik because the city of

00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:39,449
Reykjavik basically does everything they

00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:42,050
take care of the schools and

00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:44,760
kindergartens so ten percent all most of

00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:47,310
the people that live in Reykjavik they

00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:49,889
work for the city so let's look at that

00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:54,029
example and see how we can have to them

00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:58,650
to create value for the city this is the

00:05:54,029 --> 00:06:02,339
status quo how it is the day they have

00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:06,659
50 Drupal web sites they have 150 Joomla

00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:07,979
web sites to d5 content XSL web sites 25

00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:11,490
weeks web sites

00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:15,510
25 WordPress websites and 25 sites made

00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:18,900
in some kind of our other system so you

00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:20,760
can imagine the problems that you have

00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:26,909
if you're trying to maintain this this

00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:28,830
is 300 web sites so they although have

00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:31,229
one thing in common they were all

00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:34,169
created they were deployed there is

00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:35,539
maintenance and bug fixing going on all

00:06:34,169 --> 00:06:37,590
the time

00:06:35,539 --> 00:06:40,110
300 times

00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:44,400
so you can't imagine what is the problem

00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:47,880
there so how can we solve it that's why

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,100
we are here right so we can solve it by

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,710
focused on one single technology and

00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,230
that is that can be Drupal that can be

00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:58,050
something else but we decided to use

00:06:55,230 --> 00:07:00,210
Drupal because we think that Drupal can

00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:02,550
really do that plus the city of

00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:06,600
Reykjavik they have said that they want

00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:08,820
to use open source technology so let's

00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,580
look at this example a little bit

00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:13,830
differently so imagine we have the 300

00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,320
sites they are on the right side or from

00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:19,080
you guys on the left side so every

00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:21,570
single web site consists of four

00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,660
different layers at least this is the

00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:27,060
stack so we have in the base we have the

00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,080
base system layer that's the management

00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,990
content management system that you're

00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,780
using then you have the core layer and

00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:36,360
that is the core modules the base theme

00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,250
the you know the installer so you have

00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,760
maybe created some kind of a blog or

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,110
events or news then you have the context

00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,169
layer so for example when you're

00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,250
creating 120 websites for schools you

00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:50,520
know there are certain things that the

00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:53,700
schools needs neat and there's something

00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:56,250
else that other proteus needs but you

00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,110
create that in a context layer and then

00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,600
on top you have the project layer and

00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:04,050
this is the specific layer for your

00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:08,340
website so this is how we like to like

00:08:04,050 --> 00:08:11,340
look at it because when we analyzed all

00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:14,970
300 web sites we noticed that there is

00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:20,039
so much stuff in common at least from

00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:23,280
bottom and up so how do we then do that

00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:25,460
we create a distribution so by creating

00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:29,250
a distribution or a puppy staven here

00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:32,669
there was a nice block that he had about

00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:36,719
distributions and what you basically do

00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:39,450
you take these modules or elements and

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:42,750
you pack them into something so

00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:45,720
basically you take the bottom we use

00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:48,030
Drupal 8 and we use Acquia lightening on

00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:51,570
top of that and this is just because we

00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:52,050
have looked at it and we have seen that

00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,820
they

00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:55,769
have a lot of good stuff already in

00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,959
there so we don't have to build that too

00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,880
so we start like by clicking together

00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:02,459
the modules that we like and we use

00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,589
again and again and again then we take

00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:08,279
the core layer we have the the paste

00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:10,829
theme we have the all these all these

00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:14,850
elements or the block element and the

00:09:10,829 --> 00:09:20,339
events and all that and that we go on so

00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:22,860
are you so far with me just recently

00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:25,709
there was a meet-up in Boston where

00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:28,649
Reese was actually addressing let's make

00:09:25,709 --> 00:09:30,420
distributions great and he said people

00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:31,860
don't really want to download all these

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,720
different pieces and couple them

00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,180
together and figure out how to configure

00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,550
them and deal with maintaining them and

00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:41,250
upgrading them distributions can really

00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,990
reduce so many barriers to adoption so

00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,209
by having a distribution we can already

00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,760
have all this we don't have to do it

00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:50,040
again and our programmers they also

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,480
don't like doing these things again I

00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,820
don't know how many of your programmers

00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:59,070
have created some kind of a news module

00:09:53,820 --> 00:10:00,450
on a website every single time so let's

00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:03,420
not think about so we're trying to

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:07,170
create value and one of the variables

00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:09,890
that we are using there is cost so let's

00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:13,920
just imagine that we have an average

00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:15,899
price per site 10,000 euros that not a

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,510
lot of money but let's just play with

00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:20,160
that number a little bit so if we say

00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,870
like of course we know in the city of

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,310
Reykjavik that we have very many sites

00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,560
that are really expensive and much more

00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,910
expensive than that so let's just but

00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,760
there's also very many landing pages

00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:31,260
that do not cost so much so let's just

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,000
use this example and you can use this

00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,399
number and you can put it up or down

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,350
depending on who - who you're talking to

00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:43,620
lets them take the layers and just put

00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:44,880
12 2500 on its layer you know it would

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,560
be interesting and this is what we are

00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,180
thinking about just try to see like what

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,050
is the real relationship and each layer

00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:55,230
but let's say that this 1/4 it means

00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:58,740
that for the city of Reykjavik and all

00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:02,040
other enterprises with this type of web

00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:05,100
project they have spent 3 million euros

00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:05,590
on creating these websites so 300

00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,160
website

00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:12,160
times only ten thousand years it's three

00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:14,290
million years that's a lot of money and

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,850
if you just put this number up to twenty

00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:22,060
thousand you will have a lot higher

00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:24,010
number so let's then try to look at it

00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:26,010
if we do the same calculation with a

00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:29,110
distribution okay

00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:31,870
distribution cost money that's no doubt

00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:33,520
so let's just put any number on it let's

00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,050
just put like hey we have to do so much

00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,060
we have to work like we have to create

00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,530
all these modules you know clan you know

00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:41,730
how much time it takes to create a

00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:43,870
distribution you know so let's just put

00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:45,310
750 thousand years of creating the

00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:47,980
distribution seems to pay a lot of money

00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,450
but in comparison with it what's gonna

00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:53,410
what you're gonna end up with it's not

00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:55,660
very much and then for all the websites

00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:59,620
that we are creating every single time

00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:01,930
we only need to spend 2500 euros on each

00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:06,100
website so we have three hundred

00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:07,900
websites times 2500 euros that's 750

00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,600
thousand years then we have the initial

00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:12,400
cost of the distribution and having

00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,990
maybe a somebody maintaining that

00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,570
distribution and taking care of it and

00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:19,720
that will resource in 1.5 million euros

00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,730
which means it's late leaves us with 1.5

00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:24,130
million years which is a lot of money in

00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:27,280
a governmental space for example and in

00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:29,200
any enterprise of course so this is

00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,090
seems really clear like why are we not

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,000
doing that why are we not just all doing

00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:37,720
exactly this if we have this problem

00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:43,020
that we have very many projects so it is

00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:46,360
not only about the cost it is also about

00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:50,740
freeing resources for innovation and it

00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:53,470
is also about using this 2500 euros to

00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:55,420
do something for the project itself to

00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:58,420
the website you know make some awesome

00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:00,040
front-end with react you know do

00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:02,980
something really cool and use the money

00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,450
on that don't use the money on doing

00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,940
this stuff that you're doing again and

00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,350
again and again so we can even like then

00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,820
we can calculate and this would be - we

00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:12,610
calculate with the client we say like

00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:15,670
okay let's take the 2500 let's hire that

00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:18,160
up so like make that a little bit larger

00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,420
portion on the top you know then you

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,670
even have more money to

00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:25,240
- you know to have your departments play

00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:28,000
with and do something awesome but it is

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:31,330
not only about freeing like getting less

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,090
having less cost freeing resources for

00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:36,580
innovation in your company but it's also

00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:39,460
about having your employees happier and

00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:41,680
very much less burnout for example

00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,330
because if they have to only focus on

00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,250
one single technology it's definitely

00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:48,100
easier than having to deal with the

00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:51,370
problem that time co2 before and of

00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:54,580
course the risk for an IT and now coming

00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:56,410
up the EU governor Ehrlich the

00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:59,200
compliance loss and all the data

00:13:56,410 --> 00:14:01,330
protection and of course this is also

00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,760
very important that this is all part of

00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:05,320
your basic distribution so they don't

00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,720
have to start doing that again and again

00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,000
and some people some agencies do it bad

00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,530
and other do it differently and then you

00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,880
know the IT is trying to maintain that

00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:18,040
and can't do that so this is then the

00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:21,660
question that comes up every single time

00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:25,090
here but we already paid three million

00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:27,070
so how do we solve that well it's not

00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:31,000
like that we are going to be taking all

00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:32,530
of the 300 websites and create and put

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,480
them into the distribution that would be

00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:35,860
madness so what we're gonna do we are

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,030
gonna create the distribution as the

00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,830
first thing we were gonna do we are

00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:41,440
gonna work together with a team we are

00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:44,920
gonna find out what the layers are and

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:46,960
then every single new project that is

00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:49,720
gonna come it's gonna be put on the

00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:53,620
distribution and that is how we're gonna

00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:55,330
do it so slowly from now you are going

00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:56,680
not to spend three million next time

00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:58,510
because we all know that there are

00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,180
protests they live not longer than maybe

00:14:58,510 --> 00:15:03,700
maximum five years so there anyhow have

00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:06,160
to be done and again and again so we

00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,420
already have maybe twenty five website

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,230
that we can do start them doing right

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:14,850
now because they have to be done anyways

00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:17,620
so basically it is still a pitch we are

00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:20,460
asking for a lot of money now to create

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:22,900
a distribution to occur save money later

00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:26,800
but the good thing about Drupal 8 is

00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:29,620
that it is upgradable this it has no end

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,690
and this is one of the big things that

00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,150
we used in our okay I said that I'm not

00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:33,830
gonna talk

00:15:32,150 --> 00:15:37,220
Drupal 8 in the beginning but I have to

00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:41,600
say this one thing that it has no end to

00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:44,750
Drupal 7 will have an end and where it's

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:49,100
not being maintained but Drupal 8 and on

00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:54,340
will continue so for enterprises this is

00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:57,740
also a very good tool to start using

00:15:54,340 --> 00:16:00,530
this is though possibly a problem that

00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,900
we are always saying is that we are

00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:05,150
possibly asking them to kick out their

00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,160
favorite vendors and they are already

00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:09,680
used you know using a lot of web agency

00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,230
that they love working with and these

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:16,400
web agencies don't necessarily write

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:18,620
code in PHP nor like Drupal there we

00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,420
have to work a lot with the client we

00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,310
have to offer a lot of training we have

00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:25,160
to create a lot of documentation of how

00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:27,950
to use this so they can still work with

00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:30,590
it with with their vendors and that is

00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:32,300
very important it will never work that I

00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:33,740
come in there and say like hey guys I'm

00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,080
gonna take care of it all and I'm gonna

00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,880
take all the 300 websites that are out

00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:41,750
there for the rest of the world we know

00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,430
that too so we really like tell them

00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,900
that we are gonna help you you know we

00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,040
are gonna take care of your distribution

00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:48,440
we are gonna help you with that stuff

00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,440
and we are even gonna enable you to work

00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:53,540
with the best front-end company and the

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,970
best company that does integration to

00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,800
whatever system they are using so that

00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:00,170
is really important in the pitch to tell

00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,370
them this that we are not or that is not

00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,570
their mission that we're gonna throw

00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:05,870
everything out we are just gonna make

00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:07,970
sure that your basic stack technology

00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:11,780
stack is just under control and we are

00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:15,860
gonna help you to save money there so

00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:17,930
therefore the bottom line as I as this

00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:19,370
is a very short session and normally

00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:22,490
often you also have a very short

00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:25,420
pitching time so this was my pitch you

00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:29,840
just have the same we have lower costs

00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:32,180
less risk and happier employees and I

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,700
can ensure assure you that this is gonna

00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,770
make the sale like they are gonna

00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:41,360
believe that because it is also true and

00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:43,220
this is being done now all over I talked

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,020
to earlier about open Adu distribution

00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:46,420
for a higher education right by image X

00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,970
media here

00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:51,740
clan we have the dqo for the government

00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,420
now and we see the commerce guys so

00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:57,950
there's this is being done a lot now in

00:17:53,420 --> 00:18:00,110
through poll and center with bhutva

00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:02,450
media so encourage duties to look at

00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:04,340
that and also use that when you are

00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:08,990
promoting and you're trying to convince

00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:12,110
the clients to go this way so just a

00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:15,170
little advice in the end that came also

00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:17,660
up in this Boston user group on the 5th

00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:19,640
of September it's a good friend Mike

00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:23,120
miles who also came to the Drupal camp

00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:26,150
in Iceland he said two things that are

00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,190
really important so number one if you

00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:30,050
want to build a distribution you need to

00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:32,780
remember that you're not building a

00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:34,490
single site you need to abstract your

00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:37,010
problems and solutions though the work

00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:38,090
for many sites you have to think about

00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,900
that and you have to build your

00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:45,440
distribution that way you can't just

00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:47,330
focus on this one site so and the next

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,060
is that if you're building a

00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:53,540
distribution you will probably deal with

00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:55,670
very many different teams and they have

00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:59,060
different expertise and priorities so

00:18:55,670 --> 00:19:00,860
not everything is a need to have so try

00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:03,470
to get the teams to think in terms of

00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:05,120
brand best practices and guidelines when

00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:07,460
describing the functionality they are

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:10,130
looking for and this is a lot of work

00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:14,300
this is probably the biggest challenge

00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:16,250
you have is to convince them all to that

00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,920
not everything is necessary and try to

00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:24,740
put that stuff maybe up to the top layer

00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:27,350
that we looked at before so that this I

00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:31,520
think I have already I think five

00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:34,370
minutes so I was I made it yeah

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,590
questions yes please and could you maybe

00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:39,410
come here because of the otherwise I

00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:42,400
will repeat your question because they

00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:42,400
have to record it all

00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:53,790
hi I have a question I'm actually I

00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:55,890
guess one were you not yours what I'm

00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:58,080
saying just a person that uses Drupal

00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:00,750
our business has over sixty four

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,810
websites plus because we keep acquiring

00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:06,480
companies and then we have this we're

00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:09,780
working in 7.5 right now we are - trying

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,870
to get money for the upgrade for Drupal

00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:15,840
8 now we are converting we have over 22

00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:17,280
websites or 18 7.5 and we're trying to

00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,170
get to this yes right

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,300
so as part of that and what you were

00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:23,310
saying is to rewrite trying to even

00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:25,080
though we're a fortune 100 company in

00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:26,670
the United States we still struggle

00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,110
getting money I'm part of that is your

00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:31,110
marketing I'm the head of it is your

00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:32,850
marketing so my question is this when

00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:35,490
you put anything you put in back that

00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:37,320
slide where you had the buckets this one

00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:39,330
no the buckets were you had like the

00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:42,180
definition on the bottom Yeah right

00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:43,890
there they steam and all that so when

00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:46,230
you were saying that there's

00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:48,930
nice-to-haves and they're the ones that

00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:51,090
we truly need would you say that these

00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:54,540
buckets are kind of like the foundation

00:20:51,090 --> 00:20:56,580
of when it comes to functionality yeah

00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:58,080
and then when you add me once you just

00:20:56,580 --> 00:21:00,240
add additional buckets within

00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,080
yeah well we tried to fit them into the

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,970
buckets so we try like and this is most

00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:09,000
likely the context layer then where we

00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:11,730
start to like put your your business

00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,080
into like what is alike and if we think

00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,400
about the city of Reykjavik you know we

00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,260
have the kindergartens they are pretty

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,300
similar and they have same API

00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,430
integrations and then you have the

00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:23,340
schools and we put them and then we

00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:26,850
start creating that modules in the

00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:30,330
context layer and then on top that is

00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:32,340
just very site-specific module and how

00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:35,970
the rack we help you get there

00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:38,010
what sorry Acquia which is the yeah so

00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:40,470
we are using Acquia lightning and they

00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:44,010
just come with a lot of for example in

00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:46,170
media and they have a lot of stuff done

00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:49,380
already that we are just using and this

00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:52,050
is also open source so the the Drupal 8

00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,730
and the the Acquia Lightning is open

00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:55,500
source products and there are very many

00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:57,090
agencies that are using Acquia lightning

00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,230
as their based when they start creating

00:21:57,090 --> 00:22:01,200
websites

00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:03,270
and we just pack this together and we

00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,559
put on the correct modules how we like

00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:07,470
and they have already done this

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:09,059
configuration for us partly and they are

00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:10,559
also maintaining and making sure that

00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:12,090
the media for example is this working

00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:13,830
out of the box and that's a challenge

00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:16,620
that we have often been having that

00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:18,750
every single time you have to you know

00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:20,910
the cumbersome new module and then you

00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:24,030
put in this module or you know and we

00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:26,790
just use that as a base and and work

00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:28,860
from there on and the pace could be then

00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:31,140
you know the same I know they know

00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:35,160
OpenIDEO distribution they are also

00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:36,809
using the same same pace as we are okay

00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,690
thank you yeah hope it answer the

00:22:36,809 --> 00:22:52,169
question

00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:55,940
anybody else know yes please can you go

00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:55,940
to the microphone yeah thank you

00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:07,190
i we as a Drupal building company have

00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:10,430
often the problem that customers have

00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:12,340
very special wishes for modules or other

00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:15,200
contrib Thanks

00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:17,930
which are not really sellable to other

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,950
customers this is not really fitting in

00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:25,670
your plan to build everything you do for

00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:28,130
the cluster of your whole customer ship

00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:30,230
so how do you deal with this problem you

00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:32,740
have to you have to make a really good

00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:35,960
decision where does it fit in this here

00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:37,850
at the moment like what we have been

00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:41,110
doing with de cough then we are

00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:44,030
basically open sourcing the bottom -

00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:45,650
which means that that part is there

00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:48,320
something that when there comes a wish

00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:50,480
we look at it and we have experts of

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,360
people who then decide if it is a good

00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:55,700
good thing to put in the distribution

00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,380
that is open source or not just like

00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:00,140
actually just like we do within Drupal

00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:02,720
project the same procedures the same way

00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:04,370
and then you go to the next level and

00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,310
you start thinking about that makes

00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:09,320
sense for this level or not and then it

00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:12,200
always ends up then in the in the top

00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:15,290
layer which then can grow you know but

00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,690
at least you have saved the the 2.5

00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:20,450
times 3 you already saved that and then

00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:22,250
you just can use at least that money you

00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:24,820
can even use ten thousand years then to

00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:33,740
do the top one which is then awesome

00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:36,620
cool yeah thanks any more questions good

00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:39,050
so I hope you enjoyed it if you have any

00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:41,650
questions you can anytime come feel free

00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:45,680
I'm probably walking around here and

00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:54,630
