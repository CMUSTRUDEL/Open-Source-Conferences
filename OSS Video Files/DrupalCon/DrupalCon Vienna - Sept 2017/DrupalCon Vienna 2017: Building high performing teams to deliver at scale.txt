Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Building high performing teams to deliver at scale
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	What level of knowledge should attendees have before walking into your session:  BASIC OR NONE

You’re a member of a project team. Everyone else on the team isn’t where you are. Or when you are. Or as up to speed with, Agile as, performant, always-on or as Drupal as you are.


Here’s how we overcame all of that and produced a performant, happy team across multiple Scrum teams, agencies, products and timezones.



Based on our experience of delivering large enterprise Drupal solutions for our global blue chip clients, our session will describe some of the challenges faced and the solutions our widespread project team uses every day to overcome them.



In 25 minutes we’ll give you our notes on the tools, techniques and methodologies we learned, discarded, adapted and kept, and how we continually evolve everything we do to cater for the very different needs and drivers of our business, colleagues and clients.



The topics we will cover, including real world examples:

Dealing with geography without becoming history

Agency boundaries and collaborative working

Multiple scrum teams interfacing with one client across multiple products

Design dreams v development wakeups

Collaborative and respectful culture in the name of the project

Stepping a confident path toward openness and transparency internally, (and with the client…)

Using common language and definitions

Tools and task automation

Building a productive culture via guilds and tribes and beer and foam hammers

right sorry about the delay good thing

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,929
I'm not here to talk about high

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:16,260
performance or anything I hope you'll

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:19,830
enjoyed lunch my name is Duncan McAndrew

00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:21,150
and I'm delivery director at unipro I'm

00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,310
here to talk to you about building high

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,500
performance teams to deliver at scale

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,539
I'm just gonna put a few slides up on

00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,130
the screen behind me to capture a few

00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,349
points and they'll be one at the end for

00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,790
key takeaways and maybe time for a few

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:37,559
questions or maybe not now because we've

00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:40,379
had tech issues so I'm not here to talk

00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,960
about an unusual situation an unusual

00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:45,899
situation would be for a fully mature

00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,219
team operating on a single product from

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,440
the same space with well-established

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:51,870
communication methods and execution

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,430
methods as well more realistically you

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,129
might be joining a team or you might be

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,210
onboarding a new team member or even

00:00:55,129 --> 00:00:59,010
generating a new team in the greenfield

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:02,430
environment across different countries

00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:05,519
and across different languages you might

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,490
have difficulty with your laptop or

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,720
somebody else's laptop which I'm having

00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:11,640
you might have time zones of an hour or

00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,140
even ten hours apart don't even get me

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,659
started on time zones that start with a

00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,430
half hour you might have seniors and

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:19,350
juniors who need a lining and onboarding

00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:20,520
despite client commitments and you might

00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,650
very well be dealing with people who

00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,350
have varying a familiarity with agile

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,290
processes as pertain to your company or

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:29,640
to your project or to your client and

00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:30,869
given these people not machines they

00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,360
will also have varying levels of

00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:34,799
productivity accuracy commitment and

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,470
knowledge from each other you'll need to

00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,509
factor in the program I'll be talking

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:42,360
about over the next few minutes has some

00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:44,159
40 developers and QA six scrum masters

00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,799
and six product project managers from

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,299
year pro a dozen UX and design staff and

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,700
six product owners from the client side

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:52,619
or from other agencies we've got a eight

00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,399
to those other agencies contributing

00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:58,049
data insights code content messaging a

00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,670
strategy at any one time all usual

00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:01,290
hangers-on like program managers and

00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,759
client services and delivery directors

00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:06,780
whose role is frankly never been a

00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:08,670
particular ly clear all these people are

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,530
ostensibly working towards the same aim

00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,390
and in roughly this

00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:13,459
fashion and all those agencies also

00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:16,400
trying to stay profitable with an eye on

00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:18,770
contract renewal which can easily get in

00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,700
the way of the program's actual aims so

00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,530
I'm going to talk for a little bit today

00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,240
about some of the things that we find

00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:24,890
work well some of the things that we

00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,360
could keep doing better and I hope this

00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:27,800
will give you an insight into building a

00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,880
scalable teams using a scalable

00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:37,160
processes okay

00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:38,390
he was unibrow well we had on 20-year

00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,610
anniversary just a couple of weeks ago

00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:43,370
that was celebrated in all five of our

00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:44,959
locations across the world we've mainly

00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:47,360
come from a systems integration and

00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,670
database background and what we really

00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,730
do is build websites that deliver to our

00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:55,459
client goals

00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:59,269
we're a development partner to global

00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:01,760
organizations and we have little or no

00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:03,680
design or UX function as you probably

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,310
realized by the labor action values on

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,560
my deck there's about a hundred and ten

00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,180
people in the company and the program

00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:14,239
I'm talking about today touches over

00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:16,610
half of them in some capacity it's split

00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,930
into eight streams including a separate

00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:18,890
stream for rollout you're not supposed

00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,310
to be able to read this don't worry

00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:24,410
about that means eight scrum teams most

00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,600
of which have their own scrum master the

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:30,049
client stands up the product owner and

00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:32,860
we stand up the scrum master the product

00:03:30,049 --> 00:03:38,540
manager the developers and the QA a

00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:41,630
partner agency provides the UX and the

00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:43,820
designers all resource is ring thanks to

00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,709
Pross the scrum team and allocated

00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:47,420
several sprints in advance by the court

00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:49,220
elite sprint the planning process so

00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:50,930
resources one thing that people don't

00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,350
tend to have to worry about which is

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,350
quite refreshing

00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:02,900
okay this visualization shows data usage

00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:05,720
across the globe over a 24-hour period

00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,610
for those who are interested Yuna probe

00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,860
worked very hard and frankly missed out

00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,450
on a lot of profit by keeping all the

00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,120
developers in one room as much as

00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:16,070
possible we started with one office in

00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:23,270
Chichester hang on there's an animation

00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:25,100
and now we have three introduced to in

00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:26,660
London one in Australia and a

00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,510
wholly-owned testing facility in

00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,860
Mauritius so everyone in the room has

00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,410
probably experienced issues with having

00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:36,320
clients and Mark scrum masters in one

00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:37,910
country and developers in another in a

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,730
scrum environments the benefits of being

00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,620
in the same room for stand-ups

00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:43,990
collaboration ceremonies and execution

00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,460
are really obvious for us all to see

00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,410
each of our scrum teams have their own

00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,540
room with the scrum master and product

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:51,229
manager in it and the developers in the

00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,490
same room too

00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:54,979
they all have their own virtual

00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:57,800
conference set up for communicating with

00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:59,479
the client ceremonies other agencies and

00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,160
testing and they will have their own

00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:03,380
permanent whiteboards and walls for

00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,030
their planning and their reference the

00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,830
client also has their own room in Archie

00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:08,330
Chester office and they're invited to

00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:10,310
physically attend all appropriate

00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:14,600
ceremonies and releases so they can be

00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:16,729
on-site for QA and UAT colocation is

00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,260
obviously very agile for developers and

00:05:16,729 --> 00:05:20,270
designers they can sit together and nut

00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,430
things out but only if they given the

00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:25,130
authority to do so by the client and the

00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,419
programme lean UX actually has a chance

00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,979
of work and if you put people in the

00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:29,930
same room and we all know that the agile

00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:32,960
manifesto encourages more face-to-face

00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:38,240
working methods all that being said

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:40,310
what's bad about colocation we put all

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,510
of our we put one of our scrum teams the

00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:46,430
mobile team into partner agency the UX

00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,050
and design agency because we felt that

00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:52,070
the mobile team would benefit a lot from

00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:55,280
having always-on access to a design team

00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:57,919
for that it was true to a point but we

00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,990
learned we're still two teams and two

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,190
agencies and it became hard to remember

00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,169
this when we were guests in someone

00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,419
else's house there were never enough

00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:06,300
meeting runs and although the designers

00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:08,669
and developers

00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,889
the same pod they didn't work together

00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:14,340
enough at the same desk regularly enough

00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:16,620
for us to feel a benefit meetings became

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,509
unfocused and basic scrum principles

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,610
were forgotten the scrum masters

00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:22,080
austerity was undermined and a lot of

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:24,000
people became a bit slope shown up about

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:30,360
the responsibilities we had to step in

00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:32,009
and do a full scrum reset the situation

00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,539
we discovered that that partner agency

00:06:32,009 --> 00:06:36,449
has some interesting powers with the

00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:37,979
client relationship - they're genuinely

00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:40,620
trying to embrace the notion that we're

00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:42,210
all one team it's the product owners

00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,460
responsibility to Commission the scrum

00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:46,440
teams work for the Sprint and if the

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,780
Sprint or the program fall behind the

00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:52,560
product owner is the single ring herbal

00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:54,210
neck however the product owners are all

00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,699
humans and they're all answering to

00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:59,400
their own bosses and they're the same

00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:01,110
people that we answer to you as well so

00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,639
despite strong encouragement the

00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,259
products owners find it very hard to

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,819
take the blame for poor output when

00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:07,770
there are so many other people involved

00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:10,500
who they could do it to instead after

00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:12,240
all we're the digital experts in tech or

00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,699
in UX and they're just people that know

00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,740
their product we have to bear in mind

00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:18,090
that they have careers and pride and

00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,449
other agendas that we might not know

00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:23,279
about so things can be going just fine a

00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:25,020
bad Sprint can be perfectly well

00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:27,240
explained away and the retro run well to

00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,409
prevent repeated errors and then the

00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,979
scrum master gets thrown under the bus

00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:33,539
at the next sprint report meeting we can

00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:36,629
also be stuck in the situation where our

00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:38,250
co agency see our large team as a chance

00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:39,629
to increase their own involvement and

00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:41,610
there's no opportunities to throw an

00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:43,229
elbow in our direction if it might

00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,190
present a revenue opportunity for them I

00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:49,139
think we've all been there have to say

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,699
it does keep everyone honest if the

00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:52,469
client just have one agency on this

00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,180
they'd be missing all the checks and

00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:56,069
balances that come from having multiple

00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,699
agencies or running disparate processes

00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:57,930
and a QA

00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,240
and diligence and everything that

00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:02,250
happens the client and the agency

00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,080
seniors also understand that the teams

00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:07,289
need to be self-organizing and we are

00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:10,050
facilitators of this so we maintain very

00:08:07,289 --> 00:08:11,940
transparent very informal safe space

00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,529
back channels to speak candidly about

00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:16,110
difficult subjects for the good of the

00:08:13,529 --> 00:08:19,500
program and steer the team to

00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:21,940
self-organize if you don't need

00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:28,440
to adjust or improve any pinch points

00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:30,640
that they might have okay

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,620
self-organizing teams tend to level out

00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,060
and produce the kind of output and

00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,500
governance that's necessary for their

00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:38,320
project that's the definition of it

00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,880
that's fine across one scrum team it's

00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,450
fine across maybe a couple if there are

00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:45,490
common touch points we have multiple

00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,680
scrum teams interfacing with multiple

00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:50,320
product owners each of them have

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,810
enforced or not enforced different

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,400
methods of planning reporting JIRA use

00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:57,730
acceptance criteria sizing

00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,470
communications the list goes on again in

00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:02,410
a fully autonomous environment that's

00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:04,330
absolutely fine but the client seniors

00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:07,510
struggle to get a view of the program's

00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:09,310
progress and efficiency credit to them

00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:11,230
once again for operating or into very

00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:14,170
pure scrum principles but they're still

00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,880
running a business the two things that

00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,950
tend to produce sticking points are when

00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:20,050
they ask for more output than a single

00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:22,480
team can provide or when they try to get

00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:24,550
involved in reallocating resource across

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,180
multiple teams in a hope for the best

00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:31,030
kind of way when this happens it's our

00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:33,660
responsibility to help them acknowledge

00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:36,130
that quality is a fixed constant and

00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,990
therefore scope should be adjusted or

00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:39,760
highlighting and pushing back when

00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,650
instead of agreeing that a small

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,540
improvement in shippable product is

00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:45,340
desirable or they adjust the nature of

00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:47,920
the shippable product without proper

00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,300
sporadic planning this tends to be when

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,010
the agile manifesto and the Minimum

00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,010
Viable Product clash with real-life

00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,660
I'll leave that there for a minute I'm

00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:05,029
gonna talk next about roles within the

00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,370
program I've always liked this image

00:10:05,029 --> 00:10:09,319
it's remarkably accurate in the way that

00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:11,660
people see themselves and the way that

00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:16,040
other people see each other that's me

00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:17,120
right in the middle project manager I'm

00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,459
gonna focus on the difference between

00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,540
designers and developers as this is the

00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:22,040
area that tends to cause the most

00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:27,759
friction and the two that tend to be the

00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:31,279
farthest apart okay

00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:34,129
design dreams development makeups the

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,139
products owner will identify for us a

00:10:34,129 --> 00:10:39,290
vision and sometimes that can be just a

00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:40,879
couple of words like voice ordering it's

00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:42,800
then the product owner and the product

00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:46,309
managers job to turn that vision into

00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,860
executable goals the UX and the design

00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:50,029
staff are a key part of this and tend to

00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,779
be the first people the product owner

00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:58,370
will talk to the design process it any

00:10:53,779 --> 00:11:04,129
designs in I think the design process is

00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:06,110
really different slide the design

00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:08,629
process is relatively simple compared to

00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:11,300
the development process as you can see

00:11:08,629 --> 00:11:13,550
here it's basically sketching and

00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:17,329
coloring in some unicorns and then

00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:19,309
there's this word here build which is

00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:24,230
represented by this much more complex

00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:25,699
process down here where all those

00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,980
unicorns have to be turned into reality

00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:34,100
using the tools available at the time

00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:37,040
plus a lot of diligence and testing so a

00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:40,870
lot of our unicorns tend to end up

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,870
looking a little bit like this

00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:48,670
how can we prevent that well we can get

00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,350
involved earlier we can help the product

00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,210
owner and the designers understand

00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:55,210
what's possible now and what's only

00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:56,710
possible after a lot of work we can help

00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:58,180
to prototype and test so that we're not

00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,190
just producing one person's

00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,110
interpretation of a vision but the

00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:05,620
correct interpretation of a vision based

00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:07,330
on solid data and testing and most

00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:08,650
importantly as a business we can make

00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:11,920
sure that it's understood whether we

00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:13,540
produce a unicorn or a pink rhino we've

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,520
all agreed that the end product fits and

00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:25,750
meets the acceptance criteria in more

00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:27,850
than one interpretable way okay

00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,230
I mentioned a little bit earlier that

00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:31,420
one of the ways that we can help the

00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:33,160
program is to understand when in

00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:37,690
Sprint's adjustments need to be properly

00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:40,240
replanned in a sprint every action will

00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:42,580
have a reaction and according to the

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,350
basic rules accepting more points into a

00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:47,050
sprint usually mean that something of

00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,910
equal value will be discarded of course

00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:51,520
that message tends to get lost amongst

00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:55,420
the humans along the lines of can you

00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:57,400
just or best efforts then we end up with

00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,050
technical debt at the end of a sprint a

00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,720
task that could have been completed

00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:03,400
during sprint 10 rolls over to sprint 11

00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,740
despite sprint 11 already having been

00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:08,500
fully planned suddenly you're facing 10

00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:10,030
days work in nine days this repeats in

00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,650
the sprint 12 because you were over

00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:13,960
split stretched in sprint 11 and

00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:15,880
everything is already buggy so now you

00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:17,680
down 2 days it doesn't take very many

00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,840
Sprint's in fact it takes 4 Sprint's

00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,990
before all you can accept is technical

00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:25,450
debt and no fee to enhancement at all I

00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:27,070
call this a dirty snowball effect it

00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,720
gets bigger and dirtier every time that

00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:31,750
rolls and at some point it's going to

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,070
end up in someone's face the client has

00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,200
to understand that the very nature of

00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:37,480
Sprint's means this can't happen an

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:41,230
understanding has to be supported by the

00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:45,040
scrum master and by the product owner in

00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:48,190
the name of the program program is key

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,740
as although on a human level failing in

00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:52,000
one task might seem bad at the time

00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,500
taking the whole team out for an entire

00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,690
sprint to fix what should have been

00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,850
manageable levels of tasks

00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,980
is going to impact the program much more

00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,140
heavily so we have to reinforce that

00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:07,840
every time somebody tries to adjust even

00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:09,700
the smallest of things okay stepping a

00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,890
confident pass towards openness and

00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:15,340
transparency internally including the

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:17,290
time transparent communications and

00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:20,410
reporting are something that we're all

00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:21,850
familiar with as a concept bosses on our

00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,470
clients will all say they want us to be

00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,800
transparent but that tends to end when

00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:29,050
the reports are bad in this program the

00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:32,920
client genuinely sees us as a partner

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:36,130
partner not as a vendor this massively

00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,900
helps us with transparency because it

00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,550
means we can also treat the client as a

00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:42,850
partner not as a client from a

00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:44,800
commercial point of view in turn this

00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:46,840
means that we're not aggressively trying

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,970
to save money but to spend it in the

00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,550
most effective way possible with their

00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:52,660
agreement the whole company have freed

00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:55,120
up from difficult end-of-month

00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:56,740
deliverables and profit margin scraping

00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,900
and would never change to deliver

00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:01,930
something substandard in order to submit

00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,580
an invoice as we're planning our feature

00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:05,530
enhancement and releases years in

00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:08,070
advance were able to play a long game

00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:10,030
rather than a project project game

00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,770
inevitably of course this has an impact

00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:13,870
on our approach to Sprint's and sprint

00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:15,490
planning as often our team sees their

00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:17,530
work as small iterations of bigger

00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,850
programs and poor habits creep in

00:15:17,530 --> 00:15:19,480
because they're not operating according

00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:22,180
to sprints

00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:24,340
this is where constant project hygiene

00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,980
appraisal and resets of vital to keep

00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,690
everyone engaged on a sprint level we're

00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:31,150
able to act as the voice of reason

00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:32,950
between our staff and the client and the

00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:34,090
other agencies as we're the ones who

00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,310
have an eye on how everything ties

00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:38,500
together throughout the program there's

00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:40,720
no benefit to us changing the message we

00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,339
can't behind behind the code and it's

00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,070
also true to say that mistakes are a

00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:46,600
very agile way of operating apart for

00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:48,339
anything else the truth is the easiest

00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:50,490
thing to remember so it's best to stick

00:15:48,339 --> 00:15:50,490
to

00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:58,630
using common language and definitions

00:15:56,130 --> 00:16:00,339
it's really very important that everyone

00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:03,100
on the program is talking a common

00:16:00,339 --> 00:16:05,290
language so although it's not very agile

00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,880
to have documentation we have removed a

00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:09,220
lot of friction by establishing things

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,140
like races and jargon busting groceries

00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:13,420
and ways of working and roles and

00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:15,070
responsibilities documents we usually

00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,640
have more than one person who could be

00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:19,959
seen as the end over of almost anything

00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:23,380
delivery direct - versus program manager

00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:26,050
or Account Director development manager

00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,579
versus quality manager so it's important

00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:30,550
there's also a clearly defined process

00:16:27,579 --> 00:16:32,860
owner and an escalation tree most

00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:34,899
importantly of all is how everyone knows

00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:38,140
when we are done done and that comes

00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:39,339
from the original story the product

00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,589
owner needs to tell everyone else what

00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:43,029
the acceptance criteria czar and there

00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:44,860
are so many people involved in the

00:16:43,029 --> 00:16:47,950
process of defining and executing each

00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:49,750
ticket autonomously that that has to

00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:52,750
start right from the beginning the

00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:55,570
autonomy is key and that's where the

00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:58,149
idea can come back in it's a framework

00:16:55,570 --> 00:17:00,040
not a set of rules you're free to play

00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:02,579
with in design guidelines just don't

00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,579
break out of it

00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:13,420
from here are some of the tools that we

00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:17,170
use for planning and some of the tools

00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:19,030
that we use for executing and some of

00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:24,450
the tools that we use for communicating

00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:25,920
I didn't have room to fit them all in

00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:29,770
sound familiar

00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,240
this is probably nowhere close to all of

00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,950
the tools that we use on a day by day

00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,680
basis much less across the Sprint's and

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:37,180
the program everyone's got their own

00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,160
preferred method of talking to each

00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:40,900
other I've been on as I'm sure you have

00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:42,460
calls where I've got one method for

00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:46,420
voice and screen share and another

00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:51,010
method for typing and that changes from

00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:53,500
a sprint to sprint basis we tried to cut

00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:55,120
these down but realistically if a tool

00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,800
is right for the job then you'll

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,810
generate more friction try and see

00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:02,590
prevent its use than you will absorbing

00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:04,870
it some tools it's like for example can

00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,730
multitask for example we can Commission

00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:09,130
you builds on you eighty vice-like bot

00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:12,820
and it can surface communications to us

00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:14,350
via Skype so that's nice but Riaan

00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,270
reality it doesn't matter if we're

00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:18,190
exchanging messages using colored stones

00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:21,840
or skywriting or a t-shirt cannon as

00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,840
long as it gets the job done correctly

00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,630
okay

00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:32,880
somewhere deep in the agile manifesto

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,200
there is still a very strong instruction

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,080
to allow time for knowledge transfer

00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,610
cross training collaboration amongst

00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:42,270
developers and a decent work-life

00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:44,850
balance but sprint mentality and

00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:46,530
commercial reality also tend to confound

00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,080
this a little bit and that's a strong

00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:51,840
scrum master books time within the

00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:54,000
sprint for it at unify we do have

00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:56,240
Islands as success here it's an area for

00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,290
continuous improvement above all others

00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,730
ironically we've actually had to train

00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,920
people out of the notion that they have

00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:04,110
to go hammering into the code 24/7 and

00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:11,010
to take time to out to reflect and to

00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:11,940
learn okay I've caught up the time with

00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:15,030
the technical issues

00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:18,090
these were takeaways them make geography

00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:19,530
work for you don't fight it we found

00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,240
that we had a client that was making

00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:23,510
demands on us in Australia so we had

00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:26,100
some in Australia straightforward

00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:28,620
maintain call your back channels thing

00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,850
has carbs if necessary and just call

00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,920
people and say what would make you happy

00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:33,180
here don't go spending a lot of effort

00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,520
trying to make people happy until you

00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,990
find out what that is homogenized your

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,780
ways of working so that everyone's doing

00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:41,010
the same thing it'll reduce friction and

00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:43,590
make people more comfortable with their

00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:45,350
escalation processes enforce a digital

00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:47,430
design standard get involved early

00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,540
developers who understand what the end

00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,950
product should look like you've got a

00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,040
better chance of actually creating it to

00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:54,150
look correctly push back fairly by your

00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,800
scrum master on things that you

00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:57,150
shouldn't be doing and melt the dirty

00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,660
snowball before it gets thrown in your

00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:02,490
face be transparent and honest about

00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,070
everything it really is the only way

00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:08,210
you're ever going to get anything done

00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:10,500
establish an enforced common language

00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:12,390
yeah no need to go into that any deeper

00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,730
use the right tools whatever they

00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:17,460
happened to be just pick something up

00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:19,500
keep up with new developments link them

00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,230
together if there's a tool that links

00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,000
together your estimates and your actual

00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:26,220
effort done within jira and services a

00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,480
timesheet by tempo then use it and you

00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,140
don't have to have duplication of data

00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,250
entry and you avoid that pinch point

00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,290
allow time for training and the

00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:37,020
work/life balance our client allows us

00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:38,880
to schedule the developers to a maximum

00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:41,130
of 75 percent across a sprint because

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,590
they understand that meetings and

00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,970
training

00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:45,789
important learn that with better product

00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,900
that's pretty grown-up of them but it's

00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:49,539
something we have to actually work quite

00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,159
hard to enforce ourselves and always

00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:54,549
keep analyzing and adapting and changing

00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:58,390
and challenging those are all of the

00:20:54,549 --> 00:21:10,809
takeaways we've got a few minutes for

00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:24,070
any questions cool all right you're just

00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:25,240
on sit here quietly for a minute we're

00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,130
at stand three if you want to go into

00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,330
any of those any deeper or talk to my

00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:31,029
colleagues who have frankly a lot better

00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,980
at this sort of thing than I am about

00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:37,210
what Unipro do and how they do it and

00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:39,960
with Drupal you're either very very late

00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,960
or very early

00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:05,230
