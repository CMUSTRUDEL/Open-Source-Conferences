Description: 
	Welcome to DrupalCon! Welcome to Drupal!

It is important to all of us that you hit the ground running in our community. We’re scattered around the globe most of the year. Meeting and building relationships in person at events like DrupalCon is the glue that helps us be a welcoming, inclusive, productive (and mostly remote) community.

Especially if it’s your first DrupalCon, come along to make sure you know what our community is all about, hear some community tips and tricks, and find out about a few hidden gems that’ll take your DrupalCon to the next level.

Take-aways:

Learn about what goes on at DrupalCon--BoFs, Trivia Night, Code Sprints, Sessions, the Hallway Track, and so much more--and how to get the most out of it.
Drupal is inclusive. Yes, we have a Code of Conduct!
The more you put into Drupal, the more you get out of it.
Coding, contributing, and all that technical stuff happens, too ...

slides just talk about me one of my

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,270
favorite topics and then why I think I

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,129
can help you with Drupal con and I'm

00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,569

00:02:08,129 --> 00:02:10,539
the website and then I really want to

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:12,010

00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:13,239
what you're here for if you want to

00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,670

00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,939
of Drupal come this week and what is it

00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,170
that you need to know to make that

00:02:18,939 --> 00:02:22,090
happen then and we're gonna see if we

00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:24,700
can find out like figure out solutions

00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:34,989
for all of that okay so using the power

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:38,530
of Apple which is not open source yes

00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:40,450
so everybody calls me Jam I am a partner

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:46,840
at a company called open strategy

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:50,230
partners we incorporated three or four

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:54,069
weeks ago I think so so that's fun and

00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:57,250
open strategy partners we do strategy

00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:59,260
and communicate so marketing strategy

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,700
and communications for companies and

00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:04,840
organizations involved in open source

00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,909
and it's really really really fun so far

00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:12,069
we've got a couple clients and it's good

00:03:06,909 --> 00:03:14,650
good times I'm doing this because I was

00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:17,590
a a big part of my experience I started

00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:20,650
Drupal in 2005 I was the 18th employee

00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:24,190
at aqueon and I left Acquia this year at

00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:27,159
around 800 employees so I have lived

00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:28,540
through massive startup growth building

00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:30,669
a business based on open source all of

00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,590
that sort of things so my real passion

00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:34,750
is figuring out this amazing space

00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:35,949
between lots of hard work and

00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,780
contribution that we share with each

00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:39,579
other and creating value creating

00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,870
business value for ourselves creating

00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:42,909
stuff for our clients and that's what

00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,180
that's what we're really interested in

00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:47,889
and if you want to talk about anything

00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,870
related to business value of

00:03:47,889 --> 00:03:51,340
contribution open source and business

00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,739
all that kind of stuff come talk with us

00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:59,500

us there it wasn't the first Rubicon

00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:39,190
ever it was maybe the third or the

00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:42,550
fourth Drupal event but think about it

00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:44,349
Drupal con was 200 people so organizing

00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:45,880
the social evening a guy would just kind

00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:48,430
of stand up a bit on the table and yell

00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,099
okay everybody tonight we're going to

00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:54,250
this bar and that restaurant it was it

00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:56,740
was - yeah Drupal was different so and

00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:58,389
this I think this is my I think this is

00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,759
my 21st Rubicon in the last five years

00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:03,130
I've given more than a hundred

00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:05,110
presentations dozens of keynotes and as

00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,380
I said I moved through the worlds of

00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:10,539
open-source PHP business and yeah I

00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:14,919
really really like that oh that was most

00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:16,300
of Drupal con in in 2006 and so this is

00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:19,840
what the Drupal community looked like at

00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:22,060
that point that guys be I'm still doing

00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,720
Drupal here's entry Biron web chick

00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:28,570
there's Morton DK I'd say about half of

00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,650
this picture is still in Drupal actually

00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:31,840
which is pretty interesting

00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:35,190
chicks Berlin of chaos where that says

00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:39,370
that's real models who created views

00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:43,780
let's see oh then see this chart on that

00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:45,550
name there chaton he actually created

00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,880
the first version of drupal.org and he

00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:50,620
was user one and then Driessen he

00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,259
swapped so that Drupal that Driss could

00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:55,509
have the super user uh-huh count on the

00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:57,070
website most Weitzman is in the back

00:05:55,509 --> 00:05:59,229
there emojis here now Moshe is the

00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:02,289
creative organic groups and low end and

00:05:59,229 --> 00:06:05,680
Rush and he's still involved in Drupal

00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:07,900
and there's a ton of other people really

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,280
interesting people who are there how

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,110
young we all were

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,219
it's an embarrassingly long time ago

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:17,469
that was me at my first true book on

00:06:14,219 --> 00:06:20,560
information overload is a thing okay and

00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:22,449
one of the things I want I want you to

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,030
go to as many sessions as you think are

00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:27,400
going to be useful to you and if you're

00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:29,050
not sure maybe go listen to it but if it

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,539
doesn't work for you just stand up

00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:33,339
quietly and leave it's okay it's allowed

00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:35,050
an open source it's called voting with

00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:36,110
your feet go and find something that's

00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,020
more valuable to you

00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:41,480
but it's really important not to choose

00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:44,930
a session in every single slot of the

00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,880
day okay cuz that's what's gonna happen

00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:49,900
to you before you even get to the party

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,900
okay and it's really really really

00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,880
important to meet people so I don't know

00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,100
who was here for the pre note this

00:06:55,880 --> 00:07:00,650
morning that crazy hey Wow

00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,540
thank you for coming so that fun weird

00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:04,400
what does that have to do with Drupal

00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:07,580
thing that's really important to us

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,490
because so many drupal lists are

00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:12,560
musicians or scientists or you know

00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,060
they're qualified as kindergartners or

00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,390
like you'd never know who you're gonna

00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:18,440
meet and everyone here is an expert

00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:21,440
everyone here you can learn something

00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:24,470
from that man for example is an

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,170
exceptional executive coach and elite

00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,910
athlete athlete trainer right who would

00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:32,330
have known unless you know you walked up

00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:33,680
and talked with him so it's really

00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:34,970
important when you get in a big crowded

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:37,370
room and you're not just sitting with

00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,900
your friends introduce yourself to the

00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,250
person you're with go find a table at

00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,870
lunch where you're not sitting with

00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,630
people you know and introduce you to

00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:47,300
self to everyone find out what they do

00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:49,100
I've made years long friendships using

00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:51,200
that and and business partners and found

00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,820
gigs and deals and all sort of thing go

00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,280
meet the people we have this concept of

00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:56,810
the hallway track spend time in the

00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,270
coffee break just make sure that you

00:07:56,810 --> 00:08:00,710
meet new people and you take home new

00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,230
friendships after this week it's really

00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:04,960
really a really important part of of

00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:08,510
what we do

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:13,070

like to use in Drupal say you know when

00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:32,479

that we use composure that we use

00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:55,009
symfony components all of this we have

00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:57,800
massive extended communities so please

00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:59,509
don't make this your last open source

00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,490
then and go to other communities meet

00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:04,449
other communities as well and then do

00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:07,310
the same thing teach them the Drupal hug

00:09:04,449 --> 00:09:09,110
there's a photo from Drupal con Portland

00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:12,350
there were also an enormous number of

00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:13,790
people there so I said it was going to

00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:15,680
be quick and informal those are my

00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:18,500
slides I'm really really interested to

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,720
know who you are what you do and what

00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,430
you want to get out of the day here I

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,920
can go through a couple of tips and

00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:29,269
tricks about getting through the con and

00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,250
and and then are you ready to ask me

00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:35,660
some questions after that

00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:42,649
maybe maybe okay so let's have a look

00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:46,209
here let's go to my browser oh you can't

00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:46,209
see that haha sorry

00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:05,920
Wow very good so driving remote here we

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:07,060
are right so every day has a bunch of

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:11,860
sessions and a bunch of other things

00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:14,320
going on who does not know what a birds

00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,209
of a feather session is birds of a

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,529
feather sessions are really interesting

00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:19,870
and important so there's a saying in

00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:24,190
English birds of a feather flock

00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:26,500
together so maybe you really need to

00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,720
figure out new solutions to use you know

00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,370
technology and education or maybe you

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,019
want to know how to run a club website

00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:35,019
or maybe you're excited about that

00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:37,089
incredibly new JavaScript library that

00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:39,070
everyone you know is puzzling about and

00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:41,769
you want to talk with talk with other

00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:43,360
people about it you can go there's a

00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:45,730
birds of a feather page on the website

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,290
and you can look at the schedule there

00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:49,329
and if there are slots there you can put

00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,889
in your own discussion group and it's

00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:52,720
not for making presentations it's not

00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:53,860
for selling stuff but you can say we

00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,510
need to talk about the community in

00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,750
Bulgaria or we need whatever it is you

00:10:55,510 --> 00:11:00,399
want and birds of a feather people with

00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,839
common interests you can come and talk

00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,910
with your peers and talk about that and

00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,260
it's a great tool for planning local

00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,690
camps for meeting people from your

00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:09,040
region for discussing language issues in

00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:10,779
your translation whatever it is that you

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,390
need out of Drupal that's a great option

00:11:10,779 --> 00:11:16,980
birds of a feather they're really really

00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:19,930
interesting and important every evening

00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,760
there are also let's see if it's on here

00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,810
every evening there are social events

00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,720
and the social events are pretty

00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:27,130
important in Drupal as well any mirror

00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,120
of my screen so that I can see what

00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,120
you're seeing at the same time

00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:45,220
okay it's thinking about it

00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:57,360
alright okay awesome Wow it's incredibly

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:59,040
tiny I need my glasses now um so let's

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,949
see every evening

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,920
there are social events and just like

00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:06,899
you should introduce yourself to new

00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,380
people every day at lunch at the other

00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:13,470
sessions tonight there is the DrupalCon

00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:16,319
official community party put on by the

00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:17,699
Austrian Drupal Association and it's

00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:19,019
going to be a they're calling it a

00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:20,399
Viennese Ball but there's gonna be you

00:12:19,019 --> 00:12:22,259
know where what you want there's gonna

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,430
be snacks I believe there's going to be

00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:25,290
music it's gonna be a great place to

00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:28,620
just hang out and and meet people from

a great event and there's a bunch of

00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:36,240
other events I assume that most of us

00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,430
are probably not invited to the Drupal

00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,389
con CEO dinner but it's here on the it's

00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:43,620
here on the schedule and Thursday

00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:45,360
there's an interesting new event the

00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,160
Drupal marketing sprint I'm gonna be

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,610
checking that out for sure that's a new

00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:53,370
thing to Drupal and the single best and

00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:56,339
most important event of Drupal con is

00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:58,079
Thursday night trivia night this is

00:12:56,339 --> 00:13:01,110
where the community comes out for blood

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:03,149
and because it's your first drew poke on

00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:04,920
any team that you go on gets bonus

00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,720
points for you being on the team so

00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:09,089
you're a you have a valuable

00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,899
contribution to make it trivia night and

00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:16,829
there's always good drinks there so I

00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:22,230
find that's a real motivation yeah I

00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:24,769
know so lots of sessions to choose from

00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:27,839
lots of session tracks to choose from

00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:30,959
open source software comes from our

00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,149
contributions right obviously code also

00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,910
community organizing writing

00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:37,920
documentation and doing translations

00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,850
running great businesses right telling

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,180
your friends about it that's all

00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:45,540
contributions to to open source but we

00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:47,819
have these we have these sprints and a

00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:50,339
code sprint is where people come

00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:54,529
together to solve technical problems

00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:56,519
together and the community aspect of

00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:58,620
this is really important we're a

00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,920
community who works remotely with each

00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:04,460
other for for from you know

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:06,080
50 weeks of the year and as we know

00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,460
online there can be real problems with

00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:10,490
trolling real problems with people

00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:12,530
attacking each other and once you've met

00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:13,940
someone in person look them the I had a

00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:16,400
beer with them had a conversation with

00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:17,630
them worked on a patch together right

00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,010
you have an actual relationship with

00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:20,480
that person you remember you remember

00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:23,180
you remember what she looks like you

00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,920
remember how he talks and Contribution

00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:26,780
with someone you've met in person that

00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:30,440
there's an actual relationship there and

00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:31,970
it the remote work is is lubricated it

00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:34,610
it goes better you know you have an

00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:35,990
actual person in your mind and it really

00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,490
really helps to remember that when we're

00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:42,190
looking at the issue cues we're ruling

00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:44,270
on Twitter in this time of deep

00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,740
discontent in our community and an

00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:47,180
extreme politics around the world and so

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,010
on you really really have to remember

00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:52,120
that the people behind those words on

00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:54,260
the screen they're also people right and

00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,030
somebody just lost their job somebody

00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,440
just had a kid somebody's struggling to

00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,030
pay the bills somebody's learning

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,560
somebody knows more than you somebody

00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,390
knows less than you we have to keep in

00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,830
mind that we're human and working

00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:06,560
together in person is a great

00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:09,800
opportunity to really remember you know

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:14,960
get a taste of the human side of our

00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:17,150
project if you've never done a code

00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:20,840
sprint before and even if you only have

00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:25,520
limiting code limited coding abilities

00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:26,930
there are new new contributors sprints

00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,090
and they're mentored it there's a page

00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:30,350
on here to say what you need to do to

00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:34,280
prepare and get ready for that and as a

00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:36,530
whole a special room with special

00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,630
mentors on Friday set up for first-time

00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:40,040
contributors new contributors they will

00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:41,390
help you get your machine set up they

00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,890
will help you look for good issues they

00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,720
will tell you how the process works it's

00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:46,490
a fantastic tradition in the Drupal

00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,590
community the onboarding and mentoring

00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,810
that that that those people do is is

00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:53,450
fantastic and if you really really want

00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:55,820
to get excited about Drupal write a

00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,740
patch that gets accepted into Drupal

00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,990
like maybe you just fix a word

00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,420
describing how how one of the interfaces

00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:04,780
works like but you're a patch right your

00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:08,930
work once it's gone through the process

00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:11,950
that gets downloaded 300 400,000 times a

00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:14,350
month like the feeling of ownership

00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:16,029
once a piece of your code like you typed

00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:18,220
and that that's being used everywhere

00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:20,709
it's amazing right and then the project

00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:23,470
is a little bit yours and and and you're

00:16:20,709 --> 00:16:25,660
a little bit more you know sucked into

00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:28,240
the black beautiful black hole that is

00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,220
Drupal so I highly recommend checking

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,139
out this prints if you're inclined at

00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,660
all to write code there are plenty of

00:16:32,139 --> 00:16:36,760
other ways to contribute and a

00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:39,970
contribution is another of the things

00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:44,350
that I think about a lot in my in my

00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:46,690
work I wrote a blog post last spring

00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:48,699
about attending your first Drupal con

00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:53,620
and I'll just see about the highlights

00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:56,410
there what clever things I said I said

00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,130
come to the pre note mostly you got that

00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,779
thank you

00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,870
I said come to the Driss note I think

00:16:58,779 --> 00:17:03,310
probably most of you stayed for that to

00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:06,760
come to this session you're doing very

00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:11,169
well on that front remember to drink

00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:14,559
water right and if you go to an American

00:17:11,169 --> 00:17:16,059
Con and it's this summer and I'm just of

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,939
course this is completely irrelevant now

00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:21,100
but the way the Americans manage their

00:17:18,939 --> 00:17:22,600
buildings if it's the summer bring a

00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:24,610
sweater with you because it's gonna be

00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,880
freezing inside the building it's

00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:30,429
absolutely awful how they do that bring

00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,960
some business cards don't forget to

00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:36,040
introduce yourself to people and talk

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,750
with them if you haven't decided what

00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,429
you're going to go and see it would be

00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:41,020
really worth sitting down in the break

00:17:39,429 --> 00:17:42,429
and getting an idea of what you really

00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:44,650
want to see so that you're not sort of

00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:46,390
panicking it at the last minute and

00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,700
losing time trying to figure out what

00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:53,080
you should do next there's a DrupalCon

00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:55,600
app on the Play Store and the whatever

00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:57,840
the Apple one is that can be pretty

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,840
helpful

00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:06,669
let me see turn to them but um oh yeah

00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:09,100
Drupal loves social media so if you're

00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:12,929
on Twitter and you use at Drupal con EU

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:15,429
R for example or I am at horn cologne

00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:17,919
Drupal loves Twitter Drupal is pretty

00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:19,390
active on Facebook to get to you know

00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,090
join in on social media that's a really

00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:25,730
really good thing to do - told you about

00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:27,400
Sprint's already yeah and then

00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:30,080
after DrupalCon I hope that you'll feel

00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,670
more part of the community and more and

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,540
you know ready to spread the word and

00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:38,200
and participate even more the next time

00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:41,120
I would say that that is absolutely

00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:43,370
everything that I have to say of a

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,520
formal nature and I'd really it would be

00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:49,340
a privilege for me to get to know any of

00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:51,650
you who want to you know hear something

00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:54,980
now and and like I said I'd be really

00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:56,900
really curious to know why you came here

00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:59,390
what you want to get out of through

00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,580
pecan and then all the questions that

00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:04,640
you might have like what you feel might

00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,810
you know what information you need to to

00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:11,960
make those things happen

00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:14,470
who wants to start and it is why are you

00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,470
a true pecan

00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:01,970
thank you awesome

00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:03,500
do you want to come up here and put say

00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:07,930
it into here so that it's recorded and

00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:07,930
then we'll have a conversation fantastic

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,900
hey guys Ben I'm recently a developer

00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:22,760
after changing from project management

00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:25,100
and basically just interested in

00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,870
learning a lot more about Drupal I've

00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,650
been at a Drupal agency for about six

00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:32,720
months now but it's still fairly bare

00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:37,490
more thick to me at the moment so

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:39,700
adjectives basically just trying to get

00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:41,930
a greater understanding of of all

00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,970
sections of Drupal both front end and

00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:49,280
back end and even the business side of

00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:52,340
things yeah cool and so you're gonna do

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,960
technical sessions yeah I mean that was

00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:56,630
gonna be one of my questions really was

00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:58,640
like do you have any recommendations in

00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,320
terms of like balancing sessions either

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,390
towards like let's say your strengths

00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,010
cuz right now I'm far more front-end but

00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:06,770
equally like a lot of the backend stuff

00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:08,600
interests me a lot but I feel at the

00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:10,970
same time you know I see this sort of

00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,370
like difficulty ratings all over all the

00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:16,160
session recommendations but I'm not sure

00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:17,210
how intermediate intermediate is because

00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,590
some things I read which are

00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,360
intermediate might I know that and

00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:22,040
someone like that for me is you know

00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,920
next level advanced stuff yeah yeah

00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,750
that's a little tricky um it comes I

00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,790
think it comes down to how the

00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:31,340
description is written right and whether

00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:32,870
and also you know whether you just want

00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:37,250
like wanna go in there and give it a go

00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:40,160
for five minutes but I would say that if

00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:42,560
you if you are working mostly in the

00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,270
front end right then you have an

00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,890
opportunity to share what you know when

00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,780
you go to sessions like that

00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:50,030
but if you're really trying to move your

00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:52,160
career towards the back end right then

00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:53,390
maybe you should pick like three things

00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:55,760
that you think you really need to know

00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:57,080
about in the next six months and not

00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:58,160
only go to that session but then

00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,350
talk with the person who gave the

00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,300
session right because once you know them

00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,860
you can get on IRC or slack or wherever

00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,930
with them and and you know you might

00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:13,610
have a great resource to pull you along

00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:14,300
further anyone else you'll be cool if

00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,540
you could do it into the microphone

00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:19,010
because you know then we'd have have

00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:37,250
this recorded for posterity everybody's

00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:43,490
very very shy today all right I know you

00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:46,850
can hear so Matthias Matthias Nielsen

00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:48,980
where are you from I work at a small

00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,570
software company we've kind of it's only

00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:52,310
me and my boss out of seven employees we

00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,750
used rupal and that's kind of why

00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:55,550
they've invested in sending me here to

00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:57,500
learn more about it cool and what do you

00:22:55,550 --> 00:23:00,410
what do you need to bring back your boss

00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:02,330
to make this week a success pretty much

00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:04,370
like general overall knowledge because

00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:07,570
it's me who has to kind of take over

00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:09,860
most of the Drupal site stuff he's ready

00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:11,750
okay so that's simple you just have to

00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:19,100
learn about all of Drupal in the next

00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:20,980
three days yeah probably mostly back-end

00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:25,880
stuff because I need to do a lot of

00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:27,890
generally you from Copenhagen from a

00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:29,570
small island called falster but yeah I

00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:31,250
work in Copenhagen cuz there's a ton of

00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,870
great Drupal and Drupal this in

00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:36,020
Copenhagen are you do you go to the user

00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:38,240

00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:41,780

00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:46,730
really great community members up there

00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,340
there's a there's a ton of people that

00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:52,160
you could and should meet you should

00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:57,680
maybe especially look for a woman called

00:23:52,160 --> 00:24:00,530
Camilla Johnson I guess anyway her user

00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:03,590

know that they're here this time if you

00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:15,460
go introduce yourself to Camila that'd

00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:17,380
be a great resource to like to meet more

00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:21,940
people in Copenhagen and and have you

00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:22,390

all right Vikings rules good plan okay

00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:30,660
who's next

00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:38,080
you sat on the right side of the room so

00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,370
Giles where are you from Jaz I am yes

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,570
but I live in Berlin these days and I

00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,740
work there and I'm being terribly rude

00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:43,180
and sitting here and doing some work

00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,760
while you're talking I was listening the

00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:48,490
whole time but unfortunately needs must

00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,290
well no I mean that's multitasking is

00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,940
our reality rez I really don't like

00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:58,450
multitasking I'm a singletrack kind of a

00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:59,950
guy yeah I know it's Facebook trying to

00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:01,300
give away I don't want to be doing

00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,590
social media management anymore I want

00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,240
to concentrate on Drupal which is one of

00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:05,380
the reasons I'm here and one of the

00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,310
reasons I'm quite annoyed at being

00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:10,480
distracted fantastic so um what is it

00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:14,800
that you need to get out of this weekend

00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:19,900
how can we help you everything in every

00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:22,840
way so you're looking for more technical

00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:28,060
stuff or I'm more of a back-end person

00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:29,860
and so I'm more looking into Drupal 8

00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,860
which I haven't really started much

00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:35,080
developing yet so you know I've done

00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:36,790
some Drupal 7 development which is okay

00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,230
for my level of PHP but I now am one of

00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:41,740
those people who needs to learn how I be

00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:47,230
so object-oriented yeah yeah so there's

00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:50,830
a bunch of ID for me okay but let's talk

00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:54,280
about over P there is a there's that

00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:55,780
what you get with Drupal 8 once you get

00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:58,240
there you know there's a lot more files

00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:03,030
there's a lot more depth to the the tree

00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:03,030
right right right

00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:09,430
it's all gonna be fine and what's

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,620
awesome and I'll tell you I'll tell you

00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:13,090
one awesome thing with Drupal 7 like

00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,800
once you got really really fluent with

00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:16,780
Drupal 7 you spent a weekend to learn

00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,250
one internal system and a weekend to

00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:19,660
learn another internal system and

00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,850
another week to learn another and

00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:24,340
they're 21 22 of them and

00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:27,760
each have their own you know incredibly

00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:30,100
idiosyncratic ways of working right now

00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,870
in Drupal 8 thanks to Opie and like

00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,900
ripping and replacing so many things

00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:37,299
every internal system has unified the

00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:38,470
same crud operations and you only need

00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:39,970
to learn each of their specialties so

00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:42,580
you learn one system and you've learned

00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:44,260
like 80 percent of the whole thing right

00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,520
so once you're there like there's a

00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:49,059
steep little thing but then there's a

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,780
really really nice plateau awesome

00:26:49,059 --> 00:26:52,480
awesome

00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:53,530
Berlin cool town except we have to

00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,640
officially hate it because all our

00:26:53,530 --> 00:27:00,429
friends are moving there from cologne

00:26:54,640 --> 00:27:06,789
right now but if you come down to

00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:29,080
Cologne look me up okay all right so

00:27:06,789 --> 00:27:32,010
someone in the middle of the room I can

00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:36,210
tell by your incredible Norwegian accent

00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:36,210
so are you doing Drupal up in Norway

00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:47,110
there's a drupal drupal really dominates

00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:50,260
that landscape right so if i'm sorry if

00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:52,539
this is personal but is it has drupal

00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:54,429
knowing drupal has that helped you be

more mobile in your career like i know

00:27:54,429 --> 00:27:57,820
that the spanish economy hasn't you know

00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:04,659
being the greatest is that is that part

00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:09,419
of why you're in norway so what are you

00:28:04,659 --> 00:28:19,240
here for in in in vienna well my company

00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:20,590
is quite spread out so we so that whole

00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,780
remote story that i was saying that

00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,980

success it's my

00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:37,220
I've been developing drupal for one year

00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:40,570
and yeah I really want to learn more

00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:43,340
about the Drupal community especially I

00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:45,440
really really highly recommend checking

00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:47,990
out the Sprint's in your case because as

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,190
a coder and a relatively new one and

00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:50,780

00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:55,660
people to just keep this going in the

00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,660

we are maintaining several seven

00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:19,360
instances and we have the challenge to

00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:22,360
migrate hood coop at eight so that's we

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,340
want to learn about and also figuring

00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:28,510
out how to out of automate tests to

00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:32,800
improve security and also to automate

00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:34,150
the operating process yeah to little bit

00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:40,180
quicker cool

00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:41,200
so um I think on Thursday you have to

00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:43,960
look at the schedule um

00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,490
Sebastian Backman is going to be a

00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:49,030
trooper Khan and he's the maintainer of

00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:51,340
PHP unit and he's going to be talking

00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:53,140
about testing obviously and so that's a

00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,850
great great person to

00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,200
to hang out with and if he's got time to

00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:58,830
be at the sprint I know he wanted to

00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:02,080
spend time at the Sprint's talking about

00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:03,970
testing with people who needed help so

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,500
Sebastiaan Backman is gonna be here and

00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:07,710
that's a great place to start for that

00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:12,970
stuff if you want to look at migration

00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:14,380
stuff my officemate is really good at

00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:17,740
that but he's leaving

00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:19,720
he can't say at the con all week but

00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:22,270
he's in Cologne and if you get in touch

00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,040
I can introduce you um but there's like

00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:26,680
a fundamental question to you know

00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:29,650
Drupal 7 is still supported right it

00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:32,080
still gots like the security patches why

00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:35,050
is it that you need to upgrade to Drupal

00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,590
8 and what's the timeline I think it's

00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:43,330
related to the elections in Hesse so

00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:46,770
it's the elections are in 2018 so after

00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:49,450
that we will probably need new

00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:52,660
completely new sites because there will

00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:56,320
be a new government and they want ya to

00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:58,090
represent themselves so yeah that's the

00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,090
timeline but we want to learn about it

00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:04,150
and maybe try it out during the next

00:33:01,090 --> 00:33:05,860
year to gather some some experience and

00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:07,900
you know okay so that's actually a

00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:10,060
really great excuse just so like let's

00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:12,370
build a new site anyway so you're

00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:13,600
looking more at maybe data migration so

00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:15,270
you may be building a new application

00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:20,350
and then look moving the data into it

00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:23,880
because I think there's no of easy or a

00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:27,160
common way to migrate the content so

00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:31,600
probably we have to build some tool for

00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:34,090
ourself to migrate I think the good news

00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:36,940
is Therese was saying who was paying

00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:40,750
attention at three snowed today What did

00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:43,750
he say about the migration path 12

00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:46,150
critical bugs okay so that's something

00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:49,600
to contribute to this in the spring and

00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:52,270
this in the sprint this week but the the

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,890
concept with Drupal 8 was - you're never

00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:55,480
gonna do another upgrade right we're

00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:57,850
gonna build a new application and we're

00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,890
gonna migrate into it then the future

00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:00,500
thing with with the double API is down

00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:03,470
the road

00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:06,710
gonna make that but it's future music as

00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:09,200
we say in German but it sounds like if

00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,700
you look into the area of migration now

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,470
and look at the migration tools on look

00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,690
at migration path that would be a great

00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:16,220
place to learn and it would be great

00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:18,500
place to contribute because you're gonna

00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,929
be contributing straight into what you

00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:26,600
need to do at work with six months eight

00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:28,580
months from now right so you should find

00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,960
there are always Springs going on right

00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,790
and if you have time in between the

00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,899
sessions go find someone who's running

00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:34,820
the sprint room they'll have like a

00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:37,490
special t-shirt or something and start

00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:39,020
asking them who is working on the

00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:40,250
migration path and that you'd like to

00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,810
learn more and that you'd like to help

00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:43,490
and they will take you straight to the

00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:46,490
right people who are doing that and then

00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:51,620
you will help us and help yourself at

00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:53,990
work next year is it plan alright and if

00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:56,389
you come to Cologne come pick me we'll

00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:59,139
do a beer or more than one because

00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:59,139
they're small in Cologne

00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:06,860
hey okay so that feels like that feels

00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:09,620
like progress who else needs to need

00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,790
something do you need something do you

00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:15,980
mind coming across the room I'm sorry

00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:19,030
that they don't have credit cards or

00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:23,330
wireless mics in Austria hi I'm Jam

00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:24,290
magic from the Czech Republic are you

00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:28,640

00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:30,910
wait a minute girls wait wait okay

00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,910
where're you from

00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:37,190
you're from Poland we were just in

00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:38,960
Poland our friend Adam from the pre note

00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:41,120

it's fantastic I love Polish food sorry

00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:54,740
okay so it's getting a little late here

00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:57,310
so magic what do you do well I would

00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:00,950
like to be more engaging community

00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:06,900
because I'm developing

00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:11,040
lasts ten years maybe nine but my

00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:16,140
commitment in community was quite small

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:20,550
so now I think I should I want two more

00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:21,990
engage and see how I can do that

00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:25,110
fantastic so were you are you a

00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:27,150
developer yes I'm backing developer but

00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:30,480
also can do work on front end it's not a

00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:33,960
no problem but mainly I'm working in

00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,670
back end now for Flemish government we

00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,830
are providing some DuPont solutions so

00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:40,620
nice nice the Flemish government has a

00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:41,880
huge installation and it's been around

00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:51,860
for a long time so I imagine it needs

00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:51,860
some upgrades and stuff - so - Drupal 8

00:36:52,850 --> 00:36:57,060
and when you say you want to contribute

00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,800
more and be more part of the community

00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:02,250
what is it that you want to do more more

00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,830
code matches more yes also more code

00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:08,260
patches but also initiatives related to

00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:11,770

not silly silly is Hedgehog in Finnish

00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:00,710
yes there's a story which I what one get

00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:03,420
in do not right now

00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:04,860
sorry the details a bit hazy to me I

00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:07,590
should get better on the companies

00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:11,370
rather because it was vodka plus sauna

00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:13,320
equals company name not so much it's all

00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,830
about being actual and that kind of

00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:18,540
stuff sir

00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:22,890
yeah currently I work with maintenance

00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:25,560
of our Drupal sites mainly triple 7 for

00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:28,770
the moment and I'm looking forward to

00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:31,770
get into more dat and prepare myself and

00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:35,730
also get smarter with the support flow

00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:38,670
workflows yeah maybe

00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:42,140
and for a company more like how do we

00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:46,380
sell triple we're like 500 strong IT

00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:51,030
consultancy who hu police team is 8 9

00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:54,120
and and how do we sell triple internally

00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:55,680
or how do we promote it in Finland how

00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,870
do we get the head with that so that's

00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:01,700
maybe another angle that's really

00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:04,500
interesting so on the on the the

00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:06,870
workflow side I wonder if maybe project

00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,580
management sort of sessions would

00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:09,840
wouldn't be valuable I'm not sure I

00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,310
haven't looked at all the tracks but

00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:14,190
that might be a place to look in terms

00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:15,270
of of you know how we build to sometimes

00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:17,670
there have been in the past there been

00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:19,170
sessions for you know how to support 500

00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:20,880
customers on a shoestring budget or how

00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:21,960
do all that sort of things so project

00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,910
management might be really interesting

00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,780
and then there's um there's a business

00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:28,890
and and marketing track that has a few

00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:30,780
really really great sessions this time

00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:33,180
so in terms of of learning how to sell

00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:35,670
and learning how to talk about it apart

00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:37,800
from calling us up right and having a

00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:39,120
beer with with with precis and me here

00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:42,330
cuz like that's what we live and breathe

00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:43,590
I would check out the business track and

00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:48,540
then I would try and balance my time

00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:50,100
between the the internal advocacy

00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:52,230
problem is a really really interesting

00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:54,180
one so so we've been talking with some

00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:56,110
organizations very very large

00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:58,900
organizations who

00:40:56,110 --> 00:41:02,020
need to learn communications just to be

00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:03,730
able to sell to sell what they're doing

00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:05,050
internally and I'd really really love to

00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:06,730
talk with you more about like the

00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,990
challenges that you face like I don't

00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:10,240
know if you're competing with other

00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:12,760
technologies or you you have the PHP

00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,900
haters and you have the right I'd really

00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:16,570
really love to explore that more with

00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:21,010
you so but I think some of the business

00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:22,270
track would be interesting and maybe my

00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:25,330
session on the business value of

00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:32,080
contribution and then and then project

00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:32,920
management stuff okay if you want to do

00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,530
that site yes

00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:36,970
also look for sebastian Bergman and and

00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:41,500
the testing session awesome so nice to

00:41:36,970 --> 00:41:42,100
meet you and okay everyone any more

00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:46,180
questions

00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:53,290
yes can you come over here this just

00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:57,220
ended up being this way hi hi who are

00:41:53,290 --> 00:42:01,050
you I'm Celia I'm from Norway likewise I

00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:05,590
met before once you know slow at this

00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:08,200
camp and yeah I work in a small company

00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:13,900
called new media where I work as the

00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:16,000
only girl and the only designer so I'm

00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:18,760
here like looking for input

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,859
mostly and I was recommended by some of

00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:24,880
the other guys there to come here to

00:42:20,859 --> 00:42:28,330
meet people and some so yeah but I was a

00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,580
little bit unsure how to prioritize the

00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:32,500
sessions I already got some tips from

00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:37,140
you know like don't go to our session

00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:37,140
not every slots like a plan to like

00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:46,840
difficult for me to like decide what

00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:49,750
should prioritize so as a designer how

00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:51,940
technical do you consider yourself well

00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:57,010
I've only been working with Drupal for

00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:57,880
for a year and this is also my first so

00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:01,600
yeah

00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:03,680
beginner and we've been working in

00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:08,510
ripples 7 mostly and

00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:10,520
kind of try to learn tweak so it's

00:43:08,510 --> 00:43:11,900
mostly just designing and implementing

00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,790
themes okay

00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:16,670
so designing and implementing themes

00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:18,320
that's a really good opener definitely

00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:20,810
learn everything about tweak that you

00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,340
can and here's a really great tip for

00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:25,720
the world that we're living in in Drupal

00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:28,910
8 if you wrap your head around

00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:31,250
object-oriented PHP Giles if you wrap

00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:34,250
your head around twig if you know

00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:36,410
symphony right these are all completely

00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:39,800
transferrable technologies if you were a

00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:42,800
great Drupal 7 developer you were pretty

00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:44,990
much a great Drupal 7 developer and the

00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,700
internals of Drupal 7 are so bizarre

00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:49,520
that it was really hard to apply them

00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:51,440
anywhere else but Drupal 8 very much

00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:55,000
mainline PHP very much in line with how

00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:57,290
people are doing things now twig is the

00:43:55,000 --> 00:44:01,220
theming layer for more than a hundred

00:43:57,290 --> 00:44:04,160
other PHP projects so if you know how to

00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:07,580
make a thing look beautiful and usable

00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:11,360
with twig your employability your career

00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:18,320
path just opened up you know across I

00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:20,630
guess oral commerce PHP PHP B be easy

00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:22,130
published and and tons and tons and tons

00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:24,740
of others seem like and all sorts of

00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:26,360
e-commerce everything in between that's

00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:29,570
incredibly valuable for you and this

00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:32,900
connection between visually pleasing

00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:34,520
useable things and getting them

00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:36,470
implemented right is really really hard

00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:38,770
for a lot of us who come from the

00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:41,570
technical back-end so if you can apply

00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:44,540
that you can bring incredible value to

00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:47,120
all of our projects so definitely check

00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:50,000
out anything to do with twig probably

00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:52,700
the front end the javascript e stuff one

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,220
of you guys is a front ender know you

00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:59,420

Rene about about that part of of front

00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,100
of front-end technologies and then I

00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:09,890
think you'd be on your way to getting a

00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:12,680
lot out of the week yes and don't forget

00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:15,200
