Description: 
	Welcome to DrupalCon! Welcome to Drupal!

It is important to all of us that you hit the ground running in our community. We’re scattered around the globe most of the year. Meeting and building relationships in person at events like DrupalCon is the glue that helps us be a welcoming, inclusive, productive (and mostly remote) community.

Especially if it’s your first DrupalCon, come along to make sure you know what our community is all about, hear some community tips and tricks, and find out about a few hidden gems that’ll take your DrupalCon to the next level.

Take-aways:

Learn about what goes on at DrupalCon--BoFs, Trivia Night, Code Sprints, Sessions, the Hallway Track, and so much more--and how to get the most out of it.
Drupal is inclusive. Yes, we have a Code of Conduct!
The more you put into Drupal, the more you get out of it.
Coding, contributing, and all that technical stuff happens, too ...
