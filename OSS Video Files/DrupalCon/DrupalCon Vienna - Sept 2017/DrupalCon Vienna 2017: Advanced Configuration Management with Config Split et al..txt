	Configuration Management was one of the most anticipated features of Drupal 8.
We will see the use case Drupal core covers perfectly and we will see its limitations when building a real life Drupal site with more complex requirements.
This session will present you the module eco system around Config Split and Config Filter as well as best practices around configuration management that alleviate all the sorrows you might encounter while building Drupal 8 sites in a team and/or in different environments:

Environment specific configuration or modules
Environment specific permissions
Configuration changes on production
Installing a new instance from existing configuration
Configuration management for multisite.
This is an advanced session, attendees should be familiar with the basic site building process and concepts of a site being in different environments. Attendees will walk away with concrete examples on how to solve more complex site building problems and workflows easily adapted to their own projects.
