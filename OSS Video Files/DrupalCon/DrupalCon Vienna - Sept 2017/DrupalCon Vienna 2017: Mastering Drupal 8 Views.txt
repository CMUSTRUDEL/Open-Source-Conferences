Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Mastering Drupal 8 Views
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	Views was used on more than 80% of all Drupal 7 sites; now it is part of the Drupal 8 core.

Join in a father/daughter discussion about Views.

Learn how to take full advantage of Views' power to create many amazing pages and blocks.
Use filters to display only a relevant subset of your data.
Instead of building 10 different view displays with different filters, learn how a contextual filter would require only a single display.
Use relationships to combine data from several entities.
Using contributed modules, Views can turn your data into maps, carousels, and other unique displays.
In this session, we'll start by clarifying termininology

.



Then we'll modify a view built into core that everyone uses, the content page to create a custom content editor dashboard.
From there, we'll build our own simple what's new content list.
Next we'll expand and extend that list to create more complex displays, including maps and carousels.
Finally we'll look at ways to make Views display exactly what you want in the format you want it..
Create displays of content that are automatically updated when you add new content
Show maps and rotating image carousels on your site
Use fields from more than one content type to create powerful views of multi-table data
Modify the field data being displayed, combining it in different ways or changing the HTML that might be normally generated
Add headers and footers above and below a views display
Make the output of your view look exactly like the designer specifies
Change the order in which a list of content is displayed, limit the content shown to only certain content types or values
Filter content using values passed to the view in the URL, making a single view work different ways

welcome we'd like to thank you for

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:11,880
attending this session mastering Drupal

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:15,179
8 views my name is greg marshall i'm a

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,190
digital technology developer manager or

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:19,410
in more simple words I'm a Drupal

00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:22,230
architect for Accenture Digital which is

00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,869
part of Accenture and technically inside

00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:28,410
that Accenture interactive I've been on

00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:30,779
drupal.org since 2006 so roughly ten

00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:33,630
eleven years I went to my very first

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:35,430
Drupal con in 2010 in San Francisco

00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,280
that's when I decided to switch from

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:43,050
being a user of Drupal to a developer in

00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:44,579
Drupal I happen to be a aqua Grandmaster

00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:51,980
in both Drupal seven and Drupal eight

00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:51,980
and I wrote a book hey my name is Amanda

00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:06,270
sustainability and when those really

00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:08,810
help me get a job I ended up going to

00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:13,830
Drupal easy Academy my dad suggestion

00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:20,780
I've been a drupal.org either since 2008

00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:25,100
because I had previously tried my hand

00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,100
but then I decided to focus on school

00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:32,640
so I initially got into Drupal in 2008

00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:33,900
but I decided to focus on school because

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,270
I thought it would be better for it

00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,170
to help me get a job and then ended up

00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,100
coming back to it later

00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:44,009
my first Drupal con was Baltimore I'm an

00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:47,280
aqueous certified site builder I entered

00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:49,829
on a UN humanitarian response Drupal

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,220
site I'm working right now as a Drupal

00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,329
developer at Brad Jones LSD but I'm

00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,810
looking for something a little more for

00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:59,820
time so you know if anything let me know

00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:04,049
and this is Jackson he's one of the

00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,820
characters in my dad's book ok because I

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,160
work for a large company we have the

00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:11,370
standard legal disclaimer basically what

00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,980
this says is I am not here on behalf of

00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,200
Accenture I am here as an individual

00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:21,660
and they take no responsibility for

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:23,520
anything I might say so to put this talk

00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,760
into place and sort of set the stage for

00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,130
it as a family we get together whenever

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,810
the kids are in town and will tend to go

00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:34,620
out to a restaurant and have breakfast

00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:36,450
and normally at those breakfasts if it

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,090
were before last fall when Amanda

00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:43,040
started Drupal easy Academy we would

00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:47,340
talk about sewing or crafts or travel or

00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:50,130
cooking or things like that this

00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:52,950
particular breakfast was in November

00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:55,370
last year and my oldest son and his new

00:02:52,950 --> 00:03:00,300
wife were down visiting from Wisconsin

00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:01,920
and we're at this this restaurant and

00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,200
Amanda and I are sitting at one end of

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,430
the table debugging a problem she's

00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:12,080
having with a git repository and at that

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:14,580
point at this breakfast it dawned on me

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,150
family meals will never be the same

00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:19,709
again because all of a sudden we have

00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,680
something to talk about so what we

00:03:19,709 --> 00:03:24,900
decided to do just for fun is take that

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,540
conversation and sort of adapt it to

00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:30,450
views and talk about views like we were

00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:32,880
having breakfast at Sam's number three

00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:35,670
so Amanda how's that project with you

00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:38,910
and going it's going great we're getting

00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:41,010
deeper into Drupal theming I've been

00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,660
able to build a few views I thought I

00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:44,730
was really understanding views from my

00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,400
class but I'm still struggling with the

00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,890
terminology terminology is always a

00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,950
problem with Drupal Drupal tends to

00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:54,959
overload most terms so we have the same

00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:57,299
word will have different meanings

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,010
depending on what context it's in so

00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:02,010
let's let's set the stage with some

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:05,640
basic words views is the views module

00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:07,260
which in Drupal 8 is part of core but

00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,200
before Drupal 8 was actually its own

00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,510
separated separate project and the way

00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,940
to think about views is a module is it

00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:17,729
creates dynamic lists so it's a list

00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,010
builder for Drupal those of you that

00:04:17,729 --> 00:04:22,950
have been in computing long enough can

00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:25,200
think of it as the Crystal Reports for

00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:27,450
Drupal so Crystal Reports was a report

00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,610
writer back in the days of debase and

00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:32,310
and other databases and then when you

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,170
talk about view in the singular you

00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:37,350
typically are talking about a single one

00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:39,180
of these lists as an example of

00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,860
something you would do with views think

00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,100
about the the case where you want to

00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:48,570
display the five most recent blog posts

00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:50,400
as a block on your website so if you did

00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,550
it manually what you would have to do is

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,500
you would have to add the blog post

00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:58,440
publish the blog post then go back to

00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,900
the block edit the block add the title

00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:04,080
and link deleting the title and link of

00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,730
the laughs of the oldest blog post and

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,920
that would give you the five most recent

00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:10,530
and you would have to do those two steps

00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:14,060
every time you did something with views

00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:16,470
what you can do is add the blog post and

00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,540
automatically the block will update

00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:20,880
itself with the five most recent blog

00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,670
posts so you get this kind of dynamic

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:29,940
list building that becomes so so

00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:33,180
important to to Drupal views was the

00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:35,220
number one contributed module for Drupal

00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:38,430
7 so if you looked at the list of

00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:41,160
modules the module that was most used in

00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:44,400
every almost every website about 80% of

00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,900
the web sites was was views so it's when

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,250
it came in to core that was a very

00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:49,710
natural thing I think it would have

00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,660
probably gone in Drupal 7 except it's so

00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:54,300
big that it was hard to get it

00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:57,480
integrated in time but now with it being

00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,910
part of core the front page and many of

00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:02,370
the administration pages are now views

00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:05,850
so if you look at it the front page

00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:09,120
itself is just a simply a view the

00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:11,010
content list editing page is a view the

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,600
content list maintenance page the files

00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:19,500
view is a view who's online is actually

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,200
a view the people list so the user

00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:24,510
maintenance screen that's part of Drupal

00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:27,090
is now a view and what that means to us

00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:29,640
as developers and site builders is that

00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:32,550
literally any one of those can be

00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:36,000
modified and adapted to be specifically

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,650
what you want once you get down to the a

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,350
single view then you have to think about

00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:42,060
the parts so there's some component

00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:44,760
of you that sort of worked from the top

00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,950
down or from the biggest part the baser

00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:49,440
view type is a view what you're building

00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,750
a view of then you have a display within

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,960
that base or view type within that

00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:57,240
display you can pick a format and then

00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,160
you have another do you have a display

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,620
and then you have a display type within

00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,870
that and then you have filters and sorts

00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:06,990
which then let you give get make your

00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:09,360
view more things so if you look the view

00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:12,270
edit screen is very complex and it's

00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,060
complex because it does so much so if we

00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:18,390
look at it in three sections basically

00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:20,400
the first part is the the fields we're

00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:22,560
going to display the filters and the

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,420
sort criteria and how we're gonna

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,120
display or whether it's whether it's got

00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:29,400
a title that the very top it says it's a

00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,590
block so that's the display itself and

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,770
then the fact that it's an unformatted

00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:37,080
list is the display type in the middle

00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,600
you have block settings or page settings

00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,880
if it's a page something general to that

00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,800
part of it then almost every view has a

00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,140
header a footer and a no results option

00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:50,040
and these are areas where you can figure

00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:51,750
what happens either above below or if

00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,520
nothing come is going to come out of the

00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,190
query that you've built that goes with

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,350
that view and finally views comes with

00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:00,300
built in paging so if you have a lot of

00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:03,240
data and you don't want to display it

00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:05,820
all in one page 10,000 records you can

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:07,890
display them by default 10 at a time and

00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,780
they just you know let you go forward

00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:12,360
backwards the first the last depending

00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,040
on which pager you use and then finally

00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:16,320
on the right you've got the Advanced

00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:20,340
section which in a normal views

00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:21,900
installation is by default closed one of

00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,880
the recommendations I make is that you

00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,790
change the settings your view settings

00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:29,850
off the views listing page to always

00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:31,530
display the Advanced section because

00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:34,410
there are two parts of it that really

00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:36,660
you want to use one is contextual

00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:38,640
filters and the others relationships and

00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:41,219
we'll come back to that the rest of the

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,500
advanced truly is advanced and very

00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:45,480
frequently you'll find you won't use but

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:50,240
but those two contextual filters and

00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:53,060
relationships you do use so Amanda

00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,730
does that help yes it does thank you

00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:57,770
okay so let's you're still doing a side

00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:00,950
project for a real estate company hurt

00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:02,990
you yes okay so tell you what let's show

00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:05,350
everyone how you can adapt a view let's

00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:08,690
take the existing content list view and

00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:12,529
we want to adapt it to be a view that's

00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:15,589
displayed when a real estate agent logs

00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:18,230
into that website and is given only

00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:20,300
their properties that they are allowed

00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,649
to maintain and we're only gonna let

00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,570
them edit we're not gonna let them

00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:26,860
delete or do a lot of the other things

00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:26,860
that we'd do so

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:35,310
oh this is what I wanted to look like

00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,770
when you're done so I would just be

00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:40,640
address the status the updated and none

00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,640
of that extra clutter

00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:50,510
so my first step is to duplicate the

00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:52,040
content maintenance view I don't want

00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:57,560
one little mistake to screw up my whole

00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:59,240
project then under the then I changed

00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,380
the title to property maintenance by

00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:04,250
clicking on the word content under title

00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,140
under the fields section

00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:07,580
I removed the bulk operation for him by

00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,529
clicking on the field name clicking on

00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,060
the remove link at the bottom I also

00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:13,640
removed the content type and the author

00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:16,300
user fields since this view will only

00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,620
display the current users properties I

00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:20,560
also removed the translation language

00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:23,240
filter since that site only has English

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,089
finally I changed the content type

00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,100
filter from being exposed and being

00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:30,290
fixed and selecting the property content

00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:36,080
type it's important to save your changes

00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:38,600
so that they're permanent this shows the

00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:40,580
before and after the edits that was

00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,170
relatively easy but a fresh copy of

00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,240
Drupal only has two content types

00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,010
basic page and article and they don't

00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,690
have very many fields why is views

00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,520
around is it only for administration

00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:52,490
screens

00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:55,370
good question uses around because of

00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:58,730
structured content so in Drupal 7 we

00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:01,220
added fields module before that it was

00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:03,380
called CCK but it gave you the ability

00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,720
to structure your content they have lots

00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:07,370
of different fields something else

00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,650
that's unique in Drupal 8 is that

00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:11,230
relationships are built in so in Drupal

00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:14,420
7 you had to add the entity relationship

00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:16,339
model or entity reference module or the

00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,680
node reference module in order to have

00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:21,170
one content type referred to a different

00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,360
content type when Drupal 8 that's just

00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:24,830
built in as part of it and so you have

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,839
different kinds of fields you can have

00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:30,170
text fields you can have number fields

00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:32,800
boolean fields file fields image fields

00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:35,930
or reference fields to other other nodes

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,490
and then through contributed modules you

00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:39,470
can add different kinds of field types

00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:41,330
so one of the ones that I see frequently

00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:44,120
and that I know you're using on your

00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:46,430
real estate site is a geo location field

00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,250
which allows us to put longitude and

00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:51,740
latitude on that website in order to do

00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:54,740
that so if you look at the data

00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:56,780
structure for the real estate website

00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:59,000
you're working on it's very complex

00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:00,740
and to the audience I know you can't

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,930
read that it isn't intended to be read

00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:06,640
but basically what it says is there are

00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,640
a lot of fields there of different types

00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:11,540
property type there's an owner or a

00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:14,300
realtor they're similar but different

00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:16,400
and there's an open house type and if I

00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,090
actually drew a map of how these all go

00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,800
together

00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:21,770
you've got the property type in the

00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,660
middle it's being referred to by an open

00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:25,940
house and the direction of these arrows

00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:28,610
will become important later

00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:30,320
it uses Realtors it also has property

00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,930
owners and it can have more than one of

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,700
each so ten people can own a property

00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:36,650
together or you can have two realtor's

00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,510
help sell it and then there are two

00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:40,700
kinds of entities that most people don't

00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:43,040
think of as being separate like nodes

00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:45,260
but their taxonomy terms so we have a

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,060
county taxonomy and a neighbourhood

00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:51,230
taxonomy that we've defined for this

00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:53,800
particular site so why don't you walk us

00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:56,360
through building a new view for this

00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:58,460
it's pretty easy to get going

00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,110
you just starts with a simple form and

00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:03,800
as the boxes are checked it becomes more

00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:05,839
complex the new view wizard only does

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,660
the most common use cases page and block

00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:11,420
other displays like attachment have to

00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:13,190
be manually created on the edit page so

00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:15,530
if we look at the starting widget wizard

00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:17,210
page the questions are pretty easy you

00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:18,710
have to give your view a name which will

00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:22,400
automatically create the internal name

00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:24,320
that Troup will use this then you then

00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,730
you tell view the views type or what

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,250
kind of entity you want to base the view

00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:30,380
on content is the most common so it's

00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:31,640
also the default then assuming you pick

00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,100
content you can select a specific

00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,890
content type like property and the

00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:39,110
initial sort order finally you can check

00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:43,420
boxes create a page display or a block

00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,420
display or even a rest endpoint of

00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:48,650
course in Drupal nothing is as simple as

00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:50,390
the starting witch wizard would lead you

00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:51,770
to believe when I click the create a

00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,930
page a whole bunch of additional

00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:55,990
settings magically appear let's zoom in

00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:58,760
on just the page settings you'll see I

00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,470
can set the page title in the path I can

00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,120
select what kind of display I want on

00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:03,950
that page in my property maintenance

00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,620
view it was a table so I'm going to try

00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,940
that now I can also set up a pager for

00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:09,560
when there are too many results to

00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,230
display on a single page

00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,180
and I can add an RSS feed fortunately

00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:16,129
except for the base view type I can

00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,740
change anything I set up here later on

00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:21,889
the view edit screen so dad what are the

00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:23,389
various parts of a view okay well we

00:14:21,889 --> 00:14:25,339
went through it very briefly but let's

00:14:23,389 --> 00:14:27,350
talk about the various kind in more

00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:29,180
detail so you've got the base or view

00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,860
type this is the kind of view that you

00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,589
first set this is the one thing that

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:36,769
once you said it you can't change and so

00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:38,300
the most common use is content the other

00:14:36,769 --> 00:14:41,300
thing you can do is you can actually do

00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:42,800
a view of content revisions which the

00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:46,100
first time I looked at this I wondered

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,870
why and then I was was chatting with

00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,939
some people in Minnesota that worked for

00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:53,509
a state agency and they by law are

00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:55,040
required to publish the the edit log for

00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:57,379
every page that they have on this

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,569
particular web site so the the ability

00:14:57,379 --> 00:15:02,329
to do that automatically and just attach

00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:05,360
it as part of the page is a really

00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:07,730
convenient for them because comments are

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,850
now entities and not a unique thing you

00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:13,790
can do views of content of comments you

00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:16,250
can do views of log entries so if you've

00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:18,220
got the DB log turn on now the challenge

00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:20,509
with this is it's a very interesting

00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:22,220
capability but of course one of the

00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:25,279
recommended best practices is that you

00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:26,959
turn off the DB log in production which

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,199
means your view goes away with it

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:33,290
because you have nothing to reference

00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:36,110
you can do views of the filesystem you

00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:38,120
can do views of taxonomy terms and you

00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:40,490
can do views of users so you have lots

00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,339
of different base or view types that you

00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:45,439
can work from once you've picked a view

00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:47,990
type then what you do is you pick a

00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:50,990
display type and the displays can be

00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:53,660
page which is the most common or blocked

00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:56,540
which is almost as common there's a

00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:58,639
unique display that's part of every view

00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,980
that you probably never noticed is there

00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:04,519
and that's called the master or default

00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:06,499
display it's there in every view it

00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:09,589
disappears as soon as you create any

00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:11,480
other display so there is a settings on

00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:14,029
your settings page that you can go to to

00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,740
always display the master but it's very

00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:19,879
handy if you're building theme and

00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:21,860
variation displays to edit the common

00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:23,209
part in the master display and let it

00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,309
ripple through

00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:29,209
then just do the unique parts the

00:16:25,309 --> 00:16:31,579
overrides in the individual displays you

00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:35,420
can have a display called an attachment

00:16:31,579 --> 00:16:37,220
and that's a view or a kind of display

00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:39,309
for a particular view that is attached

00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:41,689
to the same view so if you have a page

00:16:39,309 --> 00:16:43,910
you can create an attachment that

00:16:41,689 --> 00:16:46,459
creates is basically a second view as

00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:49,429
part of that view and they can either

00:16:46,459 --> 00:16:51,980
share the same parameters or they can

00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:54,679
also be have different fields completely

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:56,660
you have an embed which interestingly

00:16:54,679 --> 00:16:58,339
enough really doesn't do anything in

00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,920
early versions of Drupal 8 I haven't

00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:02,869
checked it recently but it was pretty

00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:06,020
clear that the intent was at some point

00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:10,610
to limit your ability to embed a view in

00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:13,370
code only to the embed view type so that

00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:15,589
it would become a little cleaner at the

00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:17,779
very minimum it's a recommendation I

00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:19,939
would make to use it if you're going to

00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:21,919
embed that view in code because that's a

00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:24,409
signal to a site builder that this

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:27,079
particular view is being used in code to

00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:29,059
being create displays you might not want

00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:31,370
to edit it without understanding what

00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:33,590
the implications of that are you also

00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,779
have an entity reference view which is a

00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:40,820
very interesting one so when you create

00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:45,350
an entity reference field in a content

00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:49,669
type you right now the default behavior

00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:51,590
is an autocomplete so as you start to

00:17:49,669 --> 00:17:53,750
type the title of the entity that you

00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:56,870
want to be referencing from the other

00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,520
content type that's what shows up what

00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:01,730
you can do with this view is you can

00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:03,950
click the widget change it to the entity

00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:06,020
reference select a view and now you'll

00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:09,440
have all of the selection and sorting

00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:12,770
capabilities that views provide you in a

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,440
pulldown list that you can use with with

00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:17,390
entities so instead of autocomplete you

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,080
can give people just what they need to

00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:23,029
know though the next and last one is an

00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:25,399
RSS feed that's been around in views

00:18:23,029 --> 00:18:27,470
since the beginning and it allows you to

00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:30,559
create RSS feeds that are used by other

00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:32,029
websites for aggregation and then the

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:35,239
more general as of drue

00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:37,159
eight rest export so now what you can do

00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:39,859
is if the rest module is enabled the

00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:42,739
rest export becomes available you have

00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:45,499
the ability to use views with contextual

00:18:42,739 --> 00:18:47,450
filters to actually structure what kind

00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:51,190
of data and how that data is going to

00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:53,149
come back out through the rest export

00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,190
once you've done that then you have

00:18:53,149 --> 00:18:57,769
format options for whatever you're

00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:00,769
looking at so you'll have a grid which

00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:03,440
in Drupal 8 is actually a grid and not

00:19:00,769 --> 00:19:06,469
an HTML table like it is in Drupal 7 and

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,639
Drupal 6 you have the HTML list you have

00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:12,499
an unformatted list you have tables and

00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:15,049
you have anything that can be added by

00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:16,759
contributed modules so views accordion

00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:18,440
is one that i've seen used on a lot of

00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:21,409
sites it gives the ability to create

00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:23,330
accordions very easily you have a slot

00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:25,190
view slideshow which creates those

00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:26,599
carousels that every designer tells you

00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:29,599
you should never have and every website

00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:33,559
has and then you can actually create

00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:35,419
Maps so you actually have modules and

00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:39,080
parts of modules like the geolocation

00:19:35,419 --> 00:19:41,599
module provides a view Zinta Gration and

00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:44,570
so i can create a view as long as i've

00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,700
put the location geolocation data in as

00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:52,460
the output I can go ahead and feed that

00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:54,139
directly into a Google map so what's

00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,059
interesting is of course every format

00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:58,279
has options the table being the most

00:19:56,059 --> 00:20:00,559
interesting of them it has options upon

00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:02,359
options so you can actually make once

00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,460
you've created a table with a view you

00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:06,529
can have it be click sortable so the

00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,719
sort you define isn't necessarily the

00:20:06,529 --> 00:20:10,999
sort that the user has to see you can

00:20:08,719 --> 00:20:13,639
take to feel or to fields and combine

00:20:10,999 --> 00:20:16,729
them together in a single column so in

00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:19,159
one of the examples I did you you have

00:20:16,729 --> 00:20:21,019
the the realtor's name and his phone

00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:23,649
numbers separated by a comma that's

00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:26,659
something very easily to do within that

00:20:23,649 --> 00:20:28,309
once you've defined the format then what

00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:31,039
you do is you define typically the

00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:33,799
fields the alternative is you can do use

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,869
display modes and so I can say I want

00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:37,729
content with it with either the full

00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:40,299
display mode or the default display mode

00:20:37,729 --> 00:20:42,409
or a user curve data display mode I

00:20:40,299 --> 00:20:43,880
personally believe that it's better to

00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:46,100
use fields in this case

00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,840
because what it does is it puts the

00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:50,150
ordering of the fields and how they're

00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:52,130
formatted along with the view whereas if

00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:54,169
you use a display mode it's somewhere

00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:55,940
else in Drupal and you have to remember

00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,710
that you're using that display mode to

00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:02,570
control how this particular views being

00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:05,210
put out and so each field of course has

00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:06,890
lots of settings in the case of D you

00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:11,120
can pick the date format that you're

00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:12,679
going to use you can go with you can

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,780
decide whether or not to have a label

00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:16,730
attached with this particular field or

00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,980
not if so what the text should be

00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:20,270
whether it's the field label or whether

00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:23,030
you want to override that and put your

00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:25,429
own on you can do style settings and

00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:27,200
rewrites and things like that and one of

00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:30,380
the things that I found very powerful

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:33,470
ever since views added it in Drupal 6 I

00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:35,330
think is the field rewrite and so you

00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,669
check the box that says override the

00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:39,500
output of this field and all of a sudden

00:21:37,669 --> 00:21:42,460
you have the ability to rewrite this

00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:44,990
field as everything that's above it or

00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:46,789
using all the values that's above it so

00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:48,799
one of the common mistakes that gets

00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:50,419
made is well I've got it it's in my

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,340
field list but I can't see it in this

00:21:50,419 --> 00:21:54,350
list it has to be above it in the list

00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:56,539
but one of the options you had on the

00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:58,309
field is exclude from display and you'd

00:21:56,539 --> 00:21:59,960
wonder why would you put something in a

00:21:58,309 --> 00:22:01,190
view if you're gonna exclude it from the

00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,770
display why bother

00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:06,320
well the field rewrites is actually

00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:08,690
where where you use that and so it's

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,270
very easy to take two relatively

00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:14,299
disjointed fields and reassemble them

00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:17,240
let's say as a link with very custom URL

00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:21,110
being built as part of it or you can you

00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:22,220
can do more complex kinds of things the

00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:26,059
other thing that I found really

00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:28,039
interesting is in Drupal 7 the field

00:22:26,059 --> 00:22:31,159
replacement patterns are square brackets

00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:34,280
the token module and if you notice these

00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:37,070
are the double curly brackets which it

00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,900
was very very late in doing this that I

00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:43,130
realized that looks a whole lot like

00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:46,429
twig and sure enough that field is

00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:49,970
actually a twig template inside your

00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:52,190
view so anything you can do in twig you

00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:56,150
can do for a field rewrite inside views

00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:58,070
so just as an example I put a for loop

00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:01,340
and I had it this play characters

00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:04,490
separated by Asterix simply by rewriting

00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:09,309
a field with the twig capability so it's

00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:11,929
a very very powerful capability um so

00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:14,230
let's talk about filters why don't you

00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:16,610
tell us how they work

00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:18,320
filters let you select just the part of

00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:20,090
the data that a view might return for

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:22,250
example one of our favorite shows is

00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:24,559
tiny house nation which is a show about

00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:26,270
house is smaller than 500 square feet I

00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,919
thought it would be fun to have a page

00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:30,350
of tiny houses on the real estate site

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,330
to do that I set a filter to limit the

00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:34,549
results to listings where the property

00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:38,539
square footage is less than 500 square

00:23:34,549 --> 00:23:41,899
feet I could do that on an extra display

00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:44,600
of the main property view so it was

00:23:41,899 --> 00:23:46,520
really pretty easy expose filters let

00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,620
site visitors choose what values to see

00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,840
like in my real estate site this lets

00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:52,610
visitors select ranges for square

00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,740
footage asking price and number of

00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:57,710
bedrooms just like just the right house

00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:59,240
at the right price for them so Dad I see

00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:01,159
that for a neighborhood I can filter by

00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,570
the neighborhood taxonomy but do I have

00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:04,669
to create a different display for each

00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,640
neighborhood each with the filter set

00:24:04,669 --> 00:24:09,620
the way I want or is there a better way

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,630
I've seen a lot of views built with 10

00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:13,460
different displays one for each taxonomy

00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:15,919
term there is a different way and that

00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:18,080
way is called a contextual filter and

00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,730
it's one of the cases where views is

00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,770
sort of confusing because you have the

00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:23,840
filters on the left hand first column

00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:25,640
and the contextual filters are sitting

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,070
over in the right-hand advanced column

00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,590
and there's really nothing more advanced

00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:32,330
about a contextual filter than it gets

00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:36,289
the value you're looking forward to

00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:38,450
filter from the URL and so if you'll

00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:40,700
notice we have available property

00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:43,789
listing by neighborhood and it says city

00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:47,690
center with a percent twenty when I

00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:50,649
developed the taxonomy for the property

00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:53,659
I didn't think about using it as a

00:24:50,649 --> 00:24:56,330
contextual filter and I put spaces in my

00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:58,399
taxonomy terms and when you have a space

00:24:56,330 --> 00:25:00,320
in taxonomy term when it's put into the

00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:02,450
URL it has to have the percent twenty

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,400
it's translated into what you are all

00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:08,340
friendly but what it lets me do is

00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:10,230
by saying city center I can now give an

00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:13,020
available property listings just for

00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:16,620
city center and that's that's the part

00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:19,530
of it the way I did that was I filters

00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:24,960
I collect add I add the taxonomy term

00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:27,540
and I configure it with particular

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,520
taxonomy I want display only the things

00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:31,470
I want it also has a very powerful

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,500
feature which is something I use a lot

00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:36,600
where if you don't have a value in the

00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:38,370
URL what do you want the default to be

00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:40,890
and you could set that to a fixed value

00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:43,140
you can actually have it read some of

00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:46,230
the context like what user is logged in

00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:48,059
or what page your node you're on so

00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:49,980
there's all this extra information so

00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:53,220
you'll find a lot of times you're using

00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:55,080
contextual filters not using the URL but

00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:58,530
using the ability to pick up default

00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:59,760
values out of other things so Amanda

00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:03,480
walk me through how you change that

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,429
order views wouldn't be too useful if

00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,500
everyone display results by date the

00:26:05,429 --> 00:26:09,240
entity was created but as you said this

00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,740
is Drupal so anything is possible in

00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,870
views that can change the ordering or

00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,450
sort criteria to be any field and either

00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:17,429
ascending or descending I can also have

00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:20,040
multiple levels of sort so if the first

00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:24,750
sort criteria neighborhoods returned

00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:29,490
several results I can sort it by another

00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:34,410
level like title and you can sort within

00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:36,059
that group looking at the settings for

00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:39,420
the sort criteria field I can see you

00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:40,800
can expose the sort to let visitors

00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:43,200
change if they want a ascending or

00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,110
descending in this example I'm sorting a

00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,790
date field which adds a granularity

00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:51,210
option so I can sort down to the second

00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:53,280
or maybe just the day and then use the

00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,980
second level sort to sort by another

00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:57,660
field like alphabetically by title

00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:59,550
sorting is pretty easy but using the

00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:01,950
structured content like you described I

00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:03,720
wanted to have a view that shows fields

00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,580
from the realtor in my property listing

00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,290
but when I try to add the field it

00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:11,010
doesn't show up is there a way to do

00:27:07,290 --> 00:27:13,400
that of course this is Drupal that's

00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:16,679
where relationships come in so the other

00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:20,130
advanced option that you'll use a lot is

00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:22,679
called relationships when you add a

00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:25,890
you're basically associating one

00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:28,740
content-type through an entity reference

00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:31,919
to another content type and when you do

00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:33,470
that you actually acquire the fields

00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,270
from both content types

00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:39,419
now you remember when I put up the

00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:41,190
picture that showed the property with

00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:43,380
all of the other content types that

00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:46,020
could be related to it and I had arrows

00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:49,470
drawn so it went from property to

00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:51,840
realtor from property to owner from

00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:53,970
property to taxonomy terms but it

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,150
happened to go from open house to

00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:59,370
property that those arrows are important

00:27:57,150 --> 00:28:02,220
when you're using relationships and the

00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:05,400
reason is if you follow the arrow it's

00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:08,159
relatively performant if you don't

00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:11,190
follow the arrow Drupal has to basically

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,570
read the entire other side and figure

00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,820
out what happens to be pointing

00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:17,039
backwards so Drupal doesn't have a

00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:19,350
problem doing that for you I think in

00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,900
Drupal 7 you had to use a module to

00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:24,030
accomplish that but now so what you have

00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:26,730
are two options if you pick a particular

00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:29,669
field name you're gonna see two options

00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:32,909
and that is content reference from and

00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:35,429
content using so if it's content using

00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:37,590
I'm following the arrow if its contents

00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:38,909
referenced from I'm going out to the

00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,950
other side and trying to find things

00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:46,380
that are pointed at me does that make

00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:48,900
sense to everyone once I do that and you

00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:52,770
add a field from the second content type

00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:55,260
it won't show up and the reason is you

00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:58,169
also need to go in and tell it which

00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:00,179
relationship to actually use and the

00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:02,159
reason for that is Drupal allows you to

00:29:00,179 --> 00:29:05,010
recycle fields from content type to

00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,400
content type so in theory you could have

00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:10,530
a view you could have two relationships

00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:13,470
both of which has a field with that's

00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:15,150
based on the same exact field and the it

00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:16,950
you need to be able to tell it which one

00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:19,500
it is so unfortunately in that

00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:22,440
relatively fringe case causes Drupal to

00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:24,330
want to be more general so in every case

00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,330
you have to go back and tell it exactly

00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:29,250
which content type you're using once you

00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:30,780
do that and almost always it'll do when

00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,039
you pull the pull down list you only get

00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:36,149
one option so it's

00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:38,129
it's not a big deal the other thing is

00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:39,419
you'll notice when now when you're

00:29:38,129 --> 00:29:43,440
looking at my field list

00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:45,419
I've got title twice so I did something

00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,909
that probably wasn't the world's best

00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:49,739
idea for for a user interface

00:29:47,909 --> 00:29:52,649
I used the title field that's part of

00:29:49,739 --> 00:29:55,229
every entity especially every content

00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:56,759
type in the property it happens to be

00:29:55,229 --> 00:29:59,549
the address and that's what I changed

00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:01,229
the label to in the realtor it happens

00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:03,090
to be the realtor's name and that's what

00:30:01,229 --> 00:30:05,580
I change the label to so on the user

00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:07,289
input screen it isn't so bad but when

00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:10,049
I'm doing development I have to now keep

00:30:07,289 --> 00:30:12,479
track of there's a title that say the

00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:14,279
address that's part of property and

00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:16,139
there's a title that's really there and

00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:18,059
you notice it's marked as hidden and

00:30:16,139 --> 00:30:20,190
that's because if you looked at realtor

00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:22,499
phone you would find out that the real

00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:24,840
of your phone is actually rewriting the

00:30:22,499 --> 00:30:28,679
field to be realtor name comma Realtor

00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:30,869
phone so Amanda before we take take

00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:34,679
questions why don't you show a few of

00:30:30,869 --> 00:30:36,659
the views you built I haven't started

00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:38,940
working on the theme yet so all you'll

00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:41,220
see today is bar tech on the front page

00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,929
we have two views using add-on modules

00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:45,299
the picture of the house is actually a

00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:47,039
carousel or a slide show that changes

00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:48,899
about every five seconds below it as a

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,570
map of available properties when you

00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:53,549
click on a map on a map pin it opens a

00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:54,509
box with the relevant data looks like I

00:30:53,549 --> 00:30:58,049
need to figure out why that one is

00:30:54,509 --> 00:31:00,269
showing up twice this is the basic

00:30:58,049 --> 00:31:02,099
what's for sale page showing a view with

00:31:00,269 --> 00:31:04,529
various expose filters that visitors can

00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:06,840
select it's in a table format and has

00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:08,909
groupings by neighborhood this is

00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,499
another display from the main property

00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:12,359
display that is using a contextual

00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:17,700
filter to only show the neighborhood

00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:20,429
center city center finally this is a

00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:22,739
views infinite scroll picture gallery of

00:31:20,429 --> 00:31:25,019
available properties it starts off only

00:31:22,739 --> 00:31:26,700
showing four properties but as you

00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:28,529
scroll down it adds properties four at a

00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:34,049
time it's kind of like how Facebook does

00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:36,320
its timeline the end of the presentation

00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:38,480
part of the talk were more than one

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,430
however we want to remind everyone that

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,910
on Friday is sprint day

00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:46,160
please come Amanda will be there she's

00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:48,590
actually hoping we would be a sprint

00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,240
mentor this year and I'll be there and

00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:52,130
we hope we'll see all of you there

00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,050
because it's through the community

00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:56,560
getting together on days like the threat

00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:59,030
days that we have a more powerful and

00:31:56,560 --> 00:32:02,770
environment to work in and finally

00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:04,970
there's the excuse me there are

00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:07,430
evaluations on every page so if you go

00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:09,860
to the session URL for this particular

00:32:07,430 --> 00:32:11,660
session there's an evaluation you fill

00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:13,280
it out we would love to hear you your

00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:17,330
feedback so with that we'll take

00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:18,680
questions job offers whatever so there

00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:20,630
are microphones because we're being

00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:23,980
recorded if you would use the microphone

00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,980
we would dearly appreciate it

00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,289
come on everybody's got abused question

00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:42,549
what is the best practice to embed a

00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:46,299
view into a note do you use the tweak

00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:48,010
way or do you use a contributed model my

00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:50,679
favorite way and I think the one that's

00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:52,600
cleanest within the Drupal way of doing

00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:54,909
business is I create a view that's a

00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,100
block and I place the block with

00:32:54,909 --> 00:33:00,640
visibility on that particular node or

00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:02,860
node type so views can be build blocks

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,780
blocks can easily be paste placed on

00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,370
particular nodes and if you want a

00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:08,500
particular view that goes with a

00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:10,179
particular node to change depending on

00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:12,070
which node it's on that's where

00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:14,799
contextual filters comes in really handy

00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:16,990
so you can have a you can have a

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:20,770
contextual filter which can't have as a

00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:22,480
block can't have a URL and the only way

00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:24,820
it'll find out what filter it needs to

00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,090
use is by using something like the node

00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:30,280
ID from the page it's being displayed on

00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:34,299
okay and what if you want to embed the

00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:37,720
view inside the content so you have some

00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:40,780
text some intro text and some after that

00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:43,299
you and in the end gallery or something

00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:44,980
that's more challenging I'd be very

00:33:43,299 --> 00:33:47,710
honest I haven't done it and so long I

00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:50,140
know in Drupal seven there was a module

00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:52,210
that would let you do that basically

00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:56,409
added it to content types

00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:58,000
huh well not panelizer not panels or

00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:59,830
panelizer I think what you're talking

00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
about is like almost like through see

00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:03,039
the ckeditor

00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,650
the WYSIWYG you'd have a button that

00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,570
would say insert a view here and you

00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:10,510
could do it otherwise if you can if you

00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:12,099
can split it into two fields then you

00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:14,619
can use blocks again because it'd be

00:34:12,099 --> 00:34:18,580
really easy to put a view in them in

00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:19,869
between two others and ultimately when

00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,869
you want to go really kinky you use

00:34:19,869 --> 00:34:25,450
paragraphs or panels and basically have

00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:29,050
stacks I know we we did a Drupal 8

00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:30,550
project with with paragraphs and so we

00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:32,740
had different paragraph types one of

00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:35,020
which was a view and so we could add a

00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:37,240
view and a particular but it was that

00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:39,550
what's very popular style now were there

00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,960
a bunch of bands and each band might be

00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:43,179
a slightly different kind of disc okay

00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:47,169
and inside the paragraph how do you

00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:48,760
embed the view and said you can't do

00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:52,179
with HTML you'd have to do

00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,649
by generating the the HTML through to do

00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:56,950
it right you'd have to do it by

00:34:53,649 --> 00:34:59,530
generating it from something that could

00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:01,330
combine them like that so you can't

00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:07,300
really put a view in the middle of a

00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:09,220
paragraph easily cleanly okay not not

00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,170
within the single field like I said you

00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:14,619
could have two fields body one body two

00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:17,260
and easily put a view in between them

00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:19,450
but and I think like I said in Drupal 7

00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:24,310
there was a module that lets you put in

00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:24,820
it's sort of like a token huh use insert

00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:28,720
okay

00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:30,730
I knew it was it's been a while but it

00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,710
basically lets you format like a token

00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:34,510
and as long as you have the token module

00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:38,830
turned on it's just yet another way to

00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:41,310
to insert variables within your your

00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:44,910
copy okay thank you

00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:44,910
other questions

00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:56,349
to ask about I think one of the things

00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:58,479
you can do in terms of output is to tap

00:35:56,349 --> 00:36:02,679
into the rest api's and things like that

00:35:58,479 --> 00:36:05,349
so you instead of outputting HTML you

00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:09,189
can do JSON and others like that and

00:36:05,349 --> 00:36:11,709
then start decoupling a bit and would

00:36:09,189 --> 00:36:14,920
you recommend using views to create

00:36:11,709 --> 00:36:18,910
these sort of feeds or are there better

00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:20,349
ways of doing that too for rest purpose

00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:24,369
with the caveat that I am NOT a

00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:26,679
front-end developer I may pretend to be

00:36:24,369 --> 00:36:28,859
one a couple of times but and so I don't

00:36:26,679 --> 00:36:32,079
do JavaScript with frameworks and and

00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:33,579
decoupled kind of Drupal approaches the

00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,130
way I'm hearing from working with

00:36:33,579 --> 00:36:39,029
developers that do they're doing it one

00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:41,829
of two ways they're using the JSON API

00:36:39,029 --> 00:36:44,109
module which is a slightly different

00:36:41,829 --> 00:36:46,809
philosophy than the REST API that's

00:36:44,109 --> 00:36:50,529
built in the core but gives you that

00:36:46,809 --> 00:36:52,779
same capability very frequently it

00:36:50,529 --> 00:36:54,509
depends if you have relationships that

00:36:52,779 --> 00:36:57,699
you want exposed together basically

00:36:54,509 --> 00:36:59,920
denormalizing views is a great way to do

00:36:57,699 --> 00:37:02,049
that if you have content that's just

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,939
simply being output you can do that

00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:07,299
directly from the REST API that's part

00:37:03,939 --> 00:37:08,829
of core so they're really two three

00:37:07,299 --> 00:37:11,739
different ways and you might mix and

00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:13,390
match a couple of them together but more

00:37:11,739 --> 00:37:15,819
and more I'm hearing that the people are

00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:17,650
doing true decoupled are using the JSON

00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:20,949
API because it seems to have a more

00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:23,579
natural interface than than the built-in

00:37:20,949 --> 00:37:23,579
REST API

00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:33,540
other questions I feel like there's

00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:37,210
nothing else hello

00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:38,650
well with that we thank you um if

00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:39,910
anyone's interested in the book there

00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:41,950
are postcards in the back there are

00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:44,140
postcards up here they have a discount

00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:45,760
code so if you're gonna buy the book you

00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:49,060
want to buy it probably in the next

00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,280
couple weeks because it's cheaper with

00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:53,950
that well thank you for attending and

00:37:51,280 --> 00:38:02,670
have a great

00:37:53,950 --> 00:38:02,670
[Applause]
