Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Contenta - Drupal’s API Distribution
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	Contenta is a Drupal distribution that gives you modern API capabilities out-of-the box with JSON API, which amongst other features allows you to fetch nested resources in one request, and work-in-progress to include the similar GraphQL service. It’s ready to feed content to your JavaScript powered website, phone app, TV, or even the mythical fridge application.

Drupal is a leading content management system when it comes to building smart editorial experiences and content modelling, but the front-end needs of consumers have evolved rapidly away from traditional server-side rendered sites. From powering a single application, to multi-channel publishing, Contenta provides all the tools and configuration you need to get started with your Create Once, Publish Everywhere CMS.

With Contenta you can either start with a minimal blank slate, or try out the demo install which shows you how to solve some of the different problems encountered when developing and building in a decoupled situation. The demo install also provides many reference implementations of consumers in popular frameworks such as React, Angular, Elm, Ionic, and even an Alexa skill!

This session will lead you through a tour of Contenta’s current features and roadmap, including showing you what’s possible with Contenta’s reference applications that implement the Out-of-the-box Initiative’s cooking recipe site. There’ll be discussion on content model decisions we made to support our variety of consumers, as well as how we solved some common problems such as routing and rich text formats.

As a community led distribution, we’ll also show you how you can get involved with the project and join our fast growing army of Contenta contributors!
