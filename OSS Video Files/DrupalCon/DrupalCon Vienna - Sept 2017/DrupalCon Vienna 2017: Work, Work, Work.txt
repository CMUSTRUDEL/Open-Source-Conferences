Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	So you've decided you would like to turn your Drupal hobby into your profession. Congratulations! Or maybe you're unhappy in your current job, and are thinking about making a move to somewhere new. In this session, a fourteen-year Drupal veteran will give you her insights into working for agencies, in-house development teams, and working as an independent. It's not all "just" Drupal work and the more you understand the pros and cons of different working environments, the better equipped you will be to find a great job that suits you.

In this session we will explore how to:

Analyse the type of work you enjoy doing.
Convert a job description into (likely) daily tasks.
Determine if a job will be a good match for you by cross-referencing what "you" want and what "they'll" want.
A few bonus comments will be added on working for collocated vs. distributed teams.
