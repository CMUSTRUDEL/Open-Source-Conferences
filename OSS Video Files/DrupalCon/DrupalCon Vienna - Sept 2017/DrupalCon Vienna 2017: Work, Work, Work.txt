Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Work, Work, Work
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	So you've decided you would like to turn your Drupal hobby into your profession. Congratulations! Or maybe you're unhappy in your current job, and are thinking about making a move to somewhere new. In this session, a fourteen-year Drupal veteran will give you her insights into working for agencies, in-house development teams, and working as an independent. It's not all "just" Drupal work and the more you understand the pros and cons of different working environments, the better equipped you will be to find a great job that suits you.

In this session we will explore how to:

Analyse the type of work you enjoy doing.
Convert a job description into (likely) daily tasks.
Determine if a job will be a good match for you by cross-referencing what "you" want and what "they'll" want.
A few bonus comments will be added on working for collocated vs. distributed teams.

um there there is a small amount of

00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,270
actual audience participation and

00:00:04,259 --> 00:00:08,429
they've just locked the door so you're

00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:12,420
all stuck in the room now fortunately or

00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:15,780
unfortunately and I lied it's not really

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:18,630
locked you're not you're not late I

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:21,090
haven't started yet you're not late I

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:24,990
promise and but I will get started in

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,910
about two minutes and there is a small

00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,500
amount of having to talk to other people

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,529
which I know is going to be horrendous

00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,020
for some of you so if you're not a

00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:36,360
talking kind of person please do make

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,969
sure that you have your digital device

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,100
open and ready to tweet which I realize

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,629
will be a lot more accessible for some

00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,980
of you and I don't have a hashtag for

00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,370
the talk so you could just put it on the

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,590
DrupalCon hashtag and I don't think

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,390
it'll be too scary though so if you want

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,780
to you don't have to come towards me

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,090
that's fine but if you want if you want

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,460
to move forward or back so that you're

00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:05,070
sort of vaguely sitting near someone

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,330
else yeah again you don't you don't have

00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,110
to if you want to be on Twitter instead

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,110
that's completely fine

00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,690
I love when I say audience participation

00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:36,300
and then some people like no I'm out and

00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,620
they just walk into the room it's okay

00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:42,750
the recording will be here for you later

00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:44,460
when you're ready for him um I think

00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,880
it's okay if I start a bit 20 seconds

00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,500
early

00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,210
I think I'm re with this I know that

00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,590
everyone's like standing inside just

00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,460
waiting to rush the room but I think

00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:57,330
we're good and so this this talk came

00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:01,979
about because in part Emma convinced me

00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:05,040
to tell this story that I had told to

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:07,020
her about how I had found what is now

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,880
for me quite meaningful and employment

00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,619
there are definitely challenges with my

00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,540
job and I'll tell you who I work for in

00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,830
a minute so you'll perhaps want to

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,200
remember that statement of there are

00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,489
challenges but it's it's been a pretty

00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,130
interesting journey for me and I hope

00:02:17,489 --> 00:02:22,470
that for some of you it will be useful

00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:23,880
relevant and for some of you it may just

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:25,260
be story time where you get to hear

00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,989
about the different kinds of jobs that

00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:31,380
I've had in the last 20 years about 15

00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:34,620
of which has been with Drupal and so

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:38,310
more specifically I have been around

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,500
since the days of Drupal gosh three four

00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:44,430
in that range so quite a long time and

00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:49,590
Drupal speak and it worked at the time I

00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:52,170
was working for local government and or

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,980
was a contractor sort of around that

00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:59,850
time since then I've worked for in-house

00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,170
development teams for agencies I've

00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:03,510
worked for phase two I've worked for

00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,799
Lullaby although I was on the education

00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:09,630
side of things so more specifically

00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:11,070
Drupal ëismí and have also now may be

00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,320
the right way is to say it landed a job

00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:15,739
working for the United Nations where I

00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:19,470
work as a development manager and

00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:22,410
project manager for within digital

00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,570
services for the office for the

00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:26,190
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs so

00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:28,170
the challenging part of my job is that I

00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:32,459
deal with professional disaster

00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:34,260
responders and all of the heartache that

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:35,640
comes with paying attention to the work

00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:38,459
that you're doing in terms of how that

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,800
impacts the field and for me it has been

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:42,270
a really interesting journey we are

00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:46,410
using Drupal in-house

00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:48,450
I manage we probably have about seven or

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,820
eight Drupal projects that we host and

00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,820
then there's also a combination of

00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:56,490
Python some straight PHP websites what

00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:57,870
am I forgetting there's another platform

00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,100
in there don't tell anyone

00:03:57,870 --> 00:04:01,620
node that's the other one that we hope

00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:04,680
stuff and it's so it's a range of

00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:06,990
different products and effectively we so

00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,050
the digital services team acts as a mini

00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:11,490
in-house agency but there's not time

00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:14,040
cards associated it doesn't have the

00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:16,500
same sort of regular or the typical

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,120
billing cycle that you would think of in

00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,830
terms of doing agency work and we have a

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,299
much longer term relationship with our

00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:23,940
clients because they're all within our

00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:25,560
organization so similar to some of the

00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,640
work that I was doing but a little bit a

00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,830
little bit of a twist

00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:33,570
now I it's kind of a weird thing to do

00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,610
to everyone but what I would really like

00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:37,440
for you to do is just with the folks

00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:38,250
around you or perhaps on Twitter if

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,870
you're not completely comfortable

00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:42,930
talking to strangers which I completely

00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:45,600
understand and respect do you know right

00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:47,520
now what it is and so this is sort of

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,100
like the before and after do you know

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,880
what it is right now that you are doing

00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,620
when you are most happy so with the with

00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,910
the folks next to you give a bit of an

00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,910
introduction you may already know them

00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,920
and maybe you've seen or heard about the

00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:04,560
term flow like what is it that you're

00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,260
doing let's say at your computer when

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,110
you are filled with the most joy and

00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:12,600
then we'll sort of unpack a little bit

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:15,000
of that as the presentation sort of

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,500
unfolds and then the other thing if you

00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,360
have no idea and you actually hate doing

00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:20,730
Drupal that's okay I understand that too

00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,610
we all have those moments today might be

00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:25,890
that moment for you ah what is your

00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:27,150
other passion in life so we'll assume

00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,860
that Drupal is your number one passion

00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,960
which may or may not be the case but

00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,570
we'll make that assumption so what is

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,190
sort of your your outside world or sort

00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,990
of when you're not when you're not doing

00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,150
Drupal what is it so for me it would be

00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,160
sewing or running are my two sort of

00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:43,020
outside passions so I'll give you sort

00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,390
of 30 seconds right now to sort of just

00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:47,820
do a quick introduction and at the

00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,830
computer what are you doing when you are

00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,229
most happy and then the second one

00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,350
what's your secondary source of joy go

00:05:52,229 --> 00:05:54,350
ahead

00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,400
so I'm gonna I'm gonna cut you short on

00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:19,199
this one but what I saw it there was a

00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,360
lot of happy faces which is good because

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,919
initially what I saw was a lot of faces

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,129
sort of looking at me blankly thinking I

00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:27,960
have no idea what brings me joy so for

00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:29,430
some of you the social aspect of it is

00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,750
what brings you joy because as soon as

00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:32,009
you were able to talk to someone else

00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,449
you were able to start sort of thinking

00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:34,229
about what it was that that you actually

00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:36,210
loved doing

00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:38,310
there's a few words sort of up behind me

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,840
that maybe you would have exchanged with

00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,729
one another in terms of building or

00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,270
refactoring being social or working

00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:44,430
alone

00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:46,020
and do you do you like optimizing code

00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,159
do you like generating new code you know

00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,750
there's lots of different things that

00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:51,870
you could have said and it's always for

00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:53,520
me a bit fun to see the the reaction

00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,780
when someone else sort of like there's

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,000
people out there who actually enjoy

00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,470
refactoring and and the look on

00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,630
someone's face it's like really those

00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,159
people exist I have met them they exist

00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:04,650
in the wild I know that they're out

00:08:02,159 --> 00:08:05,880
there and any sort of you know there's

00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,440
these different ways of thinking and I'm

00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,880
gonna sort of rap a lot of this

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,900
presentation I know you really want to

00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,900
take a picture the slides are already

00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,919
line on line I promise it'll be a rain

00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,419
there's an article that I read or a

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:20,039
presentation that I watched actually a

00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:22,259
couple of years ago that broke ways of

00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:26,250
thinking about problems into three types

00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:27,599
of people and this there's a lot of the

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:29,130
metaphor that doesn't really work for

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,870
what we're going to do but I think it's

00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,959
a good one so we're going to talk about

00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:37,800
pioneers settlers and town planners and

00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:40,349
this is a originally blog post by Simon

00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,360
wordly who's done a lot with Auslan so

00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:43,110
if you do a search for Auslan and Simon

00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,579
hordley you'll find some really

00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:46,890
interesting things that he's also talked

00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:49,410
about and he basically says that there's

00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:51,660
three types of very brilliant people who

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:54,000
do really really important work you've

00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,310
got the pioneers who are going to build

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,170
something that is a prototype it's not

00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,940
even a product they come up with these

00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,920
outlandish ideas that you would never

00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,170
want to actually use they probably their

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,430
code doesn't work a lot of the time but

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,470
they're really innovative and

00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:10,279
interesting ideas that they're going to

00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,450
bring to the table the next one is the

00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:14,490
settler and what the settler does is

00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:17,670
they take this prototype and they turn

00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:19,740
it into an actual usable MVP or product

00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:21,209
something you might want to know now

00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,010
you're getting into the beta phase of

00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:24,660
things you can handle low volume traffic

00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,040
you can actually start having users

00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,480
interact with it and they

00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,130
they serve a really important purpose I

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,380
mean at this point you're starting to

00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:34,290
perhaps make money off of that initial

00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:36,180
prototype and you are you're able to to

00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:38,490
bring some reliability to it and then

00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:40,350
finally you've got the town planners at

00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:42,149
the end of things the town planners take

00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,009
that initial website and they scale it

00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:46,680
up into something absolutely massive and

00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:49,949
they are able to at that point so if you

00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:54,000
think about you know I can put in a

00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:56,220
video on my website but if I want to be

00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,589
Netflix I don't want everyone coming to

00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,720
my website so that's the scaling idea of

00:09:58,589 --> 00:10:03,329
you have this initial platform that you

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,160
then want to make bigger so roughly

00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:07,350
speaking you're going to have the

00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,209
pioneers as the people who invent the

00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:11,040
settlers as the people who refactor and

00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:12,810
the town planners is the people who are

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,699
going to scale now there's all kinds of

00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,410
ways that this doesn't quite work in the

00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:19,079
real world but think of it in that way

00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:21,690
for this one so within those three

00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:23,519
categories you may sort of initially you

00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:26,399
may start to think about which of those

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:29,819
three you are and then start thinking

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,940
about how you experience work and think

00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:35,639
about whether or not you are fighting

00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,290
with what the work is trying to do or

00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,300
what your employer is trying to do in

00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:41,850
terms of their core business and what

00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:45,690
you are most interested in ultimately

00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:47,670
employers can also be pioneers settlers

00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:49,079
and town planners and there's also of

00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:50,940
course different points of the project

00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:53,579
where you know you may you may have

00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:56,310
early on in the development of a product

00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:58,230
where something is going to be turned

00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:59,430
upon the the innovative side of things

00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,529
and then maybe it's going to be very

00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,760
innovative again at the scaling side

00:11:01,529 --> 00:11:05,910
when you start to think of a bigger

00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:07,860
infrastructure and actually making it

00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:11,790
work for millions of people instead of

00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:13,019
your cat and your dog so now we need to

00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:14,760
start thinking about these types of

00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:17,010
employers and the other question that

00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,079
I've asked myself sorry over and over

00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,630
again is how is it that I've had all of

00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:23,220
these different jobs in the last 20

00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,709
years and sort of what do they have in

00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,209
common and I've got some things in terms

00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:29,699
of I really like three-month projects

00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:31,680
that's my my window or my attention span

00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:33,060
for excitement and even in the place

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,069
that I'm in right now even though I'm in

00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,260
an in-house software developer

00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,490
effectively it's still project-based and

00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,980
I still have multiple teams that I'm

00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,269
supporting

00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,560
we still have projects that are about

00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:43,510
three months long where we add new

00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:45,790
features and then basically set that

00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:47,470
site up for maintenance mode where it's

00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:50,860
only getting bug fixes and only getting

00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:54,250
small tweaks along the way so I've been

00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:57,579
self-employed agency work in terms of

00:11:54,250 --> 00:12:00,250
working for phase two and also basically

00:11:57,579 --> 00:12:02,410
agency work as my own self-employed

00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,660
person and then the in-house development

00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:07,149
was working for a couple of different

00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:09,040
and actually all of mine has agency work

00:12:07,149 --> 00:12:10,930
has been for government or pseudo

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,250
government and then finally the in-house

00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,079
combination which is where I am right

00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:17,860
now which is effectively an agency

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:20,649
inside a large organization I've found

00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:23,250
that in especially at Drupal cons and at

00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:27,220
Drupal camps I found that there's this

00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:29,380
affinity for Drupal agencies and that's

00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:30,790
that's who we see out in on the exhibit

00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,050
hall you know that those are the

00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,730
companies that we think of it working

00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,889
for those are the ones that we see and

00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:36,910
yet of the folks who are here I'm going

00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:39,190
to I'm not gonna do a show of hands

00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:40,870
because you might prove me wrong but I'm

00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,730
gonna guess that a percentage of you are

00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:45,220
not actually working for Drupal agencies

00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:47,440
and certainly if we were to go into the

00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:50,139
wider audience of who's here it's

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,819
there's not enough Drupal agency work

00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:53,649
for everyone to actually be working at

00:12:51,819 --> 00:12:56,920
an agency so we're likely to find

00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:58,990
schools libraries government things that

00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,550
are perhaps someone's secondary passion

00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,699
and they're not necessarily building

00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:05,410
software for the sake of software so

00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:06,850
then we then we start to look at okay if

00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,620
there's different kinds of agencies

00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:10,389
there's also different types of

00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,550
industries that we can work in and as I

00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:14,110
was saying you know you can be producing

00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,029
technology for the sake of technology

00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:17,860
which is a lot of the folks who are on

00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:19,959
that trade floor are building technology

00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:22,839
for other technologists to consume in

00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:24,430
their day job then we have users of

00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:27,279
Technology which is the government the

00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:28,630
schools the think about all the folks

00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,670
who've built websites for if you do

00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:32,800
agency work right now and then

00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:34,510
ultimately combining that with your

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,560
passion so have you gone back to you

00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:40,899
know what was your secondary copy and

00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:43,269
it's like my dream job might actually be

00:13:40,899 --> 00:13:44,529
working for Strava might actually be you

00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:46,269
know there's there's lots of different

00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:49,180
ways that you can think about and it

00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:51,950
sort of as a as a graduate with a second

00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:54,260
degree or a second major rather in

00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:56,269
science for me to be always coming back

00:13:54,260 --> 00:14:00,470
to government makes a lot of sense in

00:13:56,269 --> 00:14:02,660
terms of my second passion my first

00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:06,740
passion isn't necessarily technology

00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:10,070
it's more that I hate bad websites and

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,810
so want to make them better you know

00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,279
that's sort of refactoring experience

00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:14,810
and made those people do exist in the

00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,190
wild like I want to make it better for

00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:17,660
people I want this experience to be

00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:20,870
really really wonderful

00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:22,250
or at least suck a little bit less so if

00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:25,160
you think about your secondary passion

00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:27,730
and you pair it with with that sort of

00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,980
are you a pioneer are you an inventor a

00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,600
refactor or a scalar I don't even know

00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,029
if these are words but let's think of it

00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,829
that way then we can sort of match those

00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:40,279
up and find the job that's going to be

00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:43,459
right for you now this next session is

00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:45,740
section rather is a cheeky maybe a

00:14:43,459 --> 00:14:48,350
little bit cheeky because it's really a

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,269
primer on reading job advertisements and

00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:53,690
I have found that most of them are

00:14:50,269 --> 00:14:55,699
really poorly written so it may seem a

00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,970
little bit unfair but we'll see if I can

00:14:55,699 --> 00:15:00,980
match them up kind of so the first set

00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,930
and these are you know these are pulled

00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,490
from real job adverts on the internet

00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:08,930
you can tell because of that first

00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:10,459
sentence so the inventor friendly if

00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,810
you're thinking about keywords when

00:15:10,459 --> 00:15:14,570
you're reading a job description that

00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:15,769
might suit you you will need don't not

00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,640
have to read this I think this is one of

00:15:15,769 --> 00:15:19,279
those things where I can't just

00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,740
paraphrase you will need to efficiently

00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:24,769
execute on business priorities and

00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,360
designs in an agile framework so there's

00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:28,250
a couple of key words for heating me

00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:31,459
here one is that they haven't actually

00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:35,540
named what the agile framework is and in

00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:37,490
my experience agile is a code word for I

00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,480
didn't feel like planning and I'm going

00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:41,300
to change my mind

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:45,290
regularly I really like the agile

00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:48,319
manifesto and I don't particularly have

00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:50,660
a single framework that I use but for

00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:53,720
the scale of this company for this where

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:55,880
this job posting was this is code for

00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:59,149
we're going to change our mind a lot so

00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:02,720
if you really like sort of crafting

00:15:59,149 --> 00:16:04,850
these exceptional software experiences

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,610
that are going to take time and energy

00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,620
to

00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:09,030
do the user research to think about what

00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:11,520
it is that you need to build to be able

00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:13,980
to test the implementation with the

00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:16,440
users to iterate over time this this is

00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:18,360
maybe not quite going to be a good job

00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,220
for you but if you love to invent stuff

00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,540
and you love to just sort of put things

00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,740
out there and see if it works and put

00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,510
things out there and see if it works on

00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:27,900
a completely different project this one

00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:29,460
may be a good match for you second the

00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:32,580
second one come prepared to work in a

00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,960
fast-paced environment that one may just

00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,910
be codeword for we don't know how to

00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,370
stop at the end of the day but again I

00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:41,940
sort of I think it's not a it doesn't

00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:44,190
have the language of we take the time to

00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:45,870
stop and think about what we do so let's

00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,070
let's contrast it and well I think it's

00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:51,600
a you know they're a different set of

00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:53,790
keywords because this one is more on the

00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,610
the continuous it's not it's not about

00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:58,530
speed so much as iteration so

00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:00,300
continuously improve operational

00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:02,580
processes and procedures sorry my

00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:05,760
Canadians coming out here development

00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:08,280
and support of so that support word to

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,260
me implies refactoring because if you

00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,760
are responsible for a product long term

00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,290
you're going to be thinking about how

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,480
you can change that product to actually

00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:17,970
meet the needs of the users who are

00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,800
experiencing problems so slightly

00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:21,420
different if we go if I can figure it

00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,420
backwards yeah slightly different from

00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:26,370
fast-paced or focused on the business

00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:31,020
priorities which is not necessarily the

00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:32,310
user needs agile framework a slightly

00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,010
different language on these ones and

00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:36,990
then scaling scaling was a bit tricky

00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:38,550
for me to find examples of the language

00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:40,590
that I would expect and for the most

00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:43,620
part I found it in operations where it

00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:45,360
was more on the where you have a

00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,160
division between what the developers

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,900
done have done and then what the

00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,150
operations team is responsible for in

00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:53,370
terms of making sure it stays upright in

00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:55,230
production but in these cases I was

00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:56,880
mostly finding things around performance

00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:58,590
and scalability as being the keywords

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,060
that that you may look for in a job

00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:05,250
description if that's of interest to you

00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:07,200
and the big one I think I don't know

00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:11,040
what like it's maybe an unfair heading

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:14,340
but the big one for me was how do you

00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,990
personally like to work so in terms of I

00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:18,130
work on a distributed team and it is

00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:20,500
distributed by design

00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,510
being an operations team in terms of

00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,280
keeping the web servers online we don't

00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:26,559
all want to be sat in the same place

00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,090
because we don't want to do night shifts

00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,559
and so we've got a team part of the team

00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:32,980
is in Australia part and Romania and

00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:38,740
then I'm in the UK so the the culture

00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:40,900
that we have in our digital space needs

00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:44,590
to be very aware of time zones and so we

00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:46,179
try to not have an interrupt culture

00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:47,350
that results in someone being pinged at

00:18:46,179 --> 00:18:48,850
two o'clock in the morning with an

00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,520
expectation of an answer unless

00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:53,740
something is actually falling over

00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:56,200
during the work day we also for some of

00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:58,390
the teams again I support about 15 to 20

00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:02,530
teams depending on how you count we try

00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:04,840
to keep the focus or the interrupts 2

00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:07,150
scheduled meeting times which allows a

00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,320
larger block of time for folks to

00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:10,870
actually sit down and get their work

00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,270
done this is completely different to

00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:15,610
what you might experience in terms of XP

00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:17,169
or pairing or if you were in a workplace

00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,789
and you you know there's a an

00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:20,740
expectation that you can just go and tap

00:19:18,789 --> 00:19:22,510
someone on the shoulder so think about

00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,850
those keywords for yourself and do you

00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:27,760
to really sink your teeth into a problem

00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:30,490
do you need to have that quiet time to

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,840
yourself or do you need to be talking to

00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,340
someone else so if you think about when

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,650
I said what brings you joy and you just

00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:37,299
kind of you know many of you just stare

00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,740
to me blankly but as soon as you got to

00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:40,150
talk to someone else then that sort of

00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:42,309
got the ideas going and you were able to

00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:45,070
generate through brainstorming what that

00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:47,230
was so think about those those words and

00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:50,020
whether or not you want a high interrupt

00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:51,340
or a high sort of social environment or

00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,740
whether or not you want to sort of

00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:58,240
narrow down narrow down the noise and

00:19:53,740 --> 00:20:01,210
focus it in on specific meeting times so

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:04,780
really the question of which resonates

00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:06,630
with you is it the the inventer is it

00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:09,130
the refactor or is it the scale and

00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:10,659
asking and taking out of those job

00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:12,789
descriptions as much information as you

00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:15,850
get but also interviewing the employer

00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:17,799
and asking them to tell you what it is

00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:19,750
that they are expecting from that

00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:21,909
position I mean not at all have I talked

00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:24,159
about your skills this is about what

00:20:21,909 --> 00:20:26,260
brings you sort of joy and how you like

00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,540
working and the delight that that that

00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:30,100
you need to have from your employer so

00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:32,860
now we've got kind of

00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:35,410
lessons from the trenches I've worked

00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:42,490
almost exclusively on distributed teams

00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:44,919
since 2006 and it it's hard work you had

00:20:42,490 --> 00:20:49,270
need to be very consciously involved in

00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:50,980
the the day-to-day activities of how

00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:53,410
you're going to work as a distributed

00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,090
team so it means setting up some kind of

00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:57,070
schedule it means and I don't have a

00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:58,929
picture in here but we we have a lot of

00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:02,380
meetings that are set asides that there

00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:04,450
is intentional time we don't do the 24/7

00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,909
video camera of the office space it's

00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:09,700
very even we do hangouts we pretend not

00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:11,590
to do video and that's it's just the way

00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,090
the the culture of our office works and

00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,530
it works well for us but we do have

00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:18,039
these really intentional time set aside

00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:21,120
to have that communication we tend to

00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:24,100
work on shorter Sprint's we tend to

00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,929
force people to show how their work is

00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:28,299
going instead of going the longer

00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:31,240
two-week sprint we shorten things down

00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:33,190
and make sure that we explicitly know

00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,010
that someone is doing well or has run

00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:37,809
into problems we take turns for being

00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:39,280
responsible for planning instead of

00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:41,470
trying to do it as a group because it is

00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,299
quite difficult and we also allow people

00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:45,070
wherever possible to self-select the

00:21:43,299 --> 00:21:46,480
tasks that they're working on none of

00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:48,250
this is official policy it's just what

00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,820
works for the folks who are currently

00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:54,610
within the teams that I work with the

00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:57,220
next one aiming for culture is aiming

00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:59,980
too low so I have had a couple of jobs

00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:01,330
where I loved the people who I was going

00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,950
to be working with going into the

00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:04,390
company and then found that that

00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,220
actually wasn't enough because there

00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:08,200
wasn't a clear sense of how I could be

00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,280
useful and what the company needed for

00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:13,030
me and it was just this constant

00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:15,580
struggle as we didn't figure out where

00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:17,740
the click was in terms of the the

00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:20,289
synergy of how we were going to work

00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,940
together so when you when you do start a

00:22:20,289 --> 00:22:23,500
job even if you love the people you love

00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:25,240
the company you love the brand you love

00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,470
everything about them stop and think

00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,450
about what you're actually going to be

00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:31,150
doing for the first three or six months

00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:32,919
and make sure that it's something that

00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,750
you're excited about working on and they

00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:36,549
are excited about you working on and

00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,710
it's actually going to be helping them

00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:40,780
either to generate new revenue or smooth

00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:42,140
at an onboarding process or whatever it

00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,610
happens to be it can

00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:45,350
change it doesn't need to be the same

00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:49,100
for the whole thing but make sure you

00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:51,110
have that plan with them and then the

00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:54,920
next one so this is this is a tricky one

00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:58,300
for for us right now and our team

00:22:54,920 --> 00:23:00,380
Digital Services is responsible for

00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:03,530
helping to bring a new way of thinking

00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:05,600
about software development to to our

00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:08,210
larger division and we're going from

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,330
teams with sort of a single developer

00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:13,190
who sits with the team all the time to

00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:16,400
having more of a central pool and then

00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:17,900
taking whole teams and giving them to to

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,430
a product owner to a software product

00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,260
and they would get an intense period of

00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:22,520
maybe three to six months to build at

00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:25,610
any feature set and then they go and

00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:27,440
work with a different team so not all

00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:28,970
developers are going to want to work

00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,820
that way and certainly the the

00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:33,890
conditions have changed from a developer

00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,440
being effectively embedded to a

00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:37,790
developer being more sort of special ops

00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,900
now and that they'll go in and then

00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,950
they'll leave again they'll go in and

00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,080
then they'll leave again it's more like

00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:44,510
agency work and that's not going to suit

00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,400
everyone so if you know really well how

00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,990
you like to work if the conditions

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,940
change at work you'll be better able to

00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:51,500
say it's not quite what I want

00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:53,180
so can I meet my needs within a

00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,950
different division within the company or

00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,840
you know depending on how big or how

00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:58,310
small the company is but again the more

00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,490
you're conscious of it the more you can

00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:04,010
make conscious decisions that's a little

00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:05,510
bit redundant isn't it but you have to

00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:07,610
understand yourself and you have to be

00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:09,140
able to see the work for what it is and

00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:13,760
to be able to compare it against what

00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:16,180
you need hope perhaps in conclusion your

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,680
perfect job is out there I do think that

00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:21,200
like I said there's challenges too to

00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:24,110
every job but the job that I'm in right

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,570
now brings me brings me joy and I love

00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:28,220
helping the people that I help yes it

00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:29,720
has its frustrations but I'm sure that

00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,090
every job out there will have its

00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,830
frustrations and I feel for me that it's

00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:36,950
a really meaningful experience and it's

00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:38,210
um similar in the work that I've done

00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:40,880
for other agencies I mean I've worked

00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:43,070
for not-for-profits through agencies

00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,460
before but I really love this in-house

00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:48,620
aspect that I now have know yourself not

00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:50,420
just your role I understand what it is

00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,430
that you need out of a job to feel that

00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,920
you are working at your best

00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:57,320
consider the pioneer settler Town

00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:58,340
Planner breakdown there's lots of other

00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,380
different ways that you can think about

00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:03,110
it but it's not necessarily just about

00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:04,340
sort of a myers-briggs or true colors or

00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:07,100
those kinds of things that's sort of

00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:09,800
thinking about how your role applies to

00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,840
the different phases or lifecycle of a

00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:14,600
product and work with your team to

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,490
define and achieve success and then

00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,920
finally in my slides are online I think

00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:21,110
we may have one or two minutes for

00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,790
questions and I'm hoping that the next

00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:26,300
presenter will come in but--my offstage

00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:27,440
those are my last set of slides I should

00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:29,750
also remind you

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,670
contributors sprints are happening on

00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:34,550
Friday there's a mentored course spring

00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:36,710
in the morning and also the first time

00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:39,260
Sprinter workshop happens first thing

00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:42,380
and then the general sprint is full day

00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:44,900
blah blah blah on you should give

00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:46,610
evaluations for all speakers not just me

00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,200
and that I'll come back to this one I

00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:50,450
don't like I said I don't know if

00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:52,630
there's questions or not but if you do

00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:57,560
want to now you've got that sort of

00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:58,820
pioneer settler Town Planner have a chat

00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,650
back with the person that you talked to

00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:02,150
you before and think about with them

00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:04,960
which of those three do you think you

00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:04,960
most fit with

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:13,850
[Applause]

00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:14,760
you're not supposed to clap you're

00:26:13,850 --> 00:26:18,020
supposed to talk to people

00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,020
[Laughter]

00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:33,670
yeah I have one one question is do you

00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:36,190
feel that there is a pressure for like

00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:39,760
the developer to become a manager the

00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:41,950
managers to become director that sort of

00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,460
pressure hell yeah really really good

00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:44,170
question

00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:48,100
and so I think there's there's

00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:50,400
effectively become kind of too accepted

00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:53,710
paths I guess is the right way to say it

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,480
one is for you to specialize within code

00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:58,600
and become more of an architect and then

00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:01,270
the other one is to to go the manager

00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,980
track and I absolutely think that there

00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:07,750
is a pressure to do that and I also

00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:09,270
think that um there so from my

00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:12,460
experience I mean I started out doing

00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:14,640
web development and I am now very very

00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:17,230
happy as a project manager slash

00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,300
development manager for me the Internet

00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:21,100
has moved very very quickly and

00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,530
especially as a former front-end

00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:25,390
developer it just was - it wasn't

00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:27,370
exciting for me to keep on top of all of

00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:30,130
the technologies so I would hope that

00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:33,100
the workplace that folks are in would

00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:34,750
recognize that an employee may want to

00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:36,370
step out of a development aural or they

00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:38,830
may love the development role they may

00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:40,990
love the speed they may love sort of the

00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:42,460
the constant sense of change and be able

00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,200
to support someone in staying in that

00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,120
role and not force them into a

00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,620
management role and the language that

00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:52,300
I've seen around that is more around

00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:54,970
architect senior it's not even senior

00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:57,280
engineer there's another there's another

00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:59,530
word that is along the architect line

00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:02,920
which is the knot management track and

00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:04,210
so yeah and I there's a couple of good

00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,800
articles that sort of separate out the

00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:07,300
pressures nuts or thing I can all dig up

00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:14,050
the resources and add them to the the

00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:15,520
deck yeah hi I only work for a worker

00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:17,260
cooperative where we all care in our

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,940
business I noticed you didn't mention

00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:21,340
that as kind of one of the business

00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:24,160
models one of the workplaces you may

00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:26,230
find yourself in have you ever worked in

00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:28,169
a worker owned business and/or would

00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:30,239
that change your perception of how

00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:32,789
you can affect the future direction of

00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:34,440
your own yeah type of work and the

00:28:32,789 --> 00:28:36,239
direction of the company itself yeah I

00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:38,249
would sort of slot that went into

00:28:36,239 --> 00:28:39,989
self-employed contractors solopreneur

00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:43,379
although it's not the same thing at all

00:28:39,989 --> 00:28:45,330
and there are at least three or four

00:28:43,379 --> 00:28:47,279
collectives that I'm aware of within the

00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,929
Drupal space one being montreal-based

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:52,049
one being san francisco-based I want my

00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:53,639
money the company names and then where

00:28:52,049 --> 00:28:55,289
are you based out of we are agile

00:28:53,639 --> 00:28:57,539
collective based in Oxford England yeah

00:28:55,289 --> 00:28:59,190
and just a quick plug yeah absolutely

00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:01,980
I'm doing a talk about worker ownership

00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:06,350
and growth and sustainability at 2:00

00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,350
p.m. on Thursday yep so it'd be great to

00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:11,820
and then the other model which I didn't

00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:14,460
include in here is one where it is sort

00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:16,109
of owner operated but it is profit

00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:20,039
sharing for the employees and so the

00:29:16,109 --> 00:29:21,570
employees get to veto what clients come

00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:23,309
in and also how they're going to spend

00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:24,480
their money in terms of whether or not

00:29:23,309 --> 00:29:25,619
they're going to go to a conference what

00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,840
they're gonna do with it or they just

00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:29,460
want the bonus at the end of the year so

00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,899
there's they're like this is a very very

00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,119
limited view and yes there are

00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:34,379
definitely other ways of indeed it's

00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:37,169
just this is these the ones that I've

00:29:34,379 --> 00:29:42,330
worked in yeah yeah absolutely

00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:44,879
I think I might be getting the big hook

00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:46,559
now Amanda's not showing up I'm gonna

00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:49,379
keep waiting for Amanda to show up me

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:50,789
like get off the stage you hear yeah

00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:52,330
perfect there's my big hook alright

00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:57,460
