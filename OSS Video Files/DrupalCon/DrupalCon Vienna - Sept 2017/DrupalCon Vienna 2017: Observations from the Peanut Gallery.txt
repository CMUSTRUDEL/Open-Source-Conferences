Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	Please give us a detailed overview of your session and why attendees will be excited to hear about it. Â 

As the CEO of Acquia for the past almost nine years, I have developed a number of perspectives on the community, market opportunity and the success criteria required for the future. I will share the good, bad and ugly of my journey, including thoughts on the community to which I offered unrequited love in the early days that evolved into a strong mutual respect. I'll reveal little known facts about my personal struggles as community advocate and share lessons learned on building Acquia. Attendees should come away with smiles on their faces and an understanding of the human side of the company that is so often misunderstood.

Ensure that you let us know:

	00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:07,290
some familiar faces nice to see we're

00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,059
gonna probably make this a little

00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,290
participatory I wasn't quite sure what

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,420
the stage was of me like I had this

00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,340
vision of being able to even sit on the

00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,400
side of the stage but I don't think

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:19,980
that's going to work for those of you

00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,310
who don't know me Tom Erikson

00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:25,289
I'm a how does this supposed to go it's

00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:27,810
like I'm a droop list I've been a drip

00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,869
list for 10 years and I haven't used

00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:32,880
WordPress or Squarespace or Joomla for

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,969
that period of time something like that

00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,440
isn't the how the confession goes but

00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:41,520
let's let's try to have a little bit of

00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:45,649
fun here most of you if you don't know

00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,360
me I have a very lofty title

00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:51,930
I've been Drita's partner at aqua for

00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,670
really since aqua got started helped to

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,649
start the company as a board member and

00:00:53,670 --> 00:01:00,750
became the CEO a little bit later and

00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:03,780
there's I'm gonna use today to talk a

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:08,340
little bit about some of the

00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,950
observations I've made in that time as a

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,460
CEO so I've got a little bit of an

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:17,540
agenda we're gonna vary from that and

00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:22,530
we're gonna have a few questions as well

00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:26,729
just a couple of things about me I'm you

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:29,220
know I am actually kind of a technical

00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:35,100
person I graduated with an engineering

00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:36,840
degree and I was a programmer in 1974 we

00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,700
didn't call them software engineers and

00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,400
the technical degree I have was actually

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,930
an engineer and back then anybody wanted

00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,399
to call them an engineer who didn't have

00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,649
an engineering degree was looked down on

00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,890
because you weren't really an engineer

00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:51,689
you know you were something else so I

00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,780
certainly started my life in a very

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,490
technical way and somewhere along the

00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,860
lines got involved in business and found

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,560
out that other people were better at the

00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:03,329
technical things than I was and so I

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,170
better get out of the way and let them

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,910
do what they do better than me the last

00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,800
10 years have been really interesting

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,510
yeah if you if you don't want to hear

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,880
from a non-technical guy probably not a

00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,650
good

00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:20,560
place to be but it been a very

00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:23,920
interesting time as far as Drupal cons

00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,140
and Drupal community there have been

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,270
times has been very frustrating

00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:31,360
certainly very times as well that it's

00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:34,860
been very humbling it's an amazing thing

00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,080
what the Drupal community is it is I I

00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,450
every time I meet someone new and I talk

00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,400
about Drupal I talk about how amazing

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:44,830
the community is that there's million

00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,680
plus members with tens of thousands of

00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:50,110
developers get together and create

00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,520
something that's totally awesome and I

00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,520
really believe that in the bottom of my

00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,910
heart I've never lost my enthusiasm and

00:02:54,520 --> 00:03:02,530
my passion and as I step down at aqueous

00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:04,330
the CEO I'm planning to spend some more

00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,520
time even on the board of the company

00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:10,990
and really trying to contribute back in

00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:12,580
in ways that I can going forward so this

00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,990
is a business track of Drupal and I'm

00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,600
gonna ask just a couple of questions

00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:18,400
about that I'm gonna deviate from what I

00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,600
was asked to do which is help people

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,580
understand how to build better

00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,650
businesses in Drupal and I'm actually

00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:27,970
going to talk a little bit to you as

00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:30,130
opposed to sort of do that coaching role

00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:32,740
I'm happy to do the coaching role and

00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:36,280
I've attended many many business summits

00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,810
and CXO days and other things where I've

00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,430
had the chance to play that role and

00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,960
I've enjoyed it a lot

00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:44,350
but that's not what's going to happen

00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,910
today so first I want to just start out

00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:47,860
asking a bit about you the first thing

00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:49,990
is are any of you

00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:55,270
I assume raise your hands how many of

00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:58,510
you are non-technical okay you only

00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:01,000
somewhat qualify yeah because you also

00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:02,920
have business responsibilities so of

00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,840
those raise your hands again the people

00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,790
had their hands raised how many of you

00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,940
everybody that was non-technical how

00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,470
many of you are responsible for business

00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:13,300
leave your hands up like running an

00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:16,600
agency or something like that so good

00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:20,790
number of you how many of you are

00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:23,140
technical yeah okay so why did you come

00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:25,550
you know it's interesting why did you

00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,949
come up in the back

00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,900
get a different perspective right okay

00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:32,569
well good I'm glad and hopefully you'll

00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,400
get a different perspective here I do

00:04:32,569 --> 00:04:37,310
want to say that I I really do have an

00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,349
appreciation for everything that's that

00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:42,199
is technical I realize the world does

00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:43,580
revolve around that we a taqueria about

00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,470
two years ago decided we're going to

00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,720
make all of our we're gonna make a much

00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:50,000
bigger focus on marketing to developers

00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,729
and telling the story because developers

00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,310
are making a lot of decisions I think at

00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:57,199
the same time if you take a look at a

00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,690
lot of businesses with the proliferation

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,759
of marketing technologies what we're

00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:04,370
seeing happen is that dollars are

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:09,020
shifting from technical areas in

00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:11,840
businesses like IT departments and CIOs

00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:13,849
to marketing departments and the

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,759
decision-making for which tools they're

00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:18,860
gonna use and how they're going to

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,289
deploy that is shifting and there are

00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,210
people who believe that in the future

00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:26,680
the marketing budgets around technology

00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:29,659
will be bigger than the IT budgets for

00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,479
for those businesses and in some

00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:35,240
businesses like consumer technologies

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,190
that might indeed be the case and so

00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:40,639
there's a big message here that replace

00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:43,580
to to that and I think it's important

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,400
that we we get that down so my next

00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:48,710
question and then I'll get into so many

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,310
things is how many of you think that

00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:56,529
Drupal is the very best CMS content

00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:56,529
management system on the market today

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:04,900
all right I'm not seeing some hands here

00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,900
so help me understand what is missing

00:06:05,409 --> 00:06:10,599
either yeah you or somebody else right

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,599
next to you

00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,350
yep it is

00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:26,939
mm-hmm

00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:52,539
and what was that yes a wordpress great

00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:54,639
yeah no we're gonna talk a lot about

00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:56,139
names today and there won't be bad

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,159
things we're gonna talk about marketing

00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:58,449
and that won't be a bad thing or in

00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:59,620
talking about WordPress or in talking

00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:01,509
about Squarespace we're going to talk

00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:07,349
about Adobe this is gonna get it all on

00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:11,830
here today so bring it all out pardon me

00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:13,270
Liferay also yeah sure yeah yeah so it's

00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,909
a really good point depends on the use

00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:20,169
case as far as the best thing you know

00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:21,340
what is the best thing and that's that's

00:07:20,169 --> 00:07:22,539
a really good point anybody else have

00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:33,780
another perspective they want to share

00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:33,780
before I get stuck in yeah right yes

00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:50,830
yes right right so depends on the

00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,180
investment that deals with some of the

00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:55,210
things Drees talked about this morning

00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,730
for those of you that saw the you know

00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:00,280
his keynote talked about ambitious

00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:05,680
websites so Drupal very good for that

00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:10,020
yes yes depends on the support of the

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:10,020
technology as well yeah yep

00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:19,090
all great points so what I want to do

00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:21,640
though now then is take that and take

00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:24,970
these thoughts and lessons because as we

00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:27,160
think about those questions it depends

00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:30,220
you then have to think about okay how do

00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,950
we best make Drupal alright that's

00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:35,050
called positioning in marketing context

00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:37,120
how do you take what Drupal strengths

00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:39,940
are and how do you position it in the

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,710
market so that the right people know

00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,479
about it at the right time and you have

00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:47,040
a good chance of winning that client as

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:49,690
opposed to position it incorrectly and

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,360
trying to provide it to people who won't

00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:55,540
see the benefits of the product and that

00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:57,820
is all about this marketing thing that

00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:00,970
we'll talk a little bit about a little

00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:03,610
bit about more about me because it's fun

00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:05,920
to talk about yourself but just to give

00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:10,030
yourself some knowledge on my technical

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,880
chops in 1981 I was the first person to

00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:14,740
put a computer on an offshore platform

00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,420
it was in Western Australia and it was a

00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,300
very big computer the size of this stage

00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,460
almost and we used it for project

00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,100
planning on building this billion dollar

00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:27,370
at the time that was a lot of money

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:29,770
maybe it still is a lot of money but in

00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:32,860
1981 a billion dollars was he's a lot

00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:35,350
more today and we used it for planning

00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,570
to try and save time and money on that

00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:39,730
platform and I was the tech guy

00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:44,130
responsible for that not the business

00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:46,000
person so when I talk about things that

00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,070
have a technical bias

00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,819
I want everybody appreciate the fact

00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,799
that I

00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:52,929
talk about someone who has it in my

00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:55,509
heart and in my soul I still build

00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:59,439
computers today one of our clients a

00:09:55,509 --> 00:10:02,829
Drupal user very proud CMO of AMD who

00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:03,970
introduced a new microprocessor a couple

00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:06,789
of few months ago

00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:08,079
sent me a kit that I could build my own

00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:12,639
computer again because this is what I

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:15,339
like to do and I do that but at the same

00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:18,129
time I have to admit I've never

00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:23,079
committed a single line of code for

00:10:18,129 --> 00:10:28,059
Drupal not one not any Yenta zilch zero

00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:30,519
nada and I thought about it and and well

00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:33,819
I just didn't get it done at the same

00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:35,739
time what the heck have I been doing for

00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:38,739
10 years and and I like to think about

00:10:35,739 --> 00:10:40,389
the fact that I wasn't a parasite just

00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:41,949
leveraging and living off of all the

00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:45,639
Drupal community efforts that we were

00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:47,199
doing things also in contributing so you

00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:48,970
know we raised a lot of money at Acquia

00:10:47,199 --> 00:10:52,689
and we used that money to fund

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:56,139
development to to pay developers to pay

00:10:52,689 --> 00:11:00,939
marketers and others to do things with

00:10:56,139 --> 00:11:02,409
Drupal and we've also been selling the

00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:06,249
heck out of Drupal to anybody that will

00:11:02,409 --> 00:11:09,249
listen so hundreds of thousands of miles

00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:13,109
of travel for me personally thousands of

00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:15,129
meetings dozens of presentations and

00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:17,679
millions of dollars spent marketing

00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:20,739
Drupal just to give you some idea we

00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:22,419
spend for a typical analyst on any given

00:11:20,739 --> 00:11:24,729
year almost a quarter of a million

00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:28,239
dollars to convince them that Drupal is

00:11:24,729 --> 00:11:30,819
a worthwhile solution and just lest you

00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:34,089
think that that's an easy job to do when

00:11:30,819 --> 00:11:37,619
we started Gartner who is not just a an

00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:40,209
enterprise analyst Gartner is also

00:11:37,619 --> 00:11:42,220
somebody that universities listened to

00:11:40,209 --> 00:11:44,829
in nonprofits you know they're the

00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,619
people say what's good in the CMS world

00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:51,039
and if Drupal wasn't in appropriate

00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:52,659
place in that chart it would Lou it

00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:55,269
would not be considered for a lot of

00:11:52,659 --> 00:11:57,309
decisions and when we started talking to

00:11:55,269 --> 00:12:00,730
Gartner they said well what's the

00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:02,590
revenue that you get from Drupal and we

00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:04,690
told them it was zero

00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:07,710
zero today it's going to be zero

00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:10,750
tomorrow and it'd be zero in five years

00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:13,180
but we have a lot of clients and these

00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,970
are big organizations that matter and

00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:18,430
they said well I'm afraid our criteria

00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:22,360
on the vertical access is revenue that's

00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:25,750
a primary driver of execution and what

00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,880
did we say to them I got very furious at

00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,560
a table pounded the table this is that

00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,960
DrupalCon Munich just in case you want

00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:34,870
to know when it happened and I said you

00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:37,930
need to change your criteria because you

00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:40,150
guys are out of touch the world is going

00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:42,370
open-source and all you have to do is

00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:44,610
seem you'll soft or mongodb you filed

00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:47,020
last week for public offering or

00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:51,310
obviously Red Hat or other players you

00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:53,380
can see this is all happening so lo and

00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,330
behold eventually Gartner changed their

00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,730
criteria after we cancelled our

00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:59,290
subscription with them after we did some

00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,690
things and then we came back to the fold

00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,460
but that takes a lot of work it takes a

00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:06,640
lot of effort and it takes a lot of

00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:12,370
people who aren't developers and so the

00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:13,630
message I have is this world takes a lot

00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:16,930
of work to make the whole Drupal

00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:19,600
ecosystem work marketers are one it also

00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:21,820
takes designers it takes people that do

00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,700
videos it takes people that organize

00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:27,070
conferences and I think it's time that

00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,470
the Drupal community really start to

00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:31,000
accept the fact that the community has

00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:34,450
to include and embrace all of those

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:37,089
people it's a concept I call inclusion

00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:39,339
and inclusion has been in the area of

00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:41,589
discussion in the Drupal community this

00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:43,210
is something I call role inclusion and I

00:13:41,589 --> 00:13:45,160
think the future the Drupal community is

00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:46,990
gonna be very much based around the

00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:50,050
ability for that for this community for

00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:52,530
our community to include others and I'll

00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:55,060
walk through some of that later today

00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:59,230
but just to give you a little bit of a

00:13:55,060 --> 00:14:01,930
briefing on sorry this is I'm talking

00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:05,320
too much and not showing enough a little

00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:09,160
bit of a briefing on how well some of

00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,780
this stuff works this is a slide that

00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,910
we're gonna be able to share sorry a

00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,930
video share with everybody and give back

00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:15,910
to the Drupal community

00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:17,770
so an example of giving back and just

00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:22,810
listen to this and then we'll see how

00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:24,190
you feel after this video think for a

00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:30,090
moment ever the brands and companies

00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:30,090
shaped by Drupal the power brands

00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:40,040
the makers

00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,950
the institutions

00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,950
[Music]

00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:56,980
the cultural icons that unite us

00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,650
the ones that make us sing

00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:07,130
carry us away

00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,380
[Music]

00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:15,490
the agile

00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,490
[Music]

00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,740
the resilient

00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,390
and the ones who support them

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,269
the developers the millions across the

00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:36,170
globe

00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:42,079
the marketers the frontline behind the

00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:45,879
glass the road warriors the people out

00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,879
in the wild fighting every day

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:53,190
the agency's the Masters of strategy and

00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:55,480
emotion

00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:59,740
so what do all these people have in

00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:02,260
common the digital platform that powers

00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:07,830
some of the most exciting experiences on

00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:07,830
the web Drupal

00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:19,970
do you guys think it's nice huh you know

00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:24,230
I need some more a little bit it's not

00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:26,180
it's not perfect and we have a chance to

00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:28,790
do that but it's something that we want

00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,589
to be able to to share and and give back

00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:32,920
and it really comes back this idea that

00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:37,430
the Drupal ecosystem is more than code

00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:41,690
and it's time that you know I think we

00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:44,089
start to recognize that and after ten

00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:46,130
years here the reason I titled this

00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:48,380
presentation observations from the

00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,389
peanut gallery not sure that translates

00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:51,920
into all languages but the peanut

00:16:50,389 --> 00:16:56,240
gallery is where the people sit that

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,740
don't matter and I will admit that I've

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,190
sat through many of Drupal community

00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:03,829
sessions and areas and I felt like the

00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,510
person that doesn't matter even though

00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:08,660
we're contributing back in many

00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:10,459
different ways and I think it's time

00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,770
that we take a look at that and say hey

00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:16,339
we're all in this together and whether

00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:18,799
you're a marketer or a designer a you

00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:20,319
know technical support person back to

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:23,959
the point that was brought up earlier

00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:27,799
we're all building a amazing community

00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:29,780
that does very very special things you

00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:31,070
know we need to put more value into the

00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:33,410
efforts of these designers the

00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:36,049
facilitators the event organizers the

00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:39,620
volunteers the case study and the

00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:41,179
creative agencies to create this the

00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:43,610
world just doesn't know about how

00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:46,040
powerful Drupal is Driss often goes

00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:48,410
places and we'll ask you know how many

00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,809
of you know of Drupal and the number

00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:52,880
still is relatively small compared to

00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:54,799
what it needs to be and the only way

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,049
we're gonna get that change the only way

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,870
we're gonna get that done is by valuing

00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:03,950
what marketers do and not using it you

00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:06,230
know as dirty word grease himself and

00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:07,960
thank you for joining us trace has been

00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:11,000
bringing this issue up in different ways

00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:12,799
he wrote about the contributions and

00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,660
we've got this nice credit system and

00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,360
Drupal that talks and can walk through

00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,919
all the credits you give but what about

00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,659
the contributions of these non-technical

00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:21,260
folks and I really want to take this

00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:23,270
opportunity

00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:26,690
to challenge us and the community think

00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:30,080
about how to measure those credits one

00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:31,669
of the ideas I have here today is hey

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,590
why can't we give credits to case

00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:35,630
studies that are created and case

00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:39,190
studies that are submitted and and

00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:40,370
announced that and say hey you know and

00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:44,000
Vica

00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:46,309
last quarter did or last year did 30

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,880
case studies on Drupal including Arsenal

00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:52,570
would that be cool and and that gives

00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:55,400
credit to in Vica in certain ways and

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:57,169
likewise and on and on and there's other

00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,929
ways to give credit I'll give you

00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:02,240
another example do any of you remember

00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:06,650
the name of the person who built views

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,630
and enjoyment originally no miles almost

00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:10,250
everybody knows that do any of you

00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:14,720
remember the name of the individual who

00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:17,179
redesigned it in 2004 sorry for Drupal 7

00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,120
and made it substantially easier and

00:19:17,179 --> 00:19:24,669
made it so it could actually be used in

00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:28,610
a big way by a larger number of people

00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:30,549
no a designer was kevin O'Leary working

00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:33,410
with Driss did a fantastic job

00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:36,590
completely took worked with all but

00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:38,360
completely took it and redesigned it so

00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:40,460
that was much easier use and that's the

00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:44,960
kind of celebration that I think we have

00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:47,030
to have in in this world so I've asked

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,900
Rhys about why the credit system is only

00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:53,000
for code contributors and the answer you

00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,280
heard this morning but I'm challenging

00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,410
that statement and I'm I really want the

00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,780
team to start to go out and say how can

00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:01,820
we measure things that are not code

00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:03,980
contributions how can we embrace those

00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,660
folks how can we bring them into the

00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:08,090
fold and I'm going to talk a little bit

00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:09,830
more about that now I may be getting a

00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,840
little bit extreme in my remarks here

00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:14,660
but I'm you know hopefully at the point

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,400
of what I'm trying to make and the video

00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:20,179
showed us that the promotional efforts

00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:22,190
of marketers are really important and

00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:24,440
we've had a chance to introduce people

00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:25,190
to Drupal that otherwise would would not

00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,770
be there

00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,210
I know marketing is a word a dirty word

00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:31,100
to most developers and we've established

00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:34,280
that very few people here in this room

00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,830
are developers so what's not happening

00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,679
to

00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:39,120
is that words not getting out to them

00:20:36,679 --> 00:20:43,740
it's a little bit like the debate I have

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,450
with diversity in tech in general and I

00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:48,840
started a group at aqueous called women

00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:50,880
at Acquia and then the group proceeded

00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:52,559
to then decide that they would only have

00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,419
the discussions amongst themselves and

00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,190
they never wanted to share any of their

00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:58,649
conclusions or any of their observations

00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:01,080
or any recommendations with the rest of

00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:03,840
the organization and my question then

00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:05,640
was how do you improve if you don't

00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,250
share if you don't communicate if you

00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:10,440
don't you know at least make requests

00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:14,580
and demands and ask for change and

00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:15,840
that's that same kind of effort that

00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,309
needs to happen here in the Drupal

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,740
community where people need to say yeah

00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:21,779
hey at Drupal con I want to see

00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:23,730
marketers here I want them to be part of

00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:26,580
it I want to see more designers I want

00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:30,080
to celebrate what they do how do you get

00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:34,789
that diversity into this community

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:37,409
hey marketing can be ugly thing I did a

00:21:34,789 --> 00:21:40,080
years ago I did a sales training

00:21:37,409 --> 00:21:42,000
marketing and sales with a tech guy and

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,590
he got up and he was doing the

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,019
role-playing we were doing roleplay one

00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:47,940
point you you role played the buyer in

00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:49,679
one point you role played the seller and

00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,649
he got up when his role-playing in the

00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,510
cellar and boy he just he started

00:21:52,649 --> 00:21:56,460
hammering the other individual and

00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:58,649
saying hey you gotta get this it's the

00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:02,519
best thing around it's not like anything

00:21:58,649 --> 00:22:05,100
else and I said whoa Andreas hold on he

00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:09,059
was English of obviously from German

00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:11,070
descent and and I said Andreas what what

00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:14,340
makes you think that that's what a

00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:17,340
salesperson is and he said well last

00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:19,289
weekend I went to you know I forget the

00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:21,929
name of the high street store that sells

00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:23,850
appliances in the UK he said and that's

00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:26,610
what this sells guy was like and I said

00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:28,320
of course that's what you think a

00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:32,070
salesperson is like and sales people can

00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:35,190
be pushy you know and the word spam you

00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:38,070
know was invented you know 1993 let's

00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:41,010
say and it wasn't invented by a marketer

00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:42,840
for sure so there are lots of things

00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:44,669
that aren't nice about sales and lots of

00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,799
things that aren't nice about marketing

00:22:44,669 --> 00:22:47,920
but we need promotion and we have to

00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:51,940
embrace them now

00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:55,750
just as potential users but also as our

00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:57,700
brethren and I do want to say that part

00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,200
of this certainly been recognized by a

00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,910
Drupal community and you'll see some

00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,030
names up here and I'm sorry I haven't

00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:08,320
got Mirim up here but a big part of that

00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:12,100
as well you know and I purposely did not

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:14,110
include and that you'll understand why

00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,540
in a second I did not include the great

00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:17,350
Drupal agencies that are around that are

00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,840
doing this as well

00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:21,790
so agencies have definitely been a

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,550
really big part of promoting Drupal

00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:26,980
along the way but note that none of

00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:28,360
these agencies are sponsors and I'm not

00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:31,060
sure any of these people are here today

00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:34,210
at Drupal con and we have to ask

00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:37,210
ourselves why not yet they are out there

00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:38,980
selling and marketing Drupal so they're

00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:40,360
not full members of the community and

00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:43,930
there's reasons why they don't feel like

00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:45,430
they need to be and part of it is and I

00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:47,950
would propose this is that they don't

00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:50,650
see the people at a Drupal con that they

00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:52,510
expect to be here and need to be here in

00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:54,160
order for them to say yeah I'm gonna

00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:56,530
step up and be a better member of the

00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:59,260
Drupal community and that's another call

00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:01,930
to arms to say why do we have to think

00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:07,120
about how we can change and what we need

00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:08,800
to do to be more inclusive I will add

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,800
that even though these success stories

00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,690
are there they're not at scale for every

00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:15,640
Drupal recommendation that's made today

00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:18,160
I estimate there's another five that are

00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:22,690
made for a competitor so there's got to

00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:24,850
be work that we have to do it's not easy

00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:27,760
work but it's work that has to be done

00:24:24,850 --> 00:24:30,970
through spending money and I hate to say

00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:33,340
this but it's not something normal that

00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:35,230
a normal agency who works off of the

00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,750
kind of cash flow that it agency works

00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:39,760
off of can spend large sums of money to

00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:42,460
do and this is perhaps the most

00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:47,050
controversial thing I'll say in my talk

00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:49,000
today is so while agencies can't afford

00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:51,820
to do it there are other companies that

00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,640
do have products and I'm gonna use words

00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:56,800
some names and you know if you're from

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:59,260
these companies feel free to stand up

00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,790
and say I disagree I love a debate as

00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:04,630
three snows

00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:06,700
and but you know if you take a look at

00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:09,160
what our brethren from Pantheon do they

00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:11,890
say they'll tell you if you haven't

00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:13,720
decided on Drupal don't talk to us when

00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:15,160
you decide come and talk to us and oh by

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:19,300
the way if you use WordPress as well

00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:21,520
that's ok too if we're gonna be a Drupal

00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:25,930
community we've got to find a way to put

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:28,980
money behind the efforts and it can't

00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:31,480
just be aqueous or if it is just aa quia

00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:34,660
we need the community to stand up and

00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,760
say hey you know we're gonna trust

00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,850
aqueon some of this stuff in a way that

00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:42,640
the community doesn't trust aqueon today

00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:46,210
so that is one of my most important

00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:49,150
observations in my time at Acquia it

00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:50,620
feels crappy to be honest with you to

00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:53,290
feel like we're spending all this money

00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:55,840
and we're alone in this and then not

00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:57,820
getting any respect in the words of the

00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,640
great Rodney Dangerfield of any of you

00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:02,430
remember him did a great movie called

00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,600
back to school and buddy remember that

00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:06,640
happened to be filmed at my alma mater

00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,400
University of Wisconsin so I can really

00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:12,130
identify with Rodney Dangerfield and not

00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:13,300
getting in respect so and now we're

00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:15,040
being threatened by some new

00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,650
fast-growing system's Driss put up today

00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,270
a slide that said the headless systems

00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:22,930
are growing at five hundred percent a

00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:24,940
year five hundred percent a year these

00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:26,200
organizations are spending money to do

00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:28,290
marketing because they own their

00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:32,230
technology so Drupal is competing

00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:33,580
against organizations proprietary

00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:36,220
organizations spending money because

00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:37,990
they get the revenue from them and I

00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,270
would encourage the community to think

00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:42,690
about new ways to collaborate and

00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:45,850
cooperate for the benefit of everybody

00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:49,000
which still allows more Drupal marketing

00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:51,550
to happen and I've been picking on

00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,740
marketers a lot and I've been talking

00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:56,230
about it you know we have a lot of

00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:59,560
competitors Adobe site core the high-end

00:26:56,230 --> 00:27:01,330
WordPress Wix Weebly at the low end and

00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:04,810
these are the companies spending

00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:06,880
millions and they're not immune either

00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:10,810
WordPress is definitely being attacked

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:12,490
if you haven't noticed by medium by

00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:14,260
Squarespace and they're feeling the

00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:18,130
effects of what's happening to them

00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:20,710
on their core platforms so the open

00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:22,690
source in general has some challenges to

00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:25,450
maintain a business model to be honest

00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:29,160
with you at the same time I have this

00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:33,220
theory that I believe in which is that

00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:35,650
the Drupal community is aging and the

00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:37,690
great contributors who are in their 20s

00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:40,390
and had lots of time and free time as

00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:42,340
they started their agencies now are in

00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:45,010
their 30s or 40s and have families with

00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,660
kids and mortgages and stuff that cause

00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:48,940
them to do other things in their spare

00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:52,210
time other than contribute to Drupal and

00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:54,970
this is another big challenge that has

00:27:52,210 --> 00:27:56,710
to be addressed now some of that can be

00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:58,750
done through changing technology and

00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,240
getting new and exciting technologies

00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:03,160
like Greece talked about earlier today

00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,110
into Drupal you know including

00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:08,350
javascript in ways that javascript can

00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:10,240
be included you know and continuing to

00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:12,429
add those things that the 20-somethings

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,429
want to work on and improving Drupal in

00:28:12,429 --> 00:28:18,460
that way but part of it also is about

00:28:15,429 --> 00:28:20,620
making Drupal cool and quite frankly

00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:22,510
when I talked to customers out in the

00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:25,480
market many of them still think of

00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:29,710
Drupal is Drupal 5 prospects I mean and

00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:32,230
that also has to change Drupal has had a

00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:36,280
policy of breaking api's to stay

00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:38,650
relevant and to stay current so the

00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:41,110
philosophy of staying up to speed is

00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:42,940
there but unfortunately the market isn't

00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:45,549
necessarily following that philosophy

00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:48,100
and not getting the message so there's

00:28:45,549 --> 00:28:50,470
lots of work to do now we have an

00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:54,960
opportunity headless Drupal is in my

00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:59,020
opinion the ultimate developers product

00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,460
it really is and Drupal has shown that

00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:03,820
we can dominate the space when

00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:05,410
developers are there but what can we do

00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,210
about these other people we have to care

00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:08,980
about what about content authors they

00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:16,809
need something as easy as WordPress or

00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:19,600
Squarespace we also need to know sorry

00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:22,510
lost my train of thought there Drupal

00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:26,380
excels on the back end we know that but

00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:27,760
living in the UI day in and day out is a

00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:30,310
world of users a world

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,050
users that we consistently lose to as

00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:34,000
Acquia one of the things we've had to do

00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:36,520
a talk Weah probably about four or five

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,010
years ago the first two three years of

00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,480
our four years of our life we were able

00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,710
to go into the drupal community and say

00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,920
hey we've got something better than

00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:46,450
Rackspace let's say and and come and

00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,880
talk to us about how we can make your

00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:51,250
life easier by scaling in ways that you

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,410
can scale before that's another story

00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:55,090
and I can talk about that but the last

00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:58,900
four or five years we've had to spend a

00:29:55,090 --> 00:30:00,670
lot of money selling Drupal we actually

00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,230
go through two sales cycles at aquitine

00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:05,110
the first sales cycle is selling the

00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:07,540
client on Drupal and then we have to

00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:09,220
sell them on Acquia and believe it or

00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:11,950
not it happens a lot of times we sell

00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:13,900
someone on Drupal and we never sign them

00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,940
up as a customer that's not good

00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,680
business now all of you know that but

00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:20,080
that does happen and that's a challenge

00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:22,780
we as Acquia have to face and have to

00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:26,050
fix but at the same time it's important

00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:29,140
to understand we understand what it

00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:31,030
means to sell Drupal and we lose to site

00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,770
core more often than I care to simply

00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:36,250
because the content author somewhere

00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:39,430
said it's too hard it's too ugly I can't

00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:40,870
do this and that has to change and the

00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:43,240
Drupal community has to help with that

00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:46,420
change so we have to think not only

00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,940
about marketing but marketers as a

00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,470
client as a customer Driss talked about

00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,700
this a little bit today in terms of some

00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:54,730
of the modules like the media module

00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:57,310
getting more tools for marketers that

00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:59,860
they expect we can't continue to lose

00:30:57,310 --> 00:31:02,800
business these players unless we make

00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:04,210
Drupal easier to use so it's really time

00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,190
for the Drupal committee to understand

00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:08,230
embrace marketers from both sides of the

00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:11,530
equation as brethren in the community

00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:15,340
and as potential customers it's time for

00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:17,740
Drupal to become inclusive now I change

00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:19,600
the word a little bit I've been going on

00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:21,790
about marketers but they're not the only

00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,590
key stakeholders for Drupal and I use

00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:26,110
this term practitioners to talk about it

00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:28,450
and drupal's really big competitive

00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:29,620
advantage in the market is that it can

00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:32,860
work in lots of different applications

00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:35,200
and this is something most people don't

00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:37,300
understand it doesn't have to just work

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,340
for dot-coms and marketing things it

00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:41,230
works well for commerce it works well

00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:43,900
for service applications

00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:46,360
and if you are a unique you know if

00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:48,309
you're a brand person like Hermes has

00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:50,740
started to launch their sites on Drupal

00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:52,990
and you want to have a great brand like

00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:55,210
Hermes and a story to be told and you

00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:56,500
don't want to be sold by told by Amazon

00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:59,530
or somebody else where you just

00:31:56,500 --> 00:32:01,240
commoditized you can use Drupal and you

00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:04,660
will love it I'm sure of that

00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:08,559
but who makes that decision that's a

00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:11,080
marketer right but if you're also a

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:13,690
person at Cisco Systems and you're

00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:15,820
building a new service portal for your

00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:19,030
customers to come in and rather than

00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:19,990
call up and use a help desk you're going

00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,340
to introduce them to a digital

00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:23,950
experience you're going to build that

00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:25,929
community and you do build it on Drupal

00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:27,940
we're not talking to a marketer we're

00:32:25,929 --> 00:32:29,559
talking to a service line leader that's

00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:32,140
a practitioner someone else but it's a

00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:34,750
business person not the IT group and so

00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:36,130
when we talk about marketers we probably

00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:38,380
should be talking about practitioners

00:32:36,130 --> 00:32:40,330
because Drupal has unique ability to

00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:42,160
address not only markers but everybody

00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:45,790
else and Gartner will tell you that

00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:47,530
Adobe is biggest biggest criticism and

00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:49,570
biggest hole is that it only thinks

00:32:47,530 --> 00:32:53,860
about marketers and so we have to also

00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:56,470
think beyond marketers I'm gonna just

00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:58,570
give you a little bit of a rant rant and

00:32:56,470 --> 00:33:01,830
just check on my time here a little bit

00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:04,690
of a rant before I start to wind up and

00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:08,760
leave some time for questions back in

00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:12,040
2010 I went to various members of the

00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:14,380
Drupal Association board Greece was one

00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:17,230
of them and I said hey we've got to find

00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:21,640
a way to include these practitioners in

00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:25,240
Drupal con and we got an enthusiastic

00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:28,330
yes we do and Jacob you might remember

00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:31,200
this so and then we got an answer which

00:33:28,330 --> 00:33:35,160
was but we know how to do it better and

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:37,510
we said okay let's give that a shot and

00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:39,370
there were business days that were

00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:40,510
created there were business different

00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:42,850
kinds of business tracks that were

00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:45,580
created and here we are some seven years

00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:47,440
later almost or more than and I would

00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,940
say we haven't really gotten very far

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,159
all you have to do is look around the

00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:54,040
room or ask yourselves how many

00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:56,290
practitioners do you see at Drupal con

00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:57,730
and DrupalCon europe is a really good

00:33:56,290 --> 00:34:00,340
example of that because there are very

00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:02,740
few here there are more interpoc on

00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:04,930
north america for some reason and i will

00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:07,420
say that one of the reasons i believe is

00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:09,190
that we attic we achieved quotas to our

00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:12,010
sales people to try and get people here

00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:13,780
and this year is a little bit different

00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:16,149
because the timing of DrupalCon this

00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:18,520
year is also the time at the end of our

00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:20,110
quarter and our sales people have to be

00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:22,960
hitting their quotas and their targets

00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:24,580
it's just the nature of the game so it's

00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,020
another little pet peeve is that it's

00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:27,280
hard for us to get our clients here

00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:29,560
because we need to have our salespeople

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,490
here and our salespeople can't be here

00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:35,950
this week so it's a kind of a catch-22

00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:38,260
so that's a little bit of a rant about

00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:40,450
the timing of things like DrupalCon that

00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,159
we need to start thinking about at least

00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:45,850
from an aqueous perspective i know not

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:48,310
everybody has that same criteria but

00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:50,950
back to this notion of having more

00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:53,679
involvement by practitioners seven years

00:34:50,950 --> 00:34:55,810
later we really haven't been successful

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,660
at that and here we are at a position

00:34:55,810 --> 00:35:01,720
where Drupal con Europe is fading and

00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:03,670
right now you heard today you know there

00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,280
is no plan for Drupal con Europe going

00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:08,590
forward there is no plan because it's

00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,390
financially not viable there weren't

00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:12,490
enough sponsors we weren't able to get

00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:15,010
those sponsors and back to the point I

00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:16,240
made earlier the sponsors aren't here

00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:18,970
because the right people aren't here for

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:21,610
the sponsors to talk to and if we want

00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:24,310
Drupal con to succeed in Europe and I

00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:25,420
would put forward even in North America

00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:30,180
we have to think about this differently

00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:30,180
as a community to make something happen

00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:38,800
so what can we do for starters let's

00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:40,090
start being inclusive you know maybe

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,830
that's not the right way we want to

00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:44,110
describe it I like to use it just

00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:46,390
because it's a little provocative but

00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:48,160
role inclusivity and thinking about how

00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:50,320
do we embrace the other people that

00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,840
matter I know that's hard for developers

00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:55,420
so this group and the group of our peers

00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:57,040
have to really lead that charge we have

00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:59,350
to help our developers understand why

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,840
that's important and that may be sharing

00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:04,510
a conference with them isn't such a bad

00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:06,070
thing hey we do this with our rock we

00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,880
engage we created it four years ago

00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:09,440
because we we did finally give

00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,299
that we be able to do something in

00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:15,740
conjunction with the Drupal Association

00:36:11,299 --> 00:36:19,009
and we have technical tracks at engage

00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:20,990
and yes we talk a lot about aqueous but

00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:22,700
the primary thing we talk about back to

00:36:20,990 --> 00:36:26,029
what I talked about earlier is Drupal

00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:28,579
remember aqua without Drupal doesn't

00:36:26,029 --> 00:36:30,559
exist and so we have to talk about how

00:36:28,579 --> 00:36:33,710
great Drupal is it's the core of what we

00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:35,809
are and I'm not saying you know do

00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:40,460
exactly what we do but let's have a

00:36:35,809 --> 00:36:42,319
conversation about what can be done and

00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:45,559
there are some easy things back to my

00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:47,990
proposal earlier let's start finding

00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:50,180
better ways to get case studies done and

00:36:47,990 --> 00:36:52,670
find a place to put them because quite

00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:55,970
frankly drupal.org is an embarrassment

00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:57,980
if you're not a developer if I'm a

00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:59,750
marketer and I go to drupal.org I think

00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:03,559
I'm not going to use this product look

00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:04,630
at how ugly it is and we've got to do

00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:06,859
something about that

00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:09,559
aqueous spent some money to try and

00:37:06,859 --> 00:37:11,150
build Drupal calm but even we don't have

00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:13,549
enough money to do everything we want to

00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:14,630
do and we haven't got it quite as far as

00:37:13,549 --> 00:37:19,069
long as we wanted to

00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:21,349
in fact in as a consequence we've still

00:37:19,069 --> 00:37:23,420
been running our own aqua comm on Drupal

00:37:21,349 --> 00:37:25,970
6 because we spent the money on Drupal

00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:28,190
comm now we're in the process of change

00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:31,910
you know for to get aqua comm on Drupal

00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:33,589
8 but it just gives you some idea there

00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:36,200
has to be a different approach here if

00:37:33,589 --> 00:37:39,019
we want marketers to really be excited

00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,730
by what Drupal does and include your

00:37:39,019 --> 00:37:43,099
customers find a way bring your

00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:45,559
customers together let's really get

00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:47,960
customers to be a celebration of what

00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:49,880
happens in the Drupal community as

00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,549
opposed to developer celebrating what

00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,380
other developers do those two things can

00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:56,710
coexist look at the other great

00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:59,180
conferences of the world you know

00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:02,539
Amazon's reinvent celebrates both

00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:05,859
customers and developers it's an amazing

00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:09,640
event that grew from 19,000 people in

00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:11,900
2015 to 32,000 people in 2016

00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:14,779
Salesforce's event embraces both

00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:16,940
developers and marketers and

00:38:14,779 --> 00:38:20,930
practitioners this is one of the only

00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:23,180
conferences I know mule soft MongoDB

00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:25,040
Red Hat all of those conferences in the

00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:26,660
open source world embraced both of those

00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,010
folks now they went through some pain

00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:30,470
I've talked to the folks at Red Hat

00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:32,480
about their transition because that was

00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:34,610
not always the case but they've never

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:38,410
looked back since that day and that kind

00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:42,080
of change has to happen here as well and

00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:44,300
last as kind of a humorous note or maybe

00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:45,380
not so humorous more of a satin tote but

00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,390
this is a true story

00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:49,430
we at aqua also created these business

00:38:47,390 --> 00:38:51,620
summits a few years ago and we found

00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:54,140
that we couldn't quite scale them so we

00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,940
didn't continue to do them but I was at

00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:58,340
a business summit in California we

00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:00,590
invited our partners to come in and we

00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:03,700
invited them to be on panels and we had

00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:07,520
a particular agency in the Bay Area

00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:09,800
founded by three folks and one of those

00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,970
folks the technical folks was invited to

00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:15,250
be on a panel about finding talent you

00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:17,990
know which is one of the big challenges

00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:20,060
I spoke to some folks from Japan earlier

00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:23,240
today said we think Japan is a great

00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:25,370
market for Drupal but we can't find any

00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:28,250
Drupal developers so we don't know where

00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:30,620
to start and I've spoken with lots of

00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:32,540
customers through the years figaro in

00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:33,770
France for example a couple of years ago

00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:36,800
I speaking to them they said we love

00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:38,690
Drupal but we're not going to expand its

00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:45,020
usage inside of the Figaro because we

00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:47,510
cannot find developers Tom Miura that's

00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:51,650
good so I mean the situation has changed

00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:54,890
a little bit but not enough that we can

00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:57,080
do things so this was an important track

00:39:54,890 --> 00:40:00,640
at this Business Summit finding talent

00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:03,290
and this leader of the Drupal community

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,850
got up in front of business people and

00:40:03,290 --> 00:40:07,040
said well you know if you're going to

00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:08,270
hire someone to do Drupal you know they

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,090
don't want to come in and work before

00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:14,060
11:00 and then they're gonna want to do

00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:16,400
what they want to work on and you know

00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:19,460
they'll they'll probably stay late but

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,410
and you know you don't you have to pay

00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:24,710
them a lot but you can just give them a

00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:27,170
lot of pizza and beer as well and that

00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:29,510
was literally what was said and if I was

00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:31,820
a person sitting in the audience as a

00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:33,560
marketer or someone trying to decide do

00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:35,750
I want to use Drupal it was def

00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:39,680
not their white way to build confidence

00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:41,480
in the market and as agencies we've got

00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,270
to be really professional when we speak

00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:46,880
to these other folks and and figure that

00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:49,190
out and we need to build confidence you

00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,990
know the value of Drupal is the breadth

00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:53,750
of our community and the diversity of

00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:55,580
the ecosystem future customers want

00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:57,260
assurances that they can find talent and

00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:59,240
the knowledge that they can find the

00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:01,640
team's to succeed with Drupal they need

00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:05,420
assurances that Drupal as a solid viable

00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:07,130
and tested platform and secure a lot of

00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,690
them are overcoming some past prejudices

00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,580
against open source and may still be

00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:11,780
working under the assumption that open

00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:15,230
source software is less secure than

00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:18,470
proprietary alternatives so confidence

00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:19,910
is imperative they often think that open

00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:22,040
source is disorganized and lacks

00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:25,310
governance that open source is somehow

00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:27,860
less trustworthy than something they

00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:30,650
have to pay for and these really are the

00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:32,540
challenges that we have and so as I wrap

00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:36,230
up I just want to thank you all for the

00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:38,390
last 10 years it's been awesome and I

00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:40,280
know that Joe likes warned people

00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:43,850
yesterday and micron get close to that

00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:45,920
now Joe as I think about this there's

00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:47,540
been a lot of discussion around risa

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,690
blog post about who contributes to

00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:52,910
Drupal and how to fix the system we need

00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:55,610
to really elevate that discussion and

00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:57,620
accelerate it because we you know we're

00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:58,370
looking at Drupal con Europe not

00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:01,160
happening

00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:03,920
it can happen it can be financed there

00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:07,250
are ways to do this and continue this

00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,110
amazing show that we have this amazing

00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:12,190
conference is amazing collaboration this

00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:15,500
amazing way of getting people together I

00:42:12,190 --> 00:42:18,200
personally don't believe a network of

00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:20,240
Drupal camps will solve that will work

00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:21,920
the same it doesn't it doesn't bring

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:24,790
together the diversity that we need from

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:29,300
just geographies much less thoughts and

00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:31,400
and that is the beauty of Drupal you

00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:33,530
know ultimately it's about building a

00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,320
culture of inclusivity and I will

00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:38,120
emphasize inclusivity obviously around

00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:41,150
all the ways we talk about inclusivity

00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:43,910
here and I want to introduce the notion

00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:47,000
that we need to celebrate passion for

00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:50,150
Drupal whether or not they can code

00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,150
thank you

00:42:58,039 --> 00:43:02,789
so we have plenty of time for questions

00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,529
I wanted to leave some debate if we want

00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:08,809
to have it can be on this topic it can

00:43:04,529 --> 00:43:11,579
be I know I promised in the in my

00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:13,079
synopsis and the abstract that I would

00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:15,180
share some of the lessons learned at

00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:17,579
Acquia I did some of that yesterday and

00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:19,109
our partner conference but I'm happy to

00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:21,450
you know if you have particular

00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:23,460
questions there about what it means to

00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:26,220
work with Greece for 10 years I can tell

00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:29,160
you that and why his hair is actually

00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:34,020
still standing up ten years later just

00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:35,849
kidding but or you know other things so

00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:37,920
I don't know if folks have questions or

00:43:35,849 --> 00:43:45,260
comments want to debate something I said

00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:45,260
I'm happy to to take that up yeah Rina

00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:57,160
how can marketers become more involved

00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:00,550
and organically find a place I think you

00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:02,200
know part of the inclusion does need to

00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:04,089
start with the developers because of the

00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:07,780
way that we run Drupal cons today and

00:44:04,089 --> 00:44:09,970
sessions are voted in it's really a

00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:12,310
developer led criteria so I think one of

00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:15,609
the things that has to happen is as I

00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:18,339
proposed in 2010 we need practitioners

00:44:15,609 --> 00:44:21,910
to have an ability to also decide what

00:44:18,339 --> 00:44:25,570
they want to hear and and and curate and

00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:27,070
sometimes that means that it's tough

00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:29,170
sometimes to get practitioners to

00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:31,359
volunteer so sometimes you need to have

00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:33,099
professionals who are going to decide

00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:35,079
what's right or wrong and that doesn't

00:44:33,099 --> 00:44:37,630
fit consistently with the Drupal

00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:38,890
community model but sometimes it's the

00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:41,530
only way because they're paid

00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:43,180
professionals and they may not volunteer

00:44:41,530 --> 00:44:44,589
their time to do the same thing that

00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:49,119
these great volunteers we have in this

00:44:44,589 --> 00:44:50,980
community to do at least that's one of

00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:54,099
the steps um you know one of the things

00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:55,720
that marketers can do boy I have to

00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:56,859
think about this because as a person

00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:58,780
been pushing that button

00:44:56,859 --> 00:45:00,550
I've been trying everything I know and

00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:03,550
I'm not really technically even a

00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:09,849
marketer I don't know if others have

00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:12,339
ideas about things marketers can do send

00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:14,410
developers to conferences yeah what

00:45:12,339 --> 00:45:17,740
kinds of conferences yeah

00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:22,109
but how does that make marketers in a

00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:22,109
more you know present

00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:33,490
yeah that may be but I've we've had

00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:34,600
marketers comma just say and they'll

00:45:33,490 --> 00:45:35,980
come in if you ask them their opinion

00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:37,870
when they leave it's like this is

00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:44,010
Developers Conference I'm just throwing

00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:44,010
that out yeah cool Stella you

00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:52,830
might be off yeah

00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:13,950
it's a catch-22 yes

00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:48,770
I'll unplug so you don't get all my

00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:50,870
photos coming up but I haven't heard of

00:46:48,770 --> 00:46:53,270
it no I've been involved in other

00:46:50,870 --> 00:46:55,070
efforts to do marketing and I've sat on

00:46:53,270 --> 00:46:58,550
committees to do that to both that

00:46:55,070 --> 00:47:01,280
Drupal cons and and other calls it was

00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:02,330
unsuccessful but I personally don't know

00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,590
anything about the global marketing

00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:07,130
alliance I don't arena if you've heard

00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:09,860
of it so that might be a marketing

00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:12,590
problem just that's a bit of a joke

00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:17,000

marketing for drupal there's no question

00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:29,420
about it I mean just as an example we we

00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:31,610
had we we started a site years ago I

00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:33,650
forget what we called it now but it was

00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:35,600
basically a reference of all the sites

00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:37,790
in the world that use Drupal and we

00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:40,130
built it in Drupal gardens and when we

00:47:37,790 --> 00:47:44,120
sunset at Drupal gardens we moved that

00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:47,390
content over to Drupal comm and all of

00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:49,100

00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:07,220
create content that could be customized

00:48:04,670 --> 00:48:09,860
you know around selling Drupal and what

00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:10,940
it means to sell Drupal but I'm not

00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:12,680
familiar with the global marketing

00:48:10,940 --> 00:48:18,650

Jeff

00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:31,640
you know certainly the smaller shops and

00:48:29,059 --> 00:48:33,829
their traditional shops got to a level

00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:50,109
where we were starting to work with

00:48:33,829 --> 00:48:54,109
bigger clients but all the big guys

00:48:50,109 --> 00:48:56,210
really part of it was the MLS part of it

00:48:54,109 --> 00:48:58,339
was the success stories in the software

00:48:56,210 --> 00:49:01,869
