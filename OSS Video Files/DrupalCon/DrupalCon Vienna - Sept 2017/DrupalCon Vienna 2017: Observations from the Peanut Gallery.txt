Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Observations from the Peanut Gallery
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	Please give us a detailed overview of your session and why attendees will be excited to hear about it. Â 

As the CEO of Acquia for the past almost nine years, I have developed a number of perspectives on the community, market opportunity and the success criteria required for the future. I will share the good, bad and ugly of my journey, including thoughts on the community to which I offered unrequited love in the early days that evolved into a strong mutual respect. I'll reveal little known facts about my personal struggles as community advocate and share lessons learned on building Acquia. Attendees should come away with smiles on their faces and an understanding of the human side of the company that is so often misunderstood.

Ensure that you let us know:
