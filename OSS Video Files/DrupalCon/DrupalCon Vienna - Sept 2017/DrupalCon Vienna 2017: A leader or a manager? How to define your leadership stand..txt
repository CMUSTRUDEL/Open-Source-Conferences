Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: A leader or a manager? How to define your leadership stand.
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	What do you stand for?

I believe everyone should ask him/herself this question at least once in a lifetime.

I did ask myself. Not even just once. I do this kind of self-assessment from time to time to track my life direction and check if my daily life corresponds with my core personal values.

Knowing your leadership stand helps you live a bright and dedicated life, properly lead your team and succeed in what you truly love doing. Unfortunately, the speed of a modern life doesn’t leave us much space to stop and think about what we are doing and why. Therefore we are sinking in everyday’s routine and lose time that we could have used for achievements and self-development.

Sounds dramatic, but I have a solution!

I’ve combined all my knowledge about leadership with some theories and studies and come up with a simple approach to defining a leadership stand. This stand is your essence, your values and your leadership goals. Knowing what you stand for in this life helps to get on your own feet and achieve outstanding results both in professional area and in self-realization.

Of course, talking about all these reasons and “whys” can’t happen without a Simon Sinek’s model of Golden Circle. On the session we’ll use it to discover a secret ingredient of an influential leadership, learn how to find out why are you doing what you are doing and how to transmit your leadership stand and values to others. All these will allow you to be a solid personality surrounded by soulmates.

However, understanding of what kind of a leader you are or want to be is not enough. The point is to live it each and every day. In order to do so, we’ll do our life values assessment and define their place in our daily life. That will reveal the gaps between our perception of our life and an objective reality. And in conclusion of the session we’ll finalize your leadership stand based on your life values and your image of an achievable future.

This session сonsists not only of theories but also of applied practice, so if you take this opportunity, you will leave with a tangible result. But if you are more into listening and self-reflecting, you will also find useful information for yourself. 

The session is for: 

A manager who wants to become a better leader for his/her team. 
A CEO who strives to surround his/herself with people who share the same values. 
Any person who seeks for purpose of life.

hello everyone I think we should start

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,269
already because the first session was a

00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:13,080
little bit out of the time but to keep

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:16,440
the agenda in frame we'll start so I

00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,880
welcome you in the session a manager or

00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,090
leader how to define new leadership

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,220
stand but before we start I wanted to

00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:25,710
thank the Drupal community into each one

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,529
of you for the opportunity to stay here

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,060
in the liver speech you know one small

00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,040
part of me still doesn't believe that

00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,260
it's happening to me standing here and

00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,239
speaking an international event so let's

00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:44,090
give a huge round of applause to Drupal

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:44,090
community and each one of us thank you

00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:51,480
so my name is marina and I come from

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:54,059
Russia I'm working for as organizational

00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,629
development manager and the Drupal shop

00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:59,760
from Siberia and it's a little in the

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,859
further parts of my presentation but

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,210
before we move to the session to the

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,830
content of the session I want you to

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,770
introduce myself a little for you to

00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,020
have an idea why this topic is matters

00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:12,330
to me and what relevant experience I

00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,180
have to speak about this topic so during

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,759
my professional life I've been to many

00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,740
amazing teams and I was honored to lead

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,210
some of them and through each and every

00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:23,340
of those experiences I somehow

00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,070
reinvented myself to understand what

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,049
kind of leader is needed to fulfill the

00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:30,689
project's call and to help to develop

00:01:28,049 --> 00:01:32,250
the skills of the team members and I

00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:34,229
have come to conclusion that the main

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,140
difference between a manager in and a

00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:40,079
leader is that a manager distributes

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,210
tasks and the members of the managers

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,220
team usually are responsible for some

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,950
functions realizations and the other

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:49,560
hand a leader is someone who strived to

00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,290
unleash the potential of his or her team

00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,180
members in order to allow them to

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:55,890
achieve their personal goals while

00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,810
achieving the project's goal and

00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,880
therefore it creates much stronger

00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,100
commitment towards the project and it

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,540
creates the bigger picture for the team

00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:05,759
members and each and every of their

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,110
actions and that kind of leadership in

00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,539
wanna speak today that kind of

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,700
leadership that I really value and I

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,140
think it really matter

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,650
to have such kind of leaders in the

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:22,470
company and within each and every team

00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:24,720
so you know I'm not that motivational

00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,400
speakers so I'm gonna stay here stay

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,489
here and say like you can't do this

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,730
you're go for it and so on unfortunately

00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:34,980
I'm not like this yet maybe one day it

00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:36,360
becomes an inspirational speaker but now

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,280
I'm just the person who loves

00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:40,200
structuring things and today I'm going

00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,700
to present to you my own approach of

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,560
finding the leadership stand of

00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,870
understanding who you are of some kind

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,910
of self-discovery path that will lead

00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,530
you to understand in what kind of leader

00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:52,560
you can be of a kind of leader you are

00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:54,989
now so that is just my approach that I

00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,360
used myself and hope it will be also

00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:58,170
relevant to you so what we are gonna

00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,000
talk today

00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,470
first we will define the leadership

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,680
because that is the term we're gonna be

00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:06,599
talking a lot today but it's good to

00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,310
have an idea what is this because now

00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:10,380
many people will consider it as

00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,480
different things then we will discuss

00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,310
all the circle model which will help us

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,829
to understand why we do what you do and

00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,859
then we go even deeper in this to

00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:22,709
understand what value stand behind our

00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:24,480
will to do something further if we

00:03:22,709 --> 00:03:27,209
finalize those two parts with

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,819
influential leadership concept and we

00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:32,850
will finish our session with the

00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:39,299
leadership stand definite definition and

00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:41,880
creation but you know adults usually

00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:44,370
don't learn new skills before practice

00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,470
in it so I've prepared a couple of

00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,810
exercises to you to be even more engaged

00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:51,389
in the process those exercises are

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:55,889
totally individual so you won't need to

00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:57,690
interact with others and also if you

00:03:55,889 --> 00:04:01,139
don't want to participate it's also

00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:03,299
totally fine so for me both versions

00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:05,459
will work if you want to participate go

00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:08,099
for it if you don't want it more into

00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:11,400
listening it's also fine but I believe

00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:14,609
that in our nowadays life don't really

00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,099
have time to stop and think what we do

00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:19,169
why we do it who we are and what persons

00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:22,530
we want to be but now I have one hour

00:04:19,169 --> 00:04:24,960
and I want to grant it to you so use it

00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:27,330
efficient is you can take anything you

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,210
want and you can out of this one hour

00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:32,090
and I promise exercise won't be very

00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:34,440
difficult but they will help you to

00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:40,919
leave the session with the tangible

00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:43,940
result and also the leadership topic is

00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:48,000
kind of sensitive man and I believe that

00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:49,770
it will be more the result will be more

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,510
efficient from the session if you will

00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,580
demonstrate the growth mindset during it

00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:57,780
so has anyone heard about the concept of

00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:59,700
fixed and gross mindset may be okay good

00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:02,280
so the main difference between people

00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,290
was fixed and gross mindsets is that

00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,480
people with fixed mindset receive

00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:08,580
challenges as a threat and try to avoid

00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,380
it and on the other hand people whose

00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:12,540
gross mindset versus challenges as

00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,729
opportunity opportunity to meet new

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,250
people to get out of a comfort zone or

00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:19,380
to develop new skills and something like

00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,750
this and the other difference is that

00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,910
people with fixed mindset usually behave

00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,430
in the way they know all they got to

00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,320
know and people with gross mindset they

00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:30,000
tend to learn from others maybe

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,460
sometimes they were not from books and

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,169
some you know other resources but from

00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,110
talking to people or sharing exchange

00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:39,030
and experience and I believe that this

00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,310
growth mindset won't deprive you of

00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:43,890
possibly working solutions it leaves you

00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:45,720
with a choice but first to try something

00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:47,490
new and then decide whether it fits you

00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,350
or no and I believe that this kind of

00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,300
approach will be much more efficient

00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:52,580
during the talk about leadership and

00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:55,470
self-discovery

00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:58,080
well someone without further ado let's

00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,850
go to the content of the session so

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,760
please raise your hand those who can

00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:05,070
hold him or herself a leader right now

00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:07,130
do we have leaders in the room great

00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:10,200
thank you

00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:11,820
you know it kind of weird but I've never

00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,490
seen an audience when all the people

00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:16,890
rose hands on this question and I

00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,280
believe there may be two reasons for

00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,340
this

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,620
the first reason is that leadership

00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,330
became a little bit of a buzzword today

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,850
so leadership leadership leadership

00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:28,440
leadership is everywhere everyone can be

00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:30,630
a leader can call him or herself a

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,210
leader but no one really knows who is

00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:36,139
the leader

00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:37,699
the other reason is different from the

00:06:36,139 --> 00:06:40,430
first one but I believe even more

00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:42,770
relevant today this reason is that

00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,630
people now sometimes perceive leadership

00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:47,030
as something bigger

00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:49,310
beyond ordinary people is something that

00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:53,569
we need to deserve one day to be called

00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:56,169
leader and so on and people think that

00:06:53,569 --> 00:06:59,419
leadership is kind of acts of bravery

00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:01,849
changing the world entirely and every

00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:06,289
day working on yourself doing some big

00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:08,289
feat and other things like this but in

00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:10,400
his TED talk drew Dudley said that

00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:12,680
having in mind that leadership is

00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,320
something beyond us we therefore create

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,389
for us an excuse not to expect

00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,729
leadership behavior from ourselves and

00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:21,560
from people around us so we say that no

00:07:19,729 --> 00:07:23,120
leadership is too big is not for me and

00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:25,610
therefore we don't demonstrate this kind

00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,259
of behavior but on the other hand there

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,800
is a concept of everyday leadership

00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:33,110
leadership is perceived as small things

00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,130
we can do every day to change other

00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:38,960
people's lives of the better and you

00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:41,720
know I've also been kind of trapped in

00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,630
this situation as if in this perceiving

00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:49,400
of leadership until one story happened

00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:50,780
to me it was couple of years ago I was

00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,270
the team leader of a project team

00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,740
organizing the educational event and I

00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:56,539
need to mention that it was a volunteer

00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,900
in events so all we got from it was our

00:07:56,539 --> 00:08:02,960
self development and experience and that

00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:05,000
was two or three weeks before the

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,400
project realization almost anything

00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,680
wasn't ready and I felt like I need to

00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:12,560
push my team towards goals achievements

00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,419
somehow of course I could have screamed

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,280
at them I could have punished them but

00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:18,860
that would work but that wasn't the

00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:20,659
result I wanted I wanted them to

00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:23,180
remember about the great things they

00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:24,590
wanted to achieve I wanted them to

00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:29,539
remember why they joined this project

00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:33,500
and we inspire them again by the Masters

00:08:29,539 --> 00:08:35,270
project realization so I didn't say to

00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,890
them that I'm mad at them I didn't say

00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:38,719
that I'm worried about the project

00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,430
because I wasn't I did this project

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,740
before and I knew how to fix it but I

00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,940
want them to get this experience they

00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,270
could get out of this project

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:49,520
and I just said to them that I'm very

00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:53,120
sad and disappointed looking how they

00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:55,130
gave up on their dreams and that was you

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,080
know the key message of my one hour long

00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:59,210
speech and as I've already told you I'm

00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,040
not good with motivational speaking so

00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,660
when I was going home I was shaking I

00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,090
was really nervous because I didn't know

00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,820
whether it helped or it even made it all

00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:10,100
worse but by the time I got home I

00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:14,180
received this big message of one of my

00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:16,250
girls my team why she said that actually

00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:19,100
during many years we know each other she

00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:21,980
perceived me as a role model in

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:24,860
professional area for her and so when I

00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:26,600
said to her that I'm disappointed in her

00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:28,730
she felt like she betrayed herself and

00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,500
she felt like she didn't become the

00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:34,610
better version of herself she wanted to

00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:36,110
become and from that moment she promised

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,240
me that she would do anything it takes

00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,800
to contribute to the project to make it

00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,870
really great and she was the most

00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,930
efficient member of the team from that

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:47,650
point of time but you know what was the

00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:51,160
first time when I've read this message I

00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:55,670
thought a role model me

00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:58,610
no role model is something big role

00:09:55,670 --> 00:10:01,160
model is a leader is something great

00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:04,610
some someone who other people want to be

00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:06,830
look like but I'm not I'm just an

00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:11,630
ordinary person I'm not I couldn't be

00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:13,190
someone else's role model and then I

00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:15,080
started to think more about this I

00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:17,480
thought it over and over again and I

00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,950
understood that at each time we had

00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,110
conversations with this girl each

00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:23,630
project we realized together all the

00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:27,770
ordinary interval conversation that was

00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:30,410
to me they were somehow special to her

00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:32,990
and that came me led me to the

00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:35,060
conclusion that each time we talk to

00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:37,760
other people we might change someone

00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:41,330
else's life but we even don't know about

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,820
it sometimes so maybe you also have

00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:46,220
people who influenced your life very

00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:49,060
much who change the way you perceive

00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:55,040
things do you have such people in your

00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:57,380
and your friends family yeah great thank

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,710
you who have you told them that they

00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:03,980
change

00:10:57,710 --> 00:11:06,470
your life see why not and that's why we

00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:10,220
don't because they don't pay enough

00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:11,930
attention to this kind of things to this

00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:15,110
kind of leadership we used to

00:11:11,930 --> 00:11:17,180
underestimate this but actually we do

00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:20,390
change other people's lives all the time

00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:22,100
and if we want to really become leaders

00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:24,620
we need to make it more consciously

00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,900
because I personally believe that we can

00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:28,310
not lead anyone anywhere before knowing

00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:31,640
where we go in ourselves

00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:33,650
and that is a goal of our recession to

00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,130
understand what kind of leaders we are

00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:41,240
and to lead with fully transparent

00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:43,550
attitude towards other people yeah and

00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,860
the first guy to talk to help us with

00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:48,110
this self-discovery process is simon

00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:52,370
Sinek and he came up with the idea of

00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:57,110
golden circle model did you hear about

00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:59,000
it maybe okay good so he said there are

00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,490
three main questions you should answer

00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,610
before starts in doing something and

00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:06,800
these questions are why how and what so

00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:08,660
in terms of doing something new what do

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,670
you think is the most important why are

00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,280
you doing things how are you going to

00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:16,700
achieve it or what are you going to do

00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:22,070
actually so who is for why and who is

00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:25,340
for what the who is for how yeah good

00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:26,120
and I'm sorry to say this but you all

00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:29,930
are mistaken

00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,580
sorry actually if you said that to use

00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:33,050
this model you need to apply to these

00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,670
two men principles and the first

00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,920
principle is that you should answer all

00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:39,590
three of them and you should have them

00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,360
in balance because if you know what you

00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,650
do but you don't know why you do it you

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,060
don't have this connection between your

00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:45,650
personality and your activity and

00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,570
therefore people cannot understand who

00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:49,700
you are out of what you do and on the

00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:52,850
other hand if you know why you do things

00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:55,880
but you don't do anything anyway you're

00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:58,640
somehow closed from the outside world

00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:01,460
and you close all your personality from

00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:03,080
other people so this how this model look

00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:04,940
like because the second principle should

00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:07,460
apply to this model is that you need to

00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,200
always start from Y in this term

00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,800
those who rose hands on the white part

00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,690
were

00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,399
partially right because it is the first

00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,050
touch point with this model first you

00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:17,000
ask yourself why and then go further and

00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:18,830
further and when you ask answer why you

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,110
do what you do the means of achieving

00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:23,240
this your house will be much more easier

00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:27,620
to find and also what it should look

00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:29,180
like also will appear very easy so you

00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,860
should always have the clarity of why

00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,899
first where why is your set of

00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:36,110
fundamental beliefs is your core life

00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:38,420
values and then you need to have the the

00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:40,880
discipline of how where how is the

00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:43,279
concrete actual steps to realize your

00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:46,329
wine and finally you need to have the

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:49,190
consistency of what where what is

00:13:46,329 --> 00:13:52,790
concrete tangible manifestation of your

00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:55,519
why in the real world and you know when

00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:57,200
you will and ask this question why to

00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:59,779
yourself at the first time it may be a

00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,450
little bit difficult to answer it's very

00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:04,100
easy but if you will make it a habit so

00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:06,170
each time you do something new evil

00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,200
answers ask yourself this question it

00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,920
will next time it will come to your mind

00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,600
automatically and the answer will come

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,810
easier and easier from time to time

00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,270
because your whole life will be

00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:18,709
transformed to a more conscious one so

00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,839
anytime you will do something new you

00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:23,089
will know exactly why you do this and

00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:25,190
having this in mind your personality

00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:29,750
will be more shaped and solid but

00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:31,459
sometimes people struggle as answering

00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:33,860
this question or even they understand

00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:35,990
that they don't know why they do what

00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:37,550
they do and they don't actually want to

00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:39,260
do this anymore after asking this

00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:41,149
question and for this kind of situation

00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,399
I've also prepared to you two more

00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:45,110
questions that can provide you with some

00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:48,350
insights about what you can be

00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:50,420
passionate about and so the first

00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:52,640
question is what would you do if you

00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,620
have unlimited amount of money so if you

00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:56,180
don't know what you want to do ask

00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:58,339
yourself this question so imagine that

00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,140
money are not relevant in this world

00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:03,380
anymore so you are free to do anything

00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:06,440
you want and so make up with the list of

00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:08,329
things and during this day or during

00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,610
another day to refresh your mind a

00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:12,140
little ask yourself a second question is

00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:14,899
what would you do even if you are not

00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:17,149
paid for it what you are so passionate

00:15:14,899 --> 00:15:20,270
about that you would do it even for free

00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:21,570
and so after coming up with the list of

00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:24,750
things

00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:26,730
answers to those questions imagine

00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:29,070
yourself doing this action doing this

00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:32,040
activities and ask yourself a questions

00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:34,050
what it makes you feel what is similar

00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,450
in all these activities you mentioned

00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:38,640
and why is it so important for you to do

00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:40,380
this of course it may be not the direct

00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:43,440
answer on the question what you should

00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:45,960
do but it will be at least some tips

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,640
some clues to you to understand your

00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:53,520
further career step or further

00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:56,280
professional development step well as I

00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,790
said your why is a set of a fundamental

00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,250
beliefs

00:15:56,790 --> 00:16:01,710
it's a set of your life values so let's

00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:03,420
go a little bit deeper on this and

00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:06,300
understand what stand behind your why

00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:09,990
what life well you drive your why and

00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:12,510
make you do what you do what actually a

00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:18,720
life value is it is you know you're like

00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:20,970
guiding compass you're how to say value

00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,070
is your fundamental belief that drive

00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:25,350
behavior the drives behavior and this is

00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:27,300
a very important note is so values drive

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:29,430
your behavior and therefore having

00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,500
understood what your value in this life

00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:34,170
your behavioral characteristics will be

00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,970
much more clear even to you you will

00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:37,860
understand why you got angry on side on

00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,660
one particular situation and why another

00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:42,420
situation made you happy because they

00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:46,530
will know what my what their reasons

00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:50,520
that lay behind this I had any emotions

00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:53,640
any decision you take and here comes the

00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:55,260
first exercise I prepared to you and for

00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:58,470
all you all you will need is like a

00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:01,080
maybe a notebook and a pen or your like

00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:04,699
mobile device when you can draw or read

00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:08,459
or write and the first task is very easy

00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:11,510
is to draw a circle very easy exercise

00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:14,730
and those who want to participate just

00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:17,810
draw a circle it can be not that around

00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,810
but whatever it is

00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:32,950
yeah so the next one is also very easy

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:36,669
one is to divide the circle into six

00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:40,929
sectors so just three lines will help

00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:43,929
you with this step and when you are done

00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:49,630
just look up and I will see that we can

00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:52,120
move further okay the next part it will

00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:55,570
be a little bit more difficult and this

00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:58,240
is you should put your life values into

00:17:55,570 --> 00:18:00,639
this section so one value at the section

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,009
for example section 1 freedom section 2

00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:05,620
love section 3 and now see your value in

00:18:03,009 --> 00:18:09,279
this life and while you do this try to

00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:11,139
be as specific as you can because a life

00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:15,070
value is something indivisible as

00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:17,409
something solid so and it should be very

00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:19,120
understandable and clear for example if

00:18:17,409 --> 00:18:22,269
you had first I think that your life

00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:24,490
values money then think more about what

00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:26,139
you need this money for maybe you need

00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,940
not need money to travel and therefore

00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:29,710
your true life value will be not the

00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:33,220
money itself but the freedom this money

00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:34,960
can buy or for example you need money to

00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,850
help your grandparents and I think why

00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,679
it is so important for you to help your

00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:40,659
grandparents maybe your true life value

00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:42,850
will be the quality time with your

00:18:40,659 --> 00:18:45,039
family or to sense the sense of

00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:49,360
belonging to community or something like

00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,950
this and you should put this in the way

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,649
you will understand what you what do you

00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:56,080
mean by this truly so it should be

00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:58,389
really something indivisible so when you

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:04,240
ask yourself a further question on it

00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:06,549
it's very very bottom yeah we have a

00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,029
couple of minutes to say for this

00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:09,029
exercise

00:19:54,179 --> 00:20:00,149
I forgot to mention if you have more

00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:01,980
values than six it is also fine just

00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:04,139
divide the circle into more sections and

00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:06,360
just put your values there or if you

00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:08,580
have less it's also fine just leave the

00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:11,039
blank sectors it's fine but to me

00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,960
personally if having too many values

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:17,190
it's very hard to remember and very hard

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,869
to follow therefore if you have at some

00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:22,470
point it's better but if you by now have

00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:27,379
more than six fine put it as it as it

00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:30,360
feels right you know it's also fine I

00:20:27,379 --> 00:20:34,860
are you sure that you went as deep as

00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:39,509
you as you could in discovering like

00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:41,960
what what stands behind this value as

00:20:39,509 --> 00:20:41,960
it's great

00:20:50,430 --> 00:21:00,580
who needs more time okay good so the

00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:03,000
final part of the exercise will be to

00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:05,380
think about your everyday life and

00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,180
understand to which extent you live your

00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:10,030
life values in your everyday life

00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,710
so go sector by sector in color is a

00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:13,780
part of the sector to which extent you

00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:16,840
think you'll live this value and put a

00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:19,270
percentage that feels correctly so for

00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:22,810
example if you put your life values

00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:25,510
freedom but you have you know a mortgage

00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:27,610
to kids and fixed scheduled job that

00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:30,190
maybe you're not that free is you wished

00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:32,500
to be and then you should you should put

00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:36,370
some smaller percentage for example ten

00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:37,840
or twenty percent or you put your value

00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:39,880
is expanding quality time with your

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,830
family and you do spend each Sunday

00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,630
having dinner with your family this

00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:45,160
amazing time of sharing experiences and

00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:49,060
so on then you put a bigger percentage

00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:50,500
like 80 90 even 100 or for example you

00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,270
spend a lot of time is your family but

00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,270
cannot honestly say is the time its

00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:58,030
quality so put the smaller percentage

00:21:55,270 --> 00:22:00,940
like 50 60 or whatever it is and try to

00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:02,830
go one sector by one not all at once and

00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:06,360
so on once you finished with one well

00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:08,530
you move to another one and then color

00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,910
the parts of the sector to which extent

00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:12,150
we leave this value in your everyday

00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,150
life

00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:53,480
and when you finish just look up and we

00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:57,670
will move further okay see some people

00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,670
still painting

00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:14,230
mm-hmm so do you have people who live

00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:21,230
all the life values - more than 80%

00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:22,880
great doing great amazing do we have

00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:26,710
people who live all the values - less

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:30,140
than 50% mm-hmm

00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:33,350
yeah I totally with you guys because

00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:36,020
when I first did this exercise I I also

00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:38,150
draw the circle and I put my values and

00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:41,240
I looked at it and I said well I have

00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:43,990
really cool values my values looked so

00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:47,120
inspiring and so great to me I felt so

00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:49,400
empowered by the values I put on the

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,900
list and then we need it also to color

00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:53,630
the parts of the section and I was

00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:56,090
really doing this one by one and then

00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:59,360
finally I looked at the whole picture I

00:23:56,090 --> 00:24:01,419
draw I drew and and I understood that I

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:06,799
don't really leave any of my cool values

00:24:01,419 --> 00:24:08,570
and it was you know I was it was like a

00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:11,659
thunder in my head I couldn't do

00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:15,200
anything I felt paralyzed I felt like I

00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:17,690
really messed up I felt like I screwed

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,340
my life or I live someone else's life I

00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:22,610
didn't know what to do it was so scary

00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:24,919
and in this kind of agony my brain

00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:26,630
started to function and I understood

00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:28,250
that there may be two reasons for this

00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,080
kind of situation and the first reason

00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:32,630
is that maybe I put their own values

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,830
maybe it's actually not the values I

00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,630
have in my life

00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:38,030
but then I looked again and this and

00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:40,570
understood that no these are the things

00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:44,000
I care a lot and I want to leave them

00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:45,710
100% in my everyday life so the other

00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,350
reason that was left is it I do

00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,120
something wrong in my life and I need to

00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:53,059
change it somehow or need to change the

00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:55,940
perception of it but back then when I

00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:57,620
was looking at my drawing it seemed it

00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:00,470
seemed impossible it seemed impossible

00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:02,659
to include my life values into my life

00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:04,789
because one of my values I put the time

00:25:02,659 --> 00:25:06,530
it was freedom as I said but I was

00:25:04,789 --> 00:25:07,970
living in Moscow that I'm working on

00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:08,780
very important projects so I couldn't

00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:12,230
just quit

00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:14,510
I was working 24/7 and it wasn't

00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:18,020
impossible even to have like a short

00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:19,960
break and it felt like when I knew that

00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:21,580
my life well is freedom but I don't you

00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:24,010
live this from that moment I felt like

00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:26,800
entrapped in the situation and I didn't

00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:28,510
see the way out of it but then I got

00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:30,280
myself together I went to my boss that

00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:31,840
time and I said you know this kind of

00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:34,630
situation I have I'm struggling with

00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,780
this can we make something up to solve

00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:40,960
it and surprisingly she was very open

00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:42,880
and she helped me to create the plan of

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,150
how I can like you know have some rest

00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,160
and feel more free in my job

00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:50,290
responsibilities at time and that was a

00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,570
very important moment for me to

00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:54,670
understand that actually can change my

00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:58,060
life according to my values and from

00:25:54,670 --> 00:26:01,510
that moment step by step I really think

00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:03,910
I was rethinking all my life to fit my

00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:06,460
values and now I can say that it's

00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:08,770
possible so those people who put a

00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:11,320
smaller percentage of values don't get

00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:13,210
upset as I did that time it's great that

00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,940
you know it now it is the starting point

00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:20,050
from there you can go just up and and

00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:22,180
better so it is really possible by small

00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:24,910
steps change in your life and make it

00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:27,100
fit your life values and that will make

00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:31,060
you really happy and fulfilled

00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:33,640
personality so let's move further to

00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:36,070
some more positive things and it's

00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:38,520
influential leadership so it'll promise

00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:41,110
to you we will finalize those two parts

00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,180
the simon Sinek golden circle and the

00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:47,260
valleys assessment with influential

00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:49,480
leadership part and again as simon Sinek

00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:52,660
says that what makes you influential

00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:55,180
leader it's connecting your why with

00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:57,100
your what and why it is so because your

00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,960
wife is your personal values

00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,540
it's actually who you are in what drives

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,430
your behavior and if you will be able to

00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:05,080
connect your wife with your what and

00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:06,880
your what is your activity and anything

00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,250
you do you will be able to surround

00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,410
yourself as like-minded people so people

00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:14,170
will understand who you are out of what

00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:15,790
you do it will be very easier for them

00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:18,340
to understand who you are and whether

00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:20,800
they want to join you or no and having

00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:22,360
such people around you will help you to

00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:24,520
create much stronger you much more

00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,710
committed teams because again the Simon

00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:29,650
Says people don't buy what you do they

00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:32,680
buy why you do it and if we will be able

00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:34,780
to translate transmit this why to

00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:37,060
Colonel world it will shape this

00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:40,000
community around you with people who

00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:41,800
have shared values and if you will have

00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,930
such people in your team or your company

00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:46,690
you will do much more extraordinary

00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:49,150
things in comparison if you ingest unite

00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:50,590
people by you know some material things

00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:53,440
like celery or something like this

00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:57,970
people who are driven by their core life

00:27:53,440 --> 00:28:01,900
values are more committed and more

00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:03,520
bonded in these terms so try to base all

00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:05,800
of your activities your jobs your

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:07,420
hobbies on your life value a lot of

00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,190
values and that will help you to do

00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:13,750
first steps towards influential

00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:17,650
leadership but hi I was looking for my

00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:19,630
wife you know before presenting all this

00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:23,710
exercises to you have did them myself

00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:26,080
and it used to be very easy for me to

00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:29,380
answer myself a question why I do what I

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:31,990
do but a couple of years ago I was lost

00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:35,200
too little in my professional life and I

00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:37,840
asked myself why I do what I do why am I

00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:42,940
here and I answer it didn't appear and I

00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:44,500
was like you know usually it was very

00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,810
easy for me to understand why I do what

00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,520
I do but that time it wasn't so I wasn't

00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:50,650
sure whether to quit my job or no and

00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:53,080
but I understood that just quitting is

00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:54,940
an easy way and I was struggling for

00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,970
several months to understand why I

00:28:54,940 --> 00:29:00,460
should stay why am I here what what

00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:02,290
should I do further and so on and that

00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,820
was kind of tough month for me but that

00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:05,620
was good because that was the first time

00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:07,990
well I thought of creating this kind of

00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:12,130
system of understanding yourself

00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:14,410
so it was Bouton's in these terms so

00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:17,290
what I did I was analyzing all the

00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:20,410
activities I had that I enjoyed doing it

00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:22,420
was my parts of my job that I laughed

00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:24,760
doing it was by varied hobbies and you

00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:27,460
know I have weird hobbies I started with

00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,260
making muffins and you know it sounds

00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,490
pretty fine like a girl makes muffins

00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:33,940
what's wrong with it

00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:37,180
but I was making like 400 of them at a

00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:38,980
time and what just once you know then I

00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:41,320
moved to knitting and I was knitting

00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:43,630
hats and I still have this big bag of

00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,630
rats in my place I don't know why I need

00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:47,840
so many

00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:49,909
and then it was gardening I'm sorry for

00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:53,720
sharing all this random stuff but you

00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:57,289
know I'm kind of obsessed person engaged

00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:59,390
in activity I'm doing like 100% so I

00:29:57,289 --> 00:30:01,640
also analyzed my previous projects and

00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:03,490
jobs so this conference that I was

00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:06,740
trading with you in the beginning I

00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:11,570
created the idea of this event and then

00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:15,380
realized it event and I was really how

00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:17,299
to say excited when 200 people came to

00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:20,240
this conference and it was really a

00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:22,820
moment when I felt like I did something

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,029
really great felt special so I analyzed

00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:29,149
these moments that make me really happy

00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:32,059
and try to find out what is similar in

00:30:29,149 --> 00:30:34,039
all of these what they have in common in

00:30:32,059 --> 00:30:38,000
order to find out what is really

00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:40,580
important to me and the conclusion I had

00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,870
sounds really simple now but the time it

00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,389
was just mind-blowing

00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:47,690
I understood that I'm really driven by

00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:50,299
the moment of creation so when I do

00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:53,029
something out of nothing or I structure

00:30:50,299 --> 00:30:55,490
things that was in chaos before that

00:30:53,029 --> 00:30:58,279
really makes me inspired and this small

00:30:55,490 --> 00:31:00,440
realization about myself this why I had

00:30:58,279 --> 00:31:03,620
helped me to understand how I can

00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:07,370
changed my work my responsibilities to

00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:09,559
make to make them fit my inspiration

00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:11,750
because I knew that if I do this I would

00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:13,700
be much more efficient at my job and in

00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:16,549
my life because if people do what they

00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:20,360
really love doing they are much better

00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:24,769
in this and from that time I tried to

00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:28,010
change my career path I tried to change

00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:30,230
what I did and my like my

00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:32,750
responsibilities towards the things that

00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:35,059
I love doing and as I told you in the

00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,649
beginning so I'm in charge of

00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,720
organizational development which

00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:41,450
literally means that I create business

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,700
processes that never existed before or I

00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:46,639
structure business processes that were

00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:49,549
not working properly so this small

00:31:46,639 --> 00:31:51,580
thought I had a couple of years ago led

00:31:49,549 --> 00:31:54,740
me towards doing what I really loved and

00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:57,920
you can do as well and that's why you

00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:59,780
will also link why you do

00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:04,010
what you do and so it's very very

00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:06,170
possible well so now we have all the

00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:09,140
necessary information to try to come up

00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:11,330
with our leadership stand but what is

00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:13,970
leadership stance is the first place it

00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:16,940
is a statement that describes you as a

00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:19,190
person and as a leader and shows what

00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:21,620
you stand for in this life so a little

00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:24,920
ships tent is just a phrase that will

00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:27,800
explain everything about you actually so

00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:29,960
you can even put it in any words you can

00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:32,000
but if you're struggling just start with

00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,760
the words I stand for and then put what

00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,500
you stand for very easy it's also kind

00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,600
of an exercise and you if you want you

00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:41,300
can just try to come up with some words

00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:43,460
right now but what is very important

00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,930
about leadership stand is that it should

00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,820
be very clear and very easy to

00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:48,470
understand for your team members because

00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:50,780
people actually don't get inspired by

00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:53,030
something they don't understand so this

00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:55,340
phrase should be you can make it really

00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:58,400
beautiful later but now the goal is to

00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:02,990
put it in the very clear words very easy

00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:07,490
to understand once so you can do this

00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:09,740
now or you can do this later and this

00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:11,720
exercise actually contains the second

00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:14,480
part which is not individual anymore

00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:16,250
but I promised you to include any not

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,890
individual exercises so it may be your

00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:20,480
homework if you want and what it what it

00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:22,670
looks like so you come up with your

00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,590
leadership stand and you present it to

00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:26,090
the other person and they're all over

00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:28,610
the other person is to challenge your

00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:31,100
leadership stand to ask your clarifying

00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:33,440
question awkward questions and any other

00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:35,000
questions for you to have a power

00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,690
understanding of what you mean by this

00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:44,060
leadership stand for example when I

00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:45,830
first do this exercise I put my lips ten

00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:48,230
something like I stand for harmony

00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:50,540
inside and outside the balance of it

00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:57,140
like well I don't really remember how it

00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:58,790
stated the time and I presented sounds

00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,950
quite inspiring but could you please

00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:05,030
clarify what is the harmony and I was

00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:07,910
like and then if you ask how we will

00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:10,100
ensure that you already achieved harmony

00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:12,020
how we will understand that harmony

00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:14,630
inside now that is even possible and

00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:16,880
other questions like this that make me

00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:18,710
really think harder on this think more

00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:22,850
about what I want you to say but my

00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:26,330
leadership stand and so on so this

00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:28,880
exercise is you know it's a very the

00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:30,470
fastest feedback you can receive on your

00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:34,850
leadership stand from other people and

00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:36,890
the feedback to you as a person with

00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:39,169
this leadership stand so how people

00:34:36,890 --> 00:34:47,570
perceive a person who has this kind of

00:34:39,169 --> 00:34:57,560
leadership stand yeah and now we can say

00:34:47,570 --> 00:35:01,790
that yes sure I was just about to share

00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:05,540
my leadership standard oh yeah I have

00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:07,490
one just answering the question so I I

00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:10,310
can say now that my leadership center is

00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:11,750
not maybe the perfect one it should have

00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:14,180
me you may also ask questions to

00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:17,120
challenge my leadership stand but for

00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:19,400
now I stand for happiness I stand for

00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,650
that happiness that allows you to live

00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,680
and choose because you are happy now

00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:26,690
not to become happy one day because I

00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:30,470
bet any of you heard some phrases like

00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:32,780
when I get this job I'll get happy when

00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:34,460
I lose weight I'll get happy or when I

00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:37,610
get married and other things like this

00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:39,710
but when you hear and when you say

00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:41,270
something some phrase like this you

00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,890
automatically put yourself in a

00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:45,380
situation of unhappiness in current

00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:47,300
moment and I believe that knowing

00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:49,820
yourself deeply answering all these

00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:51,200
questions that I was asking you today if

00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:52,730
you can we will be able to find

00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,880
something that really makes you happy

00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:58,130
now and enable you to live your life

00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:01,630
because of the state of happiness and

00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:06,290
I'm really sure that it will be more

00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:07,850
fulfilling more efficient in any parts

00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:09,290
of your life in a professional life in

00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:11,330
your personal life because if you choose

00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:13,490
this job because you are happy it will

00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:17,210
be much more performing employee or if

00:36:13,490 --> 00:36:19,700
you choose this you know relationships

00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:20,349
because you are happy it will be it will

00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,559
bring you even

00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:29,109
happiness in the end and so this is what

00:36:23,559 --> 00:36:31,239
I truly stand for right now and this is

00:36:29,109 --> 00:36:32,650
oh this is the same situation this

00:36:31,239 --> 00:36:34,269
leadership so leadership is not

00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:36,640
something that you need to work higher

00:36:34,269 --> 00:36:39,970
to life to deserve to be one one day it

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:42,160
is something you can do already today to

00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:43,569
change other people's lives because one

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:46,660
of the feature of a leader is a

00:36:43,569 --> 00:36:48,400
responsibility as courage to take

00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:50,380
responsibility for something bigger than

00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:53,109
yourself for the project for the company

00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:55,299
for the team and once you know yourself

00:36:53,109 --> 00:36:58,660
very well you are able to lead others

00:36:55,299 --> 00:37:00,489
with full transparency so I wish you to

00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:03,880
start being a leader today and see what

00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:06,069
impact you can create tomorrow so thank
