Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	You’re tracking your Drupal development project with one or more spreadsheets. You know there’s a better way, and you’ve heard of other tools, but just have not had time to do some research. This session will help you get started: with a quick but thorough overview of popular tools and alternatives that are available to help you better manage your next Drupal project.

Depending on the size and complexity of your project, you’ll walk away with a shorter list of tools to try, or maybe new options to explore as alternatives. .

This session is a follow-up and update from the session presented at DrupalCon New Orleans. We'll look at improvements and additions to projects plus some new ones!

We’ll review and highlight the key benefits and drawbacks of using tools including:

Trello
Asana/Instagantt
Agantty
Wekan.io
AgilePad
Taiga.io
TaskBoard
Are there others you’ve tried and either hated or loved? Bring that experience to our session and we can all share!.
