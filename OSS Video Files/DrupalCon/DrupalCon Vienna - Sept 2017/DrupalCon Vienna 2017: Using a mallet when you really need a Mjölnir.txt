Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Using a mallet when you really need a Mjölnir
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	You’re tracking your Drupal development project with one or more spreadsheets. You know there’s a better way, and you’ve heard of other tools, but just have not had time to do some research. This session will help you get started: with a quick but thorough overview of popular tools and alternatives that are available to help you better manage your next Drupal project.

Depending on the size and complexity of your project, you’ll walk away with a shorter list of tools to try, or maybe new options to explore as alternatives. .

This session is a follow-up and update from the session presented at DrupalCon New Orleans. We'll look at improvements and additions to projects plus some new ones!

We’ll review and highlight the key benefits and drawbacks of using tools including:

Trello
Asana/Instagantt
Agantty
Wekan.io
AgilePad
Taiga.io
TaskBoard
Are there others you’ve tried and either hated or loved? Bring that experience to our session and we can all share!.

[Music]

00:00:08,549 --> 00:00:11,089
nice

00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:25,890
I think we have enough people right we

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:32,309
can start Everson I should wait I was I

00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:34,410
was ordered to wait so I know I'm

00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:37,340
catching up on my slack like just hold

00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,340
off oh wait wait

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,379
it's hard to do a presentation when

00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:44,699
you're in your slight is everybody here

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:46,739
on triple psych

00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:48,989
by the way does it ready or not know

00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:52,890
what slack is just over that it's okay

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:56,970
if you don't it's like there is a Drupal

00:00:52,890 --> 00:01:00,930
slack if you're not on it I recommend

00:00:56,970 --> 00:01:03,150
you get on it so you can find out what's

00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,549
going on in your particular neck of the

00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:08,340
woods or your line of interests there's

00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,830
channels for project managers just like

00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:17,270
there is channels for developers highly

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:18,479
highly recommend it I think we're up to

00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:23,939
5,000

00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:25,320
4,500 or 5,000 users so it's really

00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,450
handy when you're stuck at the middle of

00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,680
the night it's 2:00 a.m. and your client

00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,680
is expecting something at 9:00

00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,670
okay

00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:55,490
alright let's let's get started I

00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,800
apologize for the delay for those that

00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:59,540
just walked in I was asked to hold off

00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:02,290
starting for a few more minutes there

00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:07,190
was a coffee break running a little long

00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:10,820
let me get started you're in the agile

00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:13,580
sprint tools rundown how when to use a

00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:15,890
mallet when you really need a mule 'nor

00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:19,190
everybody knows what Mjolnir is right of

00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:21,709
course so Thor's hammer is called

00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:23,930
a mule 'nor I don't have a picture of it

00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:28,610
but it's pretty impressive if you ever

00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:29,960
watched any of the Marvel movies it's he

00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,040
Kunal is the only one that can pick it

00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:36,140
up and it's a it's an appropriate title

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,370
so let's get started let me tell you a

00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,010
little bit about myself and what we're

00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,810
gonna do here this is a quick session

00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:43,910
it's hopefully gonna be 20 minutes so we

00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:46,760
have enough time to do some talking and

00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,500
questions my name is Chris urban I'm a

00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,510
manager and professional services in

00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,180
aqueous I'm from Philadelphia in the

00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:56,750
United States it's my first Drupal con

00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:59,360
and probably last in Europe I've been

00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,120
playing with triples since 2008 was

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,350
anybody at the Prix note this morning

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:08,330
okay so you know a little backstory

00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:09,190
there oh yes I was wondering who they

00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,930
belong to

00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:14,630
I'm a certified scrum master I'm a site

00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:15,950
builder I'm actually a ship I used to

00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:18,710
actually do some development a long time

00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,060
ago which is how I got started like

00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:22,040
everybody else you were looking for the

00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:25,330
perfect solution tried building on

00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:29,420
yourself played with Joomla WordPress

00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:31,520
Moodle PHP nuke net nuke whatever else

00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,050
was out there and settled on Drupal and

00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,870
I've just stuck with it ever since it's

00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,400
my by far my favorite I actually come

00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,080
from a marketing agency background

00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,600
publishing newspaper business

00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,730
so all those frustrations with working

00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,590
with designers that are still locked in

00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:50,200
the world of print I've heard it all and

00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:53,990
this session is really to talk about

00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,460
some alternative tools to JIRA which is

00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,790
like the big elephant in the room that

00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:00,950
everybody either wants to use is lucky

00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:02,720
to use or you're in can't afford to use

00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:04,160
and if you're like a medium to small

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,480
agency

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,040
and you don't have the budget for it

00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,740
there's plenty of other tools that are

00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,750
worth trying so this session hopes to

00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:14,330
kind of go through a lot of these and

00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:16,520
maybe this will spawn interest you might

00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,740
want to go and play with these more but

00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:21,320
nobody has time to sit down and install

00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,580
all this stuff and play with it so that

00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,310
was the goal here to kind of go through

00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:27,410
a mall in quick succession give you the

00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:30,640
highlights the lowlights what sucks what

00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:32,720
doesn't and hopefully one of these might

00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:36,940
deserve some attention from you and your

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:41,750
project so any questions before I begin

00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:44,330
okay so we talked about it what is there

00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:47,840
that we can use in place of JIRA know

00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:50,450
I'm a JIRA nerd first and foremost so I

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,910
have a very heavy bias front JIRA I

00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:55,790
respect the power and it comes right

00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:58,370
great responsibility so I wanted to keep

00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:01,850
in mind there is a list of assumptions

00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:04,490
and desired features and I still haven't

00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,140
found what I'm looking for but there is

00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:08,960
a lot that's out there that shows a lot

00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,820
of promise so a couple a couple key

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,490
things to keep in mind I'm trying to

00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:16,910
rank what I've gone through with an eye

00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:19,040
towards you know your you've been using

00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,510
Google sheets or Excel it's not enough

00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,669
you don't want to go all the way into

00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:26,960
JIRA you're already familiar with agile

00:07:22,669 --> 00:07:28,910
maybe scrum or Kanban or both and I'm

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,419
giving a preference to stuff that's off

00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:35,000
the shelf easily installable something I

00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:37,310
can host myself maybe and most

00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,210
importantly it's cheap so it's free

00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:43,760
right or it's a perpetual license or

00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:45,800
let's say the least preference per seat

00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,919
license and that is actually the model

00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:52,190
will see a lot of the X dollars or euros

00:07:48,919 --> 00:07:54,800
per month for ten users that sort of

00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:56,600
thing in terms of a wish list the things

00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,330
I was looking for I want something that

00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:01,070
will help me with project planning and

00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:03,520
ideally keeping track of the resources

00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:08,390
that are on the project this is a high

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:09,560
goal it's a hard bill to fit I'd like to

00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,870
have something that allows me to manage

00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,640
a backlog so I have a lot of requests

00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:15,260
from my product owners they wanted to

00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,169
get it into the upcoming sprint or

00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,210
planned into your

00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:22,210
development how do you keep track of

00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:23,800
that and if you are running a scrum

00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,330
sprint cycle an iterative development

00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,909
cycle something that will allow you to

00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:30,909
keep track of the work in progress any

00:08:27,909 --> 00:08:33,279
sort of tracking of effort if it's hours

00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:35,769
or points just so that you have some

00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,070
feedback mechanism for your estimation

00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:42,130
process ideally if there's any way to do

00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:44,560
reporting so I can see who did what for

00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:46,990
how long when or where there were

00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,990
problems in the last sprint to raise

00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:51,760
these in your retrospective so now that

00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:54,519
I've given you my wish list I'm gonna

00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,560
tell you off the bat I have yet to find

00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,810
one that fits all of them so don't be

00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,820
disappointed this is part of the part of

00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:05,949
the process there are a lot of good

00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:07,149
candidates I will say that but nothing

00:09:05,949 --> 00:09:10,149
there's still nothing that fits

00:09:07,149 --> 00:09:11,529
everything yeah right now this is gonna

00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:13,420
be fun this is the first time I'm doing

00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:16,209
this in this kind of format so if this

00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:18,519
is really cheesy just bear with me it's

00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:22,570
only 20 minutes we're gonna do this like

00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:24,310
a radio station top 10 list alright so

00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,440
number 10 coming in this week in the

00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:30,370
agile sprint tools countdown number 10

00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,140
is my collab my collab is a Trello like

00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:34,750
tool if ever is are in here familiar

00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:37,750
with drama okay awesome so this is a

00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:40,209
good base line it includes a Gantt chart

00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:42,730
milestones and time tracking which is

00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:45,190
not in Trello unless not out of the box

00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:47,500
it lets you do some issue management you

00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:50,079
can install a community version this is

00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,600
the key word to look for here on Linux

00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:55,060
or Windows but like JIRA it needs Java

00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,220
to run so don't consider this

00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,470
necessarily easy to install

00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,390
so to understand like level of

00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:03,040
complexity I have juror running on this

00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,110
laptop because that's the kind of nerd I

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,930
am but I don't try encourage you to do

00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:11,199
it at home they have to give you an a

00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:13,089
sense of the cost $19 a month for ten

00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:15,970
users hundred dollars a month for 60

00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:18,160
users so this is kind of in the size I'm

00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:19,540
thinking a typical medium small to

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,389
medium shop you've got a couple of

00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:25,839
projects going on this is probably in

00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:28,959
your size range but this is number 10 in

00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,899
the list so it looks kind of familiar

00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,639
right you've got your dash

00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:35,639
on the left you've got this kind of

00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:40,860
messages pseudo slack sort of tool in

00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:42,839
there they separate bugs from tasks I

00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,990
just picked this one screenshot this is

00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:50,309
not a good representative example but it

00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:53,040
has it's it's okay it's great now this

00:10:50,309 --> 00:10:55,199
is really stupid but for me one reason

00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,059
why this is at number 10 if you go to

00:10:55,199 --> 00:11:01,589
the home page there's still lorem pips

00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:04,470
so that to me is not a good sign

00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:06,959
I'm just you know if this were me I'd be

00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:09,600
like okay somebody's got to get on this

00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:13,040
day so one reason this is at the bottom

00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:17,939
of my list alright number nine this week

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:20,009
for this con assemblee anyone here use

00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:21,420
assembler if I'm sorry I should do this

00:11:20,009 --> 00:11:24,569
for each one has anyone here used or

00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,879
familiar with my collab awesome say so

00:11:24,569 --> 00:11:30,119
now to tools you've never heard of you

00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:32,009
don't need to go play with assembly has

00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:33,749
a really one thing I like from the

00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:35,189
developer perspective it has an

00:11:33,749 --> 00:11:38,879
interface it has an integration with

00:11:35,189 --> 00:11:42,809
github it's slick looking it looks nice

00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:45,269
but it's expensive so comparatively for

00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:48,829
the number of users it's a little more

00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:52,170
pricing this does have the animation

00:11:48,829 --> 00:11:53,759
this does have some of the basic items

00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:57,360
here so I've kind of put in the key

00:11:53,759 --> 00:12:00,089
typical tasks for a dummy project you

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:08,429
can see this Trello like board right so

00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:10,050
to do doing done you can here instead of

00:12:08,429 --> 00:12:11,939
dragging the rank you have to use this

00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:14,009
up/down priority button but pulling them

00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:19,949
into the quote sprint is pretty

00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:21,149
straightforward but overall it's okay it

00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:23,730
still doesn't have a lot of the features

00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:25,439
of things that I want from let's say a

00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,959
JIRA and then again I hate to say it

00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:30,720
like that but little errors like that

00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:32,999
still pop up but you have a pretty

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,170
straightforward sprint board and I'm

00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:37,230
trying to keep it as simple as possible

00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:39,990
it includes all these other bug fixes

00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:42,850
categories so it's really more oriented

00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:46,500
as like a support help desk

00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:49,450
kind of tool rather than a spring tool

00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,100
it does have this like overall reporting

00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:53,470
so if you have let's say your entire

00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:55,750
backlog the equivalent in JIRA would be

00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:57,250
like a version reporting and this

00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,220
calendar feature which is pretty nice

00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:02,080
that's another thing that is not in JIRA

00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,970
and some of the reporting that if you're

00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,400
familiar with your straight you know

00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:10,000
typical scrum level reporting so

00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,660
reporting is good the UI is okay kind of

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,820
expensive

00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:16,210
all right let's keep going one more

00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,190
thing

00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,990
Oh integrations there's a lot of things

00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:22,150
that this connects with and it comes

00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,370
with so there's like a wiki you have a

00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,540
stand up tool which is kind of nice so

00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:27,370
if they don't talk to me about that and

00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:29,530
slack later I can tell you some other

00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,120
tricks Twitter I don't know why you want

00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:37,300
to connect Twitter to your sprint board

00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:39,670
like we completed a ticket whatever but

00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:42,520
the development integration they get and

00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:46,900
SVN hooks are pretty nice all right

00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:48,640
number eight rest you board so quick

00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,160
little background I did this session an

00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,800
earlier version of this at Drupal con

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,450
New Orleans so year and a half ago and I

00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,390
talked about this project then and it's

00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:00,490
still worth being in the countdown for a

00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:03,040
Trello alternative this is a good one

00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:05,530
because you can self host this on your

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,860
own instance and there's no restrictions

00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:10,750
so it really is a more open source model

00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,000
than what Trello is and this is even

00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,530
more timely because Trello has been

00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,650
acquired by Atlassian as you probably

00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:18,940
know the only problem and I don't know

00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,710
that they've still fixed this is that

00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,910
there's some issues with performance in

00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:22,930
Internet Explorer but if you're an

00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:26,670
internet explorer you have bigger

00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:30,610
problems so let's do a quick demo here

00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:32,260
again the way this thing loads it's very

00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,600
very Trello like and in fact what I do

00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,700
here is I load a JSON export from a

00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,310
Trello board so I have the same list of

00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,740
tickets and you can see you know your

00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:43,600
members of your team what they've been

00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,850
assigned to you drag them across the

00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,520
columns you can add details you can

00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:50,710
upvote which is kind of nice

00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:54,220
it's you know it gets the job done it's

00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:54,940
good one other nice thing if I scroll

00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:00,310
back up I hope

00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:02,650
remember this you can do maybe not you

00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:03,820
can do multiple selection of cards which

00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,750
if you're in trouble you know it's

00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:09,940
pain-in-the-ass you have to get each

00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:16,390
single one to assign them keep going

00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:19,150
keep going and the other nice piece that

00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:21,850
this does have at Trello does now is it

00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:24,190
gives you a list view and a calendar

00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:26,650
view also so again there was two extra

00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:29,320
so this is your let's trade traceability

00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:32,350
your activity log you have this kind of

00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:36,610
basic reporting the list of tasks or

00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:41,080
permissions you can have email

00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:45,960
notifications so it becomes very Trello

00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:49,150
like right okay there we go and

00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:51,550
multi-select so that's the task list so

00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:52,900
I can do this as a bulk list and then

00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,700
the counter so you can see when their

00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,260
due dates are scheduled so you can

00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,180
publish this kind of information

00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:01,810
those are nice features and a Gantt

00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:05,980
chart so that's why this is number eight

00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:10,870
in the list all right keep going number

00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:16,240
seven I have to sound like a DJ orange

00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:19,450
scrum this is a new one this is tricky

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,450
to install there's a free version that's

00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:24,130
the community version it's it I have

00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:28,450
still yet to get it installed on my

00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:30,100
laptop it's it's tricky there is a demo

00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:31,950
online that you can play with so the

00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,810
screenshots I'll show you are from that

00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:37,270
and it's a little bit different revenue

00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:39,070
model or a cost model where they give

00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:41,890
you the basic set of tools and then they

00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:44,650
charge you for the add-ons so in that

00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:47,110
method they can do like defect tracking

00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:49,089
or a Gantt chart or the ability to

00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:51,700
resource allocations you have to pay per

00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:53,920
module and they're not cheap they're you

00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:57,510
know anywhere from I think 50 to 100

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,860
dollars or Euros whatever it is per

00:16:57,510 --> 00:17:02,830
element so it can get expensive pretty

00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:05,650
quickly what is nice is that it has a

00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:07,600
template so you can say a design ticket

00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:09,549
versus a backlog ticket and

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,959
sure the way people are entering in

00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:13,539
their stories differently which is

00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:15,850
interesting they give you the task list

00:17:13,539 --> 00:17:17,980
as well as a Kanban board and it comes

00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:20,970
with apps to integrate with slack and

00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:23,350
iOS and Android which is kind of nice

00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:25,030
again it's open source so you could

00:17:23,350 --> 00:17:28,390
literally host it anywhere you want for

00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:30,309
free you can do their hosting for not

00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:33,130
too bad you pay a one-time perpetual

00:17:30,309 --> 00:17:34,960
license for 10 users or let's say $1,000

00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:36,669
for 50 users and it gives you a year of

00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:40,059
maintenance and support so if you need

00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:44,590
any help getting set up its included so

00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:46,659
again 12 months that's $10 $20 for 10

00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,549
users it's in the same ballpark what I

00:17:46,659 --> 00:17:50,289
would expect all right

00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:52,120
so quick walk through what this thing

00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:53,230
looks like again dashboard you're seeing

00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,850
how these things look familiar

00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:56,710
they kind of organize everything and

00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:02,110
give you this summary reporting which is

00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:04,210
kind of slick you can keep track of all

00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:05,860
the milestones in your project by list

00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:08,350
and then if you go up to the top you'll

00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:11,380
see you can jump over to basically the

00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:13,360
Kanban view so this is the Trello task

00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:16,900
board view that everybody's familiar

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,700
with and the same things work it keeps

00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,559
your reporting you can set up email all

00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:23,590
the whole nine yards again you get it as

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,450
a nice convenient task list and that's

00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:29,559
it so that's that one and then the next

00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:32,100
slide I should show creating a new

00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:35,080
ticket I think that's what I did in here

00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:36,789
remember what I put in here oh this is

00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,820
oh actually I don't that that one there

00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:41,950
we go there's a place for files the

00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,929
add-ons this is what's really cool these

00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:45,280
are all the extra pieces that I was

00:18:43,929 --> 00:18:47,679
talking about but you have to pay for

00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,289
that stuff so in this demo they give you

00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,909
a taste of it essentially but the Gantt

00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:57,159
chart is not included you have to pay

00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:58,659
for that but handy all right so that's

00:18:57,159 --> 00:18:59,799
that one all right let's take a break

00:18:58,659 --> 00:19:00,880
from the countdown I talked about some

00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:02,919
stuff that they didn't make the cut

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:06,010
because I tried to limit it to ten which

00:19:02,919 --> 00:19:07,659
is really hard if you think about it one

00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,980
of the projects I talked about last time

00:19:07,659 --> 00:19:12,510
I still think it's interesting

00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:15,520
especially have a very developer centric

00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:18,340
organization this is like about as

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:21,260
simple of a project management tool as

00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:23,630
you can get which is basically marked

00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:26,390
texts and I took the slide out that

00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:29,510
shows it but it's literally text using

00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:32,030
hashtags at symbols percent symbols to

00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:34,190
track and tag the different lines of

00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:37,880
work and you would basically I guess

00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:40,220
commit the file to your repo and which

00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,900
is kind of meta but you have everything

00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,460
tracked in one text board and it has a

00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,260
front-end renderer that turns it into

00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:46,790
something that's pretty nice I don't

00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,230
think this is for your average team but

00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,299
that's why it's kind of worth mentioning

00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,790
three more and I just didn't get a

00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:55,880
chance to play with these enough or the

00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:56,690
1i time I had it wasn't as interesting

00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,820
or appealing to me

00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:01,280
pivotal trackers one is I've seen use a

00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:04,429
lot but this is like for really some

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:07,520
really small teams the costs for that go

00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:09,410
up pretty substantially mingle is worth

00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,660
interesting that has a pretty slick UI

00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:14,179
too and version one I just have an

00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:16,370
interest to play with as much so again

00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:19,820
next time I do this talk I'll try to

00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:22,070
cover those oh this PDF will be added to

00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,500
the deck so don't worry about scrambling

00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:25,669
it write all these things down and I'll

00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,400
give you the list at the end too

00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:30,200
all right number six on the countdown

00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,970
Libre board or we can so used to be

00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,950
called Libre board before and it's

00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:35,150
another rest gia board you see where

00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:38,900
this is going

00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:43,130
it is - Trello so they became we can and

00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:45,350
it is pretty slick it runs on meteor and

00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:47,330
sandstorm which means again installation

00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:50,559
is a little tricky if you want to do

00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:53,360
this yourself and I wouldn't attempt it

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:58,250
what is interesting is that the way they

00:20:53,360 --> 00:21:01,130
build this it's kind of like Steam so

00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:03,890
instead of steam for games it's there

00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:06,770
the meteor sandstorm platform for

00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:09,530
project management apps which is kind of

00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:11,870
weird it's not I mean it makes sense but

00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:13,400
it's not what we're accustomed to so if

00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:14,960
you go up to the apps up at the top left

00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,260
you'll get this list of other things

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,490
that you can install download and add on

00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:21,350
one thing here I want to know it again

00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:23,750
it's multi selection like why is this

00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:26,600
not in Trello is being on me you need a

00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:29,120
chrome plug-in to do it everybody else

00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:33,020
has it but it's Trello

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:38,270
pretty much all right that

00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:40,910
stop number five I really love a ganti

00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:42,860
and I'm really glad a I'm here in Europe

00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:44,930
because these guys are in Germany and

00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:47,600
they have put a lot of effort into this

00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:49,250
tool they're kind of like the Dark Horse

00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,920
in the background building this really

00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:53,960
really simple tool it's a Gantt chart so

00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:57,230
it's the most basic project management

00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,460
tool they have done a lot of improvement

00:21:57,230 --> 00:21:59,990
over the last year and a half I've been

00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:03,890
keeping an eye on these guys and it's

00:21:59,990 --> 00:22:06,500
really worth looking into it's free they

00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:08,030
have added synchronizing to a Google

00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,010
Calendar they give you unlimited

00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:12,170
projects and teams there's a full

00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:14,780
traceability audit for every change

00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:16,940
that's been done you can draw your tasks

00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:19,190
now which again sounds really mundane

00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,170
and basic it didn't have it originally

00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:23,030
and that was lower on my list because of

00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:24,380
stupid things like this they've just

00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:26,540
added this maybe in the last three

00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:29,780
months you can draw your task and you

00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:31,820
can do the dependency chart so X tasks

00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:34,100
is dependent on this one and if you're

00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:36,380
planning out your project that is really

00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,540
really important it includes a chrome

00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,700
app so you don't have to go to them you

00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,260
don't have to go to the site and they

00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,940
support exports which are really nice

00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:47,480
they give you a lot of nice basic

00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:49,040
reporting so for a small team I would I

00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,710
would definitely look at this this is

00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:53,120
really cool this is one of their this is

00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,610
the reports doesn't really show you

00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:58,190
anything this is a little bit better so

00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:59,780
this is kind of how this thing looks so

00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:02,960
what I'm trying to show is drawing an

00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:05,030
additional task and you fill in the fill

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,950
in the blanks as to what it is and you

00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:10,070
can assign it give it a do not adieu

00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:12,740
deadline add some other notes if you

00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:15,530
drag it to make a dependency it'll show

00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:18,920
up in the dependencies it's got a nice

00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:21,680
UI right so adding a dependency is that

00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:24,200
easy this was not possible three months

00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,450
ago they are making a lot of progress so

00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,680
if anything else keep an eye on them and

00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:29,900
come back and visit them in another

00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:33,830
couple months but multiple teams

00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:35,000
multiple projects it's it's like all

00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:38,420
right that's why we're in the top five

00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:41,960
now number four this is another one of

00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:44,870
my favorites tige that i oh this one is

00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,120
about as close as I can get to

00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:50,540
Trude you're a replacement for a smaller

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:54,290
team it's python-based if you know JIRA

00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:55,490
you know how to use this and again one

00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:57,590
other like from the developer

00:23:55,490 --> 00:24:00,080
perspective having that integration with

00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:04,100
github or any other like a bit bucket

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:07,130
any other repository is is mandatory so

00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:09,950
that you know what's going on you can do

00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:12,080
this hosted for free so you can try it

00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:14,540
out basically and then if you really

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,000
want to use it you pay subscription fee

00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:20,090
again the same kind of per month model

00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,160
if you want to shell out ten thousand to

00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:26,020
support the development you you know you

00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:29,809
can get everything for for 10k forever

00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:31,880
they allow you to set this up on your

00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:33,590
own server and they give you unlimited

00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,530
users and I'm a little bit of unlimited

00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:39,020
projects so again worth playing with

00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:41,900
setting up is tricky is hard because

00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:45,650
it's Python it's not what you expect but

00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:49,970
this is kind of a mix between asana and

00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:52,280
Jorah so again the list of activities I

00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:53,900
go to my backlog view I get the

00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:58,340
reporting to see what my burn down is

00:24:53,900 --> 00:25:01,040
like adding a story is real easy right

00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:02,780
and if I want to do multiple tickets I

00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:09,710
just do one line per thing and it'll

00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:13,910
automatically add them in and now

00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:16,309
there's my stories right you can tag

00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:19,070
them on categorize them you can

00:25:16,309 --> 00:25:22,070
customize the estimation you can

00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:27,890
customize the workflow States and it's

00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:30,200
got a pretty slick UI right so now I'm

00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:31,640
going to add it to my sprint and so on

00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,940
and now if I go to the task board for

00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:37,070
the sprints similar cat typical board

00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:40,400
setup you can customize these however

00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:43,400
you want it's it's not bad it really

00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,200
isn't and you get that nice reporting up

00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,510
at the top which is like how far are we

00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:51,370
you know how many points burned down and

00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:54,910
so on and so on so definitely worth

00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:54,910
definitely worth looking at

00:25:55,530 --> 00:26:00,690
Oh block tickets right Oh forever this

00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,400
so this is actually nice and you can

00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:04,530
relate the tasks to each other which is

00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,270
quicker by the search which you know if

00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:09,300
you know JIRA everything is written the

00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:12,030
same way you really can't do that it's

00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:14,760
meant to be less ticket number versus

00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:16,200
the actual summary of the ticket which

00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,990
is good because it kind of reinforces

00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:22,470
the need to make the summary in English

00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:24,240
not you know ABC - two four five nobody

00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:26,610
knows what that is

00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,260
and this is a well because I'm having

00:26:26,610 --> 00:26:31,200
burn anything down yet but their

00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:33,330
reporting is actually pretty nice - all

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,350
right let's keep going you know there

00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:38,970
was one other thing I want to make sure

00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:41,790
I put in here oh and the team settings

00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:43,920
is really cool it does it slightly

00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:45,870
differently it's much more human

00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,760
organized and the filtering is nice we

00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:51,180
like I think I showed before searching

00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,770
by user and you can filter automatically

00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,690
what the tickets are rather than having

00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:56,940
to go into JIRA and create a create a

00:26:54,690 --> 00:27:00,030
quick filter you can just do it like on

00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,630
the fly this also has plug-ins for

00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:03,060
HipChat

00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:04,560
and slack and again I think I've

00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:08,820
mentioned it has all the connections for

00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:15,540
web hooks github bitbucket and so on all

00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:19,260
right number three crocodile crocodile

00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:20,580
crocodile anybody heard of this one all

00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,950
right so look at all the fun stuff

00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:25,380
you're learning so this is yet another

00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:28,890
after ten of these okay stop please

00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:31,440
another Kanban card system but this if

00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:35,670
the ones I showed you had a neat UI this

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:38,460
one is slick what is really cool when

00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:39,810
you join the project they force well

00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:42,180
they don't force you but they strongly

00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:44,940
recommend that you do a little

00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:47,100
onboarding game so everybody knows what

00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:49,440
a ticket is what's the point of a user

00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:51,840
story where to put it it goes in the

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,270
backlog you prioritize it you plan out a

00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:57,210
sprint like all the basic concepts

00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:58,890
covered in the first ten minutes so this

00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:01,020
way your users are like there's no

00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:02,730
excuse than not have them do their

00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:04,679
tickets right I know it's it's never

00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:06,510
enough but the fact that they made an

00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:09,149
attempt to make it a game they actually

00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:11,460
give users points during the course of

00:28:09,149 --> 00:28:13,200
you're onboarding so you can make this a

00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:15,570
little competition like who has the best

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,029
score after the first week I have not

00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:19,589
seen anybody else do this this for that

00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:22,440
alone that's what gets us up into the

00:28:19,589 --> 00:28:23,729
number three spot another nice thing is

00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,529
that the triggers that they give you

00:28:23,729 --> 00:28:28,519
between work flow states which I haven't

00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:31,169
seen so if X kind of ticket goes between

00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:34,499
state a to state B you can have a

00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:38,519
trigger in action send an email give it

00:28:34,499 --> 00:28:40,499
a flag ping slack that's kind of nice so

00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:43,589
you know all tickets going into QA could

00:28:40,499 --> 00:28:48,239
show up in your select channel it's not

00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:50,609
cheap but it's it's definitely worth

00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:53,669
investigating and it has a free trial so

00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:56,009
it's worth playing with so this is like

00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:58,499
a quick view inside of one of the

00:28:56,009 --> 00:29:00,119
backlog planning again very simple I

00:28:58,499 --> 00:29:02,399
forgive me for this epic I was just

00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:04,979
trying to build something in but very

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,479
easy to start stubbing out a backlog

00:29:04,979 --> 00:29:08,369
which is always to me one of the biggest

00:29:06,479 --> 00:29:11,070
challenges with a product owner base

00:29:08,369 --> 00:29:13,499
team just put something in there and now

00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:20,129
here you see the quick history where it

00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:21,989
is who it belongs to and then I think

00:29:20,129 --> 00:29:24,299
it's an epic ok so then after I have my

00:29:21,989 --> 00:29:26,460
epic you go up to the plan and you plan

00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:29,519
your sprint so the tickets that I've

00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:31,589
added and you basically pull them in and

00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,690
it does this little waiting crocodile

00:29:31,589 --> 00:29:35,159
thing now what out while this is going

00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,450
you'll notice up at the top you see that

00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:38,700
I have twelve hundred twenty-five points

00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:40,440
because that was I did most of the

00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,419
onboarding so I earned all these points

00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,429
and the first time you do a transition

00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:46,440
the first time you write a story the

00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:49,429
first time you close a ticket you rack

00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:55,080
up all these points so that gamification

00:29:49,429 --> 00:29:57,919
element really really cool all right one

00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:00,089
more so this is the sprint level board

00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,499
this is just show you how you can

00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:03,599
organize and change this you can

00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:06,599
customize this as you see fit this is

00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:10,309
what comes out of the box and you can

00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:13,469
change it exactly how however you want

00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:15,719
alright so that was number three all

00:30:13,469 --> 00:30:18,239
right a couple more that just missed the

00:30:15,719 --> 00:30:22,140
list ice scrum

00:30:18,239 --> 00:30:27,570
so I scrum is French outfit

00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:29,370
and I don't make this the right way the

00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:31,980
intentions are good but it's still

00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:34,830
clunky it still needs a lot of work

00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:37,890
it's Java based you can run it locally

00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:41,670
again the install factor really really

00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:43,710
high complexity there is a free cloud

00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:45,690
version now which is nice this didn't

00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:48,600
exist a year ago you can set up one

00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:50,370
simple public project if you want to pay

00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:53,190
for it the pro version gives you a nice

00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:55,530
back icebox and Road mapping features so

00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:59,640
the long-term planning element is

00:30:55,530 --> 00:31:01,410
included but it still needs work so I'm

00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,169
gonna say we revisit it another one is

00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:06,660
Gemini this is another pretty good Giri

00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:08,190
alternative it has a very intuitive

00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:10,290
layout once you see it you know where

00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:13,440
everything goes the filtering is really

00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:15,929
nice but and it has an integrated chat

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:19,200
but the prices it's kind of in the

00:31:15,929 --> 00:31:22,410
ballpark but it's still a per user not

00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,260
ten dollars a month for 10 users per

00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:27,240
user this is really expensive I think

00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:29,580
you can do better bang for the buck for

00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,440
this basically so the first one was like

00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:36,080
it's not quite there this one it's just

00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:38,100
too freaking expensive that one the

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,980
Gemini one looks a little bit like this

00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:44,580
and it looks well I hate to put it this

00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:50,160
way it looks like 2003 this is like your

00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:52,309
Windows NT dotnet looking tool look so

00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:55,200
that to me is like yeah not good enough

00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:58,260
this is a dotnet SHOP tool right this is

00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,510
not a Drupal tool all right one I

00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:02,520
haven't played with and not but what

00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:03,660
played with enough but shows a lot of

00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:07,830
promises oh do

00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:10,620
oh do oh do will you marry me oh do I

00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:12,840
don't know this is another one that has

00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:14,160
that platform mentality of buying

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,470
applications for the different pieces

00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:19,350
that you need so you can get one for

00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:21,510
setting your own Salesforce type tool

00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:24,090
another one for issue tracking another

00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:26,010
one for manufacturing or inventory if

00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:29,730
you're doing point of sale so this is a

00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:33,840
very broad platform view I mean a nice a

00:32:29,730 --> 00:32:35,860
platform like huge Enterprise not let's

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,980
say the small medium size age

00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:41,230
see that I have in my head as a target

00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:43,929
it includes this Trello like tool which

00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:46,030
is kind of nice and it has its own slack

00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:47,500
light but again okay the fact that you

00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,700
have your own slack slack is good enough

00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:51,370
you can do it for free

00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:53,920
why would you build your own tool they

00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:56,280
include the timesheets in charting which

00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,990
kind of tie into the inventory

00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:01,059
manufacturing point-of-sale retail store

00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:03,190
kind of perspective I think it's more

00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:05,940
than you possibly need so that's why I

00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:08,410
didn't put it on the list

00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,620
weirdly enough it's built in Postgres

00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:13,870
sequel and Python which seemed kind of

00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:16,690
unusual to me but whatever I'm not a

00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:21,340
developer what am I talking about

00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:23,890
all right number two one thing everybody

00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:25,059
overlooks all the time and so I'm

00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:27,760
putting it here in number two to

00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:30,130
reinforce it is pointing tickets if you

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,770
are still doing like the fists and Skype

00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:34,929
or your way everybody puts their hand up

00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:37,030
or everybody just types it into chat

00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:39,309
you're not doing it right it should be

00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:40,600
completely blind everybody votes and

00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:43,210
nobody can see what anybody else is

00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:44,770
doing so I like pointing poker there's a

00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:47,679
couple of these out there if you haven't

00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:50,020
used it try this one and I'll show you

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,640
how it looks like really quickly you can

00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:54,460
figure out however you want to do your

00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:55,750
sizing if you want to do SML Excel for

00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:59,169
t-shirt sizing or you want to use

00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:00,299
Fibonacci or I don't know letters you

00:33:59,169 --> 00:34:03,220
know whatever you want you can do it

00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:05,230
it's very very basic you can go in and

00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:08,800
essentially start up a new session and

00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:10,359
you type in your name you can join as an

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,330
observer which is basically the product

00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:15,879
owner not voting and you can customize

00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:18,490
what your the methodology you're using

00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:20,830
so in this case I'm doing a Fibonacci

00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:22,570
sequence if you're the first one there

00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:24,399
you'll get an ID and that's what you

00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:26,770
share with everybody so I'm in pointing

00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:28,990
poker slash one two three four five

00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:32,440
everybody logs in during grooming and

00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:33,879
you'll see everybody show up and so what

00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,889
I would do is and let me go to the next

00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:37,480
slide so now I type in my ticket I've

00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:40,060
got three people in here that have voted

00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,560
I go in and vote and you see that were

00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:43,419
not in consensus

00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:46,030
I voted thirteen the other two guys

00:34:43,419 --> 00:34:47,889
voted eight so right away you know where

00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:49,720
the difference is and you can call out

00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:51,159
that person and grooming and say hey

00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:53,379
why did you vote so big why did you vote

00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:56,260
so small what are we not missing if

00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:58,660
everybody is in the consensus then it

00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,190
just says consensus and you move on so

00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:02,470
you keep it very very streamlined and

00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:04,480
there's a shot clock at the top the time

00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:05,859
how long it took the vote so if you keep

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,570
every ticket at no more than five

00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:09,340
minutes you can blow through tickets in

00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:11,140
your grooming and that's how grooming

00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:13,300
should work so that's why this is number

00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:16,960
two on my list because if you have a

00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:21,940
tool in your toolbox this should be one

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:23,740
of them all right number one take a

00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:28,780
guess one my number one is I mean come

00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:30,070
on don't say you're in trouble yes yeah

00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,980
it's my number what still is not my

00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:37,510
number one I it you know why it's easy

00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:39,550
it's intuitive it's cheap it gets most

00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:41,170
of the job done it's got integrations

00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:44,260
with all the other stuff if you want to

00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:45,310
go gold it's still it's not and I have

00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,359
to double check that it's still any

00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:50,109
dollars a month because I think it went

00:35:46,359 --> 00:35:51,940
up but for the free one it gives you all

00:35:50,109 --> 00:35:54,609
the important stuff that you need in one

00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:56,020
place everybody can look at it right so

00:35:54,609 --> 00:35:58,450
I'm willing to sacrifice email

00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,890
notifications for having everything in

00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:02,349
one board that everybody knows what to

00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:04,060
do the problem is it's missing true

00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:06,250
Sybilla it's not perfect it's just

00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:07,630
number one on my list but it doesn't

00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,859
have traceability it doesn't have all

00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:10,660
that other stuff that is in the

00:36:08,859 --> 00:36:14,440
beginning of my at the beginning of my

00:36:10,660 --> 00:36:15,849
presentation but it does it it does

00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:19,900
everything right everybody knows how to

00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:21,640
use it so I'm glad you if who's upset

00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,359
with me for making this number one okay

00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:24,099
good

00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:26,260
I would answer this is exactly what I

00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:27,849
wanted I want to instigate so tell me

00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:30,990
why why you don't think you should be

00:36:27,849 --> 00:36:30,990
number one what do you hate about it

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:45,050
I know see that's the hook there you go

00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:48,200
I had you I so the whole the whole idea

00:36:45,050 --> 00:36:50,000
was that yes my number zero is zero

00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:54,950
maybe I should say that way everything

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:57,230
the whole point of this was to be yes my

00:36:54,950 --> 00:36:59,180
mule nor jira is my Mueller that's

00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:00,620
exactly it but I was trying to find is

00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:03,440
there anything that comes close to it

00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:05,030
this is probably the easiest one that

00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,440
will get me there all the other ones

00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:08,810
have a lot of the pieces that go with it

00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,400
but that's exactly that's exactly the

00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:13,820
point of this now you see why this is

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:16,010
such a hard deck to put together so

00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:17,390
already I talked about Jorah I talked

00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:19,130
about Trello I'm not going to show you

00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:23,150
this you everybody knows this you have

00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:25,040
encryption and the extra security that

00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:26,750
it now includes you know what this board

00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,830
looks like I don't need to ever knows

00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:29,900
what this looks like I'm gonna have to

00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:32,330
go through this but what's more

00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,800
important this is the thing you should

00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:36,140
know if you don't know these are ready

00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:39,200
if you know JIRA key shortcuts you

00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:40,880
should know these intro how to quickly

00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,980
do stuff they don't have to click on it

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:46,070
hopefully everybody knows this stuff who

00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:47,660
here knows this already ok good so some

00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:49,750
of you this will be good take this back

00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:52,970
and if you hover over a card and just

00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:57,350
hit space it assigns it to yourself

00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:59,450
that's like the easiest one label ll be

00:37:57,350 --> 00:38:00,650
to switch between the boards so you can

00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:02,540
do everything quickly with a keyboard

00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:03,650
and then escape to get out of it that's

00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,810
the one that I don't have in there and

00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:08,540
the nice trick is copying and pasting

00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:10,700
from Excel if you have a row base list

00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:13,180
of tasks copy it and it'll create all

00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:17,180
the tickets for you slurp it right in

00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:21,980
power user trick so here's the list all

00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:24,380
over again and backwards order again

00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:26,810
this is just my take my attempt at this

00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:29,000
I there's probably other ones that are

00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:31,760
worth investigating but for the sake of

00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,350
time this is a good place to start so

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:37,340
hopefully this will give you some good

00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:39,470
information to try and and ask so please

00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:42,350
let me show you this oh sorry anybody

00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:44,770
else want I'll put the deck up assuming

00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:44,770
to do this

00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:52,230
I don't we go back that oh I get the

00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:53,850
spinning ball of death great so while

00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:58,350
I'm waiting for this to come back really

00:38:53,850 --> 00:39:00,030
