Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Decouple your Twig from PHP and make Frontenders happy!
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	There are quite a lot of talks recently around decoupling (via API) and component libraries (Pattern Lab). But this session is different, it's about:

Decoupling Twig and PHP.
Rendering Twig templates on node.js server — native Frontend environment.
Using Fractal as a component library.
As you would already imagined, that allows us to create, render and test our components w/o any PHP! Pure Twig running in pure node.js but still compatible with Drupal — sounds like a dream.

Come on our session, enjoy the power of Twig+Fractal+node.js and become 100% freshly baked decoupled Frontender!

he'll be fine with you soon okay let's

00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:09,510
go you'll talk about decoupling today

00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:11,759
decoupling nice because how to decouple

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:15,839
your front and from the back ends and

00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,310
why and so I can do this my own actually

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,400
the biggest problem will be intimate

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:23,269
pronounce the last name but okay so who

00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:30,750
we are so next to me there's Anton and

00:00:23,269 --> 00:00:32,669
we are this is a Tesla from one rose as

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,730
well we are working in Basel in

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:39,660
Switzerland and we will talk about

00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:43,350
prompting today okay let me to make a

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,559
brief overview of our talk today first

00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,930
of all we will make a short introduction

00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:53,520
when we will talk about Drupal and

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:56,610
fractal style guide we will talk closely

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,870
about fractal fee for making style guide

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,219
is related from Drupal

00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:04,589
and when we talk about Drupal site after

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,670
that we will see a real demo project

00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:10,979
with complete setup of Drupal and

00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:13,950
fractal working together and we will

00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:20,340
make some conclusion notes to summer all

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:24,000
them up let's go decoupling the standard

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:27,180
way of decoupling things is to separate

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,259
front-end stuff and beckon the API

00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:33,360
interface which allows to isolate

00:01:30,259 --> 00:01:36,329
front-end development and front-end

00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,100
system from back-end system and to

00:01:36,329 --> 00:01:41,820
communicate between them via API

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:45,350
interface but the bad thing about it

00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:49,380
systems are decoupled but people are not

00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:52,020
because front-end developers still

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,799
require to understand the backend of

00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:58,799
Drupal still requests to know its FEMEN

00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:01,229
engine because you know it's pretty hard

00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,570
to write as weak team played without

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:08,310
knowledge words behind it and what data

00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:11,580
what data will be in input to this dick

00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:13,230
template so we will talk about the

00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,530
complete story and what

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:21,060
the coupling on the backhand side let's

00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:23,700
think of back-end as two layers first

00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:27,269
layer is back-end logic where is our

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,430
data is stored and manage it and another

00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:31,890
layer on the backend side is a

00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:35,790
presentation layer which is delegated to

00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:38,700
tweak so let's consider that our back

00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:41,370
end is also splitted into independent

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:48,120
parts first is logic and second is

00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:52,739
presentation theme why should we think

00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:56,040
in such way because it will simplify the

00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,890
whole implementation process of our

00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,900
projects during design during prototype

00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:07,709
in development and so on because we can

00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:10,290
work on presentation logic independently

00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:14,879
from business logic on our backhand side

00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:18,180
and here elegant style guide will help

00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:27,030
us because it will allow us to work on

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:31,349
design independently from Drupal first

00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:33,510
of all let me to remember key think

00:03:31,349 --> 00:03:37,380
behind all of this which is atomic

00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:40,049
design fin about componentization and

00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:46,019
splitting the big interfaces in smaller

00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:49,019
parts but putting things together can be

00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:53,790
really hard like on this real life

00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:56,910
example of assembling a car vehicle we

00:03:53,790 --> 00:04:00,299
have a car body and we have other car

00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:02,359
parts and all of them are produced

00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:05,639
separately on different factories

00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:08,669
probably and sometimes it could be

00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:14,549
really hard to assemble a whole thing

00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:17,220
together but we will try to do okay

00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:19,680
let's now make a brief introduction of

00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,049
fractional component library what is it

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,750
how we can use it and later we will talk

00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:26,719
about how we can integrate with think

00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,759
inside Drupal projects

00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:30,300
first of all a few words about fractal

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,620
itself

00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:38,729
fractal library is a tool Iranian and

00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:41,280
node G s server which is completely

00:04:38,729 --> 00:04:46,289
independent from Drupal and only

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:50,069
requires no GS environment it can hold

00:04:46,289 --> 00:04:53,639
all your Styles components and patterns

00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:57,259
inside it can help you to document these

00:04:53,639 --> 00:05:00,569
things and to build page prototypes

00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:03,779
independently from Drupal so your

00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:05,550
front-end developer can just use the

00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:08,750
single environment without any PHP

00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:15,090
knowledge and to create to create

00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:18,479
complete website interface why to use

00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:20,310
fractal because fractal tool is can

00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,009
gives you a complete freedom from

00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:27,210
templating language its template

00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:31,199
language agnostic so internally it's

00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:34,889
just knows about components and where

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:38,129
interfaces and you can use any template

00:05:34,889 --> 00:05:41,250
with language actually which will render

00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:43,020
these components the key thing is the

00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:48,000
knowledge of components and where

00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:50,639
interfaces well you can integrate this

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,339
component library inside any website

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,219
actually doesn't matter Drupal or

00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:59,099
another system the thing is to separate

00:05:56,219 --> 00:06:03,469
your style gate from your website engine

00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:03,469
completely and when integrated back

00:06:04,099 --> 00:06:11,819
component based design of course driven

00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:14,009
by atomic design we have components we

00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:16,349
can create and maintain them separately

00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:20,610
and then we can compose them inside

00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:24,150
system the important thing here how to

00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:27,029
preview our components because component

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:29,310
itself is just style and template

00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:32,520
probably break it with some JavaScript

00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:34,669
logic but to be shown correctly it

00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:40,610
requires some input some data to be

00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:40,610
inside it here we can hard code some

00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:46,680
example data or we can use faker to

00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:49,570
generate the data automatically

00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,240
according accordance with components

00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:56,200
interface all we can even implement our

00:06:52,240 --> 00:07:00,630
oral or API calls which will provide a

00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:04,150
real life data to our component library

00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:07,780
and of course the good thing about

00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:10,410
fractal it can be run locally on static

00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:17,740
server without any PHP back-end and

00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:20,350
complex web server setup and finally we

00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:26,260
can customize its default theme so it

00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:30,520
will look like our targeting brand look

00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:32,770
and feel and it's created by a company

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,230
not by individual that means that it's

00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:37,390
have a great support and maintenance and

00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:41,740
we can make sure we can use it and rely

00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:44,800
on it in our production projects ok

00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:48,250
enough from introduction words let's see

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,650
what is what is it in the real life here

00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:55,480
is an example on official fractal

00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:58,420
website 24 ways which showing on one

00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,580
side like this is a public website where

00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:02,890
you can see the application of this

00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,710
component library and on other side

00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:08,080
where a special section and with website

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:10,420
showing you all the components

00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,850
registered in the system you can easily

00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:15,190
navigate through them you can show each

00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:19,870
of them separately and to give it some

00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:24,400
context also the cool thing about

00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:27,340
fractal each component has several

00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:31,650
features you can show it's markup you

00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:34,780
can give it a context you could also

00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:38,020
give it a try on different resolutions

00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:44,340
right inside with interface without any

00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:47,700
special tools here

00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:49,590
here is one of examples of complex

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,710
components and layout inside this

00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:57,029
component library you can see how it's

00:08:52,710 --> 00:09:00,630
easy and seamless to work and play with

00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:02,970
components it can be used when by

00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:05,279
developers by front-end developers by

00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:09,230
content managers by designers this is a

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:12,480
real living style gate which can be

00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:18,810
maintained it and accessed by the whole

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:21,480
team this is another example of the same

00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:23,550
component not the same about the fractal

00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,070
this is a component library for a

00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:27,600
different client you can see that this

00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:31,020
is different set of components and

00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,120
different theme giving you a unique user

00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,740
experience and look and feel but it's

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,610
the same internal is the same system

00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:41,040
it's just a collection of components

00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:43,740
registered in the system and completely

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:46,650
independent from Drupal until this point

00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:50,220
we don't have Drupal in any way we don't

00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:52,710
have PHP it's all written and serving in

00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:56,880
node.js server a friendly environment

00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:59,160
for front-end development right and here

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,170
is some internal stuff how to set up

00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,710
components inside the system you can

00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:07,010
read more about fractal components on

00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:10,110
where visual website but the cool thing

00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:13,650
since this system is completely template

00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:16,560
language agnostic we can provide a tweak

00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:20,880
adapter to it so we can use this system

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:23,040
for managing components written and

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:27,750
click that's cool because later we can

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:30,350
use them Drupal is this here is a

00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:35,580
wonderful example of block code

00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:39,750
component and some internal setup you

00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:42,959
can see it later our talk is more about

00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:45,600
conceptual things and demo and setup is

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:49,589
the next step if you when you start

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:53,070
working with it and this is an example

00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:56,160
of more complex component which consists

00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:57,870
of various styles data and layouts and

00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,210
you can see

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:03,060
example folder structure here how it can

00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:05,779
be stored inside you can see CSS CSS

00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:10,140
file if styles at week template with

00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:15,540
markup config JSON which will hold a

00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:25,560
component interface and some files on

00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:28,140
Drupal site here on the left you can see

00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,870
a configuration which describes as a

00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:33,240
component interface it's required to let

00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:36,240
system know about your component how to

00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:46,070
interact is it how to provide data to it

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:48,750
and how to render it okay it's a short

00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:51,990
summary of fractal system what is it

00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:54,180
what is it can be used for but shortly

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,700
it's a component library totally

00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,920
independent from any back-end language

00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,650
totally independent from Drupal which

00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,600
will make it easier to maintain to adopt

00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:07,140
and to learn for your front-end

00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,510
developers now let's look inside Drupal

00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:14,820
and how we will use it in our Drupal

00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:16,350
site ok thank you so just going back we

00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:19,110
just wanted to point out that you can

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,600
also dynamically add content with I

00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:25,500
noted library called faker and that's

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:28,230
quite nice and yeah so why do we use

00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:31,290
need to use Drupal in this case anyhow

00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:33,420
because yeah we kind of need to deliver

00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:35,850
content at some point and we also need

00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:38,040
to store content at some point as well

00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:41,130
as of course server-side business logic

00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:45,150
and all this can be done with frameworks

00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:49,410
like reactive etc but for us Drupal is

00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:52,110
important so but what we are not using

00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:56,220
Drupal for or trying to not use in the

00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:59,339
future is actually theming sorry but our

00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:02,010
for me working in this field for liked

00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:05,390
it to last years trying to decouple

00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:07,910
everything I really highly recommend to

00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:09,980
look at the drupal theming layer because

00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:14,290
all that has been done there it's quite

00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:17,000
important and I still search for better

00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:19,250
examples and so in terms of

00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,670
accessibility as well as in building

00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:26,150
blocks it really gives me again all the

00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:29,210
time a very good feeling seven

00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:31,430
I really should note about this stuff is

00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:34,370
that Drupal 8 and make a significant

00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:36,770
significant step forward in this area

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,780
because in Drupal 7 the markup and

00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:41,960
styles were encapsulated in Drupal and

00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:44,390
it was really hard to separate them but

00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,400
for starting from Drupal 8 is separated

00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,960
from the ground and now we can

00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,210
completely forget about styling and

00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:53,800
FEMEN in Drupal we can delegate the

00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:53,800
content management function to it and

00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:59,330
move our styling and female process

00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:02,980
outside of Drupal but it's now possible

00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:05,860
and it's pretty easy to do with Drupal 8

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:08,600
you completely right on this point so

00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:10,460
let's see how to integrate it in the end

00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,950
the little teaser on the bottom if you

00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:15,590
can spot it already so first of all we

00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:17,570
need a component library and Drupal 8

00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:19,910
which is very nice module that allows

00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:24,130
you to put your themes somewhere else

00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:26,540
then into the theme theme folder theme

00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:30,650
theme template folder sorry that's the

00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:35,540
right word so in Drupal you have the add

00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:37,940
my theme shortage or Alijah the same you

00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:41,060
have with your modules and so on with

00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:43,370
other theme and to broaden this you can

00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:46,670
use the component library next there is

00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:50,480
the tweak field value library with a

00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:52,760
module which we will see later why we

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:56,870
need to use this because handing over

00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:59,570
values is kind of problematic in Drupal

00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:03,290
or it is problematic in Drupal due to a

00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:04,640
very important reason caching and yeah

00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:08,150
and then we need just need to tell

00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,850
fractal instead of handlebars instead of

00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:14,140
nunchucks instead of whatever templating

00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:17,510
language I like I like pack actually

00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,560
please use tweak and we wrote a little

00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:21,980
adapter for

00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:25,730
a Drupal flavor to tweak things so that

00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:27,290
you can use certain things but not

00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:29,810
important at this point so in if you

00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:33,890
want to install it it's down below so

00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:36,800
the basic idea of this is called the

00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:39,470
host template pattern which is not idea

00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,839
but it works so in the end we have my

00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:43,850
theme in the themes custom folder we

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:47,390
have our normal templates folder and

00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:49,130
there we have a page or a node

00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:52,160
whatsoever and this node should

00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:56,810
incorporate a certain component in this

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:59,200
case the box twig template inside the my

00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:02,900
theme in photo mode to actually enable

00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:05,270
the new folder to discover the new

00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,520
folder that's called components and yeah

00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:12,020
its components components components all

00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:16,010
over you can rename it as you like in

00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:17,839
the Box twig file you actually just

00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:21,020
setup what you want to have so the basic

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,940
example would be having a link it's very

00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,550
basic I know but the link consists of

00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:29,839
two variables having a URL as well as

00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:32,360
the actual content and then the actual

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:36,440
template in this case the page HTML Twix

00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:40,060
file would include from this components

00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:43,630
elías box box Twix with the given

00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:49,280
variables content field link your own

00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:52,850
content field link text please

00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:55,850
one note more about this about this

00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,980
hosting played parts in pattern from one

00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:01,120
point of view this is a drawback because

00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,920
it's requires you to write with include

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,720
sentence each new time when you want to

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,170
use a component from your style guide

00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:11,630
library but on the other side which can

00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:14,600
be advantage because you can reuse the

00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:17,209
same component from your style guide

00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,660
into different components for Drupal so

00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:22,490
you can have two systems one is

00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:25,010
components for your style guide style

00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:28,240
components and which is certified by

00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:30,800
fractal completely and another one is a

00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,000
Drupal components which is served by

00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:38,059
Drupal and

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:41,210
using this simple includes you can make

00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:42,890
kind of bridge between them so we

00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:45,140
couldn't be completely different set of

00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:48,380
components on Drupal and unfretted

00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:51,559
and you can do everything you want like

00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:55,280
here for Drupal is a page component with

00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:57,950
its own template but for style which is

00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:02,330
a box component which is different but

00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:04,460
we can use it right here and as I just

00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:06,590
said it's the host template pattern we

00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:09,230
just call it that way because it's like

00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:16,010
grabbing it's not idea but it helps to

00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:18,380
be quick stable and again let's have a

00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:21,289
look you really have to decide how you

00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:24,470
go with your CSS files with a JavaScript

00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:26,600
file so in this case we use a s CSS file

00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:30,590
that's gonna be magically included

00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:32,690
somehow and don't ask and yeah but the

00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:34,820
the example I gave before was a little

00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:36,530
bit different and to be a little bit

00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:39,380
more realistic we actually have to look

00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:42,049
at the handing over the values with the

00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:46,039
phone field for example the emails field

00:18:42,049 --> 00:18:49,880
and they put the field value pipe field

00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:53,179
value that's a filter I believe the

00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:57,520
right would be instead of using for

00:18:53,179 --> 00:19:01,010
example handing over the name as label

00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,640
brackets items and get string this kind

00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:06,650
of makes difference so I'm just slowly

00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:09,320
fastly going into this because if you

00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:12,020
would Kint the values then so the first

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:13,549
one I soak int name items getstring

00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:15,620
would directly give you the string

00:19:13,549 --> 00:19:17,240
what's the problem about this the

00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:20,330
problem would be that there's no caching

00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:23,990
attached so we need actually this pipe

00:19:20,330 --> 00:19:26,659
field value to initialize the render and

00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:28,760
the rendering and if you really really

00:19:26,659 --> 00:19:30,440
really need to do this you actually need

00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:32,990
to trigger the render for this very

00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,570
field in in this situation it's not a

00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:39,020
problem of name or a single string field

00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:41,510
it's more the problem of having related

00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:43,840
entities if those entities change in the

00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:45,510
cache and in this very particular

00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,210
situation the cache

00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:52,140
would not change and would not be

00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:54,570
invalidated so this module is quite nice

00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,580
and it gives you the nice warning I just

00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:59,340
gave you there so you have to do this

00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,690
tweak image when pipe render on your

00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,980
field if you are doing something like

00:20:00,690 --> 00:20:08,780
that red or not so and now I wanted to

00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:12,540
go over with you a demo project we

00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:16,530
developed so far it's not the whole deal

00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:21,900
of course but it shows nicely where to

00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:24,210
go and so we have this nice website that

00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:27,450
is so fantastically designed has a home

00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:30,720
page has a view on the very very home

00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:35,100
page showing three different news items

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,530
in the View mode teaser and of course it

00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:40,020
has a very important forms because the

00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:43,020
web is all about interaction and so we

00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:46,680
can see all the form items that are kind

00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:50,640
of possible we've got a 404 which Canada

00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:53,300
says no and of course we have our news

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:57,270
overview page that gives you a list of

00:20:53,300 --> 00:21:02,220
news items and if we click on a certain

00:20:57,270 --> 00:21:04,710
item we have a very well designed header

00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,810
image as well as an awesome gallery and

00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:09,780
we could put in some text here sorry for

00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:15,600
not doing the pet text what would this

00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:17,850
look like in the style guide the thing

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:20,780
is I just showed you the website so you

00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:26,880
have an idea what the final product and

00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:28,800
doing a living Steiger it actually puts

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,330
me always an awkward position I start

00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:32,700
with the small things I start with the

00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:35,430
atoms and I was saying oh that's a nice

00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,260
button and your clients kind of not

00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:41,670
gonna be impressed by little buttons and

00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:43,380
by a nice red prompt or whatever they

00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:46,620
want to see the whole page and that's

00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:50,430
the reason I tend to show a living

00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:52,860
staggered backwards and for this it's

00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:54,770
not the whole thing but for example if

00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:58,910
we go for

00:21:54,770 --> 00:22:02,960
a simple page that consists of text

00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:05,630
having a text image paragraph as well as

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:08,240
a news stripe we could think of having

00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:11,420
like this composition this could also

00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:14,290
make the whole page and you could also

00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:17,150
go and have a look at the whole page

00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:22,190
independently and see what it what it

00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:23,540
looks like and as well as the form which

00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,940
in this case looks a little bit

00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:28,160
different but it does not matter because

00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:32,180
the form needs to be adjusted to

00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:36,950
whatever container it lives in lives in

00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:39,320
and yes and then the actually the most

00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:42,470
important thing for us is to start with

00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:44,960
typography and here we start all the

00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:49,070
important things that actually atoms

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:50,870
smaller components so to speak and this

00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:54,380
is something you could actually show the

00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:57,080
client saying okay I put a nice mood

00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,880
area a header above it and I put also

00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,880
the bread crumb as well as the main

00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:05,420
navigation above it put slap the footer

00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:07,550
below and boom we have a website and so

00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:10,340
the client slowly understands I can do

00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:13,520
that like this block quote and I can

00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:15,740
show do lists and I can situate images

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:20,210
and I have a table and of course

00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:21,800
different levels of headlines and so if

00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:24,410
we start the other way around saying

00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:29,750
okay we need to define the colors of the

00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:31,550
project so we just link show them we

00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:35,450
need to at least show the icons of the

00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:37,670
project and so we slowly start over B

00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:39,770
with having all the paragraphs and the

00:23:37,670 --> 00:23:42,140
lists and the Ling's and somewhere

00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:45,470
should be the buttons yes default button

00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:46,790
yeah that's so impressive that's the

00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:47,180
reason why I showed you the other way

00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:50,540
around

00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:52,580
and but these are all small items and

00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:55,160
actually those items you don't actually

00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:57,200
reuse you just use because what is a

00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:01,070
button in this situation a button is

00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:05,690
only a class to a link or a button tag

00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:07,750
and so again there's also the next

00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:10,690
problem of having grids

00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:13,480
so I could have rose and I can also have

00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:16,510
certain columns they are not very

00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:18,070
impressive doing this is like just

00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:20,260
colors yes

00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:22,390
that's the reason we actually need to

00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:25,180
separate the very big things from the

00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:27,310
very small things and at some point we

00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:31,600
realized the in-between are the things

00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:33,640
we are actually interested in so I could

00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,410
have a new season that's only consists

00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,830
of the name of the author and as well as

00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:41,650
a title and maybe I can also have a

00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:44,260
Drupal speak View mode being a full news

00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:50,500
teaser and as you realize this fool news

00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:53,830
teaser is as with as the the curl and in

00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:57,010
the current window and as well as an

00:24:53,830 --> 00:24:59,980
image item it's only an image forms we

00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:02,500
will skip and then we can slowly go a

00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:05,560
little bit bigger saying that we have a

00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:09,870
new swarm which then would consist of a

00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:12,940
grid we already seen that a grid of

00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:14,920
certain news items we've seen that the

00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:18,040
grid then holds the news items in its

00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:21,520
width and we can reuse this whole thing

00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:25,770
and if we have a look down below we can

00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:32,430
also see that we just iterate over the

00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:36,640
pattern of the news item 10 View mode

00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:39,370
full news teaser and again naming is the

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:42,100
biggest challenge here and yeah what's

00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:44,560
more important is if we start off with

00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:46,840
having some JavaScript in there so as we

00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,970
seen in the other other demo which was

00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:50,920
going through there was like an

00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:52,960
navigation pulling off and so so

00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:56,530
JavaScript having in there is also very

00:25:52,960 --> 00:26:00,520
important so if I would have a image

00:25:56,530 --> 00:26:04,480
gallery if this would work load I think

00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:05,020
the fourth did work interesting yeah

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:10,120
there it comes

00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:15,379
take some time I can actually I think

00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:20,399
this was with fullscreen No

00:26:15,379 --> 00:26:22,619
okay not you would need to have a

00:26:20,399 --> 00:26:24,629
JavaScript being independently run there

00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:28,649
in there as well and working in there as

00:26:24,629 --> 00:26:32,039
well and mm-hmm and something like

00:26:28,649 --> 00:26:38,519
breadcrumbs makes you startled a little

00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:41,070
bit and I will explain in a short second

00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:43,470
why so just have a look at the actual

00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:47,179
code that is going on there so a little

00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:50,190
bit repeatedly repeated as we just saw

00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:52,200
we named it that way so it does not need

00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:55,440
to be like this so we but we came up

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:59,070
with the idea just slamming everything

00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,139
inside one folder does not do the trick

00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,940
because as I just said we've got the

00:27:01,139 --> 00:27:06,080
perceptual patterns so blockquote

00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:10,980
buttons colors and all that stuff colors

00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:14,179
just needs to be a description in

00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:18,539
fractals saying okay that are my colors

00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:21,840
ideally you would add in there a CSS

00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:23,970
file saying that are my colors and

00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,830
please reuse them buttons can be a

00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:28,559
little bit more complex because we can

00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:32,070
use mix-ins to change colors and then

00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:34,799
finally incorporate them but again

00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:38,730
buttons is just a small tweak template

00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:41,129
and yeah so there are actually the

00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:43,169
things that are we could reuse in every

00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:45,480
project so every company probably will

00:27:43,169 --> 00:27:49,980
have their own perceptual patterns and

00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:51,960
if if you're good and verbalized

00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:55,049
no that's another word he put variables

00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,690
on all of us you would be able to reuse

00:27:55,049 --> 00:27:58,080
in a project and just style it as you

00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:59,789
like

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,029
so layout pattern again that's something

00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:05,970
we reuse and we like to use one kind of

00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:08,249
grid and so we reuse this grid but in

00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:11,100
the end we end up with maybe the same

00:28:08,249 --> 00:28:13,379
classes saying no in this situation not

00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:17,159
saying in rows columns for example if

00:28:13,379 --> 00:28:21,720
you tend to follow the way our flag of

00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:23,549
foundation but here it gets interesting

00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,710
so the functional pairs are patterns as

00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:27,870
I just said that are the actual reusable

00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,670
elements we we came up with and

00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:34,580
we named them bricks departments floors

00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:37,110
and footer because we have quite

00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:38,760
eloquent colleague he came up with this

00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:41,070
idea and yeah why not

00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:44,220
from constructions and it kind of kind

00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:46,230
of works fast so once again we had the

00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:51,720
teaser as you remember the teaser is

00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:56,070
just plain CSS and it is a news may look

00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:59,040
the very same in the code itself and it

00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:02,670
uses a modifier in this case to have a

00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:05,309
big it uses the teaser view modifier to

00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:08,370
show a small or a simple or a full view

00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:10,230
you can do this with two different twig

00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:13,530
templates you can put this inside one

00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:16,710
template this will change how you would

00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:19,559
try to reuse it there are certain ways

00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:22,460
of doing this this is exactly what we

00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:26,910
are trying to achieve with this template

00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:30,000
has been initially stored inside Drupal

00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:32,610
folder right and now we are going to

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,320
separate such logic such presentation

00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:36,750
logic to the separate system to the

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,150
style guide and then in Drupal we can

00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:41,670
just include this fiend without a

00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:44,429
knowledge of its internal representation

00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:50,490
and if we go a little bit bigger

00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:53,250
we saw the list of saw the news wall and

00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:55,140
inside the news wall we saw the include

00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:57,240
and that's that's the fun thing at this

00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:59,610
point so this include actually is able

00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:04,020
to work in fractal as well as in Drupal

00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:06,030
so just think away the wall template

00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:09,480
concatenation back in there that's not

00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:12,860
important so you just have one one route

00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:15,300
to your template file this route is

00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:17,970
relative but it works relatively in

00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:19,500
fractal as well as in Drupal and that's

00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:21,600
the reason why you can reuse the

00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,400
elements and if you are able to actually

00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,980
iterate over those elements you actually

00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:30,240
can reuse those elements in both of them

00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:33,510
and yeah the most important thing I did

00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,630
not do this slider is how to actually

00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:39,900
put all the the assets in there so

00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:40,890
that's also something we will discuss

00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,480
later

00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:44,700
but the most important thing is of

00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,520
course we need to have JavaScript in

00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:50,820
there and having actually the Drupal

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:55,890
behavior style actually works out for us

00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:58,710
so in this fractal Stargardt we actually

00:30:55,890 --> 00:31:01,260
only include the Drupal Jas which

00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:03,600
nothing else does nothing else and

00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:06,299
iterate over the Drupal behaviors object

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:07,799
and then just fires every function

00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,340
that's it there at the attached function

00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,410
that's there

00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:13,500
shoot me if I'm saying something wrong

00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:17,640
and this can be done in fractal as well

00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:20,130
or in whatever JavaScript thing so we

00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,740
can actually have the JavaScript running

00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:28,760
inside the fractal to target as well as

00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:31,559
in Drupal and reuse the JavaScript and

00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:35,070
yeah and so the rest is actually at this

00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:36,929
point it would be nice and you can do

00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:39,630
this we have we have done this in the

00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:41,880
other project is lots of mocking and

00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:44,010
that's the reason you would normally try

00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:45,809
to reuse your components and to mock

00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:47,850
those components that you can actually

00:31:45,809 --> 00:31:58,080
reuse those components and don't copy

00:31:47,850 --> 00:32:02,130
over the whole HTML fine going back so

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:06,510
the realize challenges we face faced so

00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:08,250
far and that's really challenges of

00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:11,070
course there are problems and those

00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:13,290
problems can be solved and you just need

00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:18,210
to address them as the thing I am trying

00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:20,970
to do at the moment so we said we want

00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:23,460
to be decoupled but what's real life

00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:25,200
real life is that back-end actually is

00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:28,620
defined so when your company goes for

00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:34,080
Drupal it goes for may I say a bad word

00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:36,450
type of three and it rarely changes but

00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:40,620
of course there are situations we are

00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:42,450
not all fully going for Drupal but other

00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:45,600
component JavaScript libraries and so on

00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:48,630
we can use this there as well so and of

00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:51,179
course we have to organize ourselves in

00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:53,730
the local domain and this highly depends

00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:55,650
on the team so we can we come

00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:58,680
with the idea of bricks departments and

00:32:55,650 --> 00:33:01,320
floors nap to the fact that we are so

00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:04,130
eloquent and fancy but we realized for

00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:06,240
example we took heavy use of paragraphs

00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:08,250
talking about the front end there about

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,630
paragraphs and that we want to have a

00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:11,490
paragraph there and this paragraph

00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:14,550
should have an image no it's a paragraph

00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:17,520
it should have like something else or is

00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:18,270
it just text and normal text is like a

00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,010
blockquote

00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:22,110
right and the block paragraph you have a

00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:24,510
block paragraph so you're mixing up

00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:26,280
words or the all the way it is very

00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:28,110
important that you know what you're

00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:29,700
talking about and and that point you

00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:33,630
actually need to find your own language

00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:35,820
as well as Drupal has of course complex

00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:39,600
modules like views read crumbs and

00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:43,500
navigation and we ha need to mock them

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,750
so as I just showed you actually mocking

00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:49,520
breadcrumbs or incorporating breadcrumbs

00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:52,320
is quite complex

00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:53,820
it's just lists you know so it's more

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,760
easy to just copy and paste

00:33:53,820 --> 00:34:00,480
the list into your template fold files

00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:04,140
instead of using faker trying to iterate

00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,300
over an object to randomize the items

00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:10,470
and to randomize the contents and then

00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:12,480
see that your actual wrapper is hell has

00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:14,880
the right class and so on and all that

00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,090
stuff so navigation we actually mark at

00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:20,760
this point for fractal but you could

00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:24,360
also use an API doing this but then this

00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:26,940
API needs to be there so we came up with

00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:29,520
the three extremes I was mentioning

00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:32,820
before so we actually have our reusable

00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,380
content components which live in more or

00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:38,010
less the middle of the things so we have

00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:41,520
the elements that are for your site it's

00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:43,320
too small as I was saying so actual

00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,140
paragraphs actual block quotes actual

00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,700
blocks and so on you don't reuse you

00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:49,260
don't incorporate those as TWIC

00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:51,720
templates you just use them give them a

00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:53,550
class and use this class and on the

00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:56,490
other hand you got this and two big

00:34:53,550 --> 00:35:01,020
complex things like for example views

00:34:56,490 --> 00:35:04,640
and going more more bigger those you

00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:06,529
probably mock and those are more

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,000
important to decline than to you in the

00:35:06,529 --> 00:35:09,859
end because if you have a whole picture

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,079
of the website lens this where you go

00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:14,329
you can think about it a little bit and

00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:16,400
the other way so going for a CSS

00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:17,930
framework that kind of defines you what

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,299
you block your links and your blocks

00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:22,339
look like and on the other hand you have

00:35:20,299 --> 00:35:25,460
your documentation of the whole project

00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:27,559
and see what's the demo page so if you

00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:30,230
are paid to do a demo page even before

00:35:27,559 --> 00:35:32,539
launch it's fine to do that in there and

00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:34,279
you can mix in text that's totally

00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:37,130
random and the client would realize hey

00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:40,430
I thought our real text live example

00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:41,690
would not work but now it does okay so

00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:44,779
we are still searching for the right

00:35:41,690 --> 00:35:47,319
solution but for there is UI patterns

00:35:44,779 --> 00:35:49,849
and I highly recommend to check this out

00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:51,799
because the next step is to actually get

00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:53,839
rid of this hast template pattern so

00:35:51,799 --> 00:35:57,890
what we wanted to show you today was the

00:35:53,839 --> 00:36:00,650
actually users usage of fractal as well

00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:07,279
using it in drupal and drupal being a

00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:09,980
content delivery thing mean yes so and

00:36:07,279 --> 00:36:12,170
the the actual idea is to make its the

00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:14,180
compound folders or fractal calls this

00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,940
follows compounds and it's sometimes

00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:18,319
good to have different names for that as

00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:20,559
independent as possible and as self

00:36:18,319 --> 00:36:22,819
explaining as possible so think about

00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:25,819
dependency management this needs to be

00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:27,079
there for those compounds as well but it

00:36:25,819 --> 00:36:29,630
needs to be there for Drupal to

00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:32,660
understand so it needs to be there that

00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:35,210
I can target the JavaScript file I can

00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:37,460
target the the SVG file in there that

00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:39,980
this also needs to be a solution product

00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:43,730
as well as the CSS file when I need it

00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:45,440
and only then and of course there's more

00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:47,960
so when you're thinking about front-end

00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,569
and you at some point have to make a

00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:55,549
decision between HTTP 2 and HTTP one

00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:58,730
short form h2 h1 which gives you also a

00:36:55,549 --> 00:37:01,460
performance inside or to this thing and

00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:03,349
I just learned that HTTP 1 can be also a

00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:05,930
very good performance thing as well and

00:37:03,349 --> 00:37:08,869
as I just mentioned how to include your

00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:11,690
CSS it can be also good to have your

00:37:08,869 --> 00:37:13,759
compound so your component to actually

00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:16,519
inline your CSS with a link statement

00:37:13,759 --> 00:37:18,940
just above the component and not let

00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:22,220
Drupal do all that stuff

00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:25,490
versus a I put everything together and

00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:29,090
and compile it and just serve this one

00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:32,450
and of course JavaScript inclusion it

00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:34,910
may be a framework agnostic so it would

00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:37,880
be nice to not only use Drupal behaviors

00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:40,240
there but something else there's

00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:45,190
probably a solution for that but yeah

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,190
and so why should we use it

00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:52,670
why to use live in style gate it can

00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:56,570
simplify a real life while building the

00:37:52,670 --> 00:38:00,680
project during the whole stages because

00:37:56,570 --> 00:38:03,530
you can work on design independently

00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:07,190
from Drupal you can create various pages

00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:09,980
like these'll shown us recently so we

00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:12,770
can build almost the whole website

00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:14,690
actually without any Drupal we can show

00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:16,730
with the client we can get feedback

00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:19,550
early we can make several iterations

00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:23,120
before we go to Drupal it will save us a

00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:25,670
time resources and it will give us more

00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:28,370
flexibility because it's completely

00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:30,290
independent and it doesn't require any

00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:33,550
additional technologists it's only now

00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:33,550
je server and that's it

00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:44,290
as a result visa leads to better

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,920
communication with clients because we

00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:51,220
can identify the problems in design we

00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:56,050
can identify problems in content

00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:59,650
relation probably as well earlier and to

00:38:56,050 --> 00:39:02,080
react early as well so the whole

00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:04,690
communication between us and client

00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:06,940
during the development process will be

00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:10,090
most moving clear and it will be more

00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:12,820
fun because you know you can even make

00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:17,580
small changes in the design right in

00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:22,650
fractal right in you as a client sitting

00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:25,720
near with you for example of course this

00:39:22,650 --> 00:39:28,300
would be more hard to do with Drupal

00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:35,380
because it's more complex system and

00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:39,000
requires more knowledge and as we

00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:41,230
already said it can be used not only for

00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:43,599
front-end development and for

00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:47,290
communication of clients it also can be

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:50,920
used for by designers as a style guide

00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:54,550
as a content managers so we can see what

00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:57,099
we can do and how we can lay out where

00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:59,080
content from page to page so it's kind

00:39:57,099 --> 00:40:06,160
of a visual language between the whole

00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:10,480
team and between team and client and one

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:13,930
important thing about this separation it

00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:16,960
simplifies the way how we can test and

00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:20,410
maintain maintain our responsive design

00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,750
because just imagine if you have a

00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:25,810
complex Drupal setup with a bunch of

00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:29,770
templates and CSS and JavaScript and so

00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:34,000
on and you can just save a lot of time

00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:36,520
for changes and for preview of these

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,740
changes to the design because when you

00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:41,530
change in the templates when you change

00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:44,380
in the JavaScript or Styles you're

00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:48,720
actually doesn't change don't change any

00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:50,650
content in Drupal so Drupal represents

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,330
component library in some

00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:55,810
way some of the seperation between

00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:59,020
content storage system and style guide

00:40:55,810 --> 00:41:00,700
system is great and it helped us to

00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:03,750
maintain responsive design and to save

00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:08,380
time to verify our changes in the real

00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:10,660
life of course we can use while

00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:13,690
prototyping and using the development

00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:19,270
process as well and on ongoing

00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:25,180
maintenance of active project goes but

00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:27,100
leads us to the next sentence that it's

00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:30,340
it's a false minion that we can design

00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:32,620
the whole project once and when we use

00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:35,170
the existing design until production it

00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:38,220
just doesn't work because we should be

00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:41,010
flexible enough this should be agile

00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:43,630
especially when we are designing

00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:46,600
multi-page website with various

00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:52,420
templates and layouts and we need to be

00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:55,330
able to apply changes quickly not just

00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:58,120
the code but to design because sometimes

00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:59,980
when it came to real life we can see

00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:00,550
that our design just doesn't work in

00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:04,560
this case

00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:04,560
and we should reconsider it again

00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:17,330
that's all I hope yeah the point the

00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:20,660
point is yeah we showed how to use it in

00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:23,510
Drupal but in the end if we would like

00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:25,730
to have a another component so say for

00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:29,170
example we put another angular component

00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:31,580
on the website that needs to look I like

00:42:29,170 --> 00:42:33,680
something we have in the website there

00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:36,110
as well we couldn't put it in there and

00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:38,840
we can reuse the components there just

00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:43,030
as we have seen with the Novartis

00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:46,880
website actually this is a so-called

00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:48,290
living style guide for up to triple

00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,540
seven eight

00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:53,780
a type of three language as well as a

00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:56,060
completely independent framework they

00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:58,670
reuse and so you can build something

00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:01,280
that is totally framework apni agnostic

00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:05,690
and this would be this is also a very

00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:07,960
good takeaway and of course you can take

00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:11,440
it for your next project as I said you

00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:15,650
start building your components to be

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:17,510
reusable in the next project so our

00:43:15,650 --> 00:43:20,950
personal lessons learned and decoupling

00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:25,850
is first of all the CMS still demands

00:43:20,950 --> 00:43:27,680
some difference from the front-end so

00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:29,210
actually in Drupal I really like and

00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,100
it's important to me to get to the

00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:33,170
content so the quick edit or the other

00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:35,360
backing functionalities need to be

00:43:33,170 --> 00:43:38,630
addressed nevertheless and you have to

00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,920
face them as well and sometimes there

00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:42,080
needs to be additional container but

00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:44,720
right now Drupal is very very flexible

00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:47,210
and the theming thing as well as

00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,280
accessibility topics most are mostly

00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:51,230
addressed by the content management

00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,440
system and brings the front and there

00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:56,870
are back to earth and yeah so that's

00:43:54,440 --> 00:44:00,740
also something we really need to focus

00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:05,260
on and yeah the CMS structures front-end

00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:08,240
code so it is very important to have an

00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:10,100
common understanding of in this case

00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,770
Drupal speak I just mentioned the

00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:15,860
example of paragraphs which is a module

00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:17,290
name but kind of differentiates to

00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:20,680
normal from

00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:22,660
or HTML structure but having a blog

00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:26,260
having a view understanding what a node

00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:29,050
is to be something coming up again and

00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:31,150
again that's something that really is a

00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:33,700
good content structure coming from

00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:34,900
Drupal and not everybody needs to

00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:37,090
understand right away

00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:40,630
so think about that and view modes of

00:44:37,090 --> 00:44:43,000
course is also a very very important

00:44:40,630 --> 00:44:44,800
thing for foreigners to understand that

00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,240
they need to limit their self in

00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,720
themselves for the content and to

00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:51,310
imagine that content may reoccur and

00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,620
yeah and as I just said from the Nerds

00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:55,750
never as independent as implied so

00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:57,790
always keep in mind the application

00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:59,380
layer and of course maintenance will

00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:01,840
mess up things that's the reason we

00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:05,730
actually changed to fractal having

00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:08,920
something like KSS so where you'd

00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:12,850
document your actual styling inside the

00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:16,540
jar CSS code s CSS code is kind of

00:45:12,850 --> 00:45:19,180
cumbersome and yeah probably you will

00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:21,490
know that's not you will and this will

00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:24,220
get outdated so make yourself an

00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:27,190
outsourced documentation saying in the

00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:30,370
end saying okay if we use a building

00:45:27,190 --> 00:45:32,890
system with grids for example stick to

00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:36,190
the naming conventions of block and rows

00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:38,260
for example you can think of buttons

00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:42,490
always been buttons but not call them

00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:46,510
BTN and one in one project and call them

00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:48,850
button or whatever in the other and yeah

00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:50,260
try to minimal minimize the additional

00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:52,450
information around the component make it

00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:55,570
themself explaining and of course keep

00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:58,090
discipline mats yeah and I learned this

00:45:55,570 --> 00:46:01,000
from a last project doing this alone is

00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:04,120
really sucks it it is not worth it so

00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:07,000
it's a team workflow if I really try to

00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:08,380
do this alone don't do it you're so much

00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,720
faster you're are so much more

00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:12,820
structured and you would understand your

00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,920
project as well and everybody else will

00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:17,110
understand your project much more faster

00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:20,350
than doing this with a living style

00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:22,000
guide so it's too complex and it's not a

00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:24,070
how low-hanging fruit for us it takes

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,640
more than I don't know at the moment

00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:29,890
like five projects to slowly adopt and

00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:34,270
realize what quirks are there

00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:36,790
and yeah so it really is so going

00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:38,950
further means that you all are

00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:42,040
interested in of course UI patterns in

00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:45,010
this talk is today and there's also in

00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:47,410
lots of other topics regarding the

00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:51,610
coupling Drupal and those slides are at

00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:55,180
slides comm and of course you need to

00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:59,200
contribute to hours sprints and please

00:46:55,180 --> 00:47:02,280
help us to get better and better if I'm

00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,880
too jumpy on on stage please tell me so

00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:07,390
thank you very much

00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,710
we are help happy to have you and we're

00:47:07,390 --> 00:47:15,670
now open for questions

00:47:08,710 --> 00:47:15,670
