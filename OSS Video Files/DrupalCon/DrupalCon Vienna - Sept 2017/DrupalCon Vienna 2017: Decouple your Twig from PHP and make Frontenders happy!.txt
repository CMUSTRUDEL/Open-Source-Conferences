Title: DrupalCon Vienna 2017: Decouple your Twig from PHP and make Frontenders happy!
Publication date: 2017-09-26
Playlist: DrupalCon Vienna - Sept 2017
Description: 
	There are quite a lot of talks recently around decoupling (via API) and component libraries (Pattern Lab). But this session is different, it's about:

Decoupling Twig and PHP.
Rendering Twig templates on node.js server — native Frontend environment.
Using Fractal as a component library.
As you would already imagined, that allows us to create, render and test our components w/o any PHP! Pure Twig running in pure node.js but still compatible with Drupal — sounds like a dream.

Come on our session, enjoy the power of Twig+Fractal+node.js and become 100% freshly baked decoupled Frontender!
