00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,960
okay

00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,880
um hello and good afternoon and evening

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,720
everyone i just want to say thank you

00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,400
all for joining this talk

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,760
um there has been a lot of great work

00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,240
that went into the new

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,519
juvenile front and theme initiative and

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,199
i'm really excited to walk you all

00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,679
through the genesis of how

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:35,120
this theme was formed where we are today

00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,120
and what to expect in the new year

00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,000
so just a bit about myself my name is

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,840
putra von korsi

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
i've been in the jubu community for

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,200
about eight years now ever since i was a

00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,360
senior in college

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,640
i started my career as a front-end

00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,800
developer but now

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,160
recently transitioned into a technical

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,640
project manager role

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,600
at lullabot i live in sioux new jersey

00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,760
usa

00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,199
which is roughly about 25 minutes

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,079
outside of philadelphia if you're

00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,799
familiar with the area

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,960
i'm one of the maintainers of the alvaro

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,840
theme which is slated to be the new

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,720
default front end theme for jupiter 9

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,439
and we soon

00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,040
will be replacing vortech as well um

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,520
here's a sneak peek of what the theme

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,520
looks like

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,040
so before we look ahead i just want to

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:25,119
quickly

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,080
walk you all through how we got here

00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,600
today

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,920
because every journey or i should say

00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,880
um jupiter core initiative has the story

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,720
and it's good to

00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,640
remind us on the early stages of the

00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,680
project because

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,040
there was a lot of legwork that that was

00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,240
done before

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,799
we made the announcement to the

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,799
community and um this

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,399
um presentation will be a slim down

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,479
version from the presentation that i

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,000
gave with my hosho at the drupalcon

00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,960
global but i hope that it will still

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,720
give you all

00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,320
a general sense of the process and also

00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,399
workflow that got us to where we are

00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,880
today as well

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,399
so if i had to pinpoint a moment in time

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,840
where the conversation of the new

00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,520
juvenile theme started

00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,080
i would have to say the last day of

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,280
jupitercon seattle 2019

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:13,599
which feels a long time ago

00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,440
in my opinion um so i happened to be in

00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,080
a hotel lobby waiting for a friend to

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,000
meet up for

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,640
dinner while waiting for my friend to

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,280
show up i happened to see mike hosho who

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:26,000
is my fellow colleague

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,200
larry escula and also angie baron who

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,319
are the

00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,120
drupal core committers and also project

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,720
product managers as well in the lobby we

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,120
started to have conversation about what

00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,599
makes

00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,879
a good cms theme and naturally that led

00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,319
to the discussion of the

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,000
juvenile status as well um so during the

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,760
discussion mike and i were surprised to

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,239
find out that there was no initiative in

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,040
place

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,440
for juvenile defaulting and we thought

00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,120
that

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,280
this would be a good opportunity for us

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,319
to join in and also contribute to

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,319
back to the community as well

00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,000
and also having been in the community

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,560
for a while we knew that

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,280
you know vortech was created for drupal

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,800
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:09,680
and has long served as the default theme

00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:12,000
but it's nearly 10 years old and the

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,560
design had begun to look a bit outdated

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,560
and

00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,640
we feel that it no longer spoke or

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,120
reflects the modern background that

00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,800
drupal shifts under the hood

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,200
um so we want to change that perception

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,200
and bring something fresh and modern to

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,200
the front of theme for us our main

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,080
motivation is to create a good first

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,760
impression

00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,519
for the user which is typically the

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,400
first experience that people

00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,519
get when they first install drupal this

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,080
is the same key point that were

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,280
discussed

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,760
in our casual conversation in the hotel

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,799
lobby

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,440
as mentioned earlier as well what you

00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,319
see here

00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,560
is a look at the very first issue

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,440
related to the new juvenile theme that

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,159
were

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,799
that we submitted to the community as

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,159
you can see

00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,480
it was authored on june 28 2019 which

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,599
was

00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:03,360
roughly almost two years ago

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:05,040
flies um so putting together your

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,200
initial team

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,640
with any big or small initiative you can

00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,200
do the work all by yourself

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,640
you need a core team that can help bring

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,560
in new perspectives

00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,320
and also fill in areas that are outside

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,680
your discipline as well

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,440
for my um and i think of this effort we

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,840
need to bring talented folks and lucky

00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,800
we

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,560
know a lot of great people um so once we

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,560
knew that the idea was valid and also

00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,560
sought effort by the community

00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,240
my our lead friend and developer started

00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,160
to engage lullaby designers

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,280
um jennifer kelsey and also jared as

00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,919
well too

00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,960
for the design effort as well and

00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,520
catcher who's

00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,600
um has been helping us well with the

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,639
society and matthew tiff who

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,080
ran our weekly um slack meeting as well

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,080
here's a group shout out to us at

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,160
jupitercon amsterdam um at dries notes

00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,800
presentation from last year

00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,280
um so now that you know we have our team

00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,880
um

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,400
you know be starting to identify

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,360
stakeholders that will help

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,560
um what the proposal process is for too

00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,240
which is the key point in

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,720
us getting tractions and also building

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,560
excitement for this initiative

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,320
so we started to ask like who would be

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,280
the person that would make a breakout

00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:13,120
idea

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,080
who is the maintainers of the issue that

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,840
we need to follow up with as well too

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,440
so with all that questions in mind we

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,479
were able to identify the foreign

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,800
stakeholders

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,000
audrey's motivation for this initiative

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,600
is similar to us he

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,639
wants to create a better first

00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,000
impression of drupal especially for

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:35,199
the users and ge and also

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,919
gabo who are core committers and product

00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,240
managers

00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,120
they help us out tremendously by letting

00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,960
us know

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,400
all the key players that will help

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,160
advocate for our ideas

00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,160
and also christina and also larry who

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:50,240
were involved in the design process and

00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,680
also helped answer questions

00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,160
that we have that help navigate this new

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,120
world of core contribution for the team

00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,080
and um just here a look at elvis um in

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,440
one of our

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,840
discovery um meetings um that we had

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,479
earlier in the

00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,880
initiative so now that we have the issue

00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:10,720
queue

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,240
created and also identified the core

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,080
team and stakeholders

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,280
it's time to get into the weeks or what

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,280
i would say

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,080
some of the fun stuff here is a

00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,319
screenshot

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,840
of all the available components within

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,319
the vortech theme

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,080
we use dropbox paper to gather all the

00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,080
patterns to help us

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,199
better understand what we were designing

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,120
for and

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,560
features that we feel that's a bit

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,800
outdated as well too

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,880
once we identify all the key components

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,400
we started to create wireframes

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,240
to review with the stakeholders to

00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,120
ensure that we capture all the important

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,120
elements as well

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,440
and at this point we created a lot of

00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,360
documentation

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,199
um so it was good to just have

00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,520
a centralized place that housed all the

00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,000
notes from the internal meetings

00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,680
from our design meeting as well too this

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
process was really helpful for us to

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,960
keep

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,960
track of all the many conversations and

00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,199
makes it easier for us to say

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,639
no to when something doesn't fit with

00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,520
the overall scope of work

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,520
of the project as well

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,440
so let's talk a little bit about design

00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,039
as well too

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,199
once we felt like we were at a good

00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,560
place with the component documentation

00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,680
and we started to get

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,960
on board with the design process

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:34,160
this is an exercise called

00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,080
um the analyst um

00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,919
it was a great exercise for us to figure

00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,599
out what the stakeholders are thinking

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,880
when it comes to the tone and voice of

00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,000
the project

00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,759
um to on one end

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,120
um it's a natural that can describe the

00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,039
look and feel of the site and the other

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,720
end as an adjective that usually

00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,720
conflicts with the first as well too

00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,759
so from here um we gather up all the

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,560
design principles that we want out of

00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:59,759
them

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,160
we definitely wanted things to be

00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,759
accessible

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,759
it's definitely the top priority of the

00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,720
design we also want to make it simple as

00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:10,800
well as to

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,639
avoid unnecessary visual elements colors

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,120
effects and complexity we want it to

00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:18,160
look modern focused and also

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,160
flexible as well too

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,080
and here are some design calm

00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,080
explorations that our designers

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,400
jared and jen put together as you can

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,639
see we explore different

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,800
style from traditionals to model one and

00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,840
here is the the final design that we

00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,599
ended up with

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,599
for the alvaro theme

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:41,440
next um we started to

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,000
thinking about the the name of the

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,320
project

00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,519
and um i don't know about you all but

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,399
naming things are

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,040
a bit difficult right um however with

00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,279
the current

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,080
um theme var tech being named after gene

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,800
bartek

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:56,000
one of the original programmers female

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,000
programmers

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,920
we wanted to continue on that tradition

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,880
and name the theme after a pioneering

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,920
female programmer as well so we named

00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,519
the theme after

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,440
and in honor of rachel alvarez

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,279
rachel had touched many people in both

00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,320
the drupal and also the accessibility

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,240
communities

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,680
she works for the national federation of

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,959
the blind and she was committed to

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,080
making technology access

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:24,240
for all and we feel that this theme

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,279
embodies the the patient and generosity

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,399
that um

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:31,600
um that rachel um

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:34,800
showcased um as well

00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,720
so the community announcement so once

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,000
the design was in a good place

00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,720
that we feel validated and some of the

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
complexity within the design element had

00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,160
been sorted out

00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
especially with the header drop down we

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,000
dropped it we started to drop

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,880
a proposal for the community and sought

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:56,240
feedback for the work that has been done

00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,839
um here's our issue proposal for the new

00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,920
juvenile theme as you can see

00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,640
from the earliest slide there was like a

00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,480
lot of work that went into the proposal

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,240
and try and get the design review and

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,480
also key stakeholders

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,560
and also we've done some prototyping as

00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,200
well too to validate our new

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,680
features um and um that would not

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,760
account for it in bar tech as well too

00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,000
um overall the response was

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:23,120
overwhelmingly positive and we were

00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:26,640
thrilled to and excited to see

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,600
folks within community um energize and

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,839
also

00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,399
beyond momentum about this initiative as

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,600
well

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,360
so with any addition initiatives or

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,040
projects there bound to be some

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,959
challenges that you encounter along the

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,760
way as well too and alvaro is no

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,760
different as well

00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,079
and this kind of a project there can be

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,560
strong temptation to

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,800
include everything so it's important for

00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,360
us to draw the line between nice to have

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,600
versus

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,440
must-have which can be challenging at

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,680
times because

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,680
some of the features that folks ask for

00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,519
are valid however it's important for us

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,880
to stay focused and also looking

00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:11,519
at core features that would please

00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:13,760
the general user as well too in addition

00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,959
to you know this being an open source

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,959
project there

00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,480
is also a level of work that we need to

00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:21,920
put in for

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:26,000
um managing enthusiastic contributors

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:28,000
of various skills and also balancing

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,040
a full-time work schedule while at the

00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,120
same time um

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,440
trying to find some time to answer

00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,519
questions and also review patches

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,440
which can be difficult at times as well

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,040
to trying to find free time to to work

00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,880
on that area so those

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,279
are some of the challenges that we face

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,399
during our project

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:48,399
um where is the el rail theme today

00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,240
so now let's get to the good part here

00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,240
um

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,600
and um i just want to walk you through

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,160
where we are today and

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,720
what we've been um we're actually

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,519
looking forward to do in the next um

00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,560
month or so so here's this a road map

00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,560
issue that we created

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,480
um we started this journey around the

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,120
beginning of 2019 almost a year and a

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,160
half ago

00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,240
and i'm happy to announce that up the

00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,720
alvaro theme has now landed in jupiter

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,079
core

00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:19,120
9.1 0 as the experimental theme

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,880
yay um this is

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,959
such an incredible milestone and we

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,440
could have done this without the amazing

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,920
folks

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,720
here who have contributed their free

00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,200
time to the initiative from designing

00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,920
to community coordination submitting

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,839
patches

00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,600
reviewing testing issues and many more i

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,839
really couldn't thank you all enough and

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,800
i hope i capture other usernames here

00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:46,639
and i didn't miss anyone

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,000
so here is a sped up video demo of the

00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,519
alberto theme and so

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,800
in jupiter core 9.1 um this video is a

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,480
bit jarring

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,399
i just want to quickly showcase the

00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,279
different components and features

00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:01,360
that are available within the lro theme

00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,000
from the secondary drop down menus

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,800
to the improve masthead that works great

00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,760
on both

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,360
desktop and mobile breakpoints to the

00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,040
other wonderful features that are not

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,920
available in the current version

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:18,320
of the default front-end theme

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,399
so now that you've seen a sneak peek of

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,800
what the theme has to offer i highly

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,880
recommend checking out this short link

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,880
that houses indicative content of what

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,839
the alaro theme looks like when

00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,560
i'm enabled in drupal i just want to

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,040
give a huge

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,880
shout out to the tugboat team if you're

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:38,160
not familiar with tugboat

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,959
um tuple is a public quest builder

00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,600
that generates live working websites for

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,320
every

00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,199
pr and also branches and tags as well

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,839
too

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,480
through tugboat we were able to set up a

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:53,199
drupal multi-site install and

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:56,160
has deployed preview for content for

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,519
folks to view as well

00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,360
another thing that i also want to

00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:01,279
quickly note is that we've done a lot of

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,600
work with accessibility testing as well

00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,959
too

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:06,639
or ally um we conducted

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:09,120
testing with folks from the national for

00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,079
the federation of the blind and we

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,480
received awesome feedback from that team

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,440
so

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,560
i'm really happy with this result and

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,800
especially thank you to

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,040
kachow for coordinating this effort as

00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,040
well

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,920
now that the elbow the elbow theme

00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,600
has been included in core i'd like to

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,040
give you all an update on things that

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,320
we're currently working on and

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,480
enhancement that we're looking to

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,880
implement in the future

00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:39,279
right now we're working hard on making

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,279
aloe vera a stable thing written core

00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,680
we are already outlining the remaining

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:46,000
issues that will get us to the stage

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,519
where alvaro will be set as the default

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,839
theme of jupiter 9.

00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,680
i think we're close to meeting this goal

00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,279
um right now the majority of the issues

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,519
are mostly related to

00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,199
quality adjusting technical debt and

00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,240
also bug fixes

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:03,040
um if we stay on track we're looking at

00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,399
jupiter 9.2 as the version that will

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,440
make our world

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,440
stable and also set as the default theme

00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,839
for drupal as well too which is the main

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,000
goal that we're trying to hit

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,000
soon so looking ahead post the

00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,279
stable release we're definitely excited

00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,720
to dive more into

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,639
some of the features that we weren't

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,519
able to get through during the

00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,440
mvp phase of the initiative one of the

00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,600
requested features that we've seen

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,480
is definitely the the drug mode which is

00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,040
definitely a trend

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,639
in the web world the other feature that

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,199
we want to showcase

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,720
or work on is introducing different

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,560
accent colors that

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,160
allows editors to pick and choose and

00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,360
edit from and other

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,360
possibilities as well too

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,480
so as you can see there are still a lot

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,199
of work

00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,759
that we need to get done in order to get

00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,160
aloe vera

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,519
stable and also set as the default theme

00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,839
in jupitercore

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,880
as well as adding other enhancements as

00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,399
well too

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,720
therefore we definitely need your help

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,839
to get this work through the finish line

00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,800
um we have a weekly

00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,199
meeting um via the drupal slack channel

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:10,160
um

00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:11,440
it's in the nine dash theme that you can

00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,480
join and also

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,600
help us out too in this initiative as

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,880
well too

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:22,480
um i think i ran a little bit late so um

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:25,519
i'll just end this presentation with um

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,519
questions in q a

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,440
awesome so i'll i'm john i'm going to

00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:34,399
help moderate some questions for

00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,079
poocher here um so we have one from

00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,040
daniel that came in

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:41,120
and says he says the theme looks great

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,079
why did you decide not to include form

00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,320
components

00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:46,480
i'm increasingly seeing an interest in

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,800
forums

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,560
that's actually a great question and it

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,639
kind of goes back into

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,399
um the other slides that i mentioned

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,079
earlier um i think

00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,600
the reason why we didn't include forms

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,480
is that it's

00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,120
not part of the list of the um core

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,680
features

00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,520
written now mvp but we understand that

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,000
you know this is a feature that's also

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,360
um being used a lot by other folks as

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,720
well too and

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:15,520
we do try as best as possible to

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,919
support like a minimum um styling for

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,480
this

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,000
um but you know if this is something

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,039
that you know you guys are

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,839
looking to see more in the future i

00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,760
highly recommend

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,360
submitting a ticket for this and we can

00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:32,640
definitely expand on that

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:34,799
as well in the issue

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,160
great thank you poocher um another one

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:40,799
came from john

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:43,760
um he asks will it be easy to sub theme

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,600
great question as well um so alvaro is

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,120
not designed to be

00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:52,400
a theme that can be easily

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,960
something of this is not something that

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,000
we

00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,960
have originally in our mvp phase um

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,799
but at this again going back to the um

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,280
the form components as well too

00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:04,640
but this is something that folks um

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,120
would like to

00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:08,720
um implement as they're so on our point

00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,080
when it comes to like subthemen

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,640
um this is something that we can

00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:15,280
definitely look into as well too so

00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,880
um i think we already have an issue for

00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,919
the sub theme as well too

00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,880
so i would definitely um

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,760
recommend checking that out and provide

00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,760
you input as well

00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,280
great um so that's all that came in on

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,480
the panel we have about

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,919
five minutes left um i'm going to ask a

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,840
question for you putra

00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,520
and then that will allow time to others

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,240
to kind of think of questions if

00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,520
they're busy typing them in um so one of

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,320
the questions i have

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,960
is so now being this far down the road

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:50,559
where

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,919
we're um with the theme you know still

00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:54,080
being worked on but it looks like it's

00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:55,919
going to make it into core

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,520
anything you would have done to help

00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:04,400
improve the process now looking back

00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:06,559
wow that's a great question um

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,240
i mean to be honest with you i think

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,320
we've done a lot of work

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,840
in beginning stage of the project to

00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,480
identify all the core

00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,200
features that would be included in the

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,960
mvp

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,880
phase um so in that part i i think we've

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:23,360
done really well but at the same time

00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,000
um you know going back to my slide

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,240
regarding

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
some of the challenges that we went that

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,480
we face in this project is that

00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,320
you know it's tough to really you know

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,799
find time to

00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,520
really dedicate to the project fully so

00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,720
i i would

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:41,200
love if we were to be able to you know

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,200
