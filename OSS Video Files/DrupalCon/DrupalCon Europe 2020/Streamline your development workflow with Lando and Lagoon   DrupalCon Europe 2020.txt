ideas giver of lagoon and

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,560
with that um yeah we reached out to

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,520
tandem and said hey why don't we

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,560
connect to open source tools and um

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,759
that's

00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,240
what we did awesome and mike

over to you yeah for the sake of keeping

00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,960
this webinar

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,840
uh less confusing i will also go as mike

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,640
so there should be no confusion at all

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,600
um

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,640
yes i am mike i am mike pierog i am the

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,200
cto at tandem we're a digital agency

00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,720
but we also make make orlando which is

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,360
an open source development environment

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,079
and i'm one of one of the maintainers

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:50,799
awesome thank you to both the mics i

00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,200
feel like we

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,040
need we need some mic disambiguation

00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,320
software for the uh

00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,320
for the closed captions that they're

00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,439
going to put on this i'm sure um

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,759
cool so we're going to keep this chat

00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,640
kind of uh like i mentioned to michael

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,960
firesidy i'm very interested to hear

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,160
from both of you about your perspectives

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,000
uh particularly on local development and

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,040
why these tools are necessary and how

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
that connects

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,440
to the container topic and the and and

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,280
scalable hosting

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,640
um but it's a question for both of you

00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,680
and you can kind of rip off each other i

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,560
guess is um

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,280
like what is the history of of local

00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,800
development

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,480
um i think we've all been in this for a

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,520
while and i don't it wasn't always the

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,599
case that you know

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,200
development would work like this so

00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,720
what's the history how did how did we

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,760
arrive at this point i guess

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,780
i'll let mike answer that yeah i mean

00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,730
how much time do we have

00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,730
[Laughter]

00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,239
yeah i mean the brief history of local

00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,519
development i think is that

00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,959
for the longest time uh just using a

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,680
text editor in a web browser was

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,920
sufficient

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,519
so by the longest time i mean front page

00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,879
used to be a thing and it was cool

00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,640
and dreamweaver was a thing and it was

00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,560
cool and that was sufficient

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,400
um and then for a long period of long

00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,680
period of time after that uh like sort

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,599
of the maps of the world

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,680
i think were okay you know just give me

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,640
php give me a database i can do most of

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,159
my stuff

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,000
versions don't really matter like i

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,640
don't really need too much outside of

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,200
that

00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,400
um and then probably around like five

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,800
six years ago a big

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,560
change sort of started happening one

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,400
container technology became

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,920
uh easier to use more accessible and

00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,560
more mature as a thing

00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,920
and probably more importantly um just

00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,680
the complexity

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,120
of developing a web application all of a

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,000
sudden

00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,760
became increasingly complex um and that

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,720
trend has accelerated it hasn't it

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,000
hasn't slowed down

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,640
so uh for me where we're at now is and

00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,480
this is

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,720
true not just of local development but

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,599
development in general and hosting in

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,519
general

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,879
is that developing a modern web

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,280
application is a complex

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,319
endeavor it requires a lot of different

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,159
pieces

00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,599
that are all individually difficult to

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,280
set up so

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,560
things like lando things like lagoon at

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,480
the end of the day we're talking about

00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,319
how do we reduce that complexity

00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,439
being a developer is hard enough throw

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,040
all this other stuff on there it's

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,360
almost impossible so how can we make

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,959
that

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,959
make that experience a little bit easier

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,320
i think i can echo what mike said it's

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,280
really like

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,280
it i think we didn't really realize when

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,160
we started to use like more complex

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,320
things like

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,360
i used to be a drupal developer myself

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,919
and yeah like just

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,759
one app php version was perfectly fine

00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,800
it didn't matter which one really

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,759
and some kind of database but but as

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,639
um we had more complex systems it got

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,520
very fast

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,040
that it was clear that we not only need

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,960
much more running locally like

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,199
how do you run an elastic search or

00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,400
installer because suddenly we depended

00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,479
on these tools

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,680
and to develop to build custom

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,199
integrations

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,960
and like how do you run all of these

00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:56,800
locally indifferent

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,000
on a linux and a windows and a mac at

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,199
the same time

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,080
and um and just like specific versions

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,680
because you maybe

00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,400
knew that needed specific versions of

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,479
these tools and so that's where

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,560
we tried for a long time we tried to

00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,199
work with vms and

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,919
which sounded at the beginning very good

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,520
and

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,880
because you can provision your vm the

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,600
exactly same that you provision the

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,000
servers

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,680
but especially for an agency that has

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,960
like four or five different projects

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,759
running at the same time

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,440
you ended up like running multiple vms

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,479
and they took a long time to start and

00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,560
to stop

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,240
and so then that's where we then really

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,360
searched further and found with

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,960
containers

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,320
a possibility to a have the really same

00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,520
systems everywhere or the same

00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:42,000
configuration the same

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,639
version but also and having a system

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,240
that really

00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:49,600
fast um starts and stops the sites and

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,280
which is crucial for anybody that has

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,800
more than one website that they

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,560
need to maintain which is the case for

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,720
almost every agency out there

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,240
yeah that's but yeah i suppose almost

00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,840
all agencies these days have got

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,840
multiple things going on at the same

00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,880
time juggling between things so

00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,880
yeah it becomes more important

00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,400
when uh when my business partner um and

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,479
two other gentlemen

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,160
uh started calamine kalamuna about eight

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,680
years ago like we had standardized on

00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,120
the pantheon platform that all of our

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,639
sites were on pantheon we even rejected

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,560
clients if they weren't on pantheon

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,319
or wouldn't move to pantheon and now

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,840
it's very rare to find someone who's

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,039
like committed who can commit to just

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,520
one hosting provider it's

00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,880
very very rare so you really want a tool

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,520
that you don't want to have you know

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,199
like

00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,039
the tool the one tool for pantheon the

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,000
one tool for platform the one tool for

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,199
everything else

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,560
you want to just have the one tool that

00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,759
works with all of them and the interface

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,199
is the same like that's the

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,880
that's like the holy grail developer

00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:41,840
experience and

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,280
you know we the the amount of users that

00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,120
we have now versus like

00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,880
even a few years ago is significantly

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,919
different and

00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,199
i'm almost 10x different and you know we

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,720
like to pat ourselves on the back and

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,560
think oh this is because you know we've

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,680
done such a good job making this and you

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,319
know i think that we've done a pretty

00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,400
good job

00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,000
um but i think the real thing is that

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,479
like this this kind of development

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,319
experience is has has moved from a nice

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,759
to have to just a must-have

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,919
um especially if you're if you're a

00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,880
developer working on more than one

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,479
project or more

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:15,759
or has more than one uh collaborator

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,360
yeah that's nice yeah karen michael

00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,400
and that was one of the reasons that we

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,720
also said like from a lagoon perspective

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,639
and we we don't want to build our own

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,360
island with our own

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,280
um local development tools like we

00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,919
realize quite fast that a

00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,960
what is really sad is maybe the wrong

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,039
word but what is

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,039
what is what is really a problem is that

00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,199
if you install docker locally

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,160
and docker itself doesn't actually bring

00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,720
you a real

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,280
good develop web development experience

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,680
because

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,840
you have missing like pieces like

00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,319
certificate issues ssh keys

00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,960
and just in general like it's a very raw

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,440
docker experience and so as a developer

00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,960
you want you want to test https but the

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,960
certificates are not there and all that

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,360
stuff and so we

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,639
built our own tool called pikmi and more

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,440
like out of need

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,039
and to say hey okay we need some we need

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,599
an aj proxy running and thing here and

00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,759
there

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,400
and that was okay and for the longest

00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,479
time and if you wanted to use land uh

00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,160
sorry if you wanted to use lagoon and

00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,039
which you will use if you host with

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,440
amazio

00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,120
you had to use that tool and that's

00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,680
always felt very

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,440
wrong somehow like because like mike

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,440
said we have so many agencies that have

00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,720
all these different platform providers

00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,719
and so we um we

00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,760
realized like drupal itself the whole

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,479
community we need to get

00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,959
off the island and so we got off the our

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,719
own

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,880
local development tool island and said

00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,640
okay instead of hiring people that

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,800
continue to use p or develop

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,440
pikmi even though it is still continues

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,160
to be maintained but it never will reach

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,440
the niceness of the the cool experience

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,040
that lando has so

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,120
so we reached out to land and said hey

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,480
let's work together and

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,399
at the end we're both open source

00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,279
companies which is great we can help

00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,800
each other

00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:05,760
and yeah i really envisioning that

00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,519
in the end and that an agency just it's

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,040
basically installs lando on their

00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,160
developers computers

00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,959
and and with that they can no matter if

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,959
it's now

00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,080
lagoon or platform or pantheon or

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,760
rockville or whatever

00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,440
and they can they can deploy with one

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,279
unified um

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,040
system and i think that's really what

00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,240
what we believe will help

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,200
everybody at the end and to

00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,360
to have good experiences and very

00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,360
efficient developers because at the end

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,720
wasting time is something something we

00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,279
all hate and so

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,200
and we really hope that with integrating

00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,240
existing tools that we can

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,640
make less waste of time yeah that's i

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,800
mean

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,320
and wasted time in agencies is basically

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,600
the whole game these days if you can

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,080
figure out that you can

00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,040
you can win the game um mike from the

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,200
lando side

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,880
uh maybe give us the 30 000 foot

00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,760
overview of what's actually going on

00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,720
in the box like um i'm not i'm sure you

00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,519
would have had to see

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,480
uh pygmy during you know doing the doing

00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,320
your development so

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,680
how does it differ what's you know what

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,320
what's what's kind of going on inside

00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,680
yeah so i mean on on the the high level

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,600
pitch on lando is

00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,200
you know sort of been hinted at already

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,959
which is that this is the one tool that

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,800
you can use for all your development

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,480
so that should be true whether you're on

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,680
mac or linux or windows it should be

00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,040
true whether you're using

00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,760
lagoon or or mazie.ios like hosted

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,560
solution

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,839
or platform or pantheon or aqua or aws

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,360
or whatever

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:33,279
and the idea basically is like you know

00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,959
you have a configuration file you check

00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,720
into your git repo it's sort of

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,399
development dependency management for

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,399
lack of a better way to describe it

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,240
um you can clone the repository down you

00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,680
can run lando start and then

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,519
when that's done you should have all the

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,640
things that you need to sort of develop

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,440
test and deploy your project um and by

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,880
that i mean you should have the

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,240
infrastructure that you need to sort of

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,399
launch the project so that would be

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,120
things like redis or solar or the php

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:57,360
version or

00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,200
node version the tools you need to

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,640
develop so that's like composer

00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,399
or for for drupal that's like you know

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,760
composer drush

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,120
uh maybe drupal console um and then some

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,920
interactivity with some remote

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,000
environment

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,200
um so that's that's the sort of like the

00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,920
how that's a high level pitch on what

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,200
lando is

00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,600
um behind the scenes it's a it's a it's

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,600
a docker sort of a docker superset a

00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,320
docker utility a docker rapper

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,920
people have said that um you know i

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,680
think calling it a docker rapper sort of

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,480
is a cheap way to describe it uh because

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,320
it

00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,760
it does it doesn't do the do it justice

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,160
uh the kinds of things that it that it

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,320
does

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,360
um it's this is not this is like sort of

00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,560
like describing

00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,440
you know um what's a good example like

00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,200
uh

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,800
you know like a like a like a like an

00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,920
airplane as like an engine

00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,959
rapper you know the airplane's got more

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,440
than just the engine

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,200
um sure but like fundamentally uh what

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,120
lando is doing is is making docker

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,720
compose files sort of on the fly based

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,079
on your configuration and the idea again

00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,279
is to go back to this theme of reducing

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:55,440
complexity

00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,959
you know docker is difficult to do but

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,639
it solves a problem it makes

00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,399
something easier docker compose makes

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,000
docker itself easier lana just sort of

00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,560
extends that one one extra level and

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,680
makes

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,200
docker compose itself easier easier by

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,560
by exposing just like here are like the

00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,839
five things you really have to care

00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,279
about don't worry about everything else

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,440
we'll take care of that

00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,040
so that's that's sort of the idea yeah

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,680
that's awesome

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,079
so so we've got the local development

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,079
side

00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:22,399
of the conversation kind of spoken about

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:26,800
to some extent or going

00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:29,440
michael um amazio mike um

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,279
maybe tell us how lagoon fits into the

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,360
story like how's the

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,959
you know what what is its its job i

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,399
think a lot of developers that that i

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,360
run across and a lot of

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,440
agencies i run across see local

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,200
development as part of what lagoon does

00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,839
and i guess that's maybe

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,200
not not the full story maybe unpack that

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,560
a little bit for us

00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,399
yeah so lagoon is basically an

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,399
application delivery

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,440
tool or at least in the kubernetes

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,040
community that's

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,090
what you would describe these type of

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,160
tools it really tries to

00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:03,200
[Music]

00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,040
make it super easy for a developer to

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,480
deploy their applications

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:12,240
onto a kubernetes cluster

00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,839
and without the needs that you usually

00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,320
need to deploy an application to

00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,839
kubernetes so for example that's like

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,440
you need to write helm charts you need

00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,800
to store these health charts somewhere

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,320
you need to share them with different

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,120
developers you need to

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,720
um kubernetes not actually build your

00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,000
docker images you need to do that by

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,360
yourself and then you need to push them

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
to a docker registry and you need to

00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,519
make sure

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,279
that these docker registers is not

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,079
publicly available because then somebody

00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,480
steals your

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,000
your data and so you need to you need to

00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,760
secure them and

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,240
you also want to have like different

00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,399
environments for different branches

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,240
so you have a dev and the staging that

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,720
the and the production for example but

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,639
you may be

00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,639
also on a deploy pull requests you want

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,680
to know you want to run cron jobs you

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,839
want to run

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,760
um you want to have a backup system you

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,440
want to have a ui that you can see

00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,519
when did we deploy the last time you

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,000
maybe want to allow people to deploy

00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,040
that don't have gate access so all these

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,040
tools

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,240
is none of this is given by you by

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,839
kubernetes if you just start the

00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,519
kubernetes cluster because

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,000
a kubernetes cluster itself is basically

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,440
just a raw piece it's like a raw diamond

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,360
that you need to

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,120
make sure that it does what you want and

00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,839
so that's what lagoon does

00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,680
so lagoon basically sits between your

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,399
git repository and the kubernetes

00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,519
cluster

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:28,320
and it will receive um webhooks

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:31,040
and will look into the git repository so

00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,519
lagoon uses git ops ideas in terms of

00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,360
you

00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,959
configure the infrastructure inside the

00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,360
git repository

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,440
so the git repository like the docker

00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,440
compose yaml in there that is also used

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,519
by lando to start local containers

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,279
is also used by lagoon to figure out oh

00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,320
you need a php you need an engine x you

00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,440
need a varnish

00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,760
and so then lagoon will then internally

00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,600
use helm and to create to create the

00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,639
templates for these different

00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,079
kubernetes objects and then lagoon will

00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,360
actually talk to the kubernetes cluster

00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:03,440
and do all of this for you

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:05,279
so it basically makes it super easy

00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,720
for developers and easy literally means

00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,199
you just need to commit

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,959
into a git branch you push and that's it

00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,639
you wait a couple of minutes and

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,079
uh two or three minutes later you have a

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,839
message in your slack that says hey we

00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,199
deployed to the kubernetes cluster

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:21,680
and so that's basically what um what the

00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,480
idea of lagoon is and we did all of this

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,480
because

00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,240
when we started them easy to use

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,639
kubernetes we realized that

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,480
while it's great after you have the

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,959
application inside the cluster

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,720
it's auto scaling and auto healing and

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,120
whatever else that there is

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,199
and but to get it in there it's super

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,040
hard you need to know a lot about

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,560
containers and how kubernetes works and

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,680
so that's what lagoon

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:48,320
tries to do and so it

00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,600
lagoon itself it is correct does not

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,519
technically

00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,839
worry or do anything about local

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:55,120
development the only div or the only

00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:56,240
piece that we really have to do

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,399
something is a

00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,240
we both lander and lagoon both share the

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,560
docker compose yama file to define

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,079
which containers and because both

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,920
systems are fully

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:10,000
um docker based or con container based

00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,639
we can actually use the same container

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,959
images

00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:17,600
in both places so lando will use

00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:19,199
the same docker images that we that

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,240
could that lagoon uses to deploy to

00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,160
kubernetes so

00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,160
you have exactly the same php version

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,240
the same mysql version the same varnish

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,160
version and also the same configurations

00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,320
so it even allows you if you need to

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,800
change the nginx for any reason

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,800
um the same config that you do this to

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,680
do locally will also happen later in

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,680
production

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,600
and that's one of the things that i

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,000
always envisioned is to have

00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,079
a system that behaves the same way

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,320
locally and then in production and with

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,199
lando and lagoon and containers and

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:52,560
kubernetes we found that

00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:55,040
maybe uh i i remember like maybe four

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,639
four drupalcons ago uh i was talking to

00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,519
michael because we had this like we had

00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:59,519
this uh summit

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,839
hey man

00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,520
yeah i mean it was only a matter of time

00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,520
why is the door closed

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,880
um yeah i remember like four or five

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,360
drupal cons ago

00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,480
um michael and i were chatting and we

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,640
were doing i think this

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,600
this sort of like local development

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,600
consolidation

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,360
buff or something like that where there

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,120
was some there's some desire to like for

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,080
us all to like standardize on the same

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,679
images

00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,679
and like as you would expect everyone

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,600
was sort of just like oh yeah like maybe

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,960
but like i kind of like my images

00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,039
and i remember afterwards talking to

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,559
michael and being like i'd love to use

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:42,000
somebody else's images like i

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,520
like i don't want to maintain these

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,640
images it's like not really what lando's

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,480
like purpose is to

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,919
maintain these images like to facilitate

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,039
like the orchestration of these images

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,000
and do all the things around these

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,520
images

00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,120
and i remember being like yeah like we'd

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,799
love to like standardize standardize on

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,200
the lagoon images and i remember we you

00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,160
know

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,280
i think michael and i were both like

00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,799
yeah like that's a good idea we should

00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,559
do that and uh

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,000
that was four years ago but now we can

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,960
say mission accomplished

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,799
uh we've done it uh so it's very cool

00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,480
that likely when you run the lando

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,400
uh you know lagoon recipe it's like

00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,880
you're running the lagoon containers

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,480
they're

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,320
they're exactly the same containers that

00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,840
you're running uh when you run in

00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,200
production on lagoon so

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,280
i think that's like one of one of the

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,679
very cool things that we were able to do

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,600
um and just easier there's like one one

00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,200
config file one set of images they work

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,960
on both tools and that's i think the

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:30,880
ideal way to do it it's probably

00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,080
well i'm hoping there's a lot of fairly

00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,000
new sort of

00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,280
new to the industry developers in the

00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,799
like that that are listening to this

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,480
conversation um

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,720
and i'm interested to hear from both of

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,240
you there's a lot of buzzwords that flow

00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,760
around in the devops space you know

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,600
kubernetes containers

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,600
you know now we've got orlando and

00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,640
lagoon and uh two mics you know like

00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,400
things get

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,640
things get confusing kind of kind of

00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:56,000
quickly how how important do you

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,679
two feel it is for developers to

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,440
really know what's going on like how

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,120
important is it for a web developer

00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,000
whose day-to-day life is about building

00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,000
websites

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,160
to really like know what kubernetes is

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,799
or containers are and if it is important

00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,720
um not to preempt the conversation but

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,640
if it is important at which point in in

00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,400
somebody's career should they start

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,240
digging into the stuff is this like know

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,960
it when you come in the door on day one

00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,559
or

00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,640
like you know how do you guys feel about

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,799
that

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,039
yeah i mean that's actually one thing

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,320
that we really try to do with lagoon as

00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,720
well is to

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,559
to give a path for somebody that has

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,960
never used kubernetes

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,840
to actually have a guided way into

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,960
kubernetes

00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,360
because i really believe the more you

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,120
know

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,799
about how the infrastructure works or

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,640
how the servers work or how the

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,240
how the platform works the better

00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:47,200
decisions you will do

00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,039
as a developer so i'm all for a person

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,200
if a person wants to read down to the

00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,360
tcp kernel stack

00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,120
go ahead feel free like and you will

00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,360
probably realize something about that

00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,280
will help you with caching or whatever

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,120
but i don't think it is it is a

00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,520
requirement to go in

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,640
so i feel like if somebody just wants to

00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,760
really focus on let's say php or nodejs

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,280
or whatever and

00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,280
doesn't really want to worry about the

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,640
containers and autoscaling and local

00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,960
answers and all that stuff

00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,799
they shouldn't have to first read this

00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,400
like it shouldn't be that you start

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:20,240
your job as a developer and the first

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,400
thing is you have to learn about

00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,240
um all these other things like if you

00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,559
look at race car drivers for example

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,559
they're really good in driving the car

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,559
they're probably not good mechanics they

00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,720
might understand how the engine works

00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,240
but they're not the people that actually

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,520
um develop the new

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,280
the new engine that's what you have

00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,000
mechanics for and so i

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,280
i feel i want to do it very similar what

00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,320
is special about

00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,919
um lagoon and the same also for lando is

00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,400
that it's completely open source

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,600
so you can actually go in there and look

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,000
what is it doing

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,520
um and the fact that lagoon is open

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,640
source you can also point it to your own

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:58,159
kubernetes cluster

00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,960
and you can look what it's doing and so

00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,799
i think this is also a great possibility

00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,159
to like if you're interested you can dig

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,320
deeper you can go to the kubernetes

00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:09,919
cluster you can see how deployment works

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,919
and we try to document a lot about

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,600
reasoning why we why lagoon does

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,240
specific things it's all documented in

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,640
the code

00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,720
and we also have done many um sessions

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,559
about internals like that we explain

00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,280
why things are happening in a certain

00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:26,240
way and so it's really about also

00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,320
um educating people about the craziness

00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,799
of kubernetes and things like that

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,840
so that's how i feel it like it should

00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,280
be

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,039
you shouldn't need any knowledge to

00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,840
deploy into kubernetes but if you want

00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,440
to learn it

00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,039
you should have the capability to jump

00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,799
in and and do it

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,880
and maybe improve it at the end like

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,320
that's that's the best point for us that

00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,679
we maybe have people that come back and

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,799
say hey i have an idea

00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:50,480
to make this better yeah

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,240
yeah i mean i think i think the most

00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,799
accurate if you're if we're being sort

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,559
of

00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,000
uh academic about it i think the most

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,039
accurate way to describe

00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,720
lando is as a devops tool but this is

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,919
not how we talk about it

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,360
this is not how we talk about it i mean

00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,559
it's it's a devops tool made for

00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,520
developers we talk about

00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,960
like it's just a developer tool and you

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,880
know there's there's a small percentage

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,120
of lando users who will like

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,000
go sort of like like michael was saying

00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,400
we'll go down

00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,360
and and and get dirty in like the docker

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,120
level itself

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,880
but the vast majority of lando users

00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,480
they don't even know what docker is

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,080
like lando will automatically install

00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,919
docker for them

00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,080
um they won't have to like deal with any

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,480
docker config so i think the idea for us

00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,000
is like we make it as easy as possible

00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,080
just like go to the website download the

00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,280
thing like it's got an installer you run

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,440
through it like you read the

00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:39,440
documentation there's a config file you

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,600
change a couple settings around and like

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,960
that should be enough to get you pretty

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,360
far down the road

00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,200
um so you know you should be able to be

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:49,840
like lando proficient

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,120
within like five minutes basically um

00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,799
and you don't need to know what docker

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,880
is or what kubernetes is

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,840
or any of those things really you just

00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,679
need to know like

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,120
i've got the site running it's like

00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,559
close enough to production where that's

00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,159
like not going to be a big deal

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,200
if i mess something up look if i mess

00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,240
something up locally it'll probably

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:07,120
break

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,000
there as well um and that's and that's

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,840
that's the idea

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,280
like you really shouldn't have to know

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,840
anything certainly if you want to you

00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,080
can i

00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,880
obviously encourage all studiousness but

00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,559
um

00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:18,880
you know like again being a developer is

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,120
hard like it's already hard enough

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,000
to make a website you know then throw in

00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,440
like how do i get

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,200
like elastic search running on my

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,919
computer and it's just like not fair

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,400
anymore

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,919
so uh that's kind of the problem that

00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,679
we're trying to solve i think

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,120
yeah and it's a it's a it's a problem

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:33,679
worth solving because i think it'll open

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,760
up the

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,039
it opens up the space to more people you

00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,799
know some people are really good at

00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,279
thinking in an application space

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,960
but thinking in an engineering or or a

00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,640
devops or a hosting space

00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,919
just isn't something that either comes

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,799
naturally to them or that they ever

00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,799
learnt about

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:51,360
um so i think it's really cool that it

00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,039
kind of bridges that to some extent

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,799
so let's uh let's take a conversation in

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,120
a slightly different direction um

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,720
i think it's super interesting that two

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,159
open source tools

00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,799
um got together to solve a problem

00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,240
rather than trying to you know kind of

00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,279
roll roll your own you know

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,919
mike on tandem side you you from as far

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,520
as i know

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,760
don't have a hosting platform and and

00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,640
you know we we had pygmy or amazing io

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,240
had big me

00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,159
i mean has pygmy and will probably

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,360
continue to build it out but i think

00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,880
this partnership is

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,480
is is kind of interesting and an

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,960
interesting open source

00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,480
case study for want of a better word so

00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,240
how maybe you can just give us a bit of

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,919
an overview of how this came about

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,520
what the conversations were how did you

00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,600
decide to hey

00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,880
instead of rolling our own let's work

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,919
together you've touched on a little bit

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,919
but let's go a bit deeper there

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,159
i i i i go back to that that triple con

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,440
like four years ago

00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,360
where it was like there's a bunch of

00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,039
people in the room room and

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,200
it went exactly the way that i thought

00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,559
thought that it would uh where everyone

00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,000
wanted to like sort of guard their own

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,640
solution and their own technology and

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,159
stuff and

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,840
totally get that totally understand like

00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,200
why people feel that way but then i

00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,880
remember when michael spoke and i was

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,080
like okay at least one person here

00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,080
besides me i think gets

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,200
it you know which is that like it's you

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,400
know and it

00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,400
you know i thought i felt sort of bad

00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,559
because like lando really wasn't trying

00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,720
like i didn't want lando to be the one

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,320
thing for for everybody

00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,000
um in that sort of way it was really

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,159
meant to be like like this can interact

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,840
with like the idea here is to interact

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,960
with all the other things to connect the

00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,039
things together

00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,799
not to sort of be the walled garden and

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,480
i remember when when michael basically

00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,919
expressed the same desire i was like oh

00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,240
there's clearly there's clearly like a

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,840
very

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,159
deep fundamental understanding here that

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,679
that

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,360
of of how the of how the tools should

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,960
work and how that how the how these

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,480
things should connect together so

00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,200
to me that was a that was like the sort

00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,559
of foundational moment

00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,320
from our side we like i said when we

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,640
created pikmi was more out of a

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,960
necessity and we always discussed about

00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,880
like

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,320
pikmi for example never really had any

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,559
good windows support

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,080
and so we knew that there will be a time

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,000
that at one point the customer comes to

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,840
us and says look i'm all deploying

00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,600
developing in windows yeah you have

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,559
maybe a solution but it's not a really

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,240
nice one

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:06,240
and so we at the end it was also a

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,000
business decision from us as a hosting

00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,960
company like we wanted to provide

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,799
really great development tools for our

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,159
developers like we believe that

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,320
it is the hosting company's

00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,360
responsibility to provide also really

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,919
good tools

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,559
and so we decided okay we could now

00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,440
either

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:25,039
we could hire a couple of developers and

00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:28,320
create basically a complete

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:30,080
separate stream of beside the platform

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,520
or the application delivered to a lagoon

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,480
is to also create a really good local

00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,279
development

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,799
system and so or we could say we look

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,240
into the open source space and say

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,480
instead of us

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,360
paying developers to build our own thing

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,600
we can

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,520
invest into an already existing tool and

00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:48,000
make it better and so

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,559
that was really at the time i don't know

00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,159
how

00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,919
it was probably like a year and one and

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,760
a half ago with like all these

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,640
discussions we already had we always

00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,960
liked lando

00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,240
we we sometimes like used it for other

00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,480
stuff and so

00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,559
and there were also these all these

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,679
discussions within the drupal community

00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,520
to not only

00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,240
unify the docker images we're using but

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,159
maybe actually standardize on one tool

00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,000
but like it is you put 12 people

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,159
together and instead you have a 13th

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,720
tool instead of a single tool

00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,880
and so and so we said okay we'll like

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,480
look a bit into the into environment

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,799
or into the community and see where it

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,559
is going and at the time we saw

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,840
as we are working a lot of agencies a

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,640
lot of time that we talked to them they

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,360
all told us yeah

00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,399
we're really thinking about

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,640
standardizing onlando so we said okay

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,640
that's probably the place to be and so

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,799
we reached out and said hey

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,720
could we work together there what is a

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,840
what is a commercial way that the two

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,760
companies can

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,240
invest into each other and but at the

00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,120
end to keep everything we do open source

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,279
so that's

00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,440
um how we did it from the very beginning

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,520
we had a public alpha release

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,799
of the integration and now we're at a

00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,880
beta stage and

00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,000
we're really um interested to hear

00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,799
feedback because

00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,159
we want to make um lando the default

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,559
that like if you are

00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,480
a lagoon user that you get land or

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,320
automatically installed and or

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,080
like it is already suggested there that

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,760
like our examples have land or yaml

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,120
files in there so you can just

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,960
run it locally and you don't have to do

00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,600
anything at all so that's like the end

00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,440
goal

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:18,320
um to reach because we really believe

00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,720
that a docker itself will probably never

00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,399
do that and they clearly said they are

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,520
not going to focus on that specific use

00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,760
case for

00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,440
docker for desktop i'm not sure i would

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,760
agree with them as a company decision

00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,279
but

00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,919
well that's their decision and and um

00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,399
and i also believe that we as a company

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,520
that

00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:39,440
focuses on the platform and lan

00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,960
and lagoon which focuses on the delivery

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,320
of the app should not really focus on

00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,559
that at all

00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,760
yeah i i also i also think that there's

00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,200
this

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,039
sort of bad assumption that a lot of

00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,120
people make that because lando is sort

00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,880
of like us our side project and it's an

00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,039
open source thing that it's somehow easy

00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,279
to like solve local development

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,960
um and it's not just spoiler alert it's

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,720
not it's not easy to do this is actually

00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,720
a very hard problem to solve

00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,240
and just because lando is using docker

00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,880
containers and laguna's using docker

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,480
containers

00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,399
they're not the same problem like lando

00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,440
is not solving lando is not the same as

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,840
solving hosting

00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,520
um so i think a lot of companies they

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,159
get into this weird situation where it's

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,919
like

00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,120
oh like we start to go down that path

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,480
because we think that they're similar we

00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,520
realize that we're not we realize that

00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,960
it's a lot harder

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,039
we realize oh this is actually sort of a

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,120
distraction from our core mission

00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,080
and then we also realize that even if we

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,240
are to like go

00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,120
down that road and make our own thing

00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,559
we've developed

00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,320
something that developers don't really

00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,159
want like they don't want to have

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:36,080
the lagoon solution the platform

00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,960
solution the amazing they want the one

00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,960
developer tool

00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,720
that they can use on all of their things

00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,640
so i feel like once you go once you

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,200
start to go down that pathway i think

00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,520
like

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,120
you pretty you you put like pretty

00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,720
pretty soon along that path you realize

00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,480
oh it doesn't make a lot of sense for us

00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,039
to actually do this ourselves

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,000
yeah and i can totally echo that like

00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:57,039
the problems that we're

00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,799
facing of running stuff like

00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,840
24 7 in an aha capability is completely

00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,039
different problems than

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:08,320
trying to support every windows and mac

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:09,279
version and now i mean now all the apple

00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,039
silicone stuff

00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:16,159
i mean have fun mic with all that fun

00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:17,919
my macbook's in the mail right now so

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:19,600
i mean we also have to change our images

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:20,240
so that's the other fun piece on our

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,399
side but

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,600
i i yeah i mean there are completely

00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,960
different

00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,799
problems and solutions to the to them

00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,799
i mean you've you've both touched on on

00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:33,600
something i think is maybe an important

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,880
topic as well is most agencies these

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,720
days don't have a single

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:39,840
hosting or can't commit like you say

00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,880
mike to a to a single hosting provider

00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:46,000
um especially as the um

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,000
as privacy and security become a thing

00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,440
some companies dictate where their stuff

00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,840
needs to live right where their website

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,919
and their

00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,679
things needs to be hosted but i i'm

00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,640
seeing it more on the other side as well

00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,200
which is

00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,720
people a lot of agencies are no longer

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,640
just doing drupal even

00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,760
agencies that were traditionally very

00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,240
drupal focused

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,120
are branching out into into other

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,039
platfor

00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,200
other technologies um for want of a

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:11,519
better word so

00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,120
i i know that both both tools can do

00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,600
both but maybe talk a little bit about

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,840
how

00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,200
how having these tooling and and also

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,640
very specifically

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,399
what it what have you seen running in

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,080
the different tools i mean i

00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,799
i think we can probably agree drupal is

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,640
there but beyond drupal you know what

00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:28,000
other technology

00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,320
are you seeing running inside these

00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,320
tools

00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,159
you go mike um yeah i mean

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,720
the the idea with lando is you can run

00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:41,519
sort of whatever um i mean that the

00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,279
i think i think our opinion is that the

00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,200
landscape is getting more complex and is

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:49,279
changing faster not the other way around

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,799
so if if if if the interface that the

00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,320
developer has to interact with those

00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,600
projects remains consistent

00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,679
regardless of how the projects

00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,600
themselves change so you know whether

00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,480
your project moves from pantheon to

00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,840
amazing if you still get clone it and

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,480
lando start it and it

00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,360
the experience is the same and that's

00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,360
that's a win

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,960
but in terms of specific things i mean

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,600
like the obvious ones are the

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,279
ps php adjacent projects so like

00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,120
wordpress and

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,960
larval and symphony and those kinds of

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,760
things but decoupled obviously is a big

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,519
thing as well

00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,799
so you know being able to run a

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,960
decoupled project

00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:24,240
uh and develop that locally i think is a

00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,679
big deal um

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,080
but we have people who use landa with

00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,679
like python we have a few like dot net

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,760
developers who use it

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:33,840
um so really it's it's any kind of

00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:37,039
project

00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,840
cool yeah

00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:42,320
so i think there is probably like three

00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:45,840
different hats that i can answer you and

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:48,080
like as a as a lagoon maintainer

00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,240
i will tell you that lagoon is is

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:52,159
container based so whatever you can put

00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:52,960
into a container lagoon will deploy for

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,080
you

00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:59,200
and fun fact actually lagoon version one

00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:02,240
is deployed by lagoon itself so

00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:05,360
you use legume to deploy itself and

00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,960
so that includes actually like and micro

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,480
service architecture of like 20

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,240
different containers including

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,240
elasticsearch and key cloak which is

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:15,519
based on java and some

00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,559
go systems a lot of nodejs and other

00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:18,799
services so

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,320
i guess lagoon itself is probably the

00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,559
biggest lagoon project

00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,640
and with lagoon 2 that will come out

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:26,399
quite soon we decided to go away from

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,880
that because we realized that

00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:30,640
it's a bit too crazy of an idea to do

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,200
that and it's also not really necessary

00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,640
so

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,559
and we're going to have health charts

00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,360
and that deploy lagoon but

00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,480
and actual applications yeah i mean

00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,679
right now

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,919
we have a lot of drupal and php based so

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:46,960
we see a lot of push into laravel

00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:47,919
um specifically for just like super

00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:50,960
simple

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:53,039
um sites that don't need the complexity

00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,760
of drupal that just need like one single

00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:56,080
form

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,600
to fill out something and of course a

00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:01,039
lot of pushing to

00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,840
decoupled with gatsby or react and also

00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:05,039
more

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,039
just nodejs plain apps themselves that

00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:10,000
maybe talk to some applications

00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:11,679
and and from there though we see also

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,960
pushes into python

00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:17,280
a lot of c can decan pieces so like in

00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,720
open data that's definitely a big piece

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,399
we see a big push into matomo because

00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:24,480
and google analytics is more and more

00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,000
not allowed anymore and for people to

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,359
use for analytics because of data

00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:31,040
privacy or data

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:34,159
privacy concerns so and but

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,520
really like there is no end the the

00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,159
the piece that i would say with an

00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:40,159
amazing io hat on is who maintains

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,000
all of these like in the end you need to

00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,000
maintain docker images that

00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,679
that create the base for the application

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,879
to run on and you need to create the

00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:48,800
helm charts

00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:50,480
that um lagoon will use to actually

00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,399
deploy to kubernetes now

00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,079
we offer specific ones that are

00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,240
maintained by amazio

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,680
and so we continuously monitor them we

00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,720
update them and so

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,160
like that's drupal wordpress php all no

00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,480
chairs that is all covered

00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,280
if you bring something very exotic while

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,640
you can

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,480
there might not be the same amount of

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,359
support and that we can provide so

00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,359
that's where then

00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,560
we have a very open discussion with with

00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,240
our customers saying look

00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,839
you can deploy that we will not prevent

00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,440
you from doing this we just need to

00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,240
understand that the amount of level of

00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,400
support

00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,880
is not the same am right now but the

00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,839
idea is also to have some kind of

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,119
um lagoon community where other people

00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,880
can contribute these

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,960
templates or plugins or whatever we want

00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,480
to call them to support more

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,800
and of them and i think that's very

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,320
similar also for lando where like people

00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,480
i mean as it's open source you can

00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,200
contribute and if you want to create

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,040
um how you call them recipes mike that

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,400
other people can also deploy additional

00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,960
things so that's something we also want

00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,320
to do

00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,320
that we can say okay there might be

00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,720
fully supported ways and then there's

00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,040
like the half supported community things

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,560
and then there's the land of do whatever

00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,760
you want um

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:59,440
and place yeah the land of

00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,800
do whatever your one place is going to

00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,760
be an interesting space for both these

00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,960
projects i think

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,280
it'd probably be a good source of

00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,760
inspiration for like you know crazy but

00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,359
cool ideas for the for the future

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,160
um so i'm interested to hear if either

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:14,720
of you have had

00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,839
had this moment like i i love seeing

00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,359
when you know people who have

00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:19,280
kick-started projects

00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,880
get that like whoa that's cool moment

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,119
when they see some

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,680
company or some initiative or

00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:28,000
organization using their stuff

00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,720
and are like oh it's it's very cool to

00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,040
you know that

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,800
that somebody used that um is there

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,720
anything on either of you or you know

00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,240
maybe mike from tandem side or or from

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,640
lando side at least um

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:42,720
where you were like oh that's super cool

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,720
the death organization is using lando

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,640
um yeah i mean i i think we certainly

00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:52,400
have that i mean to us

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,480
i think the most exciting that's cool

00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,839
moment has been when hosting providers

00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,760
have reached out to us being like can

00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:00,880
you solve this problem for us

00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,160
um so you know to you know for the for

00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,760
the longest time we basically just had a

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,359
pantheon integration so like tip of the

00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,079
hat to pantheon for being up the first

00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,320
mover

00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,920
uh there but over the last year or so

00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,720
like you know we've we've worked with

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,079
within with a

00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,520
with amazing which we've wanted to do

00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,400
for a long time because we feel like

00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:17,839
there's always been a

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,760
a deep seeded uh cultural similarity

00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:22,640
there with open source and other values

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,160
um but platform has reached out and

00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,200
we're currently speaking with

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,480
with acquia and wordpress vip sorry it's

00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:31,040
drupal conference but

00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,920
uh you know wordpress vip and uh some

00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,680
other people as well

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,520
so that that's been the big thing for us

00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,320
is other people realizing oh this is a

00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:38,400
problem

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,359
it's it's like not obvious it's not as

00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,280
easy as we thought

00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,960
a problem to solve like somebody else

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,400
has solved it pretty well

00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,920
and you know we don't want to we don't

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,359
want to just build more walled gardens

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,960
we want to have a single tool that

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,800
connect to all these things so to us

00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,480
that's been the biggest like oh this is

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,800
like so cool that people are are doing

00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:55,599
this

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,960
um there's like a couple organizations

00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,720
that like have used lando that we've

00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,839
been excited about that i'll like just

00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:05,040
not name on air i think i did decide to

00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,040
put you both

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,800
yeah okay cool yeah it's similar on my

00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,960
side i'm not like we had a couple of

00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,720
drupal cons where people walk up to our

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,680
booth and say like hey thanks a lot for

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,000
the images

00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,480
because we're using it on xxx

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,920
whatever.com website you're like

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,599
wait what you're using that on like a

00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,040
top 1000 website in the world

00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,640
our docker images are running they're

00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,000
like yeah i mean they're open source we

00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,359
modify them a bit but

00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,359
they're super great because they have

00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,720
all these things in it and like okay can

00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,160
i please talk about this they're like

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,320
yeah no sorry

00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,599
that's not really like but i mean one

00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:40,240
thing i can't talk about

00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,640
is the australian government where we

00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,599
and

00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,480
two years ago we migrated um a lot of

00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,960
sites over to

00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,000
lagoon and and on a dedicated cluster

00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,440
that is running for the

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,119
for the government because it's a high

00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,880
security environment but in the end

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:54,240
they use the regular open source lagoon

00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,040
version and

00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,640
um that's what a is really nice to see

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,000
that actually government decides to

00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,680
support open source and

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,119
there's actually in the contract things

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:05,040
in there that that

00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,720
does not allow us to run the specific

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,720
lagoon version only for them

00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:10,800
so we actually we have to open source

00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,880
everything which is crazy to see this

00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,359
like in a contract written down

00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,040
and that requires you to open source

00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:19,200
everything you do which is great like i

00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,560
really would love to see more of this

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,800
and and so the piece that

00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,680
um that was for me crazy to see is this

00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,040
whole covet

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,400
and traffic and like the australian

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,200
government of course created specific

00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,560
websites

00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,119
for and the whole um covid situation and

00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,359
like

00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:38,960
the fact that we saw that new websites

00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:41,200
are built within days

00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,960
and they created completely new websites

00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,520
and then also have like

00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,640
um millions of people visiting this

00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:49,359
every hour

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,160
like one of the fun things is that they

00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,839
told us

00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,680
15 minutes though they said that they

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:55,760
opened a critical ticket and said hey

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,720
we're gonna send a text message to every

00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,880
australian citizen in 15 minutes

00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,480
and you're like okay i guess now there's

00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,960
nothing you can do anymore like you can

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,720
like

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,160
there's no way that you can now scale up

00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,119
the cluster you just have to hope that

00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,960
everything works

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,400
and the cluster handled all of it itself

00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,960
it scaled itself up

00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,760
it worked flawlessly and that's really

00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,200
awesome to see

00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,440
like because you know we talk a lot

00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,160
about auto scaling capabilities and

00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,839
things

00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,359
but like and a lot of times like you

00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,200
cannot really test it because there is

00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,200
not really this crazy event

00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,560
where like yeah an endless amount of

00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,880
traffic comes in so that's

00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,599
that's definitely really nice to see

00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,079
that

00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:34,160
governments really trust open source and

00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,680
and invest into it and i think that

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,119
in the end helps all of us because we

00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,160
build better tools open source them

00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,160
again

00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,520
and but by extension it's cool because

00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,119
if they're using you know if they're

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,400
using lagoon then there's a good chance

00:40:43,119 --> 00:40:45,440
they'll probably use lando at the end of

00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,680
the day as well

00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,720
so that's very exciting to know the

00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,800
australian government

00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,920
is uh is using landowner it's also been

00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,839
exciting there's like i think the

00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,599
department of energy and some other like

00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,880
larger universities are using land and

00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,400
that's all very exciting but

00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,839
but to me actually to think about an

00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,359
example that i saw recently like there's

00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:04,160
a company called bramble

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,560
and they make vegetarian dog food and

00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,720
they

00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:08,319
are also using lando so i'm just like

00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:10,480
you know i feel like both ends of the

00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:12,560
spectrum are sort of covered right like

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,000
you've got like this large university

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,160
that's like running lando and that like

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,760
sort of makes sense to some degree

00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,280
but then you also have like smaller you

00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:21,440
know much smaller companies that have

00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,960
like i think probably a single developer

00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,480
uh who are also using this tool so i

00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,319
think that's that speaks to the breadth

00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,480
of coverage that like a tool that uh

00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,760
that lando and and lagoon as well can

00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,319
sort of provide

00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:34,160
awesome so i've only got two questions

00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:34,640
um and they're both from thomas so hi

00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,119
thomas

00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,880
um so one for lagoon and one for lando

00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,359
so we'll we've got two minutes left so

00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,960
in

00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:43,359
in a brief answer i'm starting with

00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:46,160
lagoon uh is elasticsearch soon to be

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:49,839
supported with uh with lagoon lando

00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,839
um either of you

00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,000
sorry michael you can mark mike schmidt

00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,520
um elasticsearch soon to be supported

00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,680
with lagoon lander

00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,720
so we do have support for elasticsearch

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,359
in lagoon

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:04,319
i'm not sure if we are there yet for

00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:05,680
lando locally though mike

00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,040
i don't believe that elasticsearch is

00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,359
one of the supported services that we

00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,599
have

00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:11,200
currently uh running elastics search

00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:12,960
locally is actually sort of a pain

00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,640
sometimes because it just takes a lot of

00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,480
resources to run it so

00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,680
i think there were some hiccups when we

00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,560
tried to when we tried to do it

00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,760
initially but

00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,599
it's something that will happen at some

00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,720
point lando by itself offers

00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:26,720
elastic search so um okay i'm guessing

00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,359
yeah it shouldn't be

00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,000
it shouldn't be too hard so dominic oh

00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,720
sorry

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,280
tom if you wanna if this is something

00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,800
that you need

00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,040
please talk to either your tam on

00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,240
amazing side or just open a github issue

00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,240
and we're happy to

00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,839
to focus on that because yeah we're

00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,440
really at the point that like

00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:45,119
we built the first implementation and

00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,640
now we want to see where it goes so this

00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,800
feedback is very important for us that

00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:52,079
we know okay where do we have to steer

00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,359
and put our focus on awesome

00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:54,720
i think there's a few other i think

00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:56,079
there's a few other services besides

00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,440
elasticsearch that aren't currently

00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:59,760
supported for the lagoon

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,200
integration um i will say though as a

00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,280
workaround though like you certainly can

00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,200
like add the lando elastic search in the

00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,200
meantime and use that if you if you'd

00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,240
like to

00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,440
cool awesome so we have literally one

00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,839
minute left so

00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,359
