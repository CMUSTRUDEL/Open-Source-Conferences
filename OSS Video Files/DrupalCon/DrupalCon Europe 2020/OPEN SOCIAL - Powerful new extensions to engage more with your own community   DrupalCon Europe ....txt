[Music]

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,279
all right

00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,199
so use the q a if you have any questions

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,880
i'll go directly to the presentation

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,279
and and show you what we've been doing

00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,560
with

00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,160
open social and there's actually one

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,359
main thing that i want to demo to you

00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,040
today which is the

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,040
real-time content collaboration

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:44,160
so here we have a

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:46,320
open social installation

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,440
it's a pretty vanilla installation

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,600
distribution

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,120
um so we have the gnt menu on the left

00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,480
side we have the open social menu that

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,879
we set up on the top

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,399
and this is the basic stream page where

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,879
we have our post fields

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,800
see what's going on on the site see

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,879
which members are part of the community

00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,799
and some events that are coming up and

00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,640
i'm currently logged in as a site

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:10,400
manager that's why i have the left

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,600
menu as well and today

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,000
we're going to show you the real-time

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,960
content collaboration and a quick video

00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,240
what we're going to do with the

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,799
real-time chat

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,840
um and if we have time also show you a

00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,119
bit more about

00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,400
live events and webinars so i'm

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,040
i'm logged in as a site manager um

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,880
i'm gonna go first to the topic page the

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,079
topic page is a really basic

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,520
content type in open social and we

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,799
use it to show things like blogs or

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,840
news and you can basically

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,759
set the title you know author name make

00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,799
sure if it's public or community visible

00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,880
only

00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,560
there's some following activity here

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,479
sharing etc

00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:58,479
so far so good we all know this type of

00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:02,399
page but the interesting thing happens

00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,399
when i edit the page

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:09,039
so here we set up the blog type image

00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,000
it's not in any of the groups but here

00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,520
we are actually

00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,920
loading a new editor so

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,640
uh drupal core uses ck after version

00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,680
four

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:22,959
and we use ck editor five

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,640
so we've been able to adopt that for

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,280
open social specifically

00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,160
there's a parallel track to see if this

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,840
can be

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,440
also adopted for drupal itself i'm not

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,360
sure what the status of that

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,879
but we went ahead with it anyway so it

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,879
gives you a new editor

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,879
and that gives you some additional

00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,920
possibilities as for example

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,560
real-time content collaboration which as

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,519
you can see

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,280
is is already active here it's important

00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,640
to mention that this does come with

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,160
a page subscription um

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,680
there's a little bit of background noise

00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,840
here um

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,239
so it does come with a paid subscription

00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:01,040
from ck editor

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,480
you can talk to them about licensing etc

00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,159
but there's something to mention as we

00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,720
are always preferring open source

00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,519
but you know the real-time content clip

00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,599
collaboration

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,519
is something that only currently

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,080
microsoft google et cetera are offering

00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,319
so

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,519
it's a great value of many organizations

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,280
and they're probably

00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,959
also willing to pay a small monthly fee

00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,760
for that

00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,879
so of course i can interact with this

00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,760
other user

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,760
let's say it's json but what i'm going

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,560
to do is now switch to my incognito

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,239
window and log in in the same content

00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,440
type so you can actually see

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,319
how that works so here i'm logged in as

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,760
this other user

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,680
json going to the same page and also

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,799
want to edit this content

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,519
now the two users are set up as

00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,440
roles that can edit this content type

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,440
and therefore they can edit the content

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,000
simultaneously i'll show you

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,519
later how you can specifically set

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,239
different co-authors

00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,640
for specific piece of content but this

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,959
is

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:05,599
role based so what i can do here now is

00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:07,920
either leave a comment so i can say hey

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,519
check this out

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,319
yeah you guys know how real content

00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,560
collaboration works or i can switch to

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,799
the track changes settings

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,799
and

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,160
okay now when i go back

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,320
to my other window i'm logged in as

00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,720
moritz again here that's active user

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,000
i was seeing that jason was adding this

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,040
content

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:39,040
and of course i can then reply

00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,960
i can accept and pretty much work on the

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,000
same content as you know from any other

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,560
tool

00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,440
of course drupal has an extra mechanism

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,880
in place

00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,280
about saving so this pub this content is

00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,880
not published before it's being saved

00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,040
and of course it can also be tied into

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,560
specific workflow

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,080
where somebody else needs to check off

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,039
maybe from legal department

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,400
before the content can be published so

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,160
this is really a huge

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,600
milestone already for for drupal and

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,080
open social

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,600
working with ck editor 5 using real-time

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,400
content collaboration

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,759
and we are working with our clients

00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,600
currently to see what

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,360
use cases are best for that so for

00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,240
example we have

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,320
a module that is called a crowds crowd

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,639
ideation module

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,880
you can post challenges so you know how

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,080
can we drive real world change short

00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,680
online action and people can send in

00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,639
their ids

00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:41,759
so again it's a straightforward content

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,560
but what you can do here is specifically

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,639
set

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,680
say who can call author this piece of

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,440
content

00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,440
so in this case again we're loading

00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,800
five here

00:05:53,039 --> 00:06:00,720
actually say who can co-author

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,919
and edit the content and i can also say

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,800
if users can request co-authorship so i

00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,639
can

00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,360
from a user perspective

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,880
request and the author's gotta get a

00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,600
request

00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,880
whether i should join or not and but i

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,960
can also say

00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:35,840
you know this person karen can also

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:35,840
join or any other co-author

00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,160
so we save it now then of course she

00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,600
gets notifications say you're now

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,199
eligible um so that is all pretty

00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,680
interesting i'm gonna

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,720
see how that goes in the meantime yeah

00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,080
so here we can see all the

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,080
authors and this of course great if

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,280
you're writing a white paper or if

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,880
there's something that you

00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,560
really want to work on with a specific

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,000
group of people

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,080
and the last thing that we are now

00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,880
working on is

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:06,319
making the content also inline available

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,160
so here again we have a simple piece of

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,759
content

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,520
an id actually and you know we have the

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,160
drupal setup that says this is a detail

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,240
page

00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,479
but now there is a tab that says this is

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,800
a content collaboration page

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,680
so when i click on the collaboration

00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,919
page

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:29,120
i go directly to the inline editing part

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:31,199
and it might look the same as a normal

00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,880
field that i was just loading but

00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,400
actually this is the inline editor

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,240
and that's important because it means

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,160
that you don't need to give permissions

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,400
out specific to the user

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,000
based on a role or for a specific piece

00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,879
of content but anybody

00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,199
can make suggestions or comments in this

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,199
field

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,720
and based on the roles i have

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,360
so anybody can make changes and

00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,000
suggestions and only if i'm a site

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,639
manager or

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
owner of the content i can save it so

00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:04,000
this is a way of

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,400
working really with a crowd of people

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,919
where you give a very wide range of

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,599
possibilities to edit

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,000
and you don't need to set specific

00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,440
permissions for the content

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,840
so for each of the use case that you

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,199
might have whether it's

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,520
specific persons that can edit the

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,879
content whether it's a group of people

00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,160
that can edit the content

00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,840
or whether it's a wide variety of people

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,800
that can send in their suggestions and

00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,680
ideas

00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,120
on a piece of content the use cases are

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,240
covered here

00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,640
so we are really excited about uh

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,839
making sure we can do real-time content

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,120
collaboration

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:44,480
uh in open social um and

00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:47,680
offer this as an extension to the

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,519
basic platform of open social so the

00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:53,200
extension model of open social

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,279
is quite important we're looking

00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,279
for different ways to make sure open

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,040
social is a sustainable project

00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:01,600
that we can keep funding the core

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,920
developments and the extension model is

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,839
a

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:07,760
quite a nice way for people using open

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,440
social for their organizations

00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:14,080
to get really fast value by say

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,200
adding the crowd ideation extension or

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,560
adding the real-time content

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,080
collaboration extension

00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:24,399
or adding the native app extension

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,920
so that is quite um a fast way of

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,519
adding value to your organization for a

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,959
very small monthly fee

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:30,640
and this makes sure that we keep

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,560
building extensions maintaining it and

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,680
giving you support on them

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,560
um back to the demo platform

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,600
the other item that we're working on we

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,959
just had a very

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:45,839
slight issue

00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,480
with actually loading is the live

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:49,440
sessions

00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,160
or live events or webinars so what we

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,519
can now do

00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,839
in open social is set up an event and

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,560
make sure that it's a virtual event so

00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,760
anybody

00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,839
can join a live session

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,079
we integrate now with zoom and big blue

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,200
button

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,720
if there is a recorded session it will

00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,160
be automatically added

00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,399
to the event and and in this case

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,760
it's a event that's coming up so i can

00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,360
join the rehearsals

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,440
so it's great to uh test as well

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,399
see it in advance of an event see if

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,160
everything works

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,440
in this case we found out it wasn't so

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,440
that was a bit of a bummer

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,839
but i'll show you the back end and time

00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,480
wise we're on a limited schedule as well

00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,399
i'm obviously happy to show you this

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,720
down the line in the demo

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,160
so you have an event uh you can create

00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,959
the enrollment options

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,040
and in this case uh we've set it to a

00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,440
enable virtual event session

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,480
uh with a big blue button button

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,640
integration

00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,480
and whether to record it or not so

00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,760
there's two ways to do this there's the

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,200
big blue button

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,640
integration and there's the zoom

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,959
integration that needs a paid account

00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,640
we're happy to show you this in in real

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,560
time uh

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,680
it's still uh being development in

00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,720
development but we're planning to

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,360
release this

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,800
end of this year still it's just the

00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,560
final touches

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,959
also something that will be releasing

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,519
end of this year is the real-time chat

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,600
and that's also the first decoupled

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:21,279
project that we're doing

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,560
using the react and graphql

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,399
so i'm just going to show you the video

00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,240
because it's still in development

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,240
but i'm very excited to be able to add

00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,680
this as well to open social so

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:33,360
let me just show you and enter full

00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,079
screen mode

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,279
we really modeled this on a whatsapp

00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,600
style

00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,800
of chat so you have your one-on-one

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,519
conversations

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,959
you can create a group chat say food

00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,200
lovers

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,320
add people to this conversation make

00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,880
sure that

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,079
you can open it or close it archiving

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:55,200
functionality

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,639
you can set different moderators and add

00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,279
members to the chat

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,240
so this is the style that you know from

00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,760
whatsapp which

00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,160
we thought was a quite nice way

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,440
of building the chat so it's an overlay

00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,560
over the page

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,440
and you can add

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,959
remove people to group chats you can

00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,120
make them administrator

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,800
and start new private chats one-on-one

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,480
we will be integrating this fully with

00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:24,240
opensocial and

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,959
also making sure that it will be very

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,600
easy to start a group chat around a

00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,079
group

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,519
or around an event so the permissions

00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,760
are all based on the

00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,040
platform settings and of course if you

00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,839
change your name if you change your

00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,519
nickname

00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,880
if you change your profile picture

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,880
that's all automatically

00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,120
updated and included in the chat because

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,120
it doesn't run on any third party server

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,120
it runs on your own server you have all

00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,120
the code in house

00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,560
and the chat will be something that we

00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,639
will be expanding

00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:58,079
with the possibilities to say

00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,880
how do i cancel this also making sure

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,680
that you can

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,240
add functionality such as document

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,880
sharing

00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,440
image sharing etc okay that was a lot of

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,600
talking

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,360
let's see if there's any questions that

00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,399
came in

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,680
currently no questions

00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:17,120
maybe somebody has a question that i can

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,320
still answer in the last

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,519
minutes of this very very fast

00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,440
presentation

00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:28,240
i'll be happy to and otherwise we would

00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,360
uh love to give you a personal demo you

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,480

open social score features and the

00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,120
extensions that we're building

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:53,120
so thank you for your time
