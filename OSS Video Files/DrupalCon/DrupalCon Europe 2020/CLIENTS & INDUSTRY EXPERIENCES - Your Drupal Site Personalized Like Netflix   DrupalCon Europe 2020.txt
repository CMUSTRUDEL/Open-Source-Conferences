develop personalization for netflix

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:17,200
something like netflix and drupal

about some of the key trends of the

00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,599
digital engagement firstly companies are

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,959
today our organizations are being

00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,840
challenged to foster real-time

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,840
conversation

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,520
or a two-way dialogue with the uh

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,280
customers and seventy-five one percent

00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,040
of the customer expect companies to kind

00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,440
of interact with them in the real time

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,640
and this is one of the key engage a key

00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,440
trend of

00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,000
digital engagement in this era secondly

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,080
uh

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,920
nearly 80 percent of the customer expect

00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,120
consistency when interacting across

00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,400
multiple departments

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,920
or in short effective engagement uh

00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,000
also needs to be connected across

00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,239
different platforms be it mobile app be

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,080
it

00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,440
website or be it an offline campaign as

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,959
well and lastly

00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,959
uh which is where we are going to deep

00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,879
uh dive today is about the

00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,879
personalization and most customers now

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,480
today expect companies to provide a

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,120
personalized experience based on their

00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,280
needs

00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,800
and expectation personalization has

00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,319
already been recognized by marketeers

00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,000
for a long time now

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,159
and they are seeing the impact across

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,239
different uh customer journeys

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,280
customers today want a tailored

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,200
experience as they progress

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,959
from hearing first about the company

00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,560
then to buying your product and then

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,480
through the entire customer journey for

00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,239
example i mean if you if someone is

00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,159
seeing an ad on your website

00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,080
uh or on the side of a bus right all the

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,920
way through to clicking buying clicking

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,519
a buy button on your ecommerce website

00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,799
they also want these tailored experience

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,840
coupled with the engagement from

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,360
customer services

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,200
and therefore the personalization is

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,760
really really important in this new

00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,720
digital era

00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,599
moving on so these tailors and personal

00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,440
experience

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,319
not only help with the engagement of the

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,400
users they also help gain the insights

00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,080
into the customer preferences and and

00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,120
and their intent through the data

00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,200
and lara and uh actually talk some of of

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,319
these things in in the last presentation

00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,439
a few minutes back so today we are going

00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,920
to talk about

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,280
the netflix and personalization and we

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,959
are going to deep dive and see some of

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,799
the use cases that exist

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,000
uh before we kind of deep dive into

00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,360
those use cases as well i'm going to

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,040
talk about like what's really different

00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,639
about netflix personalization

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,919
um and they do a lot in terms of

00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,440
uh personalizing the content uh

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,360
based on what their recommendation it be

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,240
it as an email or what you see on the

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,400
website

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,320
and even the what images that you see

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,040
what banners you see about a particular

00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,600
title

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,199
and uh in anything your pattern around

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,840
the time you are watching the genre you

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,040
are watching

00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,479
and they collect a lot of data and then

00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,080
personalize and create a personalized

00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,919
experience for the end users and we are

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,639
going to see some of those use cases

00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,840
uh today um and the first use case that

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,840
we are going to talk about

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,960
today is about creating personalized

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,040
recommendation

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,160
and akansha is going to talk and deep

00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,199
dive into this uh

00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,759
scenario more hello

00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,280
thank you so personalized

00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,759
recommendations

00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,360
uh i'm sure all of you watch netflix so

00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,840
what netflix does it that

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,039
the page structure entire page structure

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,039
is personalized

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,479
which means that when you open netflix

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,360
whatever roles you see

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,840
are different for every user and this is

00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,039
what personalized recommendations

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,199
this is what happens when we talk about

00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,960
personalized recommendations so almost

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,639
75 to 80 percent of

00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,560
everything that is watched on netflix

00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,639
comes from recommendations

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,639
netflix has so much content that it

00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,039
would be impossible for anyone to go

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,479
through the entire thing

00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,240
if you think back to the last three

00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,160
shows that you watched i'm sure at least

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,840
one of them would have been recommended

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,840
by netflix

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,199
so how do they make you watch these

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,320
shows

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,120
so it's pretty netflix has a lot of

00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,199
shows

00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,199
and then they apply a bunch of

00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,880
algorithms on these shows

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,039
and filter them out and then they

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,600
structure it in the page in such a way

00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,240
that

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,560
you see the shows that will be that are

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,840
most relevant to you

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,080
so for example if i watch a lot of

00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,919
horror movies so the next time when i

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,720
open netflix the top

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,240
bar would say you know more and horror

00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,000
or continue watching

00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,600
what you would like it would have more

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,720
horror and then related

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,360
things to horror like thriller or horror

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,680
with

00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:26,080
a certain you know like sci-fi so

00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,960
first for this first you need what to

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,479
show to the user

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,360
and then you have to figure out how to

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,360
show it to the user

00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,759
all right so we did this and we'll come

00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,039
back to this how we did it in drupal but

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,520
there's another use case that i would

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,919
like to discuss before that which is

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,840
personalized artwork so netflix has

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,720
figured out that these are the genres

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,280
that you love

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,919
and netflix is going to show you those

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,800
donors

00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,520
in particular rows now how does it make

00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,960
you click

00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,080
on that particular one show to do that

00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,720
they've come up with

00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,599
this thing called personalized art which

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,680
means that

00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,280
one show can have six different posters

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,240
let's say one show has six different

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,080
posters

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,919
and based on what you like you will see

00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,080
a poster that you like

00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,080
so the example that i'm taking here is

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,479
of avengers end game

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,840
so let's say that you're a big captain

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,280
america fan

00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,240
or you like chris evans so if you open

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,960
netflix

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,840
you will see a poster that shows chris

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,240
evans when you

00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,680
see the end game when you go to the

00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,360
endgame movie or when you see

00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,759
recommendations

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,639
so netflix is showing all of this based

00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,720
on what you like

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,120
your preferences and the most relevant

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,120
content

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,120
this is what it looks like so if i'm a

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,599
captain america fan this is the poster i

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,240
see

00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,479
and if i'm an iron man fan this is the

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,319
poster that i see

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,319
now let's see how we can do this on

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,919
drupal so

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,000
we did a quick example in drupal

00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,960
you just heard a lot about smart content

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,520
paragraphs

00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,960
so i have implemented this using smart

00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,440
content blocks

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:09,520
and uh let's check this out

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,319
so this is for the recommendation block

00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,440
the block that you see on the right

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,199
and if you see so it shows what you

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,120
might like

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,720
now for now it is showing horror because

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,919
i said that as the default

00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,560
but if i go and see i see two movies

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,120
and say i go for guardians of the galaxy

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,840
and this

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:35,120
is tagged as comedy so based on this tag

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,440
my recommendation would change so now

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,680
the user knows that i like comedy if i

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,279
go back to the home page

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,279
you see the recommendation block has

00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:47,600
changed now it has become

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:51,600
comedy so and then the second example

00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:54,880
is a banner which you saw in the earlier

00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,399
presentation also so let's see you see

00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,320
the banner the banner is

00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,080
a generic banner of all superheroes

00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:03,360
together

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,760
but if i visit a page that say a captain

00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,399
america page

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,680
oh so yeah characters captain america

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,080
and

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,279
whenever i see this page so now you know

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,600
that i fall into

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,320
the segment of people who like captain

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,120
america

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,000
now if i go back to the home page and i

00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:23,200
view this page

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
again i will see that the banner has

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,279
changed

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,760
just there you go so now i see the

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,920
captain america banner

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,680
so i'd be you know more inclined to

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,080
click on this movie and watch it if i

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,399
think

00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,040
it has something to do with captain

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:43,120
america or the actor that i like

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:46,399
and that is how netflix does this uh

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:50,959
moving on let's

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:53,760
just all right so how can we do this

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,519
uh there are three things that are the

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,480
most important things when we talk about

00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,200
personalization

00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,720
the first one is segment now what is

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,000
segment

00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,640
segment is a category of users based

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,040
on their interest or any other criteria

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,240
used to classify them

00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,399
the most important part about

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,600
personalization as you've already heard

00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,760
is data collection

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,000
so the more data that you have better

00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,560
your personalization would be

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,880
and i can understand it's very hard to

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:25,440
get a lot of consolidated data about

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,480
a customer but then some things can be

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,720
done easily

00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,480
for example geolocation if someone from

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,040
a cool country visits your website and

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,399
you have say a product website

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,079
if you know that they are from a cold

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,519
country you could show them winter

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,040
clothing

00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,480
you can you know it will be a safe bet

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,279
to say that you know they would be

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,040
interested

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,320
more in that and that is more relevant

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,760
to the customer so

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,920
they'd be interested in visiting your

00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,079
site again so

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,440
this is what a segment is in the example

00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,200
that we just discussed

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,600
the segments would be people who like

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,760
captain america people who like iron man

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,519
say people who like wonder woman and

00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,600
based on those segments they will be

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,800
shown the relevant content

00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,399
the second part is slots slots are

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,839
places on your website

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,640
where this dynamic content appears so

00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,880
in our example it could be the

00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,120
recommendation block on the right

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,040
where which kept on changing according

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,920
to what genre you would like

00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,079
or the banner again which keeps on

00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,040
changing according to what segment

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,079
visits it so sloth is nothing but a

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,560
place but

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,480
to fill the content in slots you need

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,040
lots of tags content

00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,320
and that is probably the crux of you

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,000
know drupal

00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,519
like how personalization works with

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,760
drupal so

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:42,959
you need content that is tagged with

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,640
every particular

00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,079
so that it can be mapped to the correct

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,640
user

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,680
and i think this is very easy to do in

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,959
drupal since we have

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,480
taxonomy so you can tag everything

00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,000
and then you can display to the correct

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,800
user i mean the way

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,079
netflix does it netflix has people who

00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,639
manually go and tag

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,000
each show with every single sub category

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,959
they could think of so

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,320
i mean i see shows that say you know

00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,560
strong female lead

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,480
and so that has to be tagged before it

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,600
can be shown to the user

00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,120
and the final step is personalizing so

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,880
user visits your site

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,639
you recognize that they belong to this

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,880
segment and then you show them the

00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,000
correct content

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,440
i know all of this sounds a lot of work

00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,240
but then we have a lot of contrib

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,959
modules which we can use to do this

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,240
what i have used in my example is smart

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,639
content

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,079
so there are lots of other use cases

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,639
that can also be implemented

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:41,519
which for example personalized search

00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,600
results

00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,839
so you have a lot of content on your

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,079
site and a user search for something

00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,160
you would want to show them the results

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,160
that are most relevant to them

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,839
and this can happen i mean when you get

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,959
the results you can sort them based on

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,800
relevance

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,160
for slice menus or personalized

00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,279
notifications

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,880
all of this can be implemented so there

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,880
are a bunch of content modules

00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,399
that can be used to do this

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,800
personalization

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,720
this is available only for drupal 7 so

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,639
if you want to personalize your website

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,320
which is on drupal 7 then this is a

00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,320
module you should go for

00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,079
smart content and aqualift are available

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,160
for drupal 8.

00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,440
smart content is a free to use module

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,320
and even though

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,800
it cannot handle very complex use cases

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,040
it is

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,639
it works amazingly well for small use

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,600
cases like the ones that we just

00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,320
discussed

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,200
so it's mostly out of the box there's

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,600
very little code that you have to write

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,360
aqua lifters enterprise solution

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,120
obviously so if you need complex use

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,600
cases if you need

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,160
consolidated customer data across all

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,839
networks

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,560
then accualift is the solution you

00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,360
should go for this is a quick comparison

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,199
of modules

00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,959
i'm going to skip this because we don't

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,440
have a lot of time

00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,680
but um just you know different modules

00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,760
and what they should be used for

00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,440
there are more modules that can be used

00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,680
these are the ones that have personally

00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,760
explored i have also looked into you

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,880
know me which is based on apaches you

00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,720
know me

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,240
and it looks quite promising as it's

00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,240
open source and it is

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,000
almost as powerful as you know the other

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,560
enterprise level solutions available

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,600
right now

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,440
all right so we did all of this and then

00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,639
we put it to use

00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,839
so we created a personalized debt

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,480
collection system

00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,680
with wildstar so while cell is a german

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,240
agency

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,120
and this debt collection system it so

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,880
users come

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,920
and pay off their debts here so debts

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:39,360
could be from different companies

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,959
what we did was we built a custom

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,279
personalization engine

00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,000
so this has a drag-and-drop

00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,639
functionality

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,240
where you can drag and drop and create

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,560
various conditions

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,360
complicated conditions and finally you

00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,399
know you can get

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,560
divide users into segments

00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,600
uh also like we saw in the personalized

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,079
artwork example

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,959
we have personalized content here so for

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,880
every user

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:05,199
they're greeted by name based on their

00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,480
spending habits they see offers related

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,959
to that

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,480
then you know what they might like then

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,639
we also have a and b test

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,560
to determine whether the personalization

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,320
is actually working or not

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:19,040
so you find out what an user actually

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,560
likes we have ads of services

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,720
which appear throughout the site and

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,600
then users can rate them on a scale of

00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,079
one to five

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,120
and based on that we realize which users

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,519
like which ads

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,440
what they would like to see more of and

00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,519
finally a personalized payment sequence

00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,560
i mean this you see wherever you make a

00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,720
payment if you go

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,480
to paypal and make a payment you'll see

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,959
that your favorite payment methods would

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,480
be at the top this is amazing because

00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,399
you know it gives less time for the

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,079
users to get frustrated and leave your

00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:51,519
site before making an actual payment

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,079
oh all right so this is the persona

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,079
builder

00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:56,639
the personalization engine that we built

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:59,120
it has drag and drop functionality

00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,320
you can create multiple conditions here

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,600
and finally

00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,680
a result so there is an api exposed

00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,959
drupal sends a request to this and then

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,279
based on these conditions

00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:11,120
a persona is resolved we recognize that

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,120
you know this user spends a lot this

00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:15,759
uses the conservative spender

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,680
and then we return that to drupal the

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,639
architecture looks roughly like this

00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,000
this rupal this progressively decoupled

00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,519
react front-end

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,360
and there's a personalization engine in

00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,399
the back so

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,959
in react front-end we have lots of slots

00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,880
where the personalized data appears

00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,279
react sends a request to drupal

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,279
which sends a request to persona engine

00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,279
where we get the persona from

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,680
with we sent all the customer data for

00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,279
example their outstanding debt

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,720
last payment made whether they have

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,360
installments running

00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,480
and then based on that we get the user's

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,240
persona

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,000
and then we decide which content to show

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,880
so we have multiple paragraphs

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,560
with different content for each persona

00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,320
and then we return that persona

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,880
that content to react where it is

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,880
displayed

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,520
uh i'll hand it over to pratik for the

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,640
rest

00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,039
thank you again so uh so just to recap

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,799
right

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,400
we saw some of the scenarios how these

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,760
personalization techniques of netflix

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,439
personalization can be implemented

00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,400
within drupal and how we did it for the

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,559
vile style

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,160
um some of the things that we also did

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,679
as a part of that particular project was

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,640
to create a personalized chatbot so the

00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,360
same data

00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:27,199
that gets uh um that's that's become the

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,840
part of this personalization strategy

00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,200
uh can be used to build and expo and

00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,679
that can be exposed and then

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,240
things like chat bots can be uh made as

00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,840
well

00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,840
uh these are some of the things that we

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,960
want to uh we should keep in mind while

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,880
doing the personalization

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,160
the first is start with minimal i mean

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,000
in our experience we have seen that i

00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,360
mean big personalization strategies

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,039
takes a lot of time to implement and

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,960
then by the time you learn and then

00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,320
understand and that figure out the value

00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,400
of that i mean um

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,840
it's too late so our suggestion is to

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,679
start with minimal start with a simple

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,440
block on a homepage for example

00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,799
or a couple of other scenarios and and

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,559
see how it's working

00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:02,160
um start with mapping the customer

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,640
journey personalization is not just

00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,799
something

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,080
a tool just you can embed it on any page

00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,080
and then without thinking about the

00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:10,480
entire customer journey i mean uh

00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,559
akansha talked about the wild style case

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,039
study where the user can uh come and

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,679
then talk

00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,520
and uh pay their debts it's important to

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,200
understand what what places they kind of

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,320
fall out and then personalize the

00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,960
entire payment experience accordingly

00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,480
also uh the content strategy i think we

00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,919
also talked about the taxonomies and

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,039
tagging the content and the next click

00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:30,480
scenario will not there's a lot of

00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,520
content and then you need to tag it

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,440
right

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,559
with the right tags and uh place into

00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,520
the right appropriate

00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,720
slots it's important to tie up your

00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,400
personalization within your entire

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,840
content strategy otherwise

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,000
if your personas are such that your

00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,640
content that their content doesn't tie

00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,080
up with it

00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,440
i mean it may not be that useful um and

00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,960
fourth one which it's one of the most

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,760
important one is like keep it useful and

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,600
not creepy i mean

00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,200
do not overdo the idea is to not to

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,080
overdo the personalization make it sound

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,080
like creepy

00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,240
by providing and then tracking each and

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,000
everything and which also kind of ties

00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,679
up into the data privacy in the gdpr

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,039
issue i mean notify things like notify

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,880
visitors about before

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,720
uh tracking cookies only collect what

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,559
you need and give option for people to

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,760
opt out of uh these personalizations and

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,200
the data collection

00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,400
uh features that you have and um

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,600
some of the things some of the modules

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,799
that we have seen the smart content

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,160
smart paragraphs i've talked about

00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:24,000
earlier personalization

00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,240
acquia live there are a lot of lot of

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,160
technologies uh that exist

00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,240
and for some of these simple scenarios i

00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,360
mean most of the country module is more

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,440
than enough at times

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,720
unless you are really creating a really

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,720
big strategy where you need

00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,240
things like cdps and others and even

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,720
over there right i mean when you tie up

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,960
with

00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,840
uh apache you know me i mean you can get

00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,600
and then

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,280
build your entire personalization just

00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,000
by using the open source technologies as

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,000
well

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,520
um at the same time for analytics yeah

00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,960
things like i mean as simple as google

00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,480
analytics times will tell you how your

00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,039
personalization is working

00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,400
and uh and uh even when the propriety

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,960
tools like acquire lift i mean there is

00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,640
a more

00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,240
uh around it which tells you like how

00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,400
the equilibrium is happening and then

00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,320
uh lastly have a cross-functional team

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,240
uh who understands this personalization

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,880
and personalization strategy overall

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,080
and uh who can then test learn and then

00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,480
i treat quickly and then

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,520
evolve from there so with that said i uh

00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,320
we are

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,919
done with our presentation and then um

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,400
we are open up for any questions i can

00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,280
see

00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:22,640
uh there are a few questions already and

00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,840
actually would you like to take this one

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,440
where it says that

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,520
uh can you explain sentiment and

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,880
analysis as a means to categorize user i

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,159
mean how do you categorize users

00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:35,039
based on sentiment analysis uh

00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,960
sure yeah i can take that so sentiment

00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,400
analysis can be used to categorize user

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,120
as and based on you know

00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,480
the kind of content they react they

00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,559
interact with

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,720
it is a whole holistic you know the

00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,880
entire customer journey throughout

00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,760
so the tone of the content that they are

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,159
more into

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,200
for example i mean i'll give facebook's

00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,559
example

00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,640
so if i scroll through it the kind of

00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,360
post that i see would be geared towards

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,600
say

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:03,520
related to reading or happy post or like

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,919
say inspirational post

00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,799
and they know exactly what kind would

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,120
speak to me

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,320
and they display that so you can tie it

00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,919
up and you can find out

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,840
exactly what segment so there are number

00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,760
of ways to divide users into segments

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:20,320
and that could be one of those ways

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,080
yeah um so one other question is that

00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,919
does any of the contributed module

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,840
available support segmentation

00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,120
based on the number of times a user is

00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,400
viewing a particular

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,760
content um so you have to write a little

00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,720
bit of custom code for that

00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,080
but uh smart content does have the

00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,000
functionality i mean

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,520
i just checked it and there's a cookie

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,080
set number of page

00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,039
pages visited but i think it's not for a

00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,280
particular page

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,720
the example that i showed so i wrote a

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:50,159
little bit of custom code to

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,919
kind of see what taxonomy term is tagged

00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:53,280
in the node and then set a cookie with

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,880
that so

00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,320
it's a little bit of custom code but it

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,760
can be done

00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,360
yeah in addition to it right i mean you

00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,240
can always use like something like tie

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,080
it up with matic

00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,440
um and have a point system for the user

00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,640
so every time as user visits a

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,480
particular content

00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,840
uh or a particular action you can

00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,039
increase the points and then based on

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,159
those point system

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:13,200
uh you can uh create those segments so i

00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,720
mean uh

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,960
the smart content module does provide

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,640
those flexibility in terms of

00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,640
personalizing based on a flexible or

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:23,120
other custom fields as well

00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,000
um uh i think we have couple of more

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,360
minutes i think we can

00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,480
have take a few more questions um

00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,640
one of the questions that what if there

00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,480
are too many use cases uh user has been

00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,120
to a variety of the content then how

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,720
would they

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,200
that affect the recommendation part uh

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,559
okay i think i cannot see that question

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
any longer but i think the idea was that

00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,280
if you

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,120
have too many uh questions where would

00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:47,039
that go

00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,240
too many or two i mean if a user kind of

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,159
goes to a different content let's say

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,360
goes to a captain america or an iron man

00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,799
and then too many pages

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,400
how will you determine the user person i

00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,760
think that was the question uh for some

00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,799
reason i cannot see it anymore

00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,960
i can't show you wouldn't like to answer

00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,960
that

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,520
which question are you talking about

00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,360
yeah i think

00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,120
uh it's this one what if there are too

00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,559
many use cases uh i think yeah i can see

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:11,360
it now user has been to a

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:12,400
variety of content then how would that

00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,200
affect

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:19,360
that's correct uh yeah so

00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,600
i recommend contents to users i'm really

00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,400
sorry but this is going to end very soon

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,880
so maybe

00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,720
um there are a few questions pretty

00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,559
interesting questions that can reach out

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,559
to you are you going to be online during

00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,640
the rest of the event

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,240
yeah so yeah absolutely the questions

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,640
and we'll answer them on twitter

00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,880
i'm really sorry it was very interesting

00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,000
but it's going to end very sad
