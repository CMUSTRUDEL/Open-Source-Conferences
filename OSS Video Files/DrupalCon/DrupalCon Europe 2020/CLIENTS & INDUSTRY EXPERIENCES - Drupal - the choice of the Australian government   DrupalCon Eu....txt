presenting to you today

00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,719
now unfortunately because of a mix up

00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,920
and changing time slots my colleague

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:37,760
steve worley

00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,600
is not here to present this new time

00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,960
however i will speak for his parts as

00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,040
best i can

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,160
and my apologies for the inconvenience

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,840
course for those that were hoping to

00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,960
attend this originally scheduled session

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,200
yesterday

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,239
so just a quick background on myself so

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,239
i graduated in 1998 in computer systems

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,079
engineering and computer science

00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,920
i have a background in technical

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,079
architecture across applications

00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,640
integrations and infrastructure

00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,720
i am the founding director of an

00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,080
australian-based digital services and

00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,159
innovation company

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,119
and i've been working almost exclusively

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,439
for government since

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,280
2014 and among many hats i wear i

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,880
am a whole of government digital

00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,040
platform advocate

00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,799
and so as i mentioned so steve's not

00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,320
here but i would like to introduce him

00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,720
nonetheless as he's been a big part of

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,080
this presentation today um so steve's

00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,479
been working in the web industry

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,400
for a better part of 10 years and

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,240
recently been focusing on

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,680
devops for several government tech

00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:38,479
stacks so we both work for salsa digital

00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,560
and salsa digital is a digital services

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,759
company specializing in gov tech civic

00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,280
tech and open data

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,200
and so we've been heavily focused on

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,600
helping governments become more open

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,320
more connected and more consolidated and

00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,520
we've got a

00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,560
seven year legacy in drupal

00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:57,600
okay so it's a long session with

00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:59,600
uh lots to cover and uh we've broken the

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,240
session into eight key parts

00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,680
so i'll open up by talking about the the

00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,600
role the pain

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,880
uh the authorities and the policies are

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,119
for digital government

00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,800
in australia then talk a little bit

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,120
about the characteristics and qualities

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,440
of

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,560
a whole government digital platform and

00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,959
programs

00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,800
then we'll talk about the journey and

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,599
the criterion adoption of drupal within

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,280
government

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,319
and then we'll provide some highlights

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,920
for each of the major government

00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,680
jurisdictions adopting drupal in

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,120
australia namely the commonwealth

00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,760
and the three states of western

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,440
australia victoria and new south wales

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,200
and then finally we'll wrap up and

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,040
hopefully allow for some time to cover

00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,720
some questions okay so before we get

00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,920
started there is a couple of important

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,800
disclaimers

00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,239
so i am not a public servant um nor am i

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,080
a drupal developer

00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,599
and i am also not representing

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,519
government agencies um

00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,040
i am however drawing upon my

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,400
relationships and experiences in

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,920
delivering whole of government digital

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,400
platforms and programs

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,920
um and finally there's a lot of content

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,159
uh within this presentation

00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,080
so rightly or wrongly it's uh being

00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,400
produced in a take away format

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,920
so try your hardest please to not read

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,080
all the words and follow me as best you

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,080
can

00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,480
okay so here goes so part one um digital

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,480
government in australia the role

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,159
the pain the authorities and the

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,400
policies

00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,480
so let's start with the why right so

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,879
what is the role of government

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,319
so well we have many so governments have

00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,640
many responsibilities but one of the

00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,200
most

00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,959
relevant to us is that they are there to

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,599
deliver information and services to

00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,040
citizens

00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,200
so information and services that are

00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,560
easy to find and easy to understand

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,720
but they're also responsible for

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,799
delivering great user experiences

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,400
experiences that are efficient that are

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,239
elegant that are intuitive

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,720
and they're consistent so why is this

00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,319
all important well among many reasons

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,239
quality information services help

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,519
citizens they help communities and they

00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,360
help industries thrive

00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,879
there are however three barriers that

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,959
make this difficult for governments to

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,680
deliver quality information

00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,000
and great user experiences so barrier

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,879
one

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,560
is fragmentation so many governments uh

00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:07,280
technologies services information

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,280
they're fragmented so consequently user

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,080
experiences are fragmented creating

00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,400
confusion

00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,519
frustration and inefficiencies for the

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,920
citizen

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,680
barrier two is silos so there are

00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,440
historic structures of government that

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,400
have created silos resulting in

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,720
difficulties

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,680
in solving the same problems so this

00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,440
leads to waste

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,680
and prohibits the co-creation of

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,199
solutions that can truly be world class

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,720
the third barrier is proprietary

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,800
technologies we all know it

00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,639
um all of us that are here at drupalcon

00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,639
uh i appreciate that

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,560
and so the historic prevalence of

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,040
proprietary technologies in government

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,160
has led to vendor lock-in and high total

00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,160
cost of ownership

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,919
which consequently prohibits innovation

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,400
and risks stagnation

00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,680
painful right so what can we do about it

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,240
well

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,759
well of course we can start with a dream

00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,639
so let's imagine a world where

00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,600
governments are

00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,800
truly more open more connected and more

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,199
consolidated

00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,000
so more open by being more open right by

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,320
educating

00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,400
building and supporting open data open

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:09,280
apis and open source technologies

00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,800
and which then in turn results in

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,400
greater transparency and greater

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,199
opportunities to co-innovate with

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,720
citizens

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,400
with other government jurisdictions and

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,080
with industry

00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,520
more being more connected uh with

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,600
citizens is by using

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,800
technology to better digitally engage

00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,400
with the citizen

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,639
also being more connected with each

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,160
other for example cross jurisdictions

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,840
to result in greater collaboration

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,199
solving common problems

00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,520
so more consolidated the the third dream

00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,680
and

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,520
you know is being more consolidated by

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,160
designing building maintaining and

00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,320
scaling

00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,199
whole of government common platforms

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,720
which unify services removes duplication

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,400
and addresses fragmentation across

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,320
technology information and user

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:51,680
experiences

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,080
so you're dreaming i hear you say yes i

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,639
am

00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,520
and uh but the dream is not enough so

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,360
thankfully

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,960
there are peak bodies in government with

00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,199
influence that are doing something about

00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,720
it

00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,479
and so here are three of them so

00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,479
influencer number one um

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,000
there's the federal department of prime

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,280
minister and cabinet on behalf of the

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,039
global open

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,479
partnership initiative which has

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:11,759
committed australian government through

00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,160
a national action plan

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,160
to be more open through innovation open

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,800
data and common platforms

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,560
and so in a uh influencer number two

00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,120
right is the digital transformation

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,840
agency

00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,440
the dta so they are a leading digital

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,199
authority for australian government and

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,479
they are responsible for many standards

00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,560
and guidelines to help

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,600
open connect and unify government

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,560
services

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,520
and finally influencer number three is

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,759
the australian

00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,360
digital council so this council brings

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,560
together leading digital authorities

00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,639
across the federal level

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,919
and across the state governments to

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,840
share align

00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,280
and progress public data and digital

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,440
transformation in australia

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,400
okay and so for completeness it's also

00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,479
worth highlighting

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,000
global peak bodies that are bringing

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,720
governments together to address common

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,759
pain points

00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,639
uh globally a particular group that i've

00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,120
called out here

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,759
is called the digital nations which are

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,319
a group

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,360
of nine leading digital governments

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,039
throughout the world

00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,560
and similar to the australian digital

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,280
council they come together to share

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,680
knowledge

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,800
work on joint projects and leverage each

00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,720
other's success

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,319
so you can see those nine leading

00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,080
agencies that i've

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:25,039
highlighted here in red sadly no spain

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:28,160
and no australia come on aussies uh not

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:30,479
sure how you say come on in spanish

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,440
um all right so so how can governments

00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,919
achieve good

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,160
digital right well by starting first

00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,000
with well-considered policy standards

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,080
frameworks and guidelines

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,680
and there are many um however four that

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,880
we feel are relevant to this vision of

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,199
being more open more connected more

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,120
consolidated are as presented here

00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,080
so number one is the open source policy

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,319
so this is a policy from 2011

00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,680
which states quote uh australian

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,080
government agencies will

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,080
actively participate in open source

00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,000
software communities and contribute back

00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,360
where appropriate so um

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,720
number two is the digital service

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,400
standards so these are a set of 13

00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,400
standards that represent best practice

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,960
principles for government to design and

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,840
deliver

00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,879
citizen services that are simple clear

00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,360
and fast

00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,120
now one of the thirteen for example is

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,919
digital server standard number eight

00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,960
which states quote make all source code

00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,960
open by default

00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,599
so influencer number three is the uh

00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,000
digital services platform strategy so

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,959
among

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,360
many things it states that we need to

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,080
quote

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,800
use technology and data to connect and

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,680
unify

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,839
government services and to develop

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,479
integration standards including api

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,120
standards

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,720
to support platform interoperability and

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,320
finally number four

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,920
which is the whole of government

00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,480
architecture workforce

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,040
so this is an initiative also led by the

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,360
dta the digital transformation agency

00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,040
to develop whole of government uh

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,600
technology

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,279
architecture models and so these models

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,279
are there to ensure investments are

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,320
in scalable common platforms across

00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,399
whole of government and to avoid uh

00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,080
agencies spending time and money and

00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,920
effort in duplicated solutions that are

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,160
trying to repeat and solve the same

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,160
thing

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,640
okay so these are the policies and

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,000
standards that i just spoke to there at

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,519
the national level however we

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,600
also have equivalent policies and

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,240
standards for each of the individual

00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,839
states and territories um or you know

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,920
jurisdictions are within government

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,040
and i won't list them out individually

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,120
however

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,839
as you can see we have a representation

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,839
for each jurisdiction

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,920
okay so now on to part two whole of

00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,839
government digital platforms

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,000
so what are they and what benefits do

00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,000
they provide

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,240
okay so according to the oxford and

00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,360
college dictionary uh well not really

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,279
so according to the digital

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,959
transformation agency whole of

00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,080
government digital platforms provide

00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,000
capabilities that are

00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,839
shared across policy areas and deliver

00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,120
great value through common technical

00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,640
foundations

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,800
whoa my goodness what a mouthful um

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,920
so let's try different approach with an

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,760
illustration

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,519
so what can a whole of government

00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,160
content management system platform look

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,279
like

00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,680
so imagine you have multiple sites each

00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,519
on their own hosting infrastructure

00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,200
including security protection caching if

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,959
any their own cms

00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,440
their own content models and their own

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,959
user experiences so not to mention their

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,600
own separate patching and maintenance

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,920
contracts

00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,640
so you multiply that by 50 multiply that

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:39,360
by 100 multiply that by 500 times

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,240
what a fragmented mess that would be

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,320
it's dark

00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:47,040
it's cold and it's gloomy so now imagine

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,519
where you have a common uh platform

00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,519
including hosting security and caching

00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,959
you have a common managed content

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,000
management system and you have a common

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,040
content model

00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:00,079
and a common managed user experience

00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,200
and all 100 200 and 500 present web

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,200
presences

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,200
that are served upon it uh oh what a

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,760
consolidated bliss right the skies are

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,680
blue

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,399
the sun is shining and the roses are

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,399
smelling great

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,079
and okay so what are the common

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,760
qualities

00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,120
uh of a whole of government and digital

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,480
platform uh uh

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,839
or program what must they have right

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,440
well i've broken it up into two parts

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,160
you've got program qualities

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,279
and you've got our platform qualities so

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,839
let's start with the

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,519
uh program qualities um there are many

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,120
however eight of them that are here and

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,440
i'll call out a few of them the first

00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,040
one

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,880
that i'm calling out is community

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,240
sharing and contribution which is

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,320
you know there to leverage from others

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,000
and give back to others right the second

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,920
one is simplified procurement perhaps

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,200
not an obvious one and that's government

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,519
to government procurement and it should

00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,240
be

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,839
easy simple fast without the pain of

00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,079
preparing submitting

00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,560
evaluating procuring and managing

00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,399
contracts slas etc

00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,839
not to mention those poor vendors that

00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,440
spend hundreds of hours writing

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,480
government tender responses

00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:04,399
and i'm not traumatized at all so the

00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,000
third one to call out is

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,240
managed and consolidated user

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,079
experiences you know and that's a user

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,240
validated led experience that is

00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,720
consolidated and consistent

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,480
and the third quality across the program

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,079
is that it's got to be easy

00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,000
uh to um to adopt um

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:23,440
so easy to adopt the ability to

00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,440
self-serve so you know

00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,440
through great training artifacts by for

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,639
example so again there are many but

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:33,279
hopefully this gives you a good idea

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,240
okay so now for platform qualities so

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,360
again there are

00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,440
many and i've shown eight of them here

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,800
and it's hopefully not a surprise and

00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,240
what you should expect from a whole of

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,399
government platform responsible for

00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,880
delivering critical information services

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:49,040
again to name a few secure paramount

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,040
right so we need to trust

00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,040
right the second one i've listed here is

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,079
resilience right equally paramount it

00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,040
needs to stand

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,160
when we need it most a third one i'm

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,720
calling out is

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,920
scale so it needs to be able to grow as

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,720
demands

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,800
increases and just to call out a fourth

00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,639
one as an example is accessible so it

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,600
needs to enable public servants to

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,320
create

00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,440
quality content and user experiences

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,680
that are inclusive

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,720
from the start and at its core not as an

00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:21,360
afterthought

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:24,480
again there are many

00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,079
okay so what does this all mean uh this

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,880
means that

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:30,560
individual government agencies and

00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,720
individual public servants

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,000
don't need to worry about a bunch of

00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,279
stuff and you can see

00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,240
the sort of stuff that they need not to

00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:41,040
have to worry about as we've got here

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,279
right what it also means is that public

00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,199
servants get to focus on just

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,800
delivering best user experiences for

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,639
citizens and they do this

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,320
by focusing on quality services and

00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,760
quality information that is easy to find

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
and easy to understand as we've talked

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,160
about

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,000
right and they can achieve this by

00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,160
focusing on service design

00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,320
content design user research accessible

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,800
content again not for them to worry

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,360
about

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,800
all that other stuff around contracts

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,360
procurement

00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,519
security resilience that should be all

00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,959
taken care of for them

00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:15,760
okay so now on to part three why drupal

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,920
the moment we've all been waiting for

00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,959
all right so we've identified the pain

00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:22,160
uh we've now got good policies and

00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,160
standards in place

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,680
we've defined the characteristics and

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,440
qualities of what a good whole of

00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,199
government platform

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,360
and program should look like now it's

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,519
time to choose a cms

00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,560
um if you take note we just had a little

00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,639
bit of fun

00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,720
can anyone see the little uh icon here

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,120
and anyone spot any of the other icons

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:44,480
on the others and if they look familiar

00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:46,560
just for fun okay so

00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,959
there's a little overlap here however i

00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,480
present these specific key criteria

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,839
and again a subset of many that have

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,920
been used by many government

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,040
jurisdictions to evaluate the cms

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,360
solution of choice

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,880
and again to name a few the first one

00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,000
open source we know right

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,600
um it's why we're all here uh this the

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,600
second one is that it needs to be

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,959
highly adopted right the third one is

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,880
that the cms needs to have an active

00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:11,040
community

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,000
and the fourth to call out is um of

00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,720
course it needs to be

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,839
uh feature-rich easily adaptable and

00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,000
easy to use

00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:19,760
and so several jurisdictions went out to

00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,839
evaluate many of these cms's based on

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,079
this considered evaluation process

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,760
per this sample criteria above this is

00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,519
just the subset of the criteria that a

00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,800
lot of these jurisdictions

00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,839
um have used to win an uh when selecting

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,360
a cms

00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:41,519
and so the winner is you'll never guess

00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:44,639
yep it was uh drupal um dramatic pause

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:46,079
um and so all right four of the nine

00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,639
jurisdictions within the australian

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,040
government

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,120
have selected drupal for their whole of

00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,680
government platform solution

00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,959
so in 2014 we had the commonwealth

00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,560
government

00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:01,680
in 2016 we had western australia

00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:04,800
in 2017 we had the state of victoria

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,639
and just recently in 2019 we had

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,160
new south wales government so each

00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,759
having similar characteristics

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,440
and realizing similar benefits and

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,839
outcomes but equally each

00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,519
a little bit different um but also each

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,519
being at different stages of their

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,160
digital transformation and consolidation

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,440
journey

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,000
and so the next part of this

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,759
presentation is really to cover

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,759
uh some highlights of each of them

00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,560
okay so let's go to the first one right

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,839
part four which is drupal is the choice

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,720
for the australian commonwealth

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,680
government

00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,320
um known as gov cms so gov cms is the

00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,079
name

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:40,079
of the drupal-based whole of government

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:42,160
cms platform at that commonwealth level

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:44,000
that's a mouthful even more of a

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,920
mouthful is the definition here which is

00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
gov cms is a whole of government

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,880
platform for commonwealth departments

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,440
and agencies

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,120
to host sites and serve information to

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,959
australian citizens

00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,800
um so the highlights for galaxy messages

00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:00,000
as listed here right so it's a

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,040
fully managed secure hosting and fully

00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,400
managed drupal

00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,600
it's almost six years old there are 306

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,520
sites on the platform

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,799
on behalf of 92 government agencies

00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,799
the third one we've got listed there is

00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,919
that it supports drupal 7

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:19,439
drupal 8 and now with drupal 9 in alpha

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,160
um the platform is irap security

00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,880
accredited

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,559
so irap is an accreditation provided by

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,679
the cyber security authority of the

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,839
australian government

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,880
um it's an open source stack pretty big

00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,679
deal and

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,400
it has the largest drupal footprint in

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,120
government

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,120
in australia

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,240
so gov cms offers two consumption models

00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,559
right so model one is

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,240
known as software as a service right so

00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,440
it's a fully managed security created

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,240
hosting platform

00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,240
it's a fully managed drupal application

00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,160
and it provides the flexibility

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:57,039
to maintain your own theme

00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,880
the second model is paz platform as a

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,440
service so this is a managed

00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,640
hosting platform supported by a custom

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,160
drupal application

00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,960
and so with paz you have the choice to

00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,160
of managed security and managed a cdn

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,400
and with pas

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,000
the website owner is responsible for

00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,480
managing their own drupal and their

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
own theme and their own patching and

00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,880
maintenance

00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,480
currently for gov cms of those 309 sites

00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,640
there are 200 sites

00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,240
on the sas consumption model and there

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:30,080
are 109 sites

00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:33,679
on the pas consumption model

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:36,400
okay so stats and facts there are lots

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,480
so it's the biggest program it's the

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,760
oldest program and it's the program with

00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,760
the most number of sites

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,960
so the numbers are going to be big and

00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,559
impressive

00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,000
i'm not going to go through all of them

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,280
however we have presented

00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,120
lots of key statistics across key themes

00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:53,120
which you can see a couple of them here

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,360
so program agent size

00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,320
team size and structure usage stats and

00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,640
performance

00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,360
uptime and service desk modules in open

00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,600
source

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,360
and market size adoption let's call out

00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,440
a couple however

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,799
so on this slide we've just called out

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,360
one and that is that in

00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,960
the last financial year there were 122

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:13,919
sites that were added

00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,760
to the platform so on this slide two

00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:18,160
stats and facts are highlighted

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:19,200
um probably which are the most

00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,919
impressive is

00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,799
number one an impressive two billion

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,320
amount of hits

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:29,720
in march 2020 and that was due to covert

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,240
as well as um one of the big sites

00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,919
health.gov dot iu right major

00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,320
contribution to this load

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,200
um and that was only actually for sas

00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:40,320
traffic

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:43,760
the other big and impressive statistic

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,960
is this one here in that 80 percent of

00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,120
the traffic for them

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,240
for the last previous five years was

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,520
received in only

00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,840
four months in 2020 again due to

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,840
covert

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,919
okay i promise no more stats and facts

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,720
after this one

00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,120
uh lots are highlighted here but again

00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,760
one

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,280
um to point out that is uh worth

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,679
pointing out is that um

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,200
two training manuals have been open

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,640
source specifically the content

00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,000
administration training manual for

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,159
content managers

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,320
which helps public servants manage

00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,320
content

00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,520
and the second one is the site builder

00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,000
training manual which has been open

00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,559
source for

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,480
drupal developers so these manuals are a

00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,679
great initiative to enable the community

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,159
to self-serve

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,360
um to upskill right and to optionally

00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,360
contribute back improvements

00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,159
okay so lots of great noteworthy sites

00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,840
and we're not going to call all of them

00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,200
other than to state that many of these

00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,039
sites provide

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,240
very important often critical

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,480
information to serve

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,480
australian citizens as an example we've

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,559
got cyber.gov.iu

00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,640
which is the australian cyber security

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,679
center and that is a symbolic statement

00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,320
of having them on the

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,840
platform um and it's symbolic of the

00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,320
security posture

00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,600
of gov cms pretty big deal another

00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,720
example you've got here which is what we

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,720
mentioned earlier which is

00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,720
health.gov.eu

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,880
which is the official source of critical

00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,840
health information

00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,559
okay so here are many more sites

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,159
delivering

00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,159
important information services to the

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,000
citizen however we have to confess here

00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,720
we're a little biased with these ones

00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,440
as these little red salsa icons are

00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:25,120
denote

00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,960
sites that have been proudly built by

00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,080
our south digital us

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:34,559
with love um aren't they beautiful

00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,559
okay so now moving on

00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
um okay so it's also worth highlighting

00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,159
to assess the program by calling out

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,280
you know leading government federal

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,280
agencies that have

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,720
entrusted many of their websites onto

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,799
the gov cms platform

00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,799
again there are lots of them um with the

00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,919
australian department of defense

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:56,080
as one example to call out here

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,840
and again many many more including the

00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,840
australian taxation office

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:06,080
okay so it's time to get uh technical

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,840
uh god help us and so again to remind

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,640
you i'm not a drupal developer and i've

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,320
lost my

00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,080
co-presenter partnering crime stephen

00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,720
today who would have presented this

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,799
slide

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,400
but let's try actually before do that

00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,400
i'm going to have a glass of water

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:27,280
okay excuse me i just

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,640
swallowed some ice okay so

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,080
what you are looking at is the

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,120
architecture and tech stack for the

00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,760
consolidated

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,159
gov cms platform so for context we have

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,440
five

00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:40,480
sites that are illustrated here

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,240
site a site b site c x and y

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,559
and then we have the platform components

00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,320
themselves um

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,840
uh which that sit underneath and they're

00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,280
shown obviously in the red

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,960
and grey and so um the red as you can

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,600
see here from the legend the red colored

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,840
boxes

00:22:53,600 --> 00:23:00,880
represent excuse me uh represent our

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,320
common shared components and the red uh

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,880
dotted lines uh

00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,840
represent our individual uh component

00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:09,600
instances

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,039
uh that are tailored per site and so

00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,640
what you'll also notice is that we've

00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,840
demarcated the

00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,480
sas versus pas components so

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:19,200
excuse me so let's start with the common

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,039
layers

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,559
um the platform layer so the platform

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,760
layer represents that common hosting

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,360
infrastructure and the common hosting

00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,840
infrastructure is made up of

00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,480
a multi-availability zone aws public

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,400
cloud

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,320
right for a resilient hosting uh and

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,200
then we've got kubernetes

00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,159
for container management we've got cdn

00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,679
for

00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:42,320
fast edge content delivery we've got

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,080
excuse me we've got web protection which

00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,679
is made up of a variety of technologies

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,840
and practices

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,600
that are super secret for obvious

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,279
reasons

00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,039
um so before we get on to the next layer

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,960
it is important to note that

00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,120
this common platform layer is security

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,919
accredited as we talked about earlier uh

00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,799
to a specific standard known as

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,760
official sensitive so then we have the

00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,440
tooling layer

00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,679
and the tooling layer is another common

00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,760
layer supporting all the sites

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,440
and so here we have you know git lab for

00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,080
both source code management

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,440
and ci cd pipelines for code consistency

00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,960
security standards and automated

00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,760
deployment processes

00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,159
and then we have docker containers uh

00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,960
for

00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:25,360
nginx and php and we also have lagoon

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,520
for deployment management

00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,039
and so now up to the application layout

00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,080
and so the application layer

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,480
is a common drupal distribution uh each

00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,200
for

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,919
drupal 7 aaa and drupal 9 alpha as i

00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,520
mentioned

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,840
and it's important to note that this

00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,559
these distributions are a controlled

00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,279
list of contributed modules that undergo

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,320
very

00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:48,480
very strict vetting processes um with

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,320
security uh among other factors being

00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,600
the strongest uh security

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,039
naturally paramount as you would expect

00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,120
um they are these in the in the

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,400
distribution they also contain standard

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,600
content structures

00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:04,960
and as a base and so

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,720
with all sas sites using uh

00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,880
sorry all satellites use this same

00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,400
distribution um with this standard set

00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,320
of functionality

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,679
and so other shared services which is

00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,159
actually not modeled

00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:17,919
here include viral scanning mail

00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,080
delivering caching services

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,840
okay so now let's talk about the

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,880
separate and configurable

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,480
layers within the platform so the first

00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,799
one is the content structures so there

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,799
are

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:30,159
basic out-of-the-box content structures

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,039
which are provided

00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,159
um however a website has the ability to

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,679
adapt and create

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,520
new content structures to meet its

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,279
individual needs and more likely than

00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:42,559
not that often happens

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:45,600
and the second configurable and

00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,880
independent layer is the user interface

00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,960
so there is a basic set of

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,880
out-of-the-box um

00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,559
ui theme templates based off the

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,600
australian government design system

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:59,039
which is compliant with the wikag

00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,840
accessibility standards and again each

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,559
agency has the ability and flexibility

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,240
to extend

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,760
adapt and create their own design

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,320
templates and again

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:11,520
which they often do um excuse me i'm

00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,760
gonna have some water again i'm really

00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,760
sorry

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,240
okay and so finally to put this into a

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,600
context of saz

00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:25,279
versus paz for sas you have a fully

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,200
managed secure platform

00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,320
um it's a managed and controlled

00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,799
application

00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:32,480
and it also provides the flexibility for

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,279
agencies to adapt their content

00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,520
structures

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,640
and their themes and the user experience

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,080
and for paths so

00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,640
each site sits on an accredited secure

00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,159
and resilient platform however each site

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,240
has its own drupal

00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,360
uh installed with complete control and

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,520
flexibility

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,120
and they have the option to inherit the

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:54,159
gov cms distribution and

00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,600
customize that if they require and

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,760
with this level of flexibility and

00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,120
customization also comes great

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:03,919
responsibility

00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,919
um around their own security around

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,159
their own performance you know all those

00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,000
good practices that you would expect in

00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,880
a good application

00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,480
okay so that was heavy right um so the

00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,640
next three slides covers

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,480
uh program challenges noteworthy

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,799
celebrations and roadmap items

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,080
and there's a bunch of great insights

00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:22,960
throughout and i'm not going to go

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,080
through all of them

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,080
but let's call um one out for each

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,440
so one of the three program challenges

00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,960
captured here

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,760
for galaxy mess is the number one

00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:36,000
highlighted here which is the guff cms

00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,799
currently manage three distributions

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,600
really hard

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:41,360
right it's a high maintenance burden um

00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,919
the the positive side to look at this is

00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,240
that you know

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,000
hopefully now with the end of life of

00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,679
drupal 7 and drupal 8 we will soon

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,720
consolidate and fix that

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:53,520
for one distribution

00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,760
so lots of noteworthy celebrations but

00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:58,159
again just to call one out

00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,360
and it's a big one is that gov cms is

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,760
breaking down

00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,399
silos between digital teams across

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,120
government

00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,440
and uplifting technical maturity that's

00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,399
a

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,080
big big deal that can often be actually

00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,399
underestimated

00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,440
right and finally roadmap right lots of

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:16,320
good stuff coming

00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,960
up with three roadmaps listed here again

00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,880
just to call

00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,120
one out in particular is the item number

00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,840
three listed and that's platform scaling

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,240
and that's this continuous strong focus

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,799
on optimizing and exploring innovative

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,360
ways

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,080
to scale to accommodate hundreds more

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,679
sites

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,679
and therefore a whole lot more traffic

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:43,279
okay so uh now on to state

00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:46,480
jurisdictions um so so let's go to

00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:49,919
western australia okay so here it is

00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,840
so wa.gov dot a u it's a single portal

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,279
and a single user experience

00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,039
so it's a single website where west

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,480
australian citizens go to get their

00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,120
information citizens

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,559
so a couple of highlights here um let's

00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,679
give the definition right so it's a

00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,960
whole of wa

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,320
government sim uh cms platform right for

00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,240
western australian citizens

00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,760
or agency sorry to deliver information

00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,200
services to the citizens

00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,880
okay so a couple of highlights is that

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,640
it's four years old there are currently

00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:18,240
70 web presences

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,120
with 303 uh public servants um on board

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,760
onto the platform

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,039
it's running drupal 8. unlike gov cms

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,399
it's a consolidated platform but it's

00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:29,039
also consolidated user experience

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:31,360
as well as it offers a centralized

00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,360
publishing distributed authorship model

00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,440
the other thing to highlight out here is

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,120
it's moving towards a micro services

00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,200
based architecture

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,120
okay so wa so western australian

00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,279
government offers two consumption models

00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,480
the first consumption model is a fully

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:48,159
managed platform

00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:52,080
fully managed user experience um

00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,279
and fully and web presence on the wa.gov

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,000
dot au domain

00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:57,679
the second consumption model um you

00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,760
could argue is is

00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,440
not really a consumption model but it's

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,320
basically for those that need their own

00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,840
url

00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,360
but everything else is which is

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,799
essentially just a redirect

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,799
onto this platform

00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,080
um okay stats and facts again just for

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,679
the interest of time um

00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,200
there's a lot captured i'm only going to

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,559
call out um

00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,480
a few of them so two that i've

00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:23,120
highlighted here is in that the site has

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,000
experienced a 400 structural increase in

00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,480
average load

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,399
on the platform since covert um another

00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,320
interesting statistic here is that

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:33,679
um the platform have um benefited from a

00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,679
900 000

00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,360
australian dollars of course are savings

00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:40,320
in licensing and maintenance fees after

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,399
consolidating with drupal

00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:44,159
so okay two large and noteworthy

00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:45,919
agencies uh adopting the

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,440
the the platform is what we've listed

00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,159
here is the department of finance and

00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:52,399
department of justice

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,000
okay so onto the architecture and tech

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,279
stack and i'm not going to repeat a lot

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,480
of this because you're going to start to

00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:00,559
see a lot of themes

00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:02,799
and but also without my technical

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,320
aspiring partner steve who's not here i

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,840
don't want to misrepresent but just

00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,600
to touch on a few things and some

00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,880
differences to the gov cms model as i

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,159
discussed earlier

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,159
and so all websites on the western

00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,360
australian platform are web presences as

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,159
you can see here

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,360
right and with some exceptions as i'm

00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,039
talked about earlier

00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,720
um some independent brands may have

00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,679
their own url but essentially they're a

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,880
redirect

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:29,120
to the web presence um on there

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,799
and so as we talked about earlier so i

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,080
said guf cms is a fully managed secure

00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,320
hosting and drupal application

00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,240
platform right with the flexibility for

00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,200
individual sites to customize however in

00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,919
this model

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,399
all layers right including the content

00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,720
layer

00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,399
and the user experience layer are

00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,720
standardized

00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,559
and fully managed and so that's a very

00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,880
big difference here

00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,720
and so this is represented by all the

00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,720
red boxes and you see a lot of red which

00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,519
is the common shared components

00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,200
um as for the architecture stack um

00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:01,039
notable bits of differences are mostly

00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,840
around the platform and the tooling

00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,600
you know they use aws ec2 cloud front

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,039
and shield for cloud hosting

00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,799
caching and security as well as um aws

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:13,519
code deploy and code commit for

00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,559
source code management and deployment

00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,120
and finally they

00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,320
are now adopting a microservices-based

00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,559
architecture

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,039
um for greater agility scalability and

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,039
ease of maintenance

00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,720
okay so one of three noteworthy

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:28,399
challenges or sorry celebrations i

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,159
should say sorry uh that have been

00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:33,039
captured for the western australia

00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:33,679
um is number two is highlighted here in

00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:37,120
that

00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,960
um wa.gov.iu was the single source of

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,159
truth for covert related information for

00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,240
wa citizens

00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:44,000
which is um a big milestone because it

00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,159
took away any confusion or discretion on

00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,880
where the citizen needed to go to get

00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:52,159
the most relevant uh incredible um

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,720
information when it came to covert

00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,840
one of three noteworthy roadmap items

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,039
captured for the western australian

00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,919
government is number three as

00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:01,039
highlighted here

00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:03,600
and that's open apis and so open apis

00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,880
basically uh will enable the west

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,720
australian government to unlock

00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,919
government content unlock the data and

00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,159
unlock their services

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,360
to enable that true co-creation

00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:13,200
co-innovation

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,399
with the citizens and industry which is

00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,399
what we talked about earlier

00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,679
okay so on to the next state

00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,519
jurisdiction

00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,279
um which is the second last one and

00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,279
that's the state of victoria um the

00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:28,159
single digital presence

00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:30,960
okay so here it is it's vic.gov again

00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:33,679
it's one portal it's one user experience

00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,399
and it's appropriately named the single

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,880
digital

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,880
presence

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,519
and so it's obviously it's a single

00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:43,679
website where victorian students

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,440
go to get their information um i'm not

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,360
going to repeat the definition it starts

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:49,039
to get a bit repetitive here

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,640
but some highlights to call out is that

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,279
the program is two years old

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,840
it currently has 80 web presences and

00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:58,480
it's serving 250 public servants

00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,080
it's on drupal 8 and similar to western

00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,840
australia it's a fully managed digital

00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,159
experience platform

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,360
what's unique about this is that it's a

00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,679
open source stack

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,800
but also that it's a headless decoupled

00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,639
architecture

00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,320
and similar to western australia it is a

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,359
centralized publishing distributed

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:18,480
authorship content model

00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,040
so victoria offers three consumption

00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,520
models

00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,079
so you've got vic.gov.iu which is that

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,079
fully

00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,599
managed platform that fully managed user

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,639
experience

00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,200
and web presence on that single domain

00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:31,679
vic.gov.iu

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,679
the second consumption model is

00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,079
basically sites with a separate domain

00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,679
but

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:40,000
with the victorian brand on top of again

00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:41,359
fully managed platform application

00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,440
content and experience

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,119
and then finally you have this third

00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,200
consumption model

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,040
which is uh referred to as independent

00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,599
and that's a fully managed platform

00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:52,320
user experience and website but with

00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,200
your own

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,480
independent um drupal distribution and

00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,640
domain url

00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,079
and this particular one is only

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:03,920
applicable for statutory and regulatory

00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:07,520
independent government agencies that

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:09,680
need that legal separation

00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,880
okay stats and facts for the single

00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,599
digital presence again

00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,880
lots captured and shown across here for

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:18,640
you know program size

00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,640
team structure etc

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,400
but so two noteworthies to call out here

00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,920
is that the platform

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:31,040
experienced an 8 200

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,040
spike in less than 30 minutes during

00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:34,720
uh covert peak loads and this was at the

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:36,560
time when the

00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:38,560
victorian premier announced the the road

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,440
map massive unprecedented amount of

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,720
spike

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,800
so interesting um statistic number two

00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,640
is that the platform has been measured

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,040
to save victorian agencies

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,640
who are looking to build their websites

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,880
up to 70

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,720
in build and operating costs you know

00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,800
that's uh quite impressive

00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,040
okay and so two more final stats uh

00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,280
which are totally worth are calling out

00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,040
is that there's been 13 new drupal

00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,440
modules that have been created in open

00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,520
source on drupal.org

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:10,240
as well as there's been 85 visual

00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,400
components as part of their

00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,160
design system that have been user tested

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,160
and wiki compliant that have also been

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,920
open sourced on on github

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:22,400
um did i tell it was worth it okay

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,000
so again lots of great noteworthy sites

00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,520
on the victorian digital platform

00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,200
and again not to call them out but

00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,839
rather to give an impression

00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,800
and to state that there are many sites

00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,480
that are

00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,560
responsible for delivering important

00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,640
critical information and services

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,560
to victorian citizens uh that are on the

00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,359
site as of course with other government

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,079
jurisdictions

00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:44,640
you know and and victoria police is um

00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,880
no he's one here it's a name among many

00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:50,320
um and another one here is the victorian

00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:53,440
budget uh website to name another

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,440
and again lots of noteworthy large and

00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,040
credible and reputable victorian

00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,560
government departments and agencies have

00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,599
onboarded onto the platform

00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,960
um as you can see here and

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,040
now with the architecture in this tech

00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,520
stack and again and then

00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,720
missing my techie steve and i i don't

00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,480
want to misrepresent the technical

00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:12,079
details but key points to highlight in

00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,720
this architecture is that

00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,800
it's a hybrid approach um between the

00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:18,880
gov cms model and western australia

00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,640
and so like western australia it is a

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,040
high it's highly consolidated

00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:24,160
throughout all layers of the stack as

00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,839
you can see here

00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,079
so it's fully managed and highly

00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:30,720
compliant all the way through

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,720
including the user experience it also

00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,000
offers however the option for separate

00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,400
instances

00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,680
for drupal um and for separate instances

00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,280
of drupal separate instances for the

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,079
content model and separate instances for

00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,280
the ui

00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,119
however it is important to know that

00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,320
these are only available in special

00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,800
circumstances for those

00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:50,240
independent regulatory and statutory

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,240
agencies that we talked about earlier

00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,480
one other uh notable point however is

00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,400
that victorian government in this case

00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,200
for the independent sites

00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,720
manage the entire stack separately so

00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,160
they manage it on behalf of these

00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,400
independents which takes away that

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,040
burden and maintenance

00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,480
one final point to take out that's um

00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,240
unique and different here is that it's a

00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,440
completely headless and decoupled

00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,520
architecture

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,800
um with the front-end design system

00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,880
known as ripple

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:19,839
being a decoupled ui based on nuxed

00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,839
vue.js

00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,839
okay so uh one of two noteworthy program

00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,920
challenges victorian government

00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,520
is number two as highlighted here which

00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,760
is handling of an

00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:33,119
unprecedented amount of spikes during

00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,040
covert and it revealed

00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,040
some breaking points into the platform

00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,480
which um you know so discovery again

00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,160
triggered immediate remediation

00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,599
resulting in greater resilience

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,359
in handling subsequent spikes i mean

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,599
that's the good news story but it came

00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:47,200
with a little bit of pain

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,640
okay one of three noteworthy

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,599
celebrations for the victorian

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,119
government is

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,560
number two is highlighted below which we

00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,440
did talk about earlier is that headless

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,839
architecture

00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:57,200
and and so victoria's decision to invest

00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:59,119
in and build these these

00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,880
decoupled headless architecture has

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:02,320
really laid the foundation

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,920
for among many things you know

00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,160
deduplication of uh

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,839
content data unified citizen digital

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:09,760
experiences multi-channel

00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,680
and integration with an adoption of best

00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,880
of breed technologies

00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,800
and finally one of four noteworthy

00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,960
roadmap items captured here is the first

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,920
one here that's highlighted and that's

00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,760
them investing in uplifting the content

00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,520
editing and publishing experience for

00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,760
public servants

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,119
okay last one and i know we've only got

00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,599
a little bit of time left

00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:33,440
um is the and the last one is the

00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:35,680
youngest adopter of the three

00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,520
state jurisdictions new south wales so a

00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,920
little quick disclaimer here is that you

00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,920
know

00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,880
drupal for new south wales is still

00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,160
under evaluation by the custom customer

00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,040
services at the wales it's part of an

00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,480
mvp pilot

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,480
so we'll only focus on presenting

00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,359
program highlights based on the program

00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,680
pilot

00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,119
so here it is new south wales.gov dot u

00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,680
again a single portal

00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:57,680
a single user experience look how

00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,480
beautiful it looks

00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,200
okay so some key highlights to point out

00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,599
here

00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,480
is that it is an mvp pilot running on

00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:07,359
drupal 8

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,880
it is a relatively young program and a

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,240
lot of times been invested in getting

00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,480
many stakeholders

00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:14,079
on board like the other states it's

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,280
fully it's a fully managed digital

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,599
experience platform

00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,319
and also like the other states it is

00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,440
central

00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:23,680
uh publishing a distributed authorship

00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:26,079
one major notable point of difference is

00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:28,560
here is that there is an official policy

00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:30,160
to mandate the platform uh to create

00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,040
change and transformation which will

00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,040
result in

00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:35,839
rapid consolidation of the sites and

00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:39,280
user experience over the next five years

00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:40,079
um so yeah similar to victoria new south

00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,440
wales

00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,599
um sorry similar victorian government

00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:45,280
they offer this same consumption models

00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,560
uh but of course with the brand new

00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,359
south wales

00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,800
um um the brand sorry in accordance with

00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,680
their own design system and brad

00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,599
guidelines

00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,800
and as they're similar models i'm don't

00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,079
need to go through them each of them

00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,960
again

00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,640
okay you know so stats and facts for new

00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,400
south wales again important emphasize

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,040
that this is a relatively young

00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:06,000
program and they're in pilot and so

00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,200
naturally

00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,720
the um the adoption and therefore stats

00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,359
are not going to be as mature and as

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,520
developed

00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,720
so that said some interesting stats here

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,800
to highlight is that

00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,720
there are 500 sites that have been

00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,079
targeted for consolidation as part of

00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:22,079
this policy mandate

00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:24,000
right over the next five years which i

00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,440
just briefly mentioned earlier

00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,119
and that the new south wales government

00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:29,920
which is a pretty impressive stat

00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:34,480
is that have had 100 uptime uh since

00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:37,359
april 2020 that's not bad

00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:38,160
um so here are you know two noteworthy

00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:39,520
uh credible

00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,200
departments that are on board onto the

00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,319
platform as you can see here births

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,680
deaths and marriages

00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,920
as well as the department of customer

00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,560
services and

00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,240
so now just to highlight one of three

00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,640
strong focus program goals

00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,079
um which is the number three here and

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,440
very similar to others and you see

00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,520
common theme and that is

00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,200
to you know uh investing digital

00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,280
capability to uplift

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,119
the uh new south wales public servants

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,680
to enable them to up skill to cross

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,839
skill

00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,960
and to thrive so that they can

00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,000
ultimately better serve

00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:11,680
citizens one of the three noteworthy

00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,880
challenges for new south wales is number

00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:14,800
three is highlighted here

00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,160
and it's a big one and that is that

00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,280
change management is

00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,920
not to be underestimated right it takes

00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,560
time

00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,760
effort and patience to bring many many

00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,200
many stakeholders

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,920
on the journey towards a consolidated

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,160
hall of government platform

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,319
um and finally one of the road map items

00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:34,480
to highlight here is personalization

00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,440
um and that's for them to develop the

00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:37,280
capability

00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,640
to personalize this experience based on

00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,839
a variety of parent parameters of

00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:43,359
geolocation

00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:45,839
uh cookie collection archetypes etc

00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:47,520
okay i know we've only got one or two

00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:49,520
minutes left and i've just a little bit

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:51,200
of a wrap up

00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,720
one thing and i'm really sorry to have

00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,640
to rush this but

00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,560
really i'm be very personally satisfied

00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,520
and encouraged to learn recently that

00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,599
there is this

00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,040
community sharing of practice which is

00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,800
an informal collaboration between

00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,240
jurisdictions and nations

00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:08,160
and so on a periodic basis so

00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,760
these here so gov cms single-digit

00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,119
presence new south wales government and

00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:14,319
the canadian government

00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:17,680
have been um coming together um

00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:18,720
to you know exchange road maps um ideas

00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,319
pains points

00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,839
and so and recently the western

00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,960
australian government has also joined

00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,960
this collaboration

00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,480
and so here you have energy in a

00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,079
jurisdiction

00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,920
collaboration cross jurisdiction and

00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:31,280
international that's really breaking

00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:34,640
down the silo so that's um

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,920
pretty very impressive okay so it is

00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,480
getting towards the end but i just

00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:40,640
wanted to leave with a fun fact

00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,880
and that is south digital's own website

00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,240
so our website is built entirely on

00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,480
whole of victorian government open

00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:47,920
source components and we also use the

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,720
same tech stack as the victorian

00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,800
government

00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,880
as a result we've actually made several

00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,560
improvements added new features

00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,920
made some accessibility findings and

00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,960
shared them all back with the victorian

00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,200
government

00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:01,680
and this is really us you know really

00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:03,839
trying to practice what we preach

00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,599
um all right so that's a wrap up and so

00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:06,400
there's a bunch of info that i'd like to

00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,240
share with you

00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,760
um that may be of interest and i'm i'm

00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,400
conscious that we've got only seconds

00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,839
left

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,119
but the first one is that there's a

00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:15,599
whole of government digital blueprint

00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,599
that we will be releasing um in q1

00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,800
2021 and so we've released this

00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:19,920
blueprint

00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,599
or sorry we'll be releasing the

00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,000
blueprint on what it takes to design

00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,760
build

00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,440
manage and scale whole of digital

00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:27,040
platforms the other one that

00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:28,480
uh is of interest is the digital

00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,960
transformation in government publication

00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,319
series

00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,760
it's a fortnightly publication that

00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:33,839
talks about cool things that are

00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,160
happening in government across the world

00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:37,280
um and finally there's a drupal 9

00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,079
information pack

00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:41,839
um so you know it is drupalcon after all

00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:43,440

00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,520
guides

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,359
and blueprints um and there's a whole

00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,560
bunch of uh we have some open source

00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:56,319

gracias to all of you

the drupalcon audience and thank you for

00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:48,240
attending and uh supporting

00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:48,240
my talk um time for questions thank you

00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,760
thank you alfred if you want to just

00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,359
check your questions

00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,359
in the start we've got a few questions

00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:03,040
there there are i think they were based

00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:03,839
on when you were speaking so the first

00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:06,400
one was

00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:08,560
um has it been built by a single agency

00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,839
i think it's a reference to gov cms

00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,920
how long did it take the launch i think

00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:13,280
that was also referencing gov cms at the

00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,720
time he was speaking

00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,280
and the first one is also just the cuff

00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:20,000
seems to seem as evaluation

00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,640
right okay so um let me start at the

00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,839
first one

00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,839
at the bottom of the list here so how

00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:25,760
long did it take to launch the site

00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:27,119
uh from the decision of drupal to the

00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,800
first site

00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,160
okay so each of the programs were

00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,839
different um

00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,280
so if i can i talk to the one that's

00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,319
most front of mind for me right now is

00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,359
the victorian government so the

00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,440
victorian government

00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:39,200
uh probably approximately took about six

00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:41,520
to eight months but they went through

00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,520
an alpha beta program so they didn't

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,319
alpha pilot with just one or two sample

00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,240
sites

00:46:44,319 --> 00:46:48,240
and then learned lots matured the

00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,720
program turned it into beta

00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,440
and then uh then eventually went into

00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:53,520
live uh

00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,160
which was a vic.gov.eu that was about a

00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,400
six to eight month process

00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,800
um so the second question we have here

00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,280
which is also from uh stefan

00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,319
is has this been built by a single

00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,440
agency

00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:08,079
so um each of them are all very

00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,000
different

00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:13,760
um so if i again let's talk to gov cms

00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,800
so guf cms is a great example

00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:17,599
which is um so the distribution itself

00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:21,119
is made up

00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:22,640
of you know approximately 80 i think um

00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:24,480
contrary modules so it's been

00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,319
it's a distribution made up of country

00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,359
modules from the community so the

00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,440
distribution itself

00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:30,720
right which is the power of open source

00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,400
the platform

00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:39,280
um has been um

00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:43,280
developed by a um by a single agency yes

00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,760
um so yes sorry and i should also

00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,400
elaborate

00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,319
it's hosted and managed by actually um

00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,480
two agencies which are in partnership

00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:51,599
the third question we have here from

00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:53,599
micah maker

00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:55,920
maker i hope i pronounced that sorry

00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:58,960
clarifying my question

00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:00,720
uh cms evaluation results so

00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,800
let me see saying how many australian

00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:03,440
service providers get a piece of the

00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,640
cake

00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,160
was it a push for the local economy so

00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,200
that's a very good question

00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:12,160
so let's talk about um gov cms so gov

00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,400
cms

00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:16,400
has what they've established what's

00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,400
called a drupal services panel

00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,480
so the drupal services panel is made up

00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,119
of actually i'm going to guess here so

00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,160
please don't

00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:26,880
equip me but it's approximately 20 uh

00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,160
give or take agencies uh drupal services

00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:31,760
and they had to go through

00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:33,760
a obviously a uh a qualification process

00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:37,520
to get onto the panel

00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:39,599
to and so they all are agencies that can

00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:41,520
help all these other government agencies

00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:44,640
uh to help build their websites and

00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,640
onboard them onto the platform

00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:49,119
um i hope i've answered that and i think

00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:51,920
that was

00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:53,760
all the questions and so we're probably

00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,640
way out of time here now

00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,680
and uh akilah my rights assume we should

00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:00,079
just uh

00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,240
wrap up now we can sign off thank you

00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,720
very much thank you everyone great

00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,599
okay thank you all i uh yeah appreciate

00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,079
your time thank you
