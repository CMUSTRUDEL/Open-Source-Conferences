00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,680
i suppose you can

00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,279
hear me now

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:25,359
good afternoon everybody

00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:29,920
good morning depending on where you are

00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,880
um in the world and which time zone um

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,719
in this session

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,040
we'll talk about gatsby and drupal again

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,320
it won't be as specific presentation as

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,840
the previous one

00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,719
it will be more like a bird's eye view

00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:47,039
over the landscape populated by gatsby

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,360
and drupal

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,079
you obviously know a lot about drupal um

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,320
i'll

00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,559
for those who don't know gatsby i'll

00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,039
provide some introduction

00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,000
um and we'll look at how tightly these

00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:01,440
two

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,840
actually couple

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,280
first of all my name is thomas thomas

00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:10,000
phillip

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:12,479
i have a drupal webshop at vasilando.be

00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,200
with my other hat i'm an architect at

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,840
the flemish government here in belgium

00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,680
um i've been with drupal since 2006 you

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,200
may know me by the screen name

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,000
vasilando very open source and fanatical

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,600
about

00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
sustainable architecture and performance

00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,720
i was born in czechoslovakia um i live

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,560
in belgium

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,200
so basically i'm a european beast

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,680
uh what's the plan uh for the next 20

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,119
well

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:44,000
19 minutes we've covered

00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,840
speaker and on the planning i'll explain

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,960
what the aims of today's presentation

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,799
presentation are i'll introduce gatsby

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,079
as a member of the gemstack

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:57,119
family i'll talk about complementarity

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,759
of of uh gatsby with drupal uh that's

00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,000
the

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,159
core of the presentation um some

00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,479
personal experience

00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,000
uh pros and cons of the two uh if we

00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,119
have time there's an imaginary

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,200
discussion with the

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,800
devil's advocate summary in one slide

00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,480
there are some web resources which you

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,440
can look at later and

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,560
questions are always welcome during the

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,640
presentation

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,040
or later so the aims um

00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,080
this is what i want you to believe um

00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,680
drupal is

00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,280
no longer a stranger to a decoupled

00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,920
architecture we all know that there are

00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,480
so many

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,519
front-end frameworks available gatsby is

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,920
just one of them but

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,200
i would argue that it's one of those

00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,160
that have

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,680
the smoothest way of integrating uh with

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,120
drupal

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,160
um it evolved from a simple sba

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,120
single page application builder into

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,800
some

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,360
something much more powerful that can

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:55,200
handle uh very complex projects

00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,200
but one of the challenges that we have

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,280
as builders is to decide

00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,680
where is the dividing line uh between

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,120
mechanism front and

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,879
we've seen it also in the previous

00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,840
presentation it could be that you

00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,360
decided to

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,239
um not to take over the multilingual

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,080
functionalities from

00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,319
drupal and you built it only on gatsby

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:19,280
but you will lose something

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:21,280
it's easy to overdo it on on either side

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,000
so let's examine uh what are the roles

00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,120
of both um

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,040
gatsby and and drupal um

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,599
what is the dividing line or the shape

00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,840
of the the coupling between these two

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,840
and

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:47,840
what in what conditions

00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:47,840
gatsby may not be a good fit

00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,159
so gatsby yeah if you came here for uh

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,599
jay gatsby that's not the right

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,439
presentation then

00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:03,760
uh we talk about another great gatsby

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:06,239
it's got pjs um it's basically a

00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,280
front-end framework a very very fast one

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,640
and it's based on

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,599
react.js it's been launched in 2016

00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,000
not so long time ago actually by our

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,120
drupal

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,160
colleague uh kyle matthews

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,000
and it's a popular project on github

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,639
um it's one of the most popular gemstack

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,960
projects i'll explain what jumpstack is

00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,479
in the next slide but before getting to

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,600
that um if you wonder

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,240
where the name comes from um just

00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,360
yesterday

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,720
i got an answer from from kyle himself

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,880
he says it is connected to literature

00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,479
he thought that gatsby was a great name

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,880
from a great book

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,639
about an exciting dynamic time in world

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,680
history

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,240
that certainly makes you think about the

00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,240
parallels

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,960
how does the legacy

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,960
web look like what is actually the

00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,120
problem that we are solving here

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,479
we always have data living somewhere in

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,080
database like mysql

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,520
we have an application that retrieves

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,080
and manipulates the data

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,400
and then serve it through a web server

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,160
this setup is very common but

00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:19,280
it is a bit slow it has many stages

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,360
it has many um it provides many

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,800
opportunities for for attack

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,919
or or a problem and it is expensive to

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,280
scale

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:33,120
we do it every day it's possible but it

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,120
can be done in a more simple way

00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,000
gemstack is a web development

00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,840
architecture it's it's based on

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,520
client-side javascript and reusable apis

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,880
it's built on the concept of static

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,759
generators

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,320
that basically take your whole site and

00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,680
build it as a set of static files html

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,520
css js

00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,840
everything you need on the front end and

00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:00,080
that sits on a content delivery network

00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,280
there are many jamstack projects uh

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,160
besides gatsby

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,680
you may know next days hugo jacquel next

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,759
and other ones

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,000
yeah so this is how it looks like the

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,479
data are retrieved from apis

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
there's a build system that publishes

00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,199
only the static data

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,840
on a cdm this is an example from netlify

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,160
but

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:25,360
the the scheme is generic

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,560
what are the benefits we

00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,840
identified four areas it's a performance

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,720
security easier scaling and development

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,840
practice i'll

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,880
run through these very quickly

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,600
why better performance as we said it's

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,960
generated

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,000
only once and it provides static files

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,080
on cdn what can be faster

00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,440
prefetching of linked pages is built

00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,479
into drupal

00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,039
so you don't have to do it yourself

00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,759
the load images load progressively that

00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,960
saves

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,880
loading time as well the responsive

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:04,000
image loading is

00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,720
another advantage offline access is so

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,759
easy to to arrange it's uh

00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:11,280
it's it's a no-brainer um and in default

00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,599
setup there is no external

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:18,000
code fetching um why higher security

00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,880
well basically gatsby offers you less

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,280
surface

00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,400
areas for attack you don't have web

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,599
server

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:31,360
you don't have the back end exposed

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:35,599
and there is no involvement of database

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:38,240
at runtime um you still have to secure

00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,360
your data source for example your drupal

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,520
that should not

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,440
be forgotten why is it easier to scale

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,039
well again there is no database you

00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,520
don't have to care about replication

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:50,720
it's just files that are hosted

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,319
somewhere

00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,319
it's a perfect scenario for serverless

00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,520
hosting like s3 from

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,039
amazon the cms instance

00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,360
um because you still have to run your

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,240
drupal can be much smaller

00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,240
and that means it's more cost effective

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,919
as well

00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,160
in many cases it depends on your use

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,039
case obviously you can even switch off

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,280
the

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,400
the cms between builds it really depends

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,560
you know what kind of website are you

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,879
building

00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,120
better development practice why well

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,639
gatsby has a long list of starters which

00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,080
are kind of similar to drupal themes

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:28,639
that's what i thought at the beginning

00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,639
except that they offer not just um

00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,719
the theme but also the application

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,360
itself so it's very easy for you to

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,479
start

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,959
any website of any kind the development

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,000
is more

00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:42,479
targeted um preview of change preview

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,480
of changes is really slick and drupal in

00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,440
sorry in in gatsby

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,839
why because um you don't even have to

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,279
refresh your browser page the changes

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,279
uh happen immediately

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,920
it's easy to plug in a new new

00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:02,480
components typically we use npm for that

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,880
um and updating is then also trivial

00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,480
um all sources can be approached using a

00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,120
single querying system that's a huge

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,720
advantage

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,279
and there is a graphql language

00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,240
used and there is also an ide for

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,360
graphql called

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,600
graphical which is included in the local

00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,720
development environment and the

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,720
documentation of

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,640
gatsby is really really really fantastic

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,000
i should check it out

00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,320
what is the complementarity between

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,440
these two so let's look you know how

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,920
how how do they couple how tightly can

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,120
they

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,040
couple so on the drupal side what do we

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,160
expect what what definitely lies on the

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,320
side of drupal

00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,839
are the cms functionalities content

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,760
management content types

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:47,680
fields taxonomy media importantly

00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,880
this week everything about editing

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,160
itself

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,040
revisions content versioning

00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,920
the multilingual capabilities are very

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,959
nicely explained

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:02,399
in the previous presentation by nick um

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,480
slug generation now the relative url

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,800
it's simple to do in gatsby but you may

00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,360
leverage uh drupal's module path out for

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,480
this

00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,000
and get the information by the api

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,320
because then you benefit from other

00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,160
backend modules such as redirect and

00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,560
and token um

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,279
but obviously drupal needs its own user

00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,560
management

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:26,160
and authentication a crucial building

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,640
block is the api of drupal

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,000
and that's very efficiently solved by

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,600
the excellent

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,680
json api um and you can use other

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,360
back-end modules which improve the

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,079
functionality as long as they can be

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,279
transferred

00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:46,560
by api what do we expect on the side of

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:50,000
gatsby clearly the fronted uh

00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,200
html generating uh html css js phones

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,640
and so on

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,240
the front-end caching which is built in

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,320
because it just sits on a cdn

00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,360
prefetching is there a stop sim

00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,760
optimalization for

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,120
for speed uh same for image

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,079
optimalization

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,200
um so drupal doesn't have to care for

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,680
any of these

00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,640
then connecting to external source

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,040
sources

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,160
you don't have to connect only to drupal

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,399
you can use

00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,920
a number of other cms if you like

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:19,839
depending on your use case

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,640
or apis from s3 or google sheets google

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,160
analytics

00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,360
you can use all of them and you have

00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,519
just one query language to query them

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,279
all

00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,040
structured data annotation it's also

00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,920
something you don't do in drupal anymore

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,279
you do it on

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:38,959
in gatsby and it's very simple to do

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:40,880
analytics you know google analytics is

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,120
was always one of the first modules we

00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,519
enabled in a new drupal website

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,480
it doesn't belong there it's it belongs

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,880
at the front end

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,560
and it gets be each couple of lines of

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,079
code which you copy

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:58,399
and configure external sitemaps

00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:00,959
the same captcha robots.txt security txt

00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,920
web mentions all search engine

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,760
optimalizations

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:09,040
all that is on gatsby's side and drupal

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,040
drupal is not needed there

00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,680
what is unclear or imperfect um

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:18,959
the end user authentication

00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,839
in gatsby is easy to implement but

00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:23,360
it's more difficult to couple it with

00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,200
drupal authentication

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,360
if required but maybe you don't require

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,440
then you can solve it by using

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,880
third-party authentication for board

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,079
drupal and gatsby there are many

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:35,680
techniques how to

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,959
achieve that search again easy to

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,399
implement in gatsby

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,360
alone but i find the drupal's own search

00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,399
configuration

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,720
using search api still

00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,440
more superior so there is definitely

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,480
room for

00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,600
improvement preview it's

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,639
fantastic in gatsby development there is

00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,600
even a drupal module that leverages it

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,279
but i don't think it's also seamless as

00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,200
in the monolithic drupal

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,279
so this is connected with providing

00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,720
revisions by the drupal api

00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:11,200
we are getting there forms by definition

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,880
required backhand movement but that can

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,519
be solved using servers

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,200
tools like uh like those offered by

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,279
netlify

00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,200
redirect functionality so that you don't

00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,000
um

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,800
so you you keep the page keep the link

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,120
to the page

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,320
even if the title changes uh it's easy

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,519
to do it in gatsby but

00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,800
again it's more useful to use a

00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,920
backend module redirect

00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:40,320
and use it in gatsby

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,839
this is not yet completely ready but

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,000
there are patches

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:47,199
for the redirect module that go in the

00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,199
direction they're almost ready

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:53,199
um my experience you see this big number

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,079
um this is how long i've been busy with

00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,959
drupal

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,720
when i when i joined when i started with

00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:02,000
it it was still drupal

00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:05,040
4.6 i've seen so many hip players

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,600
coming up and vanishing again and yeah

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,920
why would you switch to something else

00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:13,440
after 15 years

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,079
but then yeah no i'm not leaving drupal

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,720
anytime

00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,360
anytime soon i think drupal is still the

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,399
best

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,639
cms um out there

00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,839
uh the cms competition is intensifying

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,920
but still

00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,040
um i don't doubt that drupal is is the

00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,560
best choice

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,720
but gatsby is definitely a game changer

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,680
not just the speed scalability and all

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:36,240
the all the

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,760
pros that i mentioned it's also modern

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,720
it's it's elegant

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,720
it's fresh

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,920
and it's for me it's also an example of

00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,240
a decoupled setup that has more pros and

00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,240
cons

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,839
here's the discussion i mentioned it's

00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:59,199
i'll mention the the pros the advantages

00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,480
with the devil's advocate speaking in

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:03,360
red

00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,160
performance we can say that nothing can

00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,680
beat

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:10,320
uh static files on a cdn you could say

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,560
that drupal is also able to cache on cdn

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,440
and

00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,800
expire from it but then you know you

00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,720
have to think about the complexity of

00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,720
the setup

00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,839
security you don't have to worry about

00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,959
drupal php

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,880
mysql from vulnerabilities

00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,079
because you simply don't use them at

00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,240
runtime

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,360
you could say that you always have

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,560
security worries you

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,720
you can never be completely free of them

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,399
stability no worries about traffic

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,920
surges or

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,600
the os attacks true uh

00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,839
your site is replicated all around the

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,639
world on on obsidian

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:48,079
um but yeah any site can be crippled by

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,040
biotechs

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,000
um it's fun to build uh your deaths will

00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,120
love you

00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,600
um even that that's not deliverable

00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,040
maybe

00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,680
for some um drupal can

00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,480
so easily connect to to so many other

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,560
data sources

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,480
so not just to not just a drupal

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,600
okay there are external entities

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,920
available in

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,000
uh drupal but again the setup is much

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,839
more complex

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,519
um you have a huge access to

00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,680
you have access to a huge ecosystem of

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,880
plugins of gatsby react

00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,839
and js do you really need it drupal has

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,199
a lot of modules

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,480
well you have more quality modules in in

00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,519
total then

00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,519
you can pick and choose

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,680
even even even better

00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,480
you have also improved access to to

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,519
developers

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,199
there are so many react.js developers so

00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:48,000
you have less pressure finding

00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,000
drupal talent

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:57,120
the access to the content is so simple

00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:59,040
um using the json api module

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,399
and there are edge cases like revisions

00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,759
and so on but the

00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:06,400
the json api model is improving

00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:06,400
constantly

00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,160
the hosting is is very affordable even

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,480
free on

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:19,199
hosts like s3 or netlify github pages

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:21,199
usher etc one of the ones i'd like to

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,400
i find particularly interesting is the

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,160
gatsby cloud

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,880
it's because it's so streamlined for

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,360
gatsby i should check it out

00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,720
um if you haven't checked if you haven't

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,280
seen search yet

00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,640
i really recommend that it's it's you

00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,360
you basically build your site

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,480
and then use one command to publish it

00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,640
um

00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,000
in the cloud on your own domain it's

00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,840
it's really

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,679
magic yeah i know drupal can also be run

00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,480
on raspberry pi

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,919
true jumpstart uh hosting companies they

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,039
they have a number of extra

00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,880
functionalities

00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,720
like you know cookless analytics you

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,440
don't have to worry about gdpr there's a

00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,840
catch

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,559
gatsby cache plugin which speeds up

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,520
builds

00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,400
considerably image optimization which is

00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,440
to be a separate

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:10,799
uh service uh before uh

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,679
it's just a plugin that that is switched

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,160
on on

00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,799
on netlify but there are many solutions

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,080
which are

00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,080
comparably easy

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,799
what are the disadvantages or drawbacks

00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,120
every editing drupal requires a rebuild

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:29,200
before it appears on the front end

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,240
it's simple to automate it can happen

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,280
immediately

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:37,360
but it takes time before

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:40,400
it it's built the trigger is immediate

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,799
but the build note

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,559
there is no fine grained invalidation uh

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,960
like tags

00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,559
um since this year gatsby offers

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:53,600
incremental builds

00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:55,120
uh but if even um

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,960
but the front-end refresh remains a

00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,200
challenge for bigger sites

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,200
over a hundred thousand pages

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,200
yeah the question is do you need to

00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,440
publish

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,160
everything immediately on your site it's

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,880
easy to limit access to pages but

00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,360
coupling with

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,000
drupal rules and permissions is a

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,000
challenge

00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,559
do you really need it or is it just a

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,559
nice to have

00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,720
it's not ideal for sites that focus on

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,240
authenticated users

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,720
but you can still use it on on your

00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,120
public sites compared to drupal you will

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,039
find

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,880
you will have less configuration and you

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,760
have to do some coding

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,160
more coding than in drupal you will have

00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,760
to learn

00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,360
javascript as a basis gatsby for the

00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,720
concept and graphql

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,720
but it's really it's really fun um and

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,280
it's very clear structured

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,120
um i think another drawback is that

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,720
gaspi still suffers from this

00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,120
stigma of sba static generator

00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,080
based on markdown files it's no longer

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,120
true you

00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:59,120
you're welcome to check it out summary

00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,760
so we we've seen the number of roles

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,240
which are definitely on one side or the

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,480
other

00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,280
there is a middle which is undecided

00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,640
where we

00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:14,000
uh still have work to do

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,559
drupal shines not only as cms and an api

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,480
it's it's

00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,480
it's got the potential of using a lot of

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,840
back-end um

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,760
module functionalities that can be

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,520
exposed through the api and

00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,039
very useful in gatsby front and that's

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,919
also one of the reasons why i find

00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,200
gatsby

00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,640
super drupal more superior over other

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,039
cmss

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,679
gatsby shines on a number of fronts that

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:37,039
we

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:40,240
mentioned what are the disadvantages uh

00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:43,039
for gatsby um gatsby

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,960
uh declines uh in advantage when you

00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,880
have more than 100 000 pages

00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,720
even though there is a there's been a

00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,760
use case uh also earlier today in a

00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,520
presentation

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:56,640
uh of our site with one million pages

00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:57,919
um if you need immediate propagation of

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,799
changes to the frontend

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:04,480
it's also uh less good fit and um

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,559
if you need to focus on authenticated

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,039
users uh then you may

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,919
want to choose the monology drupal or

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,520
build your own

00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:16,799
custom front end so how does the visual

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,360
visualization of the coupling look like

00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,600
very scientific look at this here it

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,600
comes

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,760
yeah so i think i think that there is

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,120
really really

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,520
good match between these two

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,480
there are some web resources for you to

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,440
look at

00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,919
later and your questions are most

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,039
welcome

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,320
either in this interface or on social

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:45,840
media

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,840
thank you very much for your attention

00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:53,679
yay for gatsby great stuff

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:56,799
um so we have one

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:59,280
question for you thomas um from miro

00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,000
and he says do you have any suggestions

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,320
how to

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:07,840
replace uh layout builder

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:10,400
okay um yeah good question i i

00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:12,000
i didn't i didn't mention that but it's

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,159
this is one of the one of the

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,640
gray areas it should be possible to

00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,640
expose that

00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:24,240
exposed functionality uh through the api

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,760
what do you do with it on gatsbyside is

00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,720
unclear i guess if you

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,840
if you build a gatsby plugin that can

00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,679
consume

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,240
um the layout it will it it may work

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,120
well

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,240
but it requires uh some work it would be

00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:41,679
fantastic if

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,679
if that could happen yeah

00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,880
and would you mind showing the lincoln

00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,360
resources slide again

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,240
if we leave it on that maybe uh just for

00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,080
peter there

00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,159
um and there was a couple of questions

00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,320
that miro sent from me too

00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,080
um and he was just talking about the pr

00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,840
for the gatsby source

00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,280
plug-in um they're apparently having

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,080
some problems i'm not sure

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,960
exactly what um but yeah inherently what

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,080
it does is it

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,200
per um per node that it picks up from

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,799
drupal it makes

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:14,720
um a request per uh for every language

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,919
um to json api because json api doesn't

00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,640
really

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,480
yeah provide all modes for a given

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,880
language or anything like that so there

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,960
is

00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:25,120
a sort of inherent uh performance

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,480
problem there but we are using it um in

00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:30,000
another client's site

00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:33,039
um with like around 10 000 nodes

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,480
um and with incremental builds which is

00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:38,000
um a a feature of gatsby and whether

00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,120
that's on gatsby cloud or hosting

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,799
elsewhere

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,240
it's all good and yeah there are a

00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,760
couple of performance things that you

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,200
need to change

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,559
um but generally okay um

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,480
and yeah i think that's us so

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,320
yeah thank you very much everyone and

00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,559
thank you thomas it was great

00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,360
and let's look forward to some more

00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:59,760
gatsby

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,000
uh presentations this triple con and

00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,640
yeah enjoy yourself

00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,640
