uh we're going to talk about why make

00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,640

we're going to talk about measuring that

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,120

permitting at the end we're going to do

00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,560
questions

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,280
so uh first of all tell us about you so

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,439
we have

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,319
i'm gonna within the live poll i'm gonna

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,599
activate

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,239
uh a couple holes so there's like this

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,519
live

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:16,079
poll uh option

00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,840
within without non-air here and and so

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,519
like are you a front-end developer

00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,680
you a back-end developer are you just

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,400
hanging out and uh

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,199
where where do you lie on the web

00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,280
performance

00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,199
exp like spectrum and stuff and this

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:32,720
will help us maybe like tailor

00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,680
tailor our uh our demos and stuff toward

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,199
you

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,800
you see live results here the polls are

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,280
adjusting as people actually vote and

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,320
they're

00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,080
i know this is moving around this is the

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,520
this is pretty neat i've never actually

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,720
uh used this before so that's pretty

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,320
cool

00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,840
so what i'm seeing right now so far is

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,960
we're seeing like uh

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,080
looks like about 40 front end devs uh 50

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,560
back end devs 10 just hanging out

00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,520
um and then as far as the experience

00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,960
with uh

00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,160
web performance um about twenty percent

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,120
are just a little

00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,080
uh three percent none fifty percent

00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,199
learning more

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,520
about a quarter is knows a lot a lot

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,120
yeah and we have six different gurus in

00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,720
here and hopefully you can maybe

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,360
like correct everything that we're

00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,759
saying with

00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,400
pick over this talk hold on i got that

00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,440
backwards

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,840
yeah exactly right what are you guys

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,840
talking about

00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,240
all right so uh let's talk about why

00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,320
make it fast so

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,759
uh ben this is going to be your your

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,600
section right here do you want to

00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,080
go ahead and talk about why make this

00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,120
fast yeah i'll say some words and i

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,560
guess a lot of you are pretty

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,560
experienced with performance

00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,000
so really if you know performance

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,759
already and why it matters

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,520
this is more for people you're working

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,960
with because i think the biggest problem

00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,000
with performance honestly isn't not

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,520
isn't like what we do it's like we want

00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,639
to do these things but we can't do these

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,479
things because

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,400
i want to get rid of these big

00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,759
javascript libraries on our site

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,440
i want to make sure our images are all

00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,880
compressed when they get uploaded

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,880
but people don't do that at my company

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,680
or my organization like all compressed

00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,600
images

00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,600
someone also walk in tomorrow and upload

00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,319
a four megabyte hero image not know it's

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,639
a problem

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,840
or someone will say we must have that

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,600
extra you know

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,919
javascript chat widget there on the

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,039
screen and people don't always know

00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,280
so really if you know these things

00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,520
already this is ammo you can use

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,639
for your own team tell them hey this

00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,120
actually matters

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,639
let's go to the next slide here please

00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,400
the thing is with the internet

00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,880
that it's a wonderful place full of

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,280
beautiful things and cool stuff

00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,800
you have total control of your site you

00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,880
can add to whatever you want to

00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,639
this is the glory of the free and open

00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,120
web that we know today

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,479
the thing is that if your site has a lot

00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,639
of images on it

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,840
maybe some image carousels or sliders

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,639
where you can slide images around the

00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,360
screen

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,720
maybe you've got a video or two some

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,800
javascripts for

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,160
various features on your site some more

00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,720
third-party javascript

00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,280
a framework maybe a second framework

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,800
some

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,599
pixel some ad some analytics and other

00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,000
things

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,440
maybe you've got a few fonts on that at

00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,520
a certain point

00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,199
even if your design is more delicate

00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,520
than this designer over here

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,960
your site's going to get slow and people

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,639
can't appreciate your site

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,840
because it'll be slow now it's possible

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,360
you're not going to notice this because

00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,080
you'll be working in your beautiful

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,120
office

00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,800
or your beautiful home or in my case in

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,639
an attic in my house which used to be my

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,560
music studio and is now where i spend my

00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,560
entire day all the time every day

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,479
which is fine if you're there in your

00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,919
home on a nice connection

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,080
you may not notice these things that

00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,919
much if you go to a slower site it could

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,000
be somewhat irritating but not a big

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,280
problem but in many cases people are

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,080
accessing your site

00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,599
on mobile devices usually in most cases

00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,160
people get to your site on a mobile

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,319
device

00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,360
like a phone or something like that and

00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,960
maybe your users

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:58,000
all have the latest iphone or galaxy

00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,919
from samsung or whatever maybe there are

00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,080
4g connections all the time

00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,319
but if they're like me that isn't always

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,400
the case so back in the old days

00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,520
i used to go to a place called an office

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
i would do what would be called

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,319
commuting

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,840
so i would actually go on a train to

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,280
this place i've not seen since march

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,840
called new york city

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,360
and on this train i shared my wi-fi with

00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,639
a thousand other people

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,680
and many sites didn't load at all period

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,080
and i knew because as you know also most

00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,199
sites that don't load that fast they

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,039
could load faster

00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,879
but they've got some large images or

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,080
extra javascript or other stuff

00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,599
that keeps them from loading that

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,519
quickly because i was trying to like you

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,120
know deposit a check in my bank or

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,519
access things for work

00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,959
i knew it was possible to be faster it

00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,279
just wasn't

00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,320
and so and also of course people around

00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,680
the world have different kinds of

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,519
experiences

00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,360
many phones most new phones that are

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,880
sold these days are lower powered

00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,040
android devices

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,240
and as mike will be telling you later on

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,880
these devices

00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,600
execute javascript slowly sometimes five

00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,959
times

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,600
ten times more so than the more

00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,640
quick device like you know an iphone and

00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,279
people often

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,560
have 3g connections out there and i've

00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,959
experienced this a lot myself

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,320
the thing is that the latest data that i

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,240
show that

00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,519
the latest data that i've seen showed

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,240
next slide please

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,240
that the average website takes 12

00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,480
seconds load on 3g

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,320
12 seconds is kind of a long time and

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,279
it's worse than that because

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,480
in fact it isn't just 3g out there next

00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,800
slide please

00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,240
40 of bubble connections worldwide are

00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,399
still 2g

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,040
40 and on 2g many sites don't load ever

00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,880
at all

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,080
you'll get the web lite version without

00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,160
the design

00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,839
you'll get a screenshot of your site

00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,160
those kinds of things will happen

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,920
so it really does matter if you want to

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,080
have a site that reaches

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,600
everyone out there all the time that

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,640
there are many cases where performance

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,040
is going to matter

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,640
not just a little bit but a lot so we

00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,440
think performance is important

00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,040
even just 10 of your users 30 of your

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:02,800
users whatever it is

00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,079
it's going to matter and if it was like

00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,880
a bug on your site that affected that

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,279
many users

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,640
you'd fix that bug immediately let's go

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,640
to the next slide over here

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,320
please there's a lot of data out there

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,680
and studies that talk about this

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,519
we won't go over too many of these

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,440
things but there's a couple of things

00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,279
that are newer well not always newer

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,800
studies this new article here

00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,320
at bit.ly slash web hyphen vitals

00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,839
hyphen science i think i'll put into

00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:30,880
that repo in a minute or two i promise

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,000
sorry i didn't do it yet uh this study

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,160
showed that two second

00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,519
delay in a site loading raises user

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,959
dissatisfaction

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,720
and lowered their intent to return to

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,680
the site that was just a two second

00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,839
delay

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,200
uh next slide please another study

00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,040
showed that users

00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,640
notice when buttons took more than 100

00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,360
milliseconds to respond

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,920
so in this study they increased the

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,680
delay

00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,839
in buttons responding from 70

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,839
milliseconds to 100 milliseconds

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,880
people noticed this and they didn't like

00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,040
it when they

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,000
then went beyond that 250 50

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,640
milliseconds

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,680
they've thought these buttons are broken

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,519
they're not working well

00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,120
the quality of the buttons is slower

00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,519
they're just not good buttons

00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,600
and really buttons are fine if they look

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,320
good but they respond slowly people will

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,640
say

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,240
my phone isn't working my site is broken

00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,680
and they'll blame you for it eventually

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,000
and use someone else's site

00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,360
so tell your marketers that uh one more

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,920
slide over here please

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,600
also uh study found a different study

00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,959
that mobile users lost attention after

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,880
four to eight seconds

00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,640
so remember that's 12 seconds for the

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,800
average site in 3g

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,399
if your site's floating in 12 seconds

00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,880
people after a little while

00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:38,480
four seconds five seconds in might just

00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,600
leave your site and press the button at

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,760
the bottom of the phone

00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,640
and go play among us stop that from

00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,399
happening

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,079
making sight faster you can use all

00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,720
these things to convince people on your

00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,560
team

00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,040
but maybe your team says we don't really

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,480
care about users all we care about is

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,760
next slide please money so

00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,680
all right does it actually affect

00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,800
revenue and the answer is

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,320
surprisingly yes not in all cases i've

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,920
seen cases people improve performance

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,000
and revenue didn't increase

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,760
but many cases you improve performance

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,440
revenue does get better because it's a

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,639
better experience people want to stay on

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,959
the side for longer

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,720
to feel better about your site and they

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,440
want to do more things even buy more

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,639
stuff

00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,120
i'm going to drink some water now

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,320
because it's still early over here

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,279
i i want to say notice that how ben used

00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:27,040
euros in his slide here as opposed to

00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:29,200
like something like dollars good job

00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,320
i did use i use real money in this slide

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,959
yeah i'm

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,399
sorry i couldn't get to go to europe for

00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,720
this whole occasion here

00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,160
i'm stuck in my country but we'll get

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,360
through it uh

00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,959
next slide please so there's a lot of

00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,760
studies showing that revenue tends to

00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,920
increase

00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,519
this one over here uh mentioned that

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,399
mobile sites loaded in less than two

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,160
seconds

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,079
at a fifteen percent higher conversion

00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:54,399
rates that's some real money

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,120
and plenty of companies have discovered

00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,560
this also

00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,079
a lot of large companies work on

00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,839
performance because they have resources

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,800
to do it and because they realize that

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,320
it matters

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,120
amazon google facebook and next slide

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,000
please

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,279
ebay for example did this uh big speed

00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,200
push last year

00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,880
because they found that 100 milliseconds

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,120
was cut off of the load time

00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,320
they had point five percent increase in

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,480
add to cart

00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,160
so a second might be a five percent

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,040
increase this kind of thing actually

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,600
matters

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,360
and again for companies that sell more

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,440
things in more developing countries

00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,200
with those lower connections you see

00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,000
cases where people actually double their

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,959
revenue

00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,079
or cut their their abandonment time in

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:36,800
half for example

00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,600
or abandonment rate rather so the money

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,440
matters

00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,519
let's say you say okay we don't care

00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,079
about money either or the users we care

00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,320
only about

00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,279
search you're talking to seo person at

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,440
your company

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,959
well it matters in search two if you go

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,720
to the next slide please

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,040
this is something that google did to

00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,480
improve speed on the web

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,000
actually in 2010 google first included

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,120
speed as a ranking factor

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,360
and desktop searches in 2018

00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,000
google sended this to mobile searches as

00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,040
well so for the last two or three years

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,839
it's been true that sites that have

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,920
faster mobile speed will rank a little

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,959
higher it's a ranking factor

00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:19,120
this happened a little while ago and uh

00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:21,360
next slide please another change was

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,120
announced in may of this year

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,880
so they announced this with a bunch of

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,040
advanced notice because everyone's

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,519
at home and people are disrupted by the

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,959
current situations in the world

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,120
but they announced in may that there'd

00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,720
be a new ranking factor a new signal

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,399
called page experience

00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,000
and page experience is simply a

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,720
combination of something called co-rep

00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,279
vitals

00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,560
which is a series of metrics about speed

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,320
interactivity

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,000
and content stability which we'll be

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,000
discussing in a few minutes

00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,279
it's a combination of that and also

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,639
things they already have

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,800
like um https those kinds of things

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,720
so they announced they were going to be

00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,959
making a new ranking factor

00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,320
and now in november it was announced

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,399
that this would actually happen

00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,760
in may of next year so this new ranking

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,279
factor will be hitting

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,720
may of 2021 and not only will it be a

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,680
ranking factor in search

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,480
but google's top stories carousel which

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,839
is used by publishers to have their

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,360
pieces um right up there and easy to see

00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,560
look at this thank you for this video

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,560
there's an actual video of the top

00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,560
stories carousel in action

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,040
uh this was reserved for pages that use

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:30,079
amp that were valid amp pages

00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,120
this is being changed so next year any

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,959
page can appear

00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,560
in this carousel if it meets google's

00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,880
news guidelines

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,199
but they'll be prioritizing pages that

00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,120
meet page experience guidelines

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,480
so this is really exciting i've worked

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,000
in ample lot myself

00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,920
and i'm pretty excited about this

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,519
because people won't be forced to use

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,560
amp anymore if they want to get top

00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,240
stories carousel

00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,240
they can use whatever they want to but

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,240
we do think that it's a lot easier to

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,680
meet these guidelines using amp than not

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,920
using amp because amp

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,240
makes you be fast we'll be discussing

00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,199
all these things later on today as well

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,240
so there's some reasons to be fast users

00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,800
the money

00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,800
and google search i think other search

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,399
engines do similar things about

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,639
prioritizing pages that are faster

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,759
last slide for me for a few minutes here

00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,759
the nice thing is

00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,959
that it isn't that hard we'll be

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,759
discussing a lot of things today that

00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,240
are elaborate

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,759
and interesting cool for programmers

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,120
like making sure you have 60 frames per

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,959
second animation

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,880
blocking along javascript tasks all

00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,759
kinds of techniques but the basics for

00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,759
most sites

00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,880
are pretty simple for most sites out

00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,720
there on the web

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,079
there are things like a large image or

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:38,240
some sort of other

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,519
you know low hanging fruit as we say you

00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,920
can fix in an hour

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,279
to make your site a lot faster so the

00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,600
basics of performance

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,680
aren't that hard don't require a lot of

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,959
time most days just need those basics

00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,040
done because they're still kind of

00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,639
challenging to remember to actually do

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:56,240
and then you go from there and do the

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,240
more kind of cool programmery things

00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,360
that is it for me for a little bit i

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,959
think we have

00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:04,720
i think yeah so yeah it's last reason

00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,679
most important one more reason after

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,760
sites

00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,360
do it for me i get frustrated by low

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,600
websites or flo

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,720
slow websites if the website's slow i

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,400
have uh you know

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,319
i'll completely throw my monitor across

00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,839
the room that's always full save those

00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,480
monitors from destruction

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,160
make your site faster so let's talk

00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,640
about like what makes a website fast i

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,959
like this

00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,400
video right here uh like these are a

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,919
bunch of race cars you can see

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,919
they're all fast but check out those

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,640
ones on the right they're like a lot

00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,039
faster

00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,840
so like like this begs the question like

00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,000
how do you

00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,360
how do you measure like how like

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,880
everything is fast

00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,080
maybe because it's like you know

00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,520
traveling to speed life how do you

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,640
measure it right

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,320
so we're going to talk a little bit

00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,480
about that right here as soon as i can

00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,720
advance the slide properly

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,080
oh but before we do that we actually

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,400
have a sl a

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,280
demo and and hopefully this is a good

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,760
demo right here

00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,480
are you heard that wasn't there before

00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,000
that's great

00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,000
yeah yeah so ben if you if you would

00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,679
i want you to maybe you'll just play us

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,039
play us some music here as

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,799
as we're doing okay yeah

00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,320
yeah let me know if you're ready here

00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,840
green yeah i'm ready for you

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:18,559
okay all right i'm gonna let no i'm not

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,000
i'm gonna start uh so the first thing

00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,240
i'm gonna do right here is i'm gonna set

00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,400
ourselves to fast 3g

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,880
and then i'm and i'm going to start

00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:31,200
three two one go

00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,000
now if you're not familiar with it this

00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,280
is the

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,760
jeopardy uh waiting music jeopardy is a

00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:43,840
um is a uh we call it a game show here

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,840
in the us

00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:48,480
[Music]

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:57,840
so this is a normal experience maybe

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:57,840
while you're at a conference

00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:08,190
[Music]

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,840
keep on going

00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:20,449
there we go

00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:20,449
[Music]

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:27,919
keep going

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:30,080
keep on going we're almost done

00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,360
all right i think that's good thank you

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,880
i'm gonna clap for everybody

00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:37,039
everybody clap here so uh

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,880
we're gonna talk about image

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:41,280
optimization here you can see that

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,280
that uh there's a six megabyte image in

00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:45,600
there so like obviously

00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,640
um i i'm pretty sure everybody's

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,400
everybody's

00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,080
attended conferences in real life and if

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,760
not you know they're a lot of fun but

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,799
when you go to conferences

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,799
there's a whole bunch of people

00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,799
on the same wi-fi and typically you get

00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:01,120
like very very slow collection

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,880
connections um as we get into

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,080
performance i want to i want to

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,640
differentiate between

00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,799
back end and front-end performance when

00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,159
people think drupal performance a lot of

00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,200
people will talk about things like

00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,320
caching

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,360
and um sql queries and

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,159
you know php profiling and apc

00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,440
and you know php fpm and all that all

00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,480
that fun stuff we're not talking about

00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,919
that we're talking about

00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,559
uh front end performance and so you're

00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:28,640
gonna you're gonna hear like things like

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,640
uh things like large largest contentful

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,240
paint uh you know page rendering

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,280
painting compositing um external scripts

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,320
and things like that

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,919
so that's what we're gonna talk about um

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,679
if you're interested in the back end

00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,120
side of things uh including

00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,600
uh caching and performance there's a

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,960
great talk uh by fabian franz who really

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,280
really

00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,159
knows this stuff but i'm sorry about

00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,159
because this actually happened

00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:59,039
but these are all

00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:03,120
these these are all recorded um

00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:05,280
and like obviously uh without

00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,120
any back-end performance your front-end

00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,640
performance is going to be slow so if

00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,159
if your back-end takes a couple seconds

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,320
to load while your front end can't like

00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,000
you know go faster than that

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,159
i guess unless you know you have like

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,240
some type of pwa stuff going on

00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,400
and it just loads so maybe maybe it can

00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,799
you know

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,799
um front end performance is important 80

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:28,080
to 90 percent of the end user response

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,840
time is spent on front end start there

00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,919
this is a quote from steve souters who

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,520
was a very smart person steve souters

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,520
uh was i believe like the chief

00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,880
performance officer at google now he

00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,880
works for a company

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,960
does he work for either fastly or speed

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,440
curve i'm not even sure but

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,159
he works in uh web performance and he's

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,559
just wrote

00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:48,159
written a lot of articles about it so

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,880
let's kind of get into some

00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:51,440
front end performance metrics right here

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,039
um

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,360
the first thing that is mostly a

00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,520
measurement of of the back end processes

00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,559
is basically time to first byte and what

00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,880
that is is

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,720
when as as soon as the browser starts

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,600
that navigation how long does it take to

00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,760
get that first

00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,640
you know little bit of html back you

00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,320
know things like

00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,679
things that affect the time to first by

00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,720
are not number one

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,080
um are things like your your dns which

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,760
is when your

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,360
computer tries to look up the ip address

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,080
of the server um

00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,240
uh uh tls connection you know to

00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,039
establish like a secure connection to

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,280
the server

00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,440
and then obviously uh things like the

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,000
back end performance response time like

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,360
that will

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,760
affect your time to first bite we also

00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,440
another another important metric is

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,360
first contentful paint first contentful

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,240
paint is actually when stuff shows up on

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,840
the screen

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,200
you know there's a lot that needs to

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,400
happen before it shows up on the screen

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,559
we're going to talk about that

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,520
but things that are important here are

00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,480
are like

00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,039
uh things that are called within the

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,679
critical

00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:53,600
the critical path and things that the

00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,679
browser needs before it can even render

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:58,480
are things like the html

00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,840
it needs all the css depending on how

00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,720
you have a setup it might need the web

00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:03,840
fonts

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,600
and um you need you need to it needs to

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,120
download and process

00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,840
all the javascript that's in the head

00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:12,480
that's not either deferred or async

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,360
um there's time to interactive time to

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,320
interactive

00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:18,320
is is that thing where like when does

00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,200
your website become interactive and have

00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,360
you ever like

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,480
you know had had your phone in and you

00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,919
go to a website

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,520
and you hit the button and then nothing

00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,200
happens and

00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,200
and so what do you do naturally well you

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,559
hit it like more forcefully because you

00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,919
think well hey if i hit it more

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,880
forcefully that's going to make a

00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,480
difference

00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,000
that's really not going to make a

00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,120
difference if you haven't figured that

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,840
out yet

00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,440
it is the the the javascript main thread

00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,520
is busy and it's not responding to user

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,720
inputs and the site is not interactive

00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,120
yet

00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,320
um you can see this on this particular

00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,320
uh chart right here

00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,400
where like the yellow is all the

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,240
javascript uh processing

00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,520
and right when that's done is when the

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,640
website is

00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,919
and was uh interactive um

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,919
something else that's important is the

00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,440
speed index and the speed index is

00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,880
is basically a number and you get you

00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,840
can get this by running the lighthouse

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,240
reports we're going to

00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,880
demo this a little bit later the speed

00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,600
index

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,880
is basically how quickly your page

00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,279
approaches

00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,240
visually complete you know so like for

00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:19,679
example if

00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,919
if i have two web pages and

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:24,240
they both maybe finish loading right at

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,960
12 seconds but one of them's pretty much

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:30,000
loaded all throughout the process that

00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:32,960
will have a higher speed index core

00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,600
and uh ben do you want to maybe talk

00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,240
about

00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,600
this slide yeah i pressed the wrong

00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,720
button there for a minute but i think

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,240
i'm back now

00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:43,039
i want to zoom there we go now i'm

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,240
bigger i can hear you fine go ahead

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,320
yeah i think i'm too big now i'm going

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,360
to get a little smaller that's good

00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,039
okay i'm a good size so yeah by the way

00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,640
my favorite was always speed index it's

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,799
uh as he was saying it's the

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,559
how fast things above the fold above the

00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:59,279
place before you actually scroll down

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,480
up here it's a nice one and webpagetest

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,640
is a fine tool

00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,919
so um we're gonna discuss here i

00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,799
mentioned before this thing called core

00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:07,039
web vitals

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,559
which is this new thing that google

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,080
other folks have been discussing for the

00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,840
last couple of years

00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,279
ways to measure speed that are maybe

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,440
more standardized

00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,640
the idea here is to measure these three

00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,440
kinds of things

00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,039
and to find numbers that kind of tell

00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,200
you whether these things are happening

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,320
the first one being we're discussing all

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,799
along here

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,640
how fast does the page actually load so

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,679
you're looking at your screen

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,480
is anything happening or not really

00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,440
number two interactivity so is it

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,799
responsive

00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,880
is it the case that you see things

00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:40,880
appearing but you try to scroll

00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,520
or press a button nothing actually

00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,799
happens or does it respond immediately

00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,080
and third visual stability which is

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,880
when you're looking at the screen there

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,799
do things kind of appear and stay there

00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,000
or as they load did things shift around

00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,080
a lot which can be

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,120
jarring and confusing and really reduce

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,600
user trust

00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,120
uh next slide please these things are

00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,799
supposed to measure that

00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:08,000
core web vitals these are lcp

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,279
largest contentful paint and fid first

00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,320
input delay

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:14,240
and cls cumulative layout shift each of

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,159
these corresponds to those three things

00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,360
we'll just go to each of those in turn

00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,279
and if you can press the button there

00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,799
you see a cool number drop down

00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,320
it is thought that you should be able to

00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,360
meet these metrics here

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,840
75 percent of page loads

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,520
so for lcp two and a half seconds or

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,240
less is considered good

00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,360
and for fid 100 milliseconds is

00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,799
considered good

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,400
and for cumulative layout shift it's a

00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,600
measurement that's new one

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,039
point and uh to hear about about why

00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,760
these things are all true you can look

00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,080
in uh

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,360
and mike's repo web.dev has a lot of

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,159
discussion about how these things were

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,840
chosen

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,279
and the discussion process that went on

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,600
the people at google

00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,120
w3c performance group and various

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,000
performance experts around the world

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,200
who discuss these things and by the way

00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,279
they've been discussed a lot but they're

00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,120
also an evolving standard so

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,720
they'll be changing next year because

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,559
the web is always changing

00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,000
so next year i mean that could be

00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,000
changing a lot but there'll be new

00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,520
things coming in there'll be tweaks made

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,320
as people give feedback

00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,720
and as the web again is always adapting

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,080
to

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:18,080
new technologies next slide please

00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,480
one cool thing about this this is a new

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,480
thing is that these come from the chrome

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,799
user experience report

00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,080
so people that use chrome who've

00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,880
consented to this

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,840
their data on speed is put together

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,840
aggregated

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,120
anonymized and put into this large

00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,440
public database

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,480
it's open anybody can query this you can

00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,559
look at your site

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,320
your competitors sites other things on

00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,640
the web and see

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,320
what kinds of things happen as they load

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,799
it's full of tons of interesting

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,559
and fascinating data actually side note

00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,039
rick viscomi who did much of the work on

00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,200
this

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,480
spoke at drupalcon europe two years ago

00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,120
was telling me that he got the

00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,039
schnitzel and all this cool food so once

00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,679
again i miss the idea of traveling

00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:02,159
to interesting places uh not this time

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,399
to travel upstairs to our attic

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,919
so next slide please the first of these

00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,919
things lcp

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,960
largest contentful paint or if you want

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,080
to say this way

00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,960
contentful paint is pretty simple

00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,880
it measures how long it takes for the

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,080
biggest thing above the fold

00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:22,159
to appear so by above the fold i mean

00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:24,080
the stuff you see on your phone here or

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,240
device before you scroll down

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,360
so the biggest thing there whether it's

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,080
a hero image

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,760
a block of text whatever it is how long

00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,520
does this thing take to appear

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,840
it was chosen because it's a good proxy

00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,919
for what users regularly perceive as

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,559
is this thing loading or not and because

00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:44,799
it's very easy to define

00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:47,039
next slide please fid first input delay

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,840
is the time between when things appear

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,440
on the screen

00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,679
i'm sorry that's not right i'm thinking

00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,440
of something else the time between the

00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,679
uh when the user first interacts with

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,480
the page and then something actually

00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,600
happens

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,840
so things appear menu button appears

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,360
user taps on this button does it

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,080
actually do anything

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,279
or not try to scroll the screen does

00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,799
actually scroll

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:11,120
or is there a delay before the scroll

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,679
occurs this is the case 400 milliseconds

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,440
or less feels kind of natural and good

00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,520
it was like 300 milliseconds a third of

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,000
a second almost it feels

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,840
weird and slow and janky users think

00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,919
this thing is kind of broken

00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,679
by the way i have to put links over

00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,880
there in the top right hand corner

00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,000
there's information about all these

00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:32,320
things in more detail web.dev

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,360
next slide please finally cumulative

00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,520
layout shift

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,640
this is a measure of stability it's that

00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,279
thing where you're loading up

00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,520
a page and things begin to shift around

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,279
so i'm home a lot these days

00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,600
doing a lot of cooking looking a lot of

00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,640
recipe sites i find often looking at a

00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,480
recipe site

00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,000
and it starts to load up i see some text

00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,480
there someone's talking about

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,200
i traveled once to milan and saw this

00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:55,840
person making

00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,080
pasta or whatever and then suddenly it

00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,679
moves around because an image loads in

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,679
the images dimensions weren't declared

00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,520
in advance the image loads in

00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,720
so it takes a part of the screen all the

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,799
text moves around

00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,760
the browser reflows the page takes a

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,240
couple you know a little while to do

00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,679
that

00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,760
and i'm looking at the text where i just

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,399
found it now and it moves again

00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,279
because a video just popped in showing

00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,200
something else

00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:19,039
and looking at that now it moves around

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,440
again because maybe a video

00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:23,039
ad pops in i'm watching a video ad

00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,440
instead of looking at my text

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,520
so these shifts as the page load don't

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,440
feel good they feel unstable

00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,720
you're looking at a newspaper or a book

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,559
it doesn't do that

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,000
and you don't want that to happen so

00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,760
this is the measurement of that

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,279
this is measured i can describe it in

00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,320
more detail if you're curious but

00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,360
basically

00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,000
it's the sum of the of the how do i say

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,159
this

00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,520
if you take the parts that move think

00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,159
about how big they are

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,360
and then take how far they move multiply

00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,279
those things together

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,200
take all the parts that move add those

00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,760
things up that's commutative layout

00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,240
shift

00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,519
so each part of the screen that moves

00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,080
take the percentage of the screen which

00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,000
moves

00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,760
how far it moved take the product of

00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,240
those things add them up

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,559
and you get this nice new score there's

00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,880
a new api called layout instability api

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:09,919
that measures this if that's kind of

00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,559
hard to understand

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,720
as i kind of babble through this here

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:18,080
please look at web.dev

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,840
cls next slide please so they did a

00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,159
little study and they found

00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,360
that when a site meets these thresholds

00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,320
users are 24

00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,360
less likely to abandon page loads 24

00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,679
less likely

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,200
so we think these things actually do

00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,679
work

00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,240
uh next slide please next question is of

00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,960
course

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,240
how do drupal sites do on this and

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,760
drumroll please

00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,480
uh there's no drumroll because there's

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,480
the next slide

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,080
on my keyboard here goodbye

00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:49,760
all right never mind that was not

00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,480
appropriate timing wise it's already

00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,919
there

00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,799
so it turns out that on desktop devices

00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,919
about 35 of drupal sites pass corrupt

00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:01,279
vitals

00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:03,919
on mobile about 22 so this is not

00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,720
most sites but this is not that bad

00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,799
because

00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,960
look at the different metrics over here

00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,679
you'll see that most drupal sites

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,799
pass each metric on most kinds of

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,360
devices

00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:17,039
just put it all together passing all

00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,919
these things is harder than passing just

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,399
one of them

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,399
notice especially first input delay on

00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,240
desktop is spectacular

00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:25,919
it's harder on mobile of course because

00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,240
this is from real world data

00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,000
and mobile devices tend to be slower

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,679
than desktop devices and beyond worse

00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,919
connections

00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:35,200
also further good news for drupal and

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,919
part of why i'm interested in being here

00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,159
today

00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,320
is that of the top top five cms's in the

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,799
world of these top five cms's

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,760
wordpress drupal joomla wix and

00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,080
squarespace

00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,360
drupal was the best and largest

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,840
contentful paint

00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,799
and it was the best in cumulative layout

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,640
shift

00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,159
so cmss are challenged in general

00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,039
because people don't always have control

00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,120
of the code

00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,799
you're adding modules or in some cases

00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,360
plugins and things which add their own

00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,360
code

00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:03,840
their own css it's hard to control all

00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:05,760
these things or know it's doing what

00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,120
this is part of why cms's tend to have

00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,720
these kinds of problems

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,720
but i think drupal is extra promising

00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,720
and the community is really strong

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,919
and i want to be here to just kind of

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,000
talk about performance

00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,360
learn from everybody here and really

00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,519
find out how to make things

00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,799
even better than they are and in fact

00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:22,240
you stick around

00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,919
in nine hours from now at the end of

00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,960
this workshop we're going to have some

00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,559
ideas

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,640
some things that are current issues

00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,600
right now that are either happening or

00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,320
being discussed

00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,360
for how to make drupal sites just better

00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,080
for everybody

00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,480
so how drupal core can by default make

00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,410
all

00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,760
sites faster nine hours

00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:44,559
[Laughter]

00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,679
or whatever it actually is i've lost

00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:49,279
track

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:51,760
yeah more like 10 12. so

00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:52,320
measuring performance let's talk about

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,760
measuring

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,600
performance here we're getting into like

00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:58,640
the more of the uh

00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,200
like the big content here and uh i also

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,840
want to

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,760
know how we have kilometers per hour as

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:06,159
opposed to miles per hour

00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,960
looked at the correct one i really like

00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,480
the graphic

00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:10,960
yes it's legit but this is ben slide and

00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,919
he's

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,760
feet for this mansion and this kid is

00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:18,639
wearing cracks

00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:21,040
so we're gonna talk yeah he's upset by

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,040
the what

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,760
i don't know so uh let's talk about like

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,919
tools we're gonna

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,200
we're gonna do some demos and and run

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:34,879
through some tools here we're to talk

00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,240
about chrome developer tools i'm going

00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,000
to talk about that

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:40,079
ben's going to talk about page speed

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,560
insights

00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:44,720
and go into lighthouse i'm going to talk

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,919
about webpagetest.org which is

00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:48,960
amazing ben's going to go back to search

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:51,359
console

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,800
and chrome ux report and i'm really

00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,320
interested personally in the chrome ux

00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,839
report because i've only used that in a

00:34:54,320 --> 00:35:01,200
in a more in the most basic

00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:04,240
sense so yeah so uh

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,160
i'm gonna do devtools here so let's kind

00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,040
of do this

00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,920
um so the first thing that i'm gonna do

00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,440
right here is

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:16,400
i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna load up

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,079
uh chrome canary here and i like uh

00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,520
chrome canary

00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,359
because number one it has the newest

00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,000
stuff chrome canary is like two versions

00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,680
in the future

00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,200
there's some stuff that that can be

00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,440
broken um

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,359
but when you're loading up developer

00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,800
tools it's nice to either

00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:33,280
kind of uh open up a new profile as a

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,280
guest

00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,720
or just open up like something like

00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,480
canary into reason so you don't have

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,400
extensions loaded

00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,920
if you're running if you're profiling a

00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,280
site it will profile extensions because

00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,320
that's javascript that's running on the

00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,440
page

00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,040
so yeah um so let's uh

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,760
open up a website here my hometown

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,839
newspaper is gainesville.com and i'm

00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:57,119
gonna profile that because it is

00:35:53,839 --> 00:36:00,400
a uh it's a typical newspaper website

00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:03,200
here in in the us and

00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,040
um has a lot you know has a lot of

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:07,599
javascript it has a lot of ads

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,240
and you know the the newspapers here in

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,040
the us

00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,079
they're they're kind of not doing so

00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,119
well because the internet's kind of

00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,240
eating them for

00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,720
you know eating up a lot of their

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:18,400
business and so so they keep it

00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,440
so they're trying to fix that by jamming

00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,640
in more ads so they can make more

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,839
revenue right

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,800
so the first thing i'm going to do right

00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,240
here is i'm going to go to the

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,720
performance tab over here

00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,240
and well actually even before that let

00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,920
me i'm going to move this down to

00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,760
horizontal right here

00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:36,720
i'm going to um one thing i like to do

00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,599
is before i do a performance profile i

00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,680
actually like

00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:41,440
kind of delete the bodies because if

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,000
it's taken to screenshots sometimes

00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,800
screenshots will show up and i'm going

00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,320
to

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,079
kind of put this in another window i'm

00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,400
going to move the

00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:52,480
page over here and get back to devtools

00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,800
i'm going to go to the performance tab

00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,640
and i am going to hit this like little

00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,680
refresh button up here you can i think

00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:00,000
hit it here too

00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,599
and it says start profiling and reload

00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,480
the page and this is really useful right

00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,720
here

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,560
so just about install because i said

00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,119
mike before my first band's first

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,920
drummer

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,119
was from gainesville he was really good

00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,480
he was incredibly good

00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,400
after two shows he quit the band to move

00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,680
back to gainesville so

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,320
yeah well gainesville is an awesome

00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:20,160
place gainesville is in north central

00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,440
florida so yeah

00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:26,800
so um one thing that i did not do

00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:30,240
uh here just for the sake of brevity is

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:34,240
uh i normally try to run this at

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:37,760
i run my profiles and fast 3g or slow

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:39,119
3g right now i just did it online

00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,880
which is just full bandwidth but

00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,599
normally you do the stuff in fast 3g or

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,920
slow 3

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,119
3g so right now i'm at the performance

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,359
tab

00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,720
and um hopefully everybody can see so

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:49,200
i'm going to i'm going to kind of walk

00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,960
through

00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,240
a couple a couple things right here and

00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,280
i'm going to use i have

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:57,760
like a little touch pad here and i can

00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,839
kind of move around

00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,880
and i like this because you can kind of

00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:04,320
zoom in and

00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,640
zoom over and things like that um

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,359
so so the first thing i want to show is

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,760
this little

00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,880
uh chart up here it shows a couple

00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,960
different colors here you're going to

00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,160
see the yellow the yellow is scripting

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,720
you're going to see the purple the

00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,359
purple the purple is layout

00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,720
or rendering and the green if you see

00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:23,359
green

00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,920
and here you i like you think you see

00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:28,160
green

00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:30,160
right in here over

00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,079
right in here the green is actually

00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,280
painting so you can see like

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:37,520
initially we have like a whole bunch of

00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,640
uh javascript that's that's coming in

00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,079
right here

00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:45,680
and uh within here you can also um

00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:47,040
sometimes maybe

00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,599
zoom out a little bit so we can see

00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:50,960
better you can see the network waterfall

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,560
in here now now you're going to see the

00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,000
network waterfall in a couple places on

00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,000
the network tab up here

00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,079
but you also see it right here and this

00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
is useful because you can use this to

00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,680
compare like as you go

00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,079
out it changes along with like uh things

00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,359
like

00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:10,320
the uh like the the

00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,720
the the primary main thread right here

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,839
um

00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,119
a couple things that you're gonna see up

00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:15,440
here on the timeline is you're gonna see

00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:18,640
these like little red ticks up here and

00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:20,640
and and things like that uh these

00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,040
these red ticks up here are just like

00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,320
when the pages frame rate drops below a

00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,359
certain criteria i don't really know

00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,200
what that does it might be like 30

00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:30,000
frames a second or something like that

00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,760
and this is highlighting when devtools

00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,040
thinks this page is janky

00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,480
you know like you know when you like

00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,200
kind of scroll up and down or you move

00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:37,359
stuff

00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,480
and and the page doesn't respond yet

00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,800
that's the

00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,560
i i always call that jankiness that's

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,680
that's what devtools is highlighting

00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:47,040
right there

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:50,640
and so now you now you can see these

00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:51,520
uh i'm going to expand this main thread

00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,359
right here

00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,720
and you can see this flame chart right

00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,359
here and this is like really really

00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,720
useful

00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:01,920
um because so so the way this

00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,760
flame chart does is or works is it'll

00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,440
it'll it'll show like you know a

00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,200
function that calls something else that

00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,079
calls something else as it works its way

00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,359
down

00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:13,680
but it's not the height of this

00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:15,200
of these items doesn't matter so much as

00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:17,280
is the length of them

00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,560
you want shorter tasks i'm going to talk

00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,640
about this a little bit later but you

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:24,160
want shorter tasks and the reason

00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,440
is because um if you have the if you

00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,200
have a long task

00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,280
similar to this right here you can see

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:34,400
that this this task right here

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:36,640
is 93 you know milliseconds

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,079
it while this task is running the

00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,240
website is not responding

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,760
to event listeners you know so if

00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,960
someone taps something it's not doing

00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,599
anything

00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,000
and and that's that's why this like

00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,640
little red bar is showing up right here

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,520
it kind of highlights those for you a

00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,319
lot of times

00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:57,119
you can kind of get in here i'm gonna

00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:58,880
expand this up here

00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:00,160
you can get in here and you can actually

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:06,240
see

00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:08,400
um you can click on where's

00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:09,280
yeah right here you can actually click

00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:11,119
and you can see

00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,480
what's causing this right here so i can

00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,040
see there's

00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,560
literally a script called pb and j

00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,079
sandwich like peanut butter and jelly

00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,599
sandwich what could the script be doing

00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:23,200
you can actually click on this

00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:25,520
you can go into into

00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,640
the sources panel and it'll actually

00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,160
show you

00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:31,599
uh how long each line takes

00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,040
you can pretty print this by hitting

00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,440
this pretty print button up here these

00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,599
like little brackets down here

00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,280
and you can kind of go down and it says

00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:41,760
like all right well this takes

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,000
0.3 milliseconds and you can kind of

00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,839
scroll down and you can maybe find

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,480
some of these ones that take a long time

00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,480
um

00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,319
that can be really useful when profiling

00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,920
debugging

00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:55,520
um let's see what else i need to go

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,960
through right here um

00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,200
let's go into the network tab the

00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,280
network tab is is really useful i

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,040
i i recommend that everybody kind of

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:06,160
like

00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:09,200
check this out just

00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,640
look at it because look at it on normal

00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,280
sites so you know what a normal site

00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,760
looks like

00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,200
look at it on on sites like this that

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,800
have a lot of javascript so you can

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,319
identify i'm going to reload right here

00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,440
just so we can get

00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:23,760
kind of a quicker

00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,200
you can so you can see this connection

00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,640
view at the top right here

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,599
and you can see various connections

00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,440
coming in and i'm going to

00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,040
hit the stop recording button up here

00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,760
you can see the waterfall view right

00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,440
here

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,599
when you click on this right here you

00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,720
can see like all right well

00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:40,960
it looks like right here we're

00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,680
connecting to a different domain so you

00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,280
can see

00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,880
you can click on this and you can see

00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,920
like all right

00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:51,440
well well you know it takes 18 second

00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:54,319
milliseconds for a dns lookup the uh the

00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,680
ssl and connection takes like about 200

00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:58,160
milliseconds and then the time to first

00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,640
bite is around 200 milliseconds

00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,839
um you can see this type of stuff right

00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,800
here and

00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:05,920
um it's it's kind of useful but what i

00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,119
find really useful

00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:11,359
is sorting by size right here if you

00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:12,319
sort by size you can identify your

00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:15,119
largest

00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:16,319
uh your largest resources typically

00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:17,760
these are images

00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:20,480
these images right here seem to be

00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:22,160
optimized pretty well you can also

00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:23,920
filter at the top you can see there's

00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,079
like all these tabs are up here you can

00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,319
you can filter by images and you can see

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:29,040
like the types of images you can see

00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,480
there's a webp

00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,119
which is a modern image format right

00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,560
here um and then you can

00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:36,640
click on javascript you can see the

00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,040
largest javascript files which are all

00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,160
like relatively reasonable here 127

00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:44,319
kilobytes

00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:46,880
is is relatively reasonable um

00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:48,480
something else that's very useful uh

00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,599
with this type of stuff is that there's

00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,440
this little uh

00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:53,280
text box up here you can filter on so

00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,520
you can filter like

00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,560
things like domain you know that i can

00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,800
filter

00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,599
based on gainesville.com and like it'll

00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,040
show me

00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,560
everything that comes in directly from

00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,599
gainesville.com there's not that much

00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,319
right here

00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,319
but you can also filter on things that

00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:11,839
come in from different domains

00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,880
by clicking on by adding a little minus

00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,480
in front of there

00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,640
and what's really interesting is when

00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,160
you're adding

00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:19,920
adding like a minus you can actually

00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,119
profile against like different scripts

00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:24,000
so like let's say i

00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:25,520
i see this script right here coming from

00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,280
tiny past i'm not quite sure

00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,800
or actually you know there was a pb and

00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:31,160
j script i don't even know what that was

00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:33,520
on pbj

00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:35,440
pbj peanut butter and jelly script i

00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,040
have no clue what this is right here

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,440
but what i can do is i can right click

00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:42,240
on this and i can hit block

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,440
block request url this opens up a pane

00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,520
at the bottom right here

00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,640
and it'll block this so if i reload this

00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:49,760
the script

00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:51,839
is not going to load and

00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:53,599
it's just gonna it's just gonna block it

00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:54,560
and what that enables me to do enables

00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,480
me to profile

00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,319
with and without that and if you do

00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,599
multiple profiles you can actually

00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:01,520
access them so if i

00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:03,440
like say if i hit reload again right

00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,119
here with this

00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,319
after this is done i'm just going to hit

00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,599
stop to get this done a little bit

00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:09,680
quicker here

00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,200
uh you will actually see a drop down of

00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,800
your different profiles up here i think

00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,079
a store is up to five and that's

00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:16,720
like kind of useful because it actually

00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,720
gives you like a little you know kind of

00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,240
a little comparison right here it would

00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,680
be it would be nice maybe this is a

00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:24,079
feature that we could ask for ben

00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:25,680
is is a way to like compare this and and

00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,040
large screens like different profiles

00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:31,119
like that

00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:33,200
um that's super useful what else am i

00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,720
want to look at here on the network tab

00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:35,920
so i'm going to go back to the network

00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:38,880
tab right here

00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,880
get out of this pane

00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,319
click out of this something else that's

00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,560
really useful is looking at your total

00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:46,880
http requests down here

00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,000
so and and you can see your uh total

00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,640
file sizes

00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,480
now http requests we used to try to

00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:53,200
limit those as much as possible but if

00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,680
you're using

00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,040
like newer protocols such as http 2 and

00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:58,880
http 3

00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,560
that's not as big of a deal and you can

00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,160
you can see that there's a protocol

00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:05,200
column here that says h2

00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,800
or h3 that's http 2 and http 3 and of

00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,839
course you see some coming down under

00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:12,640
http 1 right there

00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:14,079
a couple other really interesting

00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,640
columns that you're going to see here is

00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:20,880
the initiator column and so

00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:24,240
i can say like well why am i loading

00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,240
this main.gr script here like where the

00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:28,480
heck is this even coming from

00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,520
and i can see like the initiator right

00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,400
here is this

00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,800
this right here or you know this pixel

00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,480
um

00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,319
i can i can say like all right well

00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,160
what's loading this image right here

00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:39,599
this image is being loaded by this

00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:41,520
script you know

00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:44,079
if i see index up here that means it's

00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,079
included in the direct html

00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,760
that's really useful when tracking stuff

00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,359
down

00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:51,440
something else that's really cool here

00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:52,560
is a priority so

00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:55,119
i'm going to talk about this a little

00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,960
bit later but but the priority column

00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:58,640
is how the browser prioritizes the

00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:01,440
content and

00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,480
and that's pretty useful now um with

00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,960
http 2

00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,079
the server can actually priority or

00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:08,800
shoot down the content

00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:10,160
initially too so so there's there's

00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,040
different ways to do that and i was

00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,240
actually

00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:15,040
ben and i were looking at something a

00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:18,800
little bit uh yesterday and i was i was

00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:21,520
some of that stuff even confuses me um

00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:23,280
something that's really useful here is

00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,880
i'm gonna sort by waterfall is

00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,720
you can see the time to first bite right

00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,920
here when i go to timing up here so i

00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:30,160
can see

00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,280
i'm i'm going to click on the uh

00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,960
gainesville.com

00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,680
and you can see the time to first bite

00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:38,079
right here is uh 32 milliseconds that's

00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:41,599
that's excellent actually

00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:43,119
and a couple other useful things that

00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:45,920
we're going to see right here

00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,240
is i like this there's an option up here

00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,280
for

00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,800
large request rows right here you see

00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,000
this check box up here i'm checking

00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,040
right here it's large request

00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:57,359
rows and this will actually show you the

00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,119
uncompressed and compressed size

00:47:57,359 --> 00:48:01,599
uh you know this is like with and

00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:05,200
without gzip or compression

00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:07,359
so this enables you to identify things

00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:09,040
that might not be gzipped like you know

00:48:07,359 --> 00:48:10,559
which is which is pretty valuable

00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,480
gzipped if you're not

00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:13,760
a compression compression there's a

00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:16,079
couple different ways to compress

00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,880
stuff when g-zipping is the most popular

00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:20,319
but

00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,920
um when the server shoot data down to

00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:24,079
the browser they typically just

00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,440
kind of almost zip it up compress it and

00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:26,880
then the browser behind the scenes just

00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:28,079
uncompresses everything and it happens

00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,599
really really quickly

00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,599
that's best practice to do that and you

00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:35,440
want to make sure you're doing that

00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:36,079
um and a couple other useful things

00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,400
within

00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:40,160
chrome developer tools that are uh

00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,599
performance related is i'm gonna open up

00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,200
the panel at the bottom and i'm doing

00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:44,319
this by hitting the escape button right

00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:47,200
here

00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:48,319
um and i think there's actually like you

00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,720
know a

00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:51,920
show panel or something up here maybe i

00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,880
don't know but i just usually just hit

00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:56,000
the escape button

00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:58,880
to open that up and there's a

00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:00,400
rendering uh you can click down here and

00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,000
you can bring up additional options so

00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:03,920
there's rendering right here

00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,520
and there's a bunch of really cool like

00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,440
runtime things right here so you have

00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,839
things like paint flashing

00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,720
and if i do paint flashing and i i move

00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:12,319
this around

00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:14,880
and you can you can see that there's

00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:18,079
some green flashing coming in here

00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:20,319
and this is these are real yeah yeah

00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,119
these these are repaints happening right

00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:23,520
here

00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,280
now you can see like there's a repaint

00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,880
happening when i hover because the hover

00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:29,839
site is changing that's not

00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,400
so much of a big deal but if i scroll

00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:32,400
like i've

00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,000
i've seen pages before where you scroll

00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,760
down and the whole

00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,680
thing is turning green that means you're

00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:40,400
repainting on scroll

00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:42,400
and that's that's a that's very bad that

00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,520
will make your page like feel very janky

00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:45,680
as you scroll

00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:46,800
and it's the same thing for animations

00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:48,960
um

00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,559
another another really cool thing here

00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:51,200
let me just kind of see if i can go back

00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:54,960
and forth

00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,960
uh there's there's a

00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,000
there was a fps meter i don't see it

00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:01,359
here

00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:04,160
these things constantly change right

00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,720
here um there was an fps meter that

00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,480
would show

00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:08,480
like how many frames per second that you

00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:09,920
have and normal frames per second is 60

00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,880
frames per second

00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,599
um there's also like a couple cool

00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,240
things like

00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:17,599
i i've used a scrolling performance

00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:21,599
before

00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:23,280
and um i haven't really figured out

00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,040
exactly how it works i do i probably

00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,280
need to look into that but

00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:28,960
all these things in here can be like

00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:30,720
really really useful this is brand new

00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:32,880
it looks like disabled local fonts i

00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:34,559
haven't used this before so like if

00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,760
you're using like the app font face rule

00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:36,480
you can actually load local fonts if

00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,240
they're available

00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,520
and this maybe gives you an option to

00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,720
disable those so you have to load them

00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:41,839
from the network when you're testing out

00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,079
your website

00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:45,280
um there's also layout layout borders

00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:46,559
layout borders is

00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,640
is kind of useful you can see there's

00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,960
like these blue and there'll normally be

00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:52,319
like

00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:55,680
orange uh borders in here too

00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:57,440
and uh that's really interesting i don't

00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:00,480
know how useful it is but it's like

00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:02,640
interesting because um

00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,520
when the browser is putting together

00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,319
your

00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:07,440
your web page it creates like different

00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,960
different layers which

00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:11,280
that can then move around very

00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,440
efficiently um

00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,040
there's other options in here like

00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,319
disable avif

00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:19,839
and disable webp so like so say

00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:21,040
you know you're using modern image

00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:23,040
formats and you want to see what those

00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:25,680
look like

00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,400
like if those are not available you can

00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,480
check those

00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,839
right there so these are all like

00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,599
fantastic tools

00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:33,520
and i'm probably covering less than 10

00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:36,079
percent of them

00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:37,839
and honestly there's like documentation

00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:39,440
on all these but the best way

00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:41,280
is just like to get in here and just

00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,240
like start screwing around with stuff

00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,079
like i do this

00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:46,319
all the time like i don't even really

00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:50,160
know what this highlight ad frames is

00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:50,160
but i might mess with it

00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,200
yeah yeah packed in every corner of dev

00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,920
tools

00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,880
yeah the whole area really is you can uh

00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,640
modify and

00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,720
slow animations down that you're testing

00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,000
out with css and try different colors

00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,839
and speeds and things

00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:07,359
all this stuff squashed in every corner

00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:09,520
of dev tools

00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:11,040
yep there's the animations right here

00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,839
you can slow them down

00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,880
there's all these oh coverage is really

00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:16,079
interesting right here there's a

00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,520
coverage tab

00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:22,160
and what sorry go ahead yeah

00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,359
yeah you can uh i'm gonna hit reload and

00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:26,400
then i'm gonna hit

00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:28,319
um i'm gonna hit stop right here and it

00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,440
will actually show me

00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:33,359
in here the percentage of of the

00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:36,079
file that is actually being actively

00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:37,839
used this is useful for css

00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:40,000
or or things like that save if you have

00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:41,119
like a monolith css file or a monolith

00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,960
javascript file

00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:45,119
i can maybe look at this particular file

00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,839
and i can say well hey like at this

00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:49,280
given point on this given page um i'm

00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:52,480
only using around 80

00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:56,240
of this or not 80 but like 20 of this

00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:58,240
now this is like of course this has

00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,240
a little bit of limitations like if you

00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,000
look at your css file and it says you're

00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,720
only using like maybe 20

00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:06,079
of it but it's not covering things like

00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,440
hover states unless you actually move

00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:08,400
your mouse over the hover state and it

00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,640
invokes that

00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,839
so that so so this is the type of stuff

00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,920
that just gives you base

00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:15,040
a basic idea on where to look as opposed

00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:19,280
to just like

00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:20,880
you know cut stuff out um

00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,559
websites out there you'll see they often

00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:28,880
use about 10 of the css

00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:30,160
15 using 25 gss actually is a lot

00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,240
uh is there anything in here do you

00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:34,079
think i'm missing before uh we switch

00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:35,760
back over to you ben

00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,040
there's more stuff but you said a lot of

00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,599
things i know we already have about an

00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:40,319
hour in

00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:41,280
so i say we should uh keep on going i'll

00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:42,800
be really

00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,720
jeez yeah we gotta get out of here all

00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:46,559
right so uh let's switch back to the

00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:49,599
slides

00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:53,040
and uh left

00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:55,119
hey the hours left page speeds insights

00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,319
so ben you're gonna share your screen

00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:58,480
right so this might be

00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:59,839
a time for a lower line to switch to

00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,440
your window so

00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:03,200
all right if you're there laura lane

00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:06,400
lurleen switch over all right yeah

00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:08,079
and no we are still on mine

00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,160
oh she's uh we are still getting a

00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:12,079
burger at this point

00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,680
yeah let's see is that me or you okay

00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:17,680
all right yeah

00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:20,559
i i i think that's you yeah

00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:22,000
yeah we appreciate it so hi again this

00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:24,160
is me i'm ben

00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,760
um also my my little earbuds here are

00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,200
kind of kind of uh popping out of

00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,680
batteries so i hear you sometimes one

00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:30,559
ear

00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:32,160
or the other ear or no ears but i'm just

00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,800
going to talk so who cares what i can

00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,000
hear

00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:38,160
so php insights is a tool that you can

00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:40,079
use for yourself but also if you're

00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,040
again if you're an expert as you already

00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,720
probably are

00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:44,079
and talking to your marketer your

00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,880
product manager

00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:48,880
you know whatever the cto the ceo

00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:50,799
sometimes not quite as programmery

00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,559
then they can use this tool for a

00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:54,799
friendly interface

00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:55,760
this also uses the same api now as

00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:57,839
lighthouse

00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,280
and uses it gives you all the things i

00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,400
talked about before with chrome user

00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:02,960
experience report

00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:04,079
and core vitals let's try this out now

00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:05,920
page speed insights

00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:07,680
so i was told this was okay to do this

00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,359
i'm going to use the drupal site

00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,200
often i use a google own site because we

00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:13,760
also have sites that have

00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:14,400
issues but page speed insights i'm going

00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,680
to go

00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,440
and look at drupal.org

00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:23,040
someone's saying they're using a black

00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:25,520
screen are you not seeing my

00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,119
i see your screen properly if does

00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,960
anybody else see

00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:31,280
the screen can anyone else see his

00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,280
screen

00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,040
black screen well okay this is a black

00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,680
screen

00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:39,200
and this screen is just pure black

00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:41,520
between one color

00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:43,599
because it's beautiful and simple and

00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:48,880
simplicity is part of design

00:55:43,599 --> 00:55:48,880
uh yeah or laura lee and help us

00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:54,480
if you're here um all the attendees

00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,960
i'm going to reshare my screen how about

00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:59,520
that because maybe that will help well

00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,040
yeah all right nerd in case somehow that

00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:04,400
i forgot what i was sharing

00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:05,280
so now i'm sharing it again and

00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,920
i'm wondering if they need anything all

00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:10,720
right lower line if you can maybe try to

00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,400
make ben's screen active again i like

00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:15,119
that little hexadecimal

00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:16,000
uh number sign okay zero zero there how

00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,440
it

00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:19,440
all right for the attendees how is it

00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,920
looking now it looks good on my screen

00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,000
again

00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,119
it's up all right yeah all right they

00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,559
see it

00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:26,400
see i basically turned it off and on

00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:28,240
again and now it's happy

00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:30,319
that it fixes so many things in this

00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,880
world all right there it is peach food

00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:32,640
insights

00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,839
i should have done this i see i made a

00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,920
mistake because this is always slow to

00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:38,079
run because it's running this on actual

00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,119
phones or devices somewhere in the world

00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:39,839
i should have done this while it was

00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,160
black

00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:43,119
but i didn't so i'm typing in the url

00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,319
over here

00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:48,000
drupal.org and what it will do now is

00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,680
not only will retrieve

00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,760
data from the chrome user experience

00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,160
report but it will actually test out the

00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,319
site

00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:56,319
live on an actual device stored

00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:57,920
somewhere by the way fun fact

00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:00,559
web page tests which mike mentioned

00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,839
before uh used to be run by one person

00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:03,839
and actually there are a bunch of like

00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:05,839
phones and devices in his basement

00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:07,440
demand for everybody in the world but

00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:10,559
now it's not like that anymore

00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:12,240
now it's better so here's drupal.org

00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:14,000
so actually i think this was 11

00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:16,160
yesterday we did this in our run-through

00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,400
and it's down to 10. so we've lost a

00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,400
point

00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:23,040
so i need to pick on this site but tim

00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:25,119
said it was okay to do this before

00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,720
so this is all tim's fault and again a

00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:28,160
lot of sites like just

00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,079
there's things we missed because it's

00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,559
easy to miss the stuff so

00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:33,839
this tool over here gives you some

00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:35,839
things that are simple

00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:37,359
like this number here 10 which is the

00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:40,640
score between 0

00:57:37,359 --> 00:57:43,040
and 10. now 0 zero 100

00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,799
so you know less than 50 considered to

00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:47,760
be needs improvement

00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:48,880
over 90 is really pretty good and here

00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,680
it shows a screenshot

00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,799
of the page on a mobile device and some

00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,480
scores over here

00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:56,720
who had called during my talk do you

00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:58,319
believe the nerve of this person to call

00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,839
i can't believe that all right please

00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:02,480
don't call me now so

00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:03,359
uh it gives you these uh corbitals

00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:05,839
metrics

00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:07,280
plus also first contentful paint which

00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:09,200
also is useful

00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:11,839
and you see that chemical layout shift

00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:14,079
is good some things aren't quite as good

00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:14,880
and uh here comes calling me and telling

00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:17,359
me to stop

00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,359
doing this

00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,480
uh and you can see then actually this is

00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:23,440
a field data which is from the computer

00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,000
experience report

00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:27,760
from actual real users and then lab data

00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,680
they tested it right now on an actual

00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,440
device and found some things were slow

00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:32,960
timed interactive was very long because

00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,000
it took a long time to load up the

00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,319
actual page

00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:38,720
little blocking time was high all these

00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:41,280
things human of layout shift was stellar

00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:42,000
it didn't shift at all and then these

00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,200
numbers are in

00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,839
3g correct you know it used to do fast

00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,200
3g

00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:48,400
i'm not sure what it does anymore to be

00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,760
honest it might have been changed to

00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,480
something else but looking at the

00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:53,119
numbers here

00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,480
probably still fast 3g because that's

00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:57,040
pretty big numbers

00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,720
as they say and then looking over here

00:58:57,040 --> 00:59:00,960
it gives you actual things you can do

00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:03,440
to help out so the biggest thing over

00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,440
here is deferring off screen images

00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,280
also notice it thinks these things

00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,799
should be instead of being jpegs it

00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:11,119
could be webp or something else

00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:12,880
this is actually pretty easy to find so

00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:13,520
i said before that often the easiest

00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,599
things

00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:16,880
sorry the biggest things are easy i'm

00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,559
not going to do a long

00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:20,799
chrome dev tools thing here but let's

00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:23,200
look here real quick in chrome dev tools

00:59:20,799 --> 00:59:24,240
we're just going to load up the without

00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,400
throttling it here

00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:28,000
drupal.org so you can see what here it

00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,599
is okay there's our screen

00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:32,559
there's stuff going on over there all

00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:35,280
right so let's take that out over here

00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,000
so notice if we if we just sort by size

00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:38,160
here

00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,319
i'm going to also zoom my screen so you

00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,920
can see it a little better

00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:44,000
and you see that these things here that

00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,520
are the biggest the biggest one actually

00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:47,520
is youtube's javascript

00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,040
so if you can load youtube later do that

00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,799
because it has a lot of javascript

00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:52,400
and then these images here this

00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:55,200
pinterest image

00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,839
this mls image over here let's stop

00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,920
filtering

00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:59,359
you see more of it here there actually

00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,960
is soccer in

00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,559
the in the us although we call it soccer

01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,799
instead of football

01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:05,920
this boston city hall so these things

01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:07,359
are the big images that were being

01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:10,160
referred to over here

01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:10,880
when it said defer offscreen images so

01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,559
defer

01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,480
that means load these things later

01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:16,079
likely as you load them so where are

01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:17,599
these images on the screen here

01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:19,200
we're looking at our page i don't see

01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,599
the city hall yet or

01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:23,119
the major league soccer stadium if you

01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:25,440
scroll down here

01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:26,319
we don't see them yet we don't see them

01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,640
yet

01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:30,880
we don't see them yet where's the music

01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:33,359
we don't see them yet

01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,400
yet we don't see them yet we don't see

01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:37,680
them yet

01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:40,480
uh here we go wait wait wait i found it

01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,599
so this image carousel over here those

01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,880
are the images

01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:45,680
so notice that they're waiting so all

01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:48,720
those large images were loading

01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:51,359
just for that carousel i'm afraid so

01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,640
and they load i believe not later but

01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:53,359
with everything else so as they're

01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:54,799
loading

01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:56,559
i think other things are not loading

01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:59,520
because they can't because

01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:00,880
these things are loading instead so a

01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,319
few things should be happening

01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,839
one is of course compressing the images

01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:04,799
so they're maybe one tenth the size that

01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:06,799
they are

01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:08,240
and also i think they are not sized by

01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:09,920
device either

01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:12,480
let's just look here real quick at the

01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:15,040
image and here it is

01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,640
somewhere in there yeah nothing here

01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:18,559
sizes it by device

01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:20,160
so this should be also smaller on mobile

01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:22,559
than desktop

01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:23,680
and uh now also this whole carousel

01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,760
should be deferred

01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:27,040
and also also ideally you would just

01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,079
load the first couple images in the

01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,240
carousel

01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:32,400
the other ones later on as they were

01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:35,280
actually going to appear sooner

01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,480
so these things aren't hard to do but we

01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,240
always forget these things

01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,559
i've made tons of sites that have large

01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:42,559
images we just we just forget because we

01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:44,720
just love the image and there they are

01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:46,400
so how can this be fixed in the future

01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:47,839
we have some ideas actually we'll be

01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,119
talking about at the end about how to

01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:52,319
make these things better

01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:54,000
in all drupal sites but also in fact

01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:57,039
a change already has been made in drupal

01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:59,119
9.1 to lazy load images

01:01:57,039 --> 01:02:00,400
automatically using the html attribute

01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:02,400
for lazy loading

01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,799
so that will be soon part of more and

01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:07,760
more drupal sites around the world

01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:10,000
kind of neat it's exciting anyway so you

01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:12,400
get various bits of advice over here

01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:14,079
and uh then more elaborate advice like

01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:15,839
you know main thread work

01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:17,359
you want to really wow all these things

01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:19,200
here all the javascript is running

01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:20,480
get rid of those kinds of things

01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,280
actually while we're out of here i don't

01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,039
want to

01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:24,400
spend too much time on this but looking

01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:26,319
at javascript

01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,079
quickly this is the largest javascript

01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:32,079
file here on the page it's pretty big

01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:35,440
282k looking at this file over here

01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:39,599
notice that it is a thing

01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:42,799
that mostly contains a bunch of base64

01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:46,000
encoded images oh wow and

01:02:42,799 --> 01:02:46,799
that doesn't seem performant there's a

01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,640
lot of these things

01:02:46,799 --> 01:02:49,839
that's all it is the images of course

01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,559
will be

01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:54,400
larger because they're being b64 encoded

01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,440
but also i doubt they're all being used

01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:57,920
on the page

01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,640
there's about a thousand of them so so

01:02:57,920 --> 01:03:00,720
there's

01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:02,960
so there's javascript that encodes

01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:06,559
images so all these images have to be

01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:09,520
run through the javascript parser

01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:10,720
and then decoded from base 64 before

01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:12,240
even being written on the screen if

01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:14,480
they're being written on the screen

01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:17,119
which they're probably not so yeah some

01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:18,880
modular this thing and now there it is

01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:20,319
so look for these look at these hidden

01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,839
magical things

01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:23,520
actually these are the two things that

01:03:21,839 --> 01:03:24,799
are not hard to fix probably the image

01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,640
is in the javascript

01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:28,319
and it'll be a lot faster and get a

01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:31,359
better score on

01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:34,480
pageview inputs

01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:34,960
so uh yeah that's patreon sites nice

01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,720
tool

01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:38,559
useful stuff what else do we have over

01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:40,960
here as far as tools

01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:42,559
oh yeah lighthouse i mentioned before

01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,599
that pageview decided to use lighthouses

01:03:42,559 --> 01:03:46,400
api

01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:47,440
so it does lighthouse is the same kind

01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,079
of stuff

01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,960
but it's only data from your own device

01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:54,079
and it's done

01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:57,280
in chrome devtools by the way um

01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:58,720
now that microsoft edge uses chromium

01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:00,319
i think the same dev tools are available

01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:02,240
there as well

01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:03,920
and other browsers like firefox have

01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:05,760
their own very nice devtools i just use

01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:06,880
chrome because i work for google

01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:09,200
and we just do that because we're being

01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,400
loyal to the home team so there also is

01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,680
this thing here called lighthouse

01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:13,680
you can run this kind of report here

01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,160
right there in the browser it'll again

01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,079
run this

01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:17,760
on your own machine here and give you

01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:18,319
the same kinds of insights you see over

01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:20,160
here

01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:21,440
but from your machine so you can choose

01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:24,559
the speed that you want

01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,200
to throttle things to and just go from

01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:26,720
there

01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,839
it also gives you an seo report if you

01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:32,240
want and accessibility

01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:33,440
lighthouse a useful tool you can also

01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,839
use lighthouse

01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:37,520
yourself there's an api you can use you

01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:39,520
can then use it

01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:40,559
in your own continuous integration or

01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,400
monitoring

01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:44,079
so when someone actually loads a large

01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:46,000
image on your on your page

01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:47,599
or add the javascript you can find that

01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,119
and flag it right away

01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:50,880
in fact if i just search here real quick

01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:53,039
for lighthouse

01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,319
github as i did just a minute ago you

01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:56,799
can see

01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:57,440
there it is on github you can use this

01:04:56,799 --> 01:05:02,079
project

01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:02,079
in your own project and have fun with it

01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:07,599
also i did so lighthouse is an npm npm

01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:09,280
you can download a you can download it

01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:12,319
and like run it on your own

01:05:09,280 --> 01:05:15,039
projects in your own node base

01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:16,640
like uh continuous integration too right

01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:19,839
yes that's a much better way to use it

01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:21,680
yes thanks for saying that yeah

01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:22,880
there's things called stack packs and

01:05:21,680 --> 01:05:24,640
there's one here for drupal

01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:26,799
lighthouse will give advice specific to

01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:27,760
drupal for certain kinds of problems

01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:29,520
that it finds

01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:31,119
and this also is again open source and

01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:34,000
you can also contribute here

01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:35,039
and modify this if you want to it's

01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,520
pretty awesome what else

01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:38,480
do we have here search console again

01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:41,920
really great for that

01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:44,319
seo person or marketer on your team

01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:46,640
uh search console will give you data

01:05:44,319 --> 01:05:49,359
from the chrome user experience report

01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:50,000
so it will tell you how many urls are

01:05:49,359 --> 01:05:53,039
passing

01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,839
chord vitals how many the improvements

01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:56,640
how many aren't notice in this case over

01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:58,319
here

01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:00,880
this is kind of nice you can see on the

01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:03,359
right here of this graph can i actually

01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:04,480
get a pointer yes i can get a pointer on

01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:06,079
the right over here

01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:07,520
there was an improvement that was made

01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:09,039
and notice someone took out a large

01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:11,039
image something else good happened

01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,079
and about half of the pages began

01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:15,200
suddenly being

01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:18,400
green so that's nice

01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:20,559
a useful tool and what else have we here

01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,680
ah yes of course the granddaddy of them

01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:24,240
all the chrome

01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:25,920
user experience report itself you can go

01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:27,359
here and do your own analysis pretty

01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,240
quickly which we will do right now in

01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:30,960
front of you

01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:32,960
you can use bigquery to query the data

01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:35,200
set and find out things about sites

01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,559
i'll do over here for a shortcut oh my

01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:39,760
god

01:06:36,559 --> 01:06:41,680
what is no no

01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,280
i should say yeah that's a uh that's a

01:06:41,680 --> 01:06:46,559
big cumulative layout shift there

01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:48,640
without popping up yeah i'm just saying

01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:49,599
yes google says don't do that so don't

01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:52,960
do it

01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:54,240
so what's that saying that i do

01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,680
like i was saying we all have these

01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,960
problems i can show you like 10 google

01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:57,440
sites that have these kinds of problems

01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:59,760
too

01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,960
then you're good some of them need a

01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,559
little bit of help especially things

01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:04,000
with pictures of like beautiful

01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:05,599
phones and devices on them that are

01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:07,520
often too big

01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,720
anyway we can go to like this site over

01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:12,400
here and say let's actually

01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:12,960
profile google.com and we'll get a

01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:15,200
little

01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:18,240
report here if we do this allow

01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:20,160
parameter sharing yes

01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:21,760
first we get access to all the data so

01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:23,039
it goes here and looks at google cloud

01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:25,119
and pulls out this

01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:27,200
giant amount of data you can now do all

01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:29,520
this elaborate stuff you can

01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,720
use various dimensions so this is all

01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:32,799
the people that have used

01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:34,480
this site google.com around the world

01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:36,400
you can pick those who found over 3g

01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:39,039
connections 4g connections

01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:41,280
all kinds of stuff we're going to ignore

01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:43,280
all these parameters right now

01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:45,359
look at this these are all p75 again we

01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:48,880
said before that it's best to have

01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:52,079
uh 700 of loads succeeding

01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:53,839
on your page let's create a report okay

01:07:52,079 --> 01:07:56,559
let's do it

01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:58,799
i said let's do it okay and now the

01:07:56,559 --> 01:08:02,079
magic is going to happen

01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:02,880
i hope and it creates a beautiful report

01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:04,640
for me

01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:05,920
it's not going to populate with data

01:08:04,640 --> 01:08:07,440
there you go

01:08:05,920 --> 01:08:09,119
so this is again a pretty basic report

01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:11,680
you can do much more elaborate things

01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:13,440
here's google.com corporate vitals looks

01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:16,239
like there's actually a problem with cls

01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:18,719
here on desktop

01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:19,920
but in general it's got good large

01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:22,560
difficult paint

01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,679
good person foot delay in general but

01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:27,199
there's a problem there

01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:29,040
so even at google these things do happen

01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:30,400
this is not hard to do and you can do

01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:31,520
much more than just this you can write

01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:34,560
your own queries

01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:36,960
and bigquery and find all kinds of data

01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:38,719
also while i'm at it the web almanac i

01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:41,440
think just came out again recently

01:08:38,719 --> 01:08:42,480
i think this is just fresh from the

01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:44,799
presses here

01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,520
using this chrome user experience report

01:08:44,799 --> 01:08:48,960
data

01:08:45,520 --> 01:08:51,920
it's got tons of stuff here about cms's

01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,640
look at that and about css javascript on

01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:55,600
the web

01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:56,880
pwas all kinds of stuff over here if

01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,440
you're curious about this look at this

01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:01,279
later

01:08:57,440 --> 01:09:04,400
it talks about cms uh market shares

01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:05,120
and all kinds of things here that are

01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,040
useful

01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:09,520
lcp with various cms's look at this here

01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:11,279
it is here's drupal as i said before

01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:15,199
it was number one for alleged contentful

01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:15,199
paint and there it is

01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:21,440
all right i think that's all i had to

01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:26,159
say i think we're back to you mike

01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:28,719
all right so uh let's rely we are

01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:31,440
yeah can can you switch back to my

01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:31,440
screen please

01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,839
and i'm gonna

01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:43,279
all right hopefully so does everybody

01:09:40,400 --> 01:09:46,480
see my screen right now

01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:50,159
oh i see it at least yeah

01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:51,440
discussion here someone in chat tell me

01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:53,520
all right they they see my screen

01:09:51,440 --> 01:09:54,600
properly cool all right so we're going

01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:57,600
to talk about

01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:59,600
webpagetest.org webpagetest.org is

01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:02,159
uh one of my favorite websites it's like

01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:05,360
one of those internet gems that was

01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:08,080
you know made for free by some guy in

01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:08,880
in his basement and it looks like it was

01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:12,480
designed in

01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:13,280
2010 because it was but at the same time

01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:15,440
it's like

01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,400
super it's kept up to date in the back

01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:18,320
end and it has all the

01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:19,679
other great metrics and stuff so i'm

01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:23,199
going to give a quick overview of this

01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:23,199
and then we're going to maybe get into

01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,840
looking at waterfalls and and things

01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:31,440
like that

01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:35,040
so um

01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:36,640
you have a sorry i'm losing uh i'm

01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:39,760
having a brain fart here

01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:41,600
um on the home page you have uh you have

01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,960
an input where you can put in a url

01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,880
and at that point you can hit the start

01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:46,239
test button under the advanced settings

01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,480
there's a couple different options in

01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:50,560
here like the connection typically you

01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:52,640
want to do a 3g fast connection

01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,760
or something different you know well

01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:56,719
obviously

01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:58,560
i i generally do 3g fast if you're if

01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,760
you're doing this right now you can also

01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,640
specify

01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:03,360
um you can typically specify uh your

01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:05,199
location

01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:06,800
yeah that's right up here and you can

01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:10,320
also specify your browser

01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,800
um so what we're gonna do right here i'm

01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:13,920
gonna

01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,800
kind of even even before we do this i

01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,760
also want to say

01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,239
like that it's useful to create account

01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:19,920
and log

01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:21,600
in and the reason that you want to log

01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:24,239
in up here is because you have

01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:26,000
you'll have a test history and the test

01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:28,640
history is just useful if you want to go

01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:29,280
back and look at a look at your tests

01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:31,199
here

01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:32,719
so you're going to see this is going to

01:11:31,199 --> 01:11:35,840
load at some point

01:11:32,719 --> 01:11:37,360
for the past year i probably

01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,800
could have done that in the meantime i'm

01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:40,159
going to just go ahead and start a

01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:43,280
profile right here and we'll just do

01:11:40,159 --> 01:11:43,280
gainesville.com again

01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:51,600
gainesville.com skinsville.com is a

01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,600
slowish website so i'm just gonna

01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:56,640
well not slow but it has a lot of stuff

01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:58,560
going on so

01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:00,239
um if you're doing this right now like

01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:00,880
if you're following along select a

01:12:00,239 --> 01:12:02,719
different

01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:04,239
test location just so we don't like bog

01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:06,640
down one location

01:12:04,239 --> 01:12:09,040
um test to run defaults to three if

01:12:06,640 --> 01:12:11,199
you're doing like a real world scenario

01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:12,640
you can bump that all the way up to nine

01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:14,880
uh through this

01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:16,560
and i'm gonna just do one right here and

01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:18,080
then you can add a label and the label

01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:21,120
is really useful if you

01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:22,480
are doing things like creating videos

01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:24,719
and stuff like that so i can just say

01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:26,880
normal or something like that here

01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:28,640
there's a bunch of different options

01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:29,280
here the most useful one is scripting

01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:32,480
i'm gonna

01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:33,760
do like a little um a little demo of

01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,800
some scripting a little bit later but

01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,320
you can you can

01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,920
you can have it you can pass in

01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:41,040
different options through scripting

01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:43,280
and at that point um

01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:44,480
you know compare different compare

01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:45,760
different scenarios

01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:48,159
so at this point i'm going to hit the

01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:50,000
start test button and this is going to

01:12:48,159 --> 01:12:52,800
run now in the meantime i

01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,600
have my my log of tests over here so i

01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:57,199
can just go

01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:58,719
go ahead and click on well this is no

01:12:57,199 --> 01:13:00,239
external domains let me see if i can

01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:04,080
find a normal one here

01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:05,679
yeah so this

01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:07,520
it'll take you to a result page that

01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:08,640
looks something like this and i'm going

01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,320
to click on this

01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:12,320
and it's going to give me a whole bunch

01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:14,880
of information right here

01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:16,719
so the first thing that you see at the

01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:17,199
top up here is a lot of these metrics

01:13:16,719 --> 01:13:19,920
that

01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:21,280
that we initially talked about so you

01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,400
have like your time to first bite your

01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:24,080
start render

01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:26,080
i'm gonna close out of slacks people are

01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:29,280
trying to talk to me

01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:30,640
um and uh your largest contentful paint

01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,480
you can see up here it actually says

01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,840
like web vitals here this is something

01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:35,760
that's relatively new

01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:37,120
and it shows your total blocking time

01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,679
i'm not quite sure if that's different

01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:40,000
than the

01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:41,840
than the first input delay uh my

01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,320
understanding the total blocking time

01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:46,159
is is basically from the difference

01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:48,719
between the largest contentful paint

01:13:46,159 --> 01:13:50,480
and when the page is interactive you

01:13:48,719 --> 01:13:52,880
might know more on that then

01:13:50,480 --> 01:13:54,080
but it gives you all these metrics at

01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:57,760
the top up here

01:13:54,080 --> 01:13:59,360
so at that point we have um

01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,600
we'll have the waterfall view down here

01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:03,840
and this is this is this is really cool

01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:05,040
it gives you a bunch of it gives you the

01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,960
keys up here where you can see these

01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:10,480
vertical lines coming down here you have

01:14:06,960 --> 01:14:13,360
start render first point dom interactive

01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:14,640
and things like that you can click on

01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,159
each of these and it

01:14:14,640 --> 01:14:19,120
shows you things like priority in the

01:14:16,159 --> 01:14:23,520
protocol and that's super super useful

01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:24,080
um and what i typically like to look for

01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:26,640
here

01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,520
as i'm going through this is i like to

01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:31,280
find

01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:32,960
like like that that first start paint

01:14:31,280 --> 01:14:34,560
and see if there's any dependent

01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:36,719
dependency on that

01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:38,880
and this particular waterfall right here

01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:41,440
it might not be the best for this but

01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:43,120
like typically you'll see these vertical

01:14:41,440 --> 01:14:44,239
lines kind of spaced a little bit

01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:47,440
through

01:14:44,239 --> 01:14:50,400
and um if if

01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:51,679
if that if that first paint your start

01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:53,440
render is pushed back

01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:55,040
you can kind of look at this waterfall

01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:57,360
view and you can kind of see like well

01:14:55,040 --> 01:15:00,719
what is this waiting on you know

01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:01,199
um i think i have some some examples of

01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:02,880
that

01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:05,520
coming up too hold on one second let me

01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,520
see if i have

01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:09,440
i have this um

01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:14,640
a web page test waterfall this is a i

01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:18,320
set up a tugboat preview

01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:19,440
of lullabot.com with external fonts

01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:22,560
right here

01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:24,320
and so you can see that we have

01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:27,120
you can see like the start first render

01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:28,960
and run first paint are pushed out

01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:30,960
and you can see like well why are these

01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:32,719
pushed out and the reason

01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,239
is because we're loading these external

01:15:32,719 --> 01:15:36,560
fonts and once again this is like an

01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:39,280
intentional performance regression

01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:40,080
so you can kind of look you can see well

01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,679
all right well

01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:44,239
in this particular case right here we

01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:45,920
have to pull in this css css and

01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:49,120
and the in the browser's critical path

01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:51,520
it can't render without the css

01:15:49,120 --> 01:15:52,480
so it pulls that down and you can kind

01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,760
of uh

01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:56,080
you can kind of look at things there's a

01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:58,239
couple interesting things in here

01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:59,520
um a couple additional things that

01:15:58,239 --> 01:16:00,960
you're going to see within your web page

01:15:59,520 --> 01:16:03,199
just waterfall views

01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:05,520
you can see reds are basically like 400

01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:07,440
errors you can see 405

01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:08,719
you know you can these are not loading

01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:10,560
for whatever reason the yellows are

01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:12,560
redirects so you can see like 302s or

01:16:10,560 --> 01:16:14,000
301s or things like that

01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:15,760
when you're looking at these connections

01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:18,640
right here you will see

01:16:15,760 --> 01:16:21,040
these like you know dns connection ssl

01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:23,679
and all this type of stuff

01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:24,400
coming in and it gives you an idea of

01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:26,080
how

01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,760
why this has taken the amount of time

01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:29,120
that it takes

01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:30,880
you can see the various different types

01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:32,640
of resources up here you can see

01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,159
there's light and blues and things like

01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:37,920
that now

01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:40,960
the difference is let's go back to to

01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:44,719
to this one on

01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:46,159
let's go back to the so you can see like

01:16:44,719 --> 01:16:48,000
i'm pulling in these fonts

01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:49,520
or these jpegs right here and you can

01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,800
see there's like a light purple and a

01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,480
dark purple and the

01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:56,320
and the dark purple is actually when

01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:56,320
it's actively being downloaded because

01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:00,480
the browser can like you know have the

01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:02,159
connection open download chunks and then

01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:04,000
pause well download something else and

01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:07,679
the browser will

01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,679
will figure out how to do that

01:17:12,159 --> 01:17:18,640
at the bottom of all this

01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:20,880
you have a couple different cool charts

01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,880
including cpu utilization

01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:24,640
um which will tell you like obviously

01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:26,800
how hard your cpu is working and the

01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:28,719
bandwidth utilization right here

01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:30,960
so how much is being downloaded so you

01:17:28,719 --> 01:17:33,679
can see like after 18 seconds

01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:34,960
both the cpu and bandwidth kind of like

01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:37,520
drop off right there

01:17:34,960 --> 01:17:39,280
the browser main thread is is showing up

01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:41,199
right here and you can see like

01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:42,880
it uh it will actually tell you if your

01:17:41,199 --> 01:17:44,159
page is also interactive so you can see

01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:45,600
there's like little

01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:47,840
little areas in here where the main

01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:49,360
thread is very active and that means the

01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,520
page isn't interactive so

01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:52,400
like if i go ahead and hit you know a

01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:55,280
button

01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:55,760
right you know at this like 14 seconds

01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,840
in

01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:59,199
it's going to take a good amount of time

01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,760
before the javascript can actually

01:17:59,199 --> 01:18:04,320
respond to that and that's obviously

01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:05,120
a negative thing there's a couple cool

01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:08,000
things about

01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:09,280
webpagetest also you can also customize

01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:11,679
the waterfall right here and i

01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:13,040
i have a i have two monitors i have like

01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:14,159
a big monitor

01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:17,199
which you can see right here and then i

01:18:14,159 --> 01:18:19,600
have my little monitor below and um

01:18:17,199 --> 01:18:21,280
what one of my favorite things to do is

01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:21,920
i like to make this like super wide so i

01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:24,159
make this like

01:18:21,920 --> 01:18:26,000
say like 4 000 wide and i can generate

01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:27,920
it and open it up in a new pic

01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,600
a new window throw it up on my big wide

01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:31,600
monitor and at that point

01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,800
you can kind of it'll it'll spread

01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:33,600
things out a little bit more that's

01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:35,280
pretty neat

01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:38,880
there's a lot of different options in

01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:42,400
here that you can also play with

01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:44,320
and obviously like there's

01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:45,600
if if you want if you want to learn more

01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:47,199
about web page tests

01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:49,120
and you should there's there's youtube

01:18:47,199 --> 01:18:51,040
videos from uh patrick meenan

01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:52,840
he's the person who created this and

01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:54,719
it's fantastic but some of my favorite

01:18:52,840 --> 01:18:57,040
resources are on this

01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:59,520
github link that we gave you right here

01:18:57,040 --> 01:19:03,280
and these

01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:05,840
favorite resources that i have are

01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:07,600
this guy named matt hobbs who he works

01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:10,719
for

01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:14,239
the uk digital services and he has

01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:15,199
this amazing how to read a web page test

01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:17,600
waterfall

01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:19,440
article right here and also how to read

01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:22,400
the web page test

01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:23,679
connection view chart and and he walks

01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:25,360
you through

01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:27,120
like and annotates all the different

01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:30,800
sections and then

01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:33,330
what's really really valuable for me

01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:34,640
at the if you go to the bottom of it um

01:19:33,330 --> 01:19:37,360
[Music]

01:19:34,640 --> 01:19:38,719
let me get down here i'm just going to

01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:41,120
scroll down like this

01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:42,719
there's a lot of different uh what do

01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:46,000
you call it like

01:19:42,719 --> 01:19:49,760
things that he like use cases where

01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:51,840
he like runs into what am i getting into

01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,840
here

01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:57,360
did i click on something yeah so i'm

01:19:55,679 --> 01:20:00,640
going to page up right here

01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:02,719
you can he he examines like

01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:05,280
certain different problems in here which

01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:07,920
is which is pretty fantastic

01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:09,440
um by the way i'm realizing we're down

01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,840
to about 40 minutes here so we're gonna

01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:11,840
have to

01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:13,360
probably ah crap yeah all right thank

01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:16,320
you let's let's end the

01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,880
yeah actually all right and i'm also

01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,560
getting

01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:20,239
i think i'm getting some feedback says

01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:21,679
please don't scroll fast but yeah yeah

01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:24,800
take a look at that type of stuff

01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:25,600
i'm blind help me yeah i know so sorry

01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:30,719
about that

01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:30,719
um so let's move on to

01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:35,520
to the next uh slide here and i'm going

01:20:33,920 --> 01:20:38,719
to see if i can find my slides i have so

01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:38,719
many windows open at the time

01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:42,320
so i think we're on page speed insights

01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:44,480
here we talked about this we talked

01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,880
about your lighthouse stack packs web hs

01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:47,040
re

01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:48,800
real user monitoring uh this is

01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:50,719
something that we're we're not gonna

01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:52,480
dive deep into but real user monitoring

01:20:50,719 --> 01:20:53,840
is a type of performance monitoring

01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:56,159
where you actually have like a subset of

01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:58,239
your users or all your users in it

01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:59,679
and and there's a there's a navigation

01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:03,120
timing api

01:20:59,679 --> 01:21:03,760
that you you can you can you can say

01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,920
like

01:21:03,760 --> 01:21:07,199
you know this is this is when it starts

01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:08,000
this is when it ends and you can get

01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:10,880
these

01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:11,840
uh stats back this is the data that i

01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:13,440
believe that chrome

01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:15,040
user experience report corrects but you

01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:16,480
can actually do this on yourself too and

01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:18,239
you and there's also like

01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:20,000
lots of like really cool tools things

01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:23,040
like speed curve catchpoint

01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:24,880
and things like that that will generate

01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:28,080
you know different charts for you over

01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:31,280
time and that's super useful

01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:32,880
um useful techniques um we're going to

01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:35,040
go through some best practices

01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:37,280
including things like images javascript

01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:39,440
network and everything else

01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,639
i have this great picture of an images

01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:43,440
because images

01:21:40,639 --> 01:21:45,440
typically hog the bandwidth right so we

01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:47,199
want to identify

01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:48,960
here right isn't that good and we want

01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:51,440
to identify large images

01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:54,080
and you can do this once again through

01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:57,440
dev tools you know so like if i go to

01:21:54,080 --> 01:22:02,480
events drupal and

01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:04,560
i i reload

01:22:02,480 --> 01:22:06,400
and i can look at this type of stuff i'm

01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:08,239
going to just sort by size right here

01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:09,520
and we're going to see what we have so

01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:10,080
like right here we have a half a

01:22:09,520 --> 01:22:12,320
megabyte

01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:14,320
image right here that's that's pretty

01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:18,400
bad um

01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:20,320
but on the europe site so europe 2020 i

01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:23,360
believe is euro

01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:26,560
we have that one image

01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:28,560
is six megabytes this image right here

01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:32,320
is six megabytes right here which is

01:22:28,560 --> 01:22:32,800
you know obviously not super great is

01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,560
that the

01:22:32,800 --> 01:22:36,400
six megabyte image i don't even know but

01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:37,679
um

01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:40,159
the fact that we have a six megabyte

01:22:37,679 --> 01:22:41,280
image in here this is the type of stuff

01:22:40,159 --> 01:22:44,320
that you could easily

01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:47,600
easily do um

01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:48,480
lazy loading images my text is so small

01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:52,320
it's blurry

01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:53,440
so i uh i don't know why my texas blue i

01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:54,400
don't know if there's anything i can do

01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:55,760
about that right here

01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:57,679
without adjusting my slides so i

01:22:55,760 --> 01:23:00,639
apologize for that

01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:02,159
lazy loading images is is a useful

01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:03,920
technique it used to be

01:23:02,159 --> 01:23:06,080
be it used to have to be done through

01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:07,360
javascript but now you can do it

01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:10,080
natively through adding

01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:11,520
a loading equals lazy attribute onto

01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:12,560
your images which is super super

01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:15,920
valuable

01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:16,719
this is supported by this is supported

01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:19,600
by chrome

01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:20,159
and i think now by firefox in addition

01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,239
to that

01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:24,560
it's worth noting here that iframes also

01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:28,960
support the same attribute so you can

01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:32,159
you can lazy load your iframes

01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:33,920
um yeah so it's supported by

01:23:32,159 --> 01:23:35,440
all modern browsers and it doesn't hurt

01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:37,280
old browsers and

01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:38,800
i'm kind of neglecting safari here i

01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:40,159
don't know if safari is going to be

01:23:38,800 --> 01:23:42,400
implementing it or not

01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:43,600
but some something that has implemented

01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:47,280
it is drupal

01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:48,800
yay so uh ben mentioned this earlier but

01:23:47,280 --> 01:23:50,719
i think google actually sponsored some

01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:52,320
of the work on this but

01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:54,880
the native lazy loading of drupal is

01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:55,840
enabled by or of images as enabled by

01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:59,840
default

01:23:55,840 --> 01:24:00,960
in drupal 9.1 modern image formats are

01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:04,320
super useful

01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:06,400
so you you you're you're familiar with

01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:08,000
traditional image formats like a jiff

01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,679
pronounced with the soft g

01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:11,760
ben do you say gifford gif just take

01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:13,840
care of me

01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,880
a gif for graphics but then i've been

01:24:13,840 --> 01:24:18,320
told my

01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:18,320
reasoning is flawed so

01:24:19,199 --> 01:24:25,840
all right um jpegs are

01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:26,800
are useful for complex photos pngs are

01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,239
useful if you have

01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:29,760
transparency but if you don't have

01:24:28,239 --> 01:24:31,120
transparency i don't believe you should

01:24:29,760 --> 01:24:33,199
be using pngs

01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:34,800
svgs are very useful and they're

01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:37,920
typically like if you have

01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:40,719
some graphics that are either icon size

01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:40,719
or just have like

01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:46,239
their vector and they can be very

01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:47,920
very performant which is super awesome

01:24:46,239 --> 01:24:48,639
but there's newer image formats such as

01:24:47,920 --> 01:24:52,000
web p's

01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:53,360
uh webp's are have a small very small

01:24:52,000 --> 01:24:54,719
file size they support alpha

01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:57,120
transparency similar to

01:24:54,719 --> 01:24:59,280
pngs and they're supported by all modern

01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:00,239
browsers and the caveat on that is only

01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:03,440
the most recent

01:25:00,239 --> 01:25:06,639
version of safari and big sur

01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:08,400
support supports that but firefox and

01:25:06,639 --> 01:25:09,920
chromium-based browsers do support that

01:25:08,400 --> 01:25:13,440
there's a module

01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:16,080
called the webp module which will use

01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:18,400
like the uh php libraries like such as

01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:19,760
image magic and like i guess it was a gd

01:25:18,400 --> 01:25:22,560
library to use

01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:23,440
webp and so you can integrate that in

01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,199
today

01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:28,080
there's the av there's a new format

01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:31,440
called avif that's how ben pronounces it

01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:35,360
or avif and it's it's even smaller

01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:38,960
than um than

01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:43,120
uh webp and it's it's derived from

01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:44,880
from i believe like the av-1 uh video

01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:46,560
but it's it's very similar but it's

01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:49,679
supported by less browsers

01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:49,679
hopefully this will be more

01:25:50,480 --> 01:25:54,800
be more prevalent later there's a drupal

01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:57,840
module for that

01:25:54,800 --> 01:26:00,239
called avif um

01:25:57,840 --> 01:26:01,520
it uses an api to actually do the

01:26:00,239 --> 01:26:04,960
conversion

01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:06,239
um because uh gd does does not support

01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:08,560
that you can't convert it yeah i don't

01:26:06,239 --> 01:26:11,520
know if image magic supports that but

01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:12,880
yeah so you can use those yeah i'm

01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,560
working on gd right now to make it

01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:15,840
support that image magic already does

01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:18,880
support it

01:26:15,840 --> 01:26:20,719
uh the gdp is still working progress

01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:22,159
yeah so there could be like a uh you

01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:23,600
know if you have image mod

01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:25,600
magic there could be a drupal module

01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:27,360
that does it you know internal to drupal

01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:29,360
on you know without an api which would

01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:30,960
be very useful you can use these modern

01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:32,719
image formats today by using the

01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,639
picture element so you can see like

01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:36,000
right here on the right hand side

01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:36,960
there's this type attribute and this

01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:40,159
type attribute

01:26:36,960 --> 01:26:42,480
will you know hint to the browser

01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:44,480
what type of image this is and if it is

01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:46,159
a particular if it's if it's not

01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,679
something the browser will support they

01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:48,159
will download something that they do

01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:51,199
support

01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:53,360
and that's that's super super useful

01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:54,480
um we were going to demo squoosh but i

01:26:53,360 --> 01:26:56,679
don't know if we like really have time

01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:59,120
here we have like half an hour left

01:26:56,679 --> 01:27:02,080
squoosh.app is the url i'm just going to

01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:02,080
load this up right now

01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:07,920
this is a really really good place to

01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:09,840
play with images you know you can like

01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:11,440
load this image and it's just really

01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:15,199
cool things where you can you can

01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:18,159
you can select different options here

01:27:15,199 --> 01:27:18,880
and it's really fantastic because it

01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:21,920
uses

01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:23,199
it uses um uses the browser to do this

01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:26,960
and it's a very

01:27:23,199 --> 01:27:28,719
very cool pwa too and it uses a

01:27:26,960 --> 01:27:29,360
webassembly to do all those conversions

01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:32,800
which is

01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:34,320
really really neat responsive images

01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:36,719
are something that's included in drupal

01:27:34,320 --> 01:27:38,960
core so responsive images will load

01:27:36,719 --> 01:27:40,719
different images based on your viewport

01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:42,480
size and there's a couple different ways

01:27:40,719 --> 01:27:44,400
to do that

01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:45,679
including source sets and the picture

01:27:44,400 --> 01:27:46,000
element the picture element's kind of

01:27:45,679 --> 01:27:47,199
useful

01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:49,360
because you can have different aspect

01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:51,760
ratios too uh

01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:52,560
this is like really really cool this is

01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:55,679
included

01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:57,760
in drupal core with drupal 8 and later

01:27:55,679 --> 01:27:59,199
and it's a contrib module for drupal 7.

01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:00,239
it's not enabled by default you have to

01:27:59,199 --> 01:28:01,199
turn it on and then you have to

01:28:00,239 --> 01:28:02,880
configure it

01:28:01,199 --> 01:28:04,159
the documentation on how to configure

01:28:02,880 --> 01:28:05,760
this is at the bottom but this is

01:28:04,159 --> 01:28:08,239
something that's super useful

01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:10,280
for those large hero images like that

01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:13,040
you see on like the

01:28:10,280 --> 01:28:14,400
events.drupal.org javascript

01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:16,719
is i have this great graphic for

01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:20,239
javascript because javascript tends to

01:28:16,719 --> 01:28:23,360
be a a big culprit

01:28:20,239 --> 01:28:26,480
with with web performance you know

01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:29,120
um even though javascript is amazing the

01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:32,320
less javascript the better

01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:33,840
and it's it's useful to recognize as

01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:36,080
you're downloading javascript that not

01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:38,080
all bytes are created equal

01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:39,120
when mega beta javascript does not take

01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:41,440
the same amount of pr

01:28:39,120 --> 01:28:43,760
to process as one megabyte of images

01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:44,320
when the browser can output that the

01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:46,960
images

01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:48,960
very very quickly but the javascript

01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:49,600
that has to it has to parse it has to

01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:51,120
compile

01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:52,800
it has to do like the just in time

01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:54,960
compiling or everything else to do and

01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:56,800
then it has to execute that javascript

01:28:54,960 --> 01:28:58,320
that takes a lot more time than it does

01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:00,480
to render images

01:28:58,320 --> 01:29:02,560
so that's just something to keep in mind

01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:04,480
um

01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:07,280
it's it's best practice to create

01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:09,280
smaller javascript bundles and this

01:29:07,280 --> 01:29:11,120
you know can go into the face of like

01:29:09,280 --> 01:29:13,520
aggregating your javascript

01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:14,480
but you want your bundles to be like in

01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:16,880
the neighborhood

01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:18,960
of 200 kilobytes or less because what

01:29:16,880 --> 01:29:22,159
that does is that enables

01:29:18,960 --> 01:29:25,520
your event listeners to to

01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:28,880
jump in and respond to user input as

01:29:25,520 --> 01:29:30,320
the as the browser is parsing or

01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:35,440
compiling or executing

01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:37,199
you want to keep an eye on on long tasks

01:29:35,440 --> 01:29:39,120
like if you have a task that is long you

01:29:37,199 --> 01:29:39,840
might want to somehow async it or

01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:42,400
something like that

01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:43,280
so the so the browser can respond to

01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:46,400
those

01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:48,080
user inputs um this is a great image

01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:48,880
right here for the javascript main

01:29:48,080 --> 01:29:52,000
thread

01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:54,560
like javascript main thread only like it

01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:56,000
runs and nothing else can happen until

01:29:54,560 --> 01:29:58,719
it pop

01:29:56,000 --> 01:30:00,080
like it will run one thing at a time and

01:29:58,719 --> 01:30:02,400
it only runs on

01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:04,480
one processor now my understanding is if

01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:05,280
you have multiple tabs your different

01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:08,000
version

01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:09,600
or your your different tabs can run on

01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,280
different processors but

01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:13,679
the javascript main thread will just run

01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:16,000
on one processor

01:30:13,679 --> 01:30:16,719
identifying and removing third-party

01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:19,440
scripts

01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:22,159
is is super amazing i have this demo

01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:24,719
that i'm going to be very very quick

01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:26,880
through for ben but i'm going to go back

01:30:24,719 --> 01:30:31,760
to web page test

01:30:26,880 --> 01:30:34,560
and i'm going to go into my test history

01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:35,760
and let's set this for seven days right

01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:38,000
here and hit update

01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:39,120
now imagine if i just ran these right

01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:42,639
now i can

01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:46,159
i i i can compare these

01:30:42,639 --> 01:30:46,960
these uh these uh what do you call them

01:30:46,159 --> 01:30:49,840
um

01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:51,600
waterfalls to get this what i'm going to

01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:53,520
do is i'm actually going to

01:30:51,600 --> 01:30:55,040
use the scripting element right here so

01:30:53,520 --> 01:30:56,880
i'm going to go to

01:30:55,040 --> 01:31:00,639
i'm just going to go to the script tag

01:30:56,880 --> 01:31:00,639
right here and let me get back to

01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:05,760
this right here and i'm gonna i'm gonna

01:31:03,520 --> 01:31:08,000
take this

01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:09,600
i'm gonna take this text that i have

01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:13,120
right here

01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:18,560
and um oops

01:31:13,120 --> 01:31:18,560
let me hit uh presenter view

01:31:18,960 --> 01:31:22,320
i'm going to take this text right here

01:31:20,639 --> 01:31:24,400
and i'm going to throw this

01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:26,080
into the scripting and then i would hit

01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:28,400
the start test button

01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:30,560
and what this script does it says block

01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:32,400
domains accept and i have a a list of

01:31:30,560 --> 01:31:35,840
space separated domains

01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:39,120
where i i'm only going to allow uh

01:31:35,840 --> 01:31:40,719
i'm only going to going to allow

01:31:39,120 --> 01:31:43,040
connections to these domains that i'm

01:31:40,719 --> 01:31:46,080
going to i type and navigate right here

01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:47,840
and then navigate will will tell to go

01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:50,400
to that particular website

01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:52,480
and it'll load now i can i can store i

01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:54,159
can add a label in here

01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:55,760
you can see like under test settings

01:31:54,159 --> 01:31:56,960
there's this label so i can type in here

01:31:55,760 --> 01:32:00,719
like no

01:31:56,960 --> 01:32:03,679
external scripts or no external content

01:32:00,719 --> 01:32:05,280
and i can compare these and i can hit i

01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:07,120
can check these boxes and hit the

01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:08,800
compare button right here

01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:11,040
and what's really interesting is you can

01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:14,639
kind of see how these

01:32:11,040 --> 01:32:15,760
how these will uh how how these

01:32:14,639 --> 01:32:18,000
differentiate

01:32:15,760 --> 01:32:19,920
and you can hit this create video button

01:32:18,000 --> 01:32:22,639
right here which is super useful

01:32:19,920 --> 01:32:23,679
and the create video button will um let

01:32:22,639 --> 01:32:25,120
me see if i have my

01:32:23,679 --> 01:32:27,280
it will actually create a video and it

01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:29,679
will show everything

01:32:27,280 --> 01:32:31,040
like it'll show the loading and you can

01:32:29,679 --> 01:32:32,400
download that video and you can maybe

01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:34,239
show that to marketers and say hey

01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:37,440
listen you know this is

01:32:34,239 --> 01:32:38,880
negatively impacting our first uh

01:32:37,440 --> 01:32:40,800
you know our first paint or something

01:32:38,880 --> 01:32:43,840
like that now something that these

01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:48,880
videos do not show is it does not show

01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:52,480
things like the uh the uh

01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:53,840
the cpu utilization but the it will show

01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:55,120
it down here so you can see the browser

01:32:53,840 --> 01:32:58,239
main thread

01:32:55,120 --> 01:33:01,280
for the further without

01:32:58,239 --> 01:33:04,320
uh for the waterfall without

01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:06,800
um external domains is

01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:08,080
is pretty decent but with the external

01:33:06,800 --> 01:33:11,360
domains we saw earlier was

01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:13,600
was was very very clogged up so that's

01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:16,239
something that's super useful right now

01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,780
with developer tools you can do

01:33:16,239 --> 01:33:18,159
something

01:33:16,780 --> 01:33:22,080
[Music]

01:33:18,159 --> 01:33:23,520
kind of similar which is pretty neat so

01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:25,840
i'm going to go to the webpage

01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:27,280
i'm just going to hit i'm going to go to

01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:29,679
the performance tab i'm going to

01:33:27,280 --> 01:33:31,280
i'm going to reload and i'm only going

01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:33,199
to let this go for a second here because

01:33:31,280 --> 01:33:35,040
we don't have a heck of a lot of time

01:33:33,199 --> 01:33:36,560
but what's really interesting is you can

01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:38,239
zoom in and you can actually kind of

01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:39,520
group by sub domain and

01:33:38,239 --> 01:33:40,719
and see what's going on i'm going to

01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:43,520
show you how to do that as soon as it's

01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:43,520
done processing

01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:47,440
so i'm going to i'm going to maybe zoom

01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:48,239
in right here and i'm going to get out

01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:50,250
of this pane

01:33:48,239 --> 01:33:52,080
and then i'm going to

01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:54,080
[Music]

01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:56,000
yeah oh so you can see i have the

01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:58,000
summary it shows me the amount scripting

01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:00,080
the amount loading the amount rendering

01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,440
and and things like this but what what's

01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:02,800
really interesting is you can go to this

01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:04,239
bottom up view right here and there's a

01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:06,159
bunch of grouping

01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:07,440
so something that's really useful is

01:34:06,159 --> 01:34:09,840
grouping by a subdomain

01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:12,000
and you can see like okay well 16 of

01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:14,960
this is coming from the tabula you know

01:34:12,000 --> 01:34:16,800
15 is coming from tinypass like you can

01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:19,679
look at all these corporate domains

01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:20,719
down here that are causing issues and i

01:34:19,679 --> 01:34:23,199
i think that's

01:34:20,719 --> 01:34:24,639
that's super valuable um something else

01:34:23,199 --> 01:34:28,719
that's like really important

01:34:24,639 --> 01:34:31,679
is avoiding the for forced reflows

01:34:28,719 --> 01:34:33,840
so force like layouts and reflows are

01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:36,719
when the browser actually like

01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:37,199
takes the page and puts it out you know

01:34:36,719 --> 01:34:39,280
like

01:34:37,199 --> 01:34:40,400
like figures out how everything fits

01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:43,360
together

01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:44,960
and um you can animate stuff like that

01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:46,000
but it's not a great idea you know you

01:34:44,960 --> 01:34:49,679
can animate

01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:52,000
um let me see

01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:53,679
uh i i think i have a a little bit later

01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:55,600
though but but

01:34:53,679 --> 01:34:57,360
you typically don't want to animate that

01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:59,440
and you also don't want to

01:34:57,360 --> 01:35:00,400
like there's certain javascript

01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:02,639
properties like

01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:04,239
including the get client wrecked bound

01:35:02,639 --> 01:35:06,400
where

01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:08,400
where it figures out where an element

01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:11,440
fits into a page

01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:13,679
if you run that uh based on like either

01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:15,280
like scroll events or resize events or

01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:18,400
things like that it will cause

01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:22,000
uh it will cause layout thrashing and

01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:24,159
you can see things like this um up here

01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,920
where like the little ticks up here uh

01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:29,199
these little red ticks

01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:31,600
will indicate when your browser's

01:35:29,199 --> 01:35:33,520
you know running at less like around 30

01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:37,280
frames per second or less

01:35:33,520 --> 01:35:39,679
um there's a cool gist right here

01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:41,360
from paul irish that actually shows

01:35:39,679 --> 01:35:45,520
animations

01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:47,840
uh of things that will cause reflow

01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:49,440
and and you just want to avoid this if

01:35:47,840 --> 01:35:52,080
at all possible there are things

01:35:49,440 --> 01:35:52,560
sometimes you do need to animate that

01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:55,679
stuff

01:35:52,560 --> 01:35:58,080
but try to avoid it um

01:35:55,679 --> 01:35:59,360
we're moving into network now and i also

01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:03,360
want to talk about like

01:35:59,360 --> 01:36:04,960
cdns so cdns like really help with with

01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:06,800
that time to first byte

01:36:04,960 --> 01:36:08,400
for that initial document and any type

01:36:06,800 --> 01:36:09,119
of static assets that you have up here

01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:11,119
this is

01:36:09,119 --> 01:36:12,639
something i did yesterday right here

01:36:11,119 --> 01:36:14,639
this is the time to first byte for

01:36:12,639 --> 01:36:16,159
lullabot.com with and without the cdn

01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:16,960
and i measured this by just like of

01:36:16,159 --> 01:36:20,719
course

01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:23,520
running lullaby.com

01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:24,480
normally which has about a 20

01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:26,080
millisecond

01:36:24,480 --> 01:36:27,520
time to first bite but if i added just

01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:29,360
kind of a random query string at the end

01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:29,920
so it bypassed that cdn for the first

01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:32,960
time

01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:34,880
it was uh it was a half a second uh time

01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:36,239
to first bite so we literally added like

01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:38,719
about a half a second

01:36:36,239 --> 01:36:41,760
onto the time that adds up like like

01:36:38,719 --> 01:36:46,000
that's that's a lot of time

01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:47,840
um resource hints are very very useful

01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,280
uh resource hints are things that you

01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:51,280
put into

01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:53,760
are like almost like meta tags that you

01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:57,040
put into the head of your document

01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:59,360
and you can preload and pre-connect

01:36:57,040 --> 01:37:00,960
to pre-load is useful for loading things

01:36:59,360 --> 01:37:02,560
like fonts pre-connect is useful for

01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:04,000
connecting to other domains you can see

01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:05,840
preload right here this is an

01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,040
old version of lullaby.com where we had

01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:09,520
a react app

01:37:07,040 --> 01:37:10,480
and we preloaded a certain javascript

01:37:09,520 --> 01:37:12,159
bundle

01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:14,159
right here you can see you can see that

01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:17,119
link rail preload works

01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:18,400
now there are this works under modern

01:37:17,119 --> 01:37:19,840
browsers but it doesn't work under

01:37:18,400 --> 01:37:21,360
things like internet explorer but

01:37:19,840 --> 01:37:24,560
internet explorer will just

01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:25,840
you know ignore it um you can see right

01:37:24,560 --> 01:37:26,960
here we're using pre-connect we're

01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,800
connecting to a couple of

01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:30,480
other domains and this is like super

01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:32,960
useful because

01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:34,480
as i mentioned earlier the uh the

01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:36,159
connection time to these different

01:37:34,480 --> 01:37:38,400
domains take a little bit of time but if

01:37:36,159 --> 01:37:41,520
you pre-connect you do this earlier

01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:43,280
in the process you can you can you can

01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:44,719
do that pre-connect while the browser is

01:37:43,280 --> 01:37:46,960
doing everything else and

01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:48,560
and so there's not as much of a penalty

01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:50,400
you can do this all together you can see

01:37:48,560 --> 01:37:52,639
in this particular case right here that

01:37:50,400 --> 01:37:55,199
we're pre-loading a number of

01:37:52,639 --> 01:37:57,280
font files and we're also pre-loading

01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:58,560
some background images background images

01:37:57,280 --> 01:38:01,760
are

01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:02,080
are nice to pre-load if they're in above

01:38:01,760 --> 01:38:04,400
the

01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:06,320
in the above the fold area because in

01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:08,880
order for a background images to come in

01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:10,400
you need to the browser needs to look at

01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:12,159
the css and it creates this chain of

01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:13,280
dependencies and things like that

01:38:12,159 --> 01:38:14,560
you can see for the particular

01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:16,320
background images here i'm using the

01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:17,520
media attribute to limit of when they're

01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:19,199
coming in

01:38:17,520 --> 01:38:20,560
nowadays i typically try not to use

01:38:19,199 --> 01:38:21,840
background images i tend to use

01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:25,679
absolutely positioned

01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:28,960
image tags with the object fit attribute

01:38:25,679 --> 01:38:31,119
um i'm not gonna i don't know if we like

01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:34,960
really have time to do

01:38:31,119 --> 01:38:38,239
i i i i set up uh a um

01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:41,920
a couple links within that uh google

01:38:38,239 --> 01:38:41,920
or within that um

01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:46,960
uh document that we have let me open

01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:48,719
that up right here

01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:50,560
and i encourage everybody to kind of do

01:38:48,719 --> 01:38:53,600
it themselves i have a couple different

01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:56,840
um uh tugboat demos right here

01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:58,719
where it shows these fonts it shows

01:38:56,840 --> 01:39:01,280
lullaby.com

01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:03,119
with and without like various

01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:03,760
regressions like right here so you can

01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:07,119
see there's

01:39:03,760 --> 01:39:08,960
a rece this is a version of lullaby.com

01:39:07,119 --> 01:39:11,119
where i remove the resource hints

01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:13,040
this is a version of lulabot.com where i

01:39:11,119 --> 01:39:15,280
removed the external fonts and this is a

01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:18,719
version of levelbot.com where i

01:39:15,280 --> 01:39:20,719
introduced uh layout thrashing

01:39:18,719 --> 01:39:22,400
and so if you scroll down you can see

01:39:20,719 --> 01:39:23,280
how things are very very janky right

01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:24,480
here because i just

01:39:23,280 --> 01:39:26,719
kind of took away any type of

01:39:24,480 --> 01:39:28,480
optimizations that i did and those are

01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:29,520
kind of super useful for like maybe

01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:31,760
getting used to

01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:33,119
profiling so i encourage you to like

01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:36,320
mess around with those

01:39:33,119 --> 01:39:37,760
in things like uh you know chrome

01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:41,199
developer tools

01:39:37,760 --> 01:39:44,560
and um webpagetest

01:39:41,199 --> 01:39:46,239
http 2 and http 3 are

01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:48,320
modern versions of the hypertext

01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:51,440
transfer protocol and it's very useful

01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:53,679
to use these with with the old legacy

01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:56,719
like http1 the browser would have to

01:39:53,679 --> 01:39:58,480
connect for every single

01:39:56,719 --> 01:40:00,400
resource and it would only download like

01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:01,679
six or so at a time and then it would

01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:03,119
have to

01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:06,639
reconnect and created this long

01:40:03,119 --> 01:40:08,560
waterfall view http 2 and http 3

01:40:06,639 --> 01:40:10,159
have different ways where they manage

01:40:08,560 --> 01:40:11,360
that where they create different streams

01:40:10,159 --> 01:40:14,560
http 3s

01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:16,800
is is not deployed everywhere yet it's

01:40:14,560 --> 01:40:18,000
it's i've seen google use it before but

01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:20,239
http 3

01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:22,239
is really neat because it doesn't use

01:40:20,239 --> 01:40:23,920
the tcp part of tcpip

01:40:22,239 --> 01:40:26,239
uses udp and then it has this other

01:40:23,920 --> 01:40:28,000
protocol that kind of manages like air

01:40:26,239 --> 01:40:30,719
conditions and stuff like that

01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:31,440
makes things very quickly you can see

01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:33,040
there

01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:34,800
i mentioned i showed this earlier but

01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:36,880
there's a protocol

01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:38,719
column within developer tools that will

01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:40,719
show you what what you're using

01:40:38,719 --> 01:40:42,080
if you use modern cdns they're usually

01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:45,360
using http 2

01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:47,040
so that's that's a great way to go um

01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:49,440
i talked a little bit about watching

01:40:47,040 --> 01:40:51,360
your http request count it used to be

01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:52,480
like really really important but with

01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:54,000
http 2

01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:55,840
it's not as important as it is but

01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:57,360
something to keep an eye on

01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:58,960
and that shows up right down here in

01:40:57,360 --> 01:40:59,600
developer tools and i'm sure web page

01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:02,159
tests has

01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:03,280
somewhere too pre-fetching is really

01:41:02,159 --> 01:41:05,040
really useful so

01:41:03,280 --> 01:41:07,199
you can use this link rail prefetch and

01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:09,119
there's some javascript apis for it too

01:41:07,199 --> 01:41:10,560
and you can preload pages that might be

01:41:09,119 --> 01:41:12,880
in the viewport or preload different

01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:16,320
pages if i'm on a particular page

01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:18,560
and i know that i know that a user

01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:19,520
usually navigates to this other page i

01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:23,679
can go ahead

01:41:19,520 --> 01:41:25,520
and um i i can go ahead and preload that

01:41:23,679 --> 01:41:26,960
the browser will store it or prefetch

01:41:25,520 --> 01:41:28,480
that the browser will store it in the

01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:30,639
cache so when it loads it

01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:32,719
it's uh it's pretty instantaneous

01:41:30,639 --> 01:41:33,920
there's a really really awesome library

01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:36,320
called quick link that's

01:41:33,920 --> 01:41:37,360
that's created by google chrome labs

01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:39,199
that will fetch

01:41:37,360 --> 01:41:42,080
uh prefetch links that are in the

01:41:39,199 --> 01:41:43,679
viewport there's a drupal module that

01:41:42,080 --> 01:41:45,199
called quicklink also a corresponding

01:41:43,679 --> 01:41:47,840
one i i'm i'm the one

01:41:45,199 --> 01:41:49,600
who's the maintainer and wrote that and

01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:52,800
that's really cool it gives you options

01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:54,000
you can you can uh you can pre prefetch

01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:56,960
certain

01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:58,480
domains uh or you can only prefix

01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:59,280
certain domains or you can block things

01:41:58,480 --> 01:42:00,800
to default

01:41:59,280 --> 01:42:02,480
or prefetch it gives you a whole bunch

01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:04,560
of really cool options

01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:07,199
we use that on lullabot.com and you can

01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:08,159
actually see on lulabot.com like as you

01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:10,400
scroll down the page

01:42:08,159 --> 01:42:11,199
as these links enter the viewport you

01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:14,239
can see

01:42:11,199 --> 01:42:15,840
the if you have developer tools open you

01:42:14,239 --> 01:42:18,880
can see them come in

01:42:15,840 --> 01:42:22,080
um uh one thing to know with

01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,639
with with this is that you want to keep

01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:24,560
an eye

01:42:22,639 --> 01:42:26,080
like like i've had some feedback that

01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:27,679
like one particular customer that was on

01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:29,280
a popular hosting platform

01:42:27,679 --> 01:42:30,960
like quick link will download a lot more

01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:31,520
data and it could take you over to a

01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:33,199
tier

01:42:31,520 --> 01:42:35,119
over the tier and you might be paying

01:42:33,199 --> 01:42:36,960
more money that's something just to keep

01:42:35,119 --> 01:42:39,440
an eye on

01:42:36,960 --> 01:42:40,480
another very important thing to keep an

01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:42,239
eye on is avoid

01:42:40,480 --> 01:42:43,840
avoiding chaining dependencies right

01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:46,320
here so this is

01:42:43,840 --> 01:42:48,080
a uh this is a profile of an earlier

01:42:46,320 --> 01:42:49,840
version of lullaby.com where we were a

01:42:48,080 --> 01:42:52,159
react app and there was this great

01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:53,440
well not not great but there's a

01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:55,760
situation where we had an

01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:56,800
api call to another api call to another

01:42:55,760 --> 01:43:00,000
api call to

01:42:56,800 --> 01:43:01,520
another api call to another api call

01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,040
to another and once again to another

01:43:01,520 --> 01:43:04,480
before it would actually like

01:43:03,040 --> 01:43:05,920
pull down this information in the

01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:06,320
meantime you can see like there was like

01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:10,080
just

01:43:06,320 --> 01:43:12,320
two seconds of of wait time here before

01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:13,840
this before the browser would actually

01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:15,679
get these images and you can kind of see

01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:19,040
that in the waterfall view

01:43:15,679 --> 01:43:20,880
this is the type of things

01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:22,560
that you just want to kind of take a

01:43:20,880 --> 01:43:25,520
look at uh

01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:27,520
it's it's typically a good idea to to

01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:29,280
avoid external dependencies such as

01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:32,080
things like google fonts or external

01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:34,000
like cdns that pull things in like

01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:36,800
jquery

01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:38,880
because the browser has to reach out to

01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:40,960
those domains and pull those in

01:43:38,880 --> 01:43:42,719
and you can see that and you can usually

01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:44,800
profile that pretty easily within the

01:43:42,719 --> 01:43:48,239
waterfall charts

01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:50,639
um you can see the start render and this

01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:52,000
and this particular waterfall right here

01:43:50,639 --> 01:43:55,280
is dependent on the google font style

01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:57,119
sheet and everything else uh ben do you

01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:58,880
want to talk a little bit about amp

01:43:57,119 --> 01:44:00,880
yeah i think we have we're we have like

01:43:58,880 --> 01:44:02,239
17 minutes left so

01:44:00,880 --> 01:44:04,400
we're getting through it really quick

01:44:02,239 --> 01:44:06,560
yeah you were those last slides there

01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:09,760
you got through this lap

01:44:06,560 --> 01:44:11,520
these things go on so quick yeah yes

01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:14,000
um by the way there are a couple of

01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:16,000
questions in the q a area

01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,920
uh please add more questions there if

01:44:16,000 --> 01:44:19,520
you'd like to there aren't so many so

01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:22,560
far i've mentored a couple already that

01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:24,480
via just you know the text but we also

01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:26,159
can answer some questions live too

01:44:24,480 --> 01:44:28,159
for example someone asked about adding a

01:44:26,159 --> 01:44:29,280
region of the world or country selection

01:44:28,159 --> 01:44:31,280
to lighthouse

01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:32,880
that's a really interesting idea and i

01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:35,360
don't even see actually

01:44:32,880 --> 01:44:36,880
a way to filter by that in um the

01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:39,440
user experience report

01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:40,560
there probably is one such a basic idea

01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:42,480
i will look into that

01:44:40,560 --> 01:44:45,840
and ask people about this one because it

01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:47,440
would be an obvious feature to have

01:44:45,840 --> 01:44:49,600
yeah anyone that you can do that with

01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:50,880
webpagetest

01:44:49,600 --> 01:44:54,159
yeah that's true you can select

01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:56,880
different places for the device to be in

01:44:54,159 --> 01:44:58,000
so uh anyway amp we didn't talk about

01:44:56,880 --> 01:45:00,960
this yet at all but

01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:01,600
it is a way to make sites faster that's

01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:04,800
supposed to be

01:45:01,600 --> 01:45:07,679
easy um and by default

01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:09,199
so the idea of amp essentially is it's

01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:11,119
web components library

01:45:09,199 --> 01:45:12,400
you can use to instead of writing your

01:45:11,119 --> 01:45:14,320
own javascript

01:45:12,400 --> 01:45:16,400
use web components with their own small

01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:17,840
javascript and thus instead of writing

01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:19,840
javascript for everything

01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:20,960
and loading third-party libraries using

01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:23,040
what app provides

01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:25,040
the downside being that if you follow

01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:26,719
amp's validation rules

01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:29,280
you can't add your own javascript except

01:45:26,719 --> 01:45:30,960
for within a web worker which you can do

01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:33,360
and you can't do all the things you want

01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:34,639
to do because amp's goal is to restrict

01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:36,320
what you could do in order to make

01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:39,600
things more performant

01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:42,000
so amp has kind of got good use cases

01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:43,360
not good use cases for simpler sites

01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:45,119
things that are mostly just content

01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:47,199
aren't the interactive

01:45:45,119 --> 01:45:48,320
don't require a lot of custom code a

01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:49,760
nice way to make a site that's going to

01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:51,119
be fast by default

01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:52,639
for sites that are more interactive or

01:45:51,119 --> 01:45:53,199
whether you have to have things like

01:45:52,639 --> 01:45:56,560
more a b

01:45:53,199 --> 01:45:58,800
testing or analytics to emphasis support

01:45:56,560 --> 01:46:00,719
it's not as you get a use case it's an

01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:02,639
open source project google started it

01:46:00,719 --> 01:46:06,960
five years ago now i believe

01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:09,360
but now belongs to the openjs foundation

01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:10,239
uh actually next slide please here's how

01:46:09,360 --> 01:46:12,080
amp looks

01:46:10,239 --> 01:46:13,840
in person if you can go to the next

01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:17,040
slide for me there other

01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:18,639
reason oh there we go is that good

01:46:17,040 --> 01:46:21,040
yes that is the next slide thank you

01:46:18,639 --> 01:46:22,960
that's how amp looks it says html which

01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:24,960
is web pages of html on them

01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:26,080
so this for example is i make a youtube

01:46:24,960 --> 01:46:28,560
embed in

01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:29,520
amp it is not using youtube's own

01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:31,119
javascript

01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:33,520
use this web component called amp

01:46:31,119 --> 01:46:36,000
youtube app does the rest for you

01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:37,360
automatically elsa will lazy load this

01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,800
video if it's actually at the bottom of

01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:40,560
the screen automatically and does

01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:42,080
various things optimize

01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:43,920
notice also width and height are in

01:46:42,080 --> 01:46:44,719
there that's because the amp requires

01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:46,960
these things

01:46:44,719 --> 01:46:48,239
that prevents content layout shifts

01:46:46,960 --> 01:46:48,960
because everything's got its size

01:46:48,239 --> 01:46:52,080
declared

01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:53,840
in advance amp will do other things to

01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:55,840
also make you be fast it restricts how

01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:58,000
much css you can have

01:46:55,840 --> 01:46:59,520
uh what i was going to say over here i

01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:00,080
think that was it if you go to the next

01:46:59,520 --> 01:47:01,360
slide

01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:03,280
i'm going a little faster than i was

01:47:01,360 --> 01:47:04,400
going to go but let's go faster here

01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:06,080
if you go to the next slide here and

01:47:04,400 --> 01:47:08,239
then you press the button there then

01:47:06,080 --> 01:47:11,040
this will pop down on the screen

01:47:08,239 --> 01:47:13,280
uh it turns out that sites that use amp

01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:15,840
to pass corp vitals criteria

01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:16,400
at five times the rate of non-amp sites

01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:18,560
so

01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:20,320
to make carbon vitals criteria yours

01:47:18,560 --> 01:47:22,480
this is the way you can do it

01:47:20,320 --> 01:47:24,480
now one problem you might have is that

01:47:22,480 --> 01:47:25,760
maybe the validation rules of amperture

01:47:24,480 --> 01:47:27,199
restrictive for you

01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:29,119
the nice thing is with the changes we

01:47:27,199 --> 01:47:31,440
discussed about seven hours

01:47:29,119 --> 01:47:32,480
ago before in search amp will no longer

01:47:31,440 --> 01:47:34,400
be required

01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:36,880
for the top stories carousel if you're a

01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:39,440
publisher so it becomes more compelling

01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:40,000
to simply use amp and if you want to

01:47:39,440 --> 01:47:42,000
actually

01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:43,840
do things that are not valid amp you've

01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:44,560
got to have your own javascript on the

01:47:43,840 --> 01:47:47,040
page

01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:47,840
or add that analytics pixel that doesn't

01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:50,080
support

01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:51,440
you can just go ahead and do it and the

01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:53,760
reason not to do that

01:47:51,440 --> 01:47:54,960
except for the fact that if you use amp

01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:57,679
you get into

01:47:54,960 --> 01:47:58,480
amp caches that then will serve your

01:47:57,679 --> 01:48:00,639
page

01:47:58,480 --> 01:48:01,520
from on google search google's own

01:48:00,639 --> 01:48:04,080
servers

01:48:01,520 --> 01:48:05,119
or on bing search for microsoft servers

01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:06,560
for example

01:48:05,119 --> 01:48:08,639
so you'll lose the benefit of being in

01:48:06,560 --> 01:48:09,520
the cache which is just for valid amp

01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:11,520
pages

01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:13,600
but still if you're finding yourself

01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:16,560
struggling making your page faster

01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:17,520
amp is a good way to get there and also

01:48:16,560 --> 01:48:20,000
next year

01:48:17,520 --> 01:48:21,199
next slide please in january i think

01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,159
it'll be a launch to make the amp even

01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:24,320
easier to use

01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:26,000
which is called bento amp like let me

01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:27,280
bento boxes where you can pick out bits

01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:29,040
of japanese food

01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:31,280
in their own little compartments you'll

01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:32,000
be able to use amp components on other

01:48:31,280 --> 01:48:34,480
web pages

01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:36,560
as well this can be done now but it

01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:38,080
doesn't always work maybe honestly it

01:48:36,560 --> 01:48:39,760
seems to always work now anyway but

01:48:38,080 --> 01:48:41,760
they're writing all the components using

01:48:39,760 --> 01:48:42,560
preact to guarantee that all the amp

01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:45,440
components

01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:46,000
will work independent of amp's own run

01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,679
time

01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,679
so you'll be able to say oh i've got

01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:52,239
this large image carousel library

01:48:49,679 --> 01:48:53,040
i could do stamp carousel it's just 9k

01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:55,280
g-zipped

01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:57,119
and you can save some space and go on

01:48:55,280 --> 01:48:58,239
doing this to your page until things are

01:48:57,119 --> 01:49:00,800
faster

01:48:58,239 --> 01:49:01,600
also amp so does that i have a follow-up

01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:04,560
question

01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:05,040
for that does that mean these components

01:49:04,560 --> 01:49:06,880
um

01:49:05,040 --> 01:49:08,239
these bento amp components will not

01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:10,639
require external the

01:49:08,239 --> 01:49:11,360
external amp javascript yes that's

01:49:10,639 --> 01:49:12,800
correct

01:49:11,360 --> 01:49:14,800
and i think in january the plan is to

01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:16,080
have the 30 most popular ones all

01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:18,960
support that

01:49:16,080 --> 01:49:20,320
so that cool that is different i see a

01:49:18,960 --> 01:49:23,199
comment about going slower

01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:23,760
yeah sorry i'll try to talk a little i

01:49:23,199 --> 01:49:26,960
really

01:49:23,760 --> 01:49:28,480
have 11 minutes yeah we have we have 11

01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:30,560
minutes left until

01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:31,840
laura lean is going to like kick us out

01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:33,040
thanks for the reminder about not

01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:35,199
talking so fast i

01:49:33,040 --> 01:49:36,400
i talk too fast yeah just i get excited

01:49:35,199 --> 01:49:38,719
about things sorry

01:49:36,400 --> 01:49:40,159
so anyway the idea is that you'll be

01:49:38,719 --> 01:49:41,440
able to use amp

01:49:40,159 --> 01:49:43,520
in a way that you want to to make your

01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:44,480
site faster without feeling like you

01:49:43,520 --> 01:49:47,199
have to use amp

01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:47,920
to please um top stories carousel in

01:49:47,199 --> 01:49:51,199
google search

01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:51,840
in some way let's go to the next slide

01:49:51,199 --> 01:49:54,719
here

01:49:51,840 --> 01:49:55,679
what is the next slide oh yeah um amp

01:49:54,719 --> 01:49:58,239
has a really nice

01:49:55,679 --> 01:49:59,360
wordpress plugin the drupal plugin is

01:49:58,239 --> 01:50:01,520
more basic and

01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:03,679
not as maintained the wordpress plugin

01:50:01,520 --> 01:50:05,280
has been worked on by an agency

01:50:03,679 --> 01:50:07,280
plus some google engineers now for a

01:50:05,280 --> 01:50:09,360
little while the nice thing is that the

01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:11,840
team is working on taking

01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:13,199
out the guts of this plugin and making

01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:15,360
it usable by anybody

01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:17,199
taking out the php that's not wordpress

01:50:15,360 --> 01:50:18,719
specific so that other people can use it

01:50:17,199 --> 01:50:20,239
for other plugins out there

01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:22,000
this will be helpful because the

01:50:20,239 --> 01:50:22,880
wordpress plugin does things like for

01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:25,760
example

01:50:22,880 --> 01:50:27,840
go through all your css on your site and

01:50:25,760 --> 01:50:29,840
find all the css that's not being used

01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:31,199
and get rid of it so it makes css

01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:33,440
smaller by default

01:50:31,199 --> 01:50:34,239
so these features will soon be available

01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:40,159
to other

01:50:34,239 --> 01:50:40,159
cms's as well okay

01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:44,000
i guess and we're going back to me right

01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:45,440
now so uh i want to talk a little bit i

01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:46,800
think i mentioned this earlier i want to

01:50:45,440 --> 01:50:47,679
talk a little bit about performant

01:50:46,800 --> 01:50:50,560
animations

01:50:47,679 --> 01:50:52,560
and i wanna i wanna so there's certain

01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:54,000
animations that can cause reflow and

01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:55,199
paints and those include

01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:57,040
things like animating background

01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:59,360
positions and the top left

01:50:57,040 --> 01:51:00,719
and margins and paddings and if you ever

01:50:59,360 --> 01:51:02,880
like scroll down a page and it's doing

01:51:00,719 --> 01:51:05,599
like this parallax stuff

01:51:02,880 --> 01:51:06,639
and it starts being all janky as it's

01:51:05,599 --> 01:51:07,840
coming up and down

01:51:06,639 --> 01:51:09,199
that's typically because they're

01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:10,320
animating background position or

01:51:09,199 --> 01:51:13,440
something like that

01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:15,360
a better way to do that is by

01:51:13,440 --> 01:51:16,480
using properties that that do

01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:19,199
compositing like

01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:20,800
transform or opacity so when you're

01:51:19,199 --> 01:51:23,520
doing animations

01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:24,560
try try to do things like transforms and

01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:26,000
opacity

01:51:24,560 --> 01:51:27,760
as much as possible there's sometimes

01:51:26,000 --> 01:51:29,920
where you can't do that but just just

01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:32,560
keep that in mind

01:51:29,920 --> 01:51:33,679
talk a little bit about css it's bad

01:51:32,560 --> 01:51:36,320
practice to

01:51:33,679 --> 01:51:37,599
base64 encode everything into your css

01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:38,960
it used to be

01:51:37,599 --> 01:51:41,360
good practice to do this because it

01:51:38,960 --> 01:51:43,840
would cut down on your http request when

01:51:41,360 --> 01:51:45,280
you know there was it when we were on

01:51:43,840 --> 01:51:47,280
http one

01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:48,320
the http requests mattered a whole bunch

01:51:47,280 --> 01:51:51,119
so people would in

01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:53,040
embed these images into their css files

01:51:51,119 --> 01:51:54,400
right now

01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:56,320
that's bad practice because you're

01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:57,679
taking basically a non-critical

01:51:56,320 --> 01:51:59,520
uh resource and you're making it

01:51:57,679 --> 01:52:00,800
critical and

01:51:59,520 --> 01:52:02,719
you know other than that you just kind

01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:04,480
of want to follow like best practices

01:52:02,719 --> 01:52:06,000
and try to componentize and split up

01:52:04,480 --> 01:52:09,280
these monolithic style sheets

01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:10,960
as much as possible and

01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:12,320
i i don't worry about selector

01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:15,599
performance

01:52:12,320 --> 01:52:17,920
um so ben what can i do

01:52:15,599 --> 01:52:18,960
i love your css slide there selective

01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:20,800
performance

01:52:18,960 --> 01:52:22,159
it matters but not as much as that two

01:52:20,800 --> 01:52:25,440
megabyte images

01:52:22,159 --> 01:52:26,719
lying yeah so what can i do yeah we have

01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:28,960
some ideas for things

01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:32,000
issues that are underway and under

01:52:28,960 --> 01:52:33,280
discussion that are seeking volunteers

01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:35,040
if you can go to the next slide over

01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:37,199
here pastor a superhero

01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:38,159
this already happened this is exciting

01:52:37,199 --> 01:52:40,080
google

01:52:38,159 --> 01:52:41,440
actually paid some people to do this

01:52:40,080 --> 01:52:43,199
didn't take a lot of code

01:52:41,440 --> 01:52:44,560
it took very little code because drupal

01:52:43,199 --> 01:52:47,199
is so organized

01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:48,159
so you can already now use lazy loading

01:52:47,199 --> 01:52:51,520
right there

01:52:48,159 --> 01:52:53,440
in drupal 9.1 automatically let's go to

01:52:51,520 --> 01:52:55,840
the next slide here please

01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:56,560
other ideas that are out there if you

01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:59,520
had

01:52:56,560 --> 01:53:00,639
better ways to make images smaller and

01:52:59,520 --> 01:53:02,480
still the most bites

01:53:00,639 --> 01:53:04,239
on the web is images although as mike

01:53:02,480 --> 01:53:06,639
pointed out javascript fight for byte

01:53:04,239 --> 01:53:07,679
takes more time images are still the

01:53:06,639 --> 01:53:09,679
most bites

01:53:07,679 --> 01:53:11,119
so there are ideas out there to make it

01:53:09,679 --> 01:53:13,280
possible to

01:53:11,119 --> 01:53:14,960
make images smaller both right when

01:53:13,280 --> 01:53:16,239
they're created in the first place when

01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:18,560
they're first uploaded

01:53:16,239 --> 01:53:20,239
and also on the server if you go to the

01:53:18,560 --> 01:53:22,480
next slide over here

01:53:20,239 --> 01:53:23,760
you'll see the idea of simply using

01:53:22,480 --> 01:53:25,199
squoosh.app

01:53:23,760 --> 01:53:27,040
and sticking that right there into

01:53:25,199 --> 01:53:28,800
drupal or something similar

01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:30,960
so you could if you're a person loading

01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:32,960
up a big image say okay here's my image

01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:35,280
oh i can compress it look at that now

01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:38,239
it's only 20k instead of 200k

01:53:35,280 --> 01:53:39,040
super useful the squish api is available

01:53:38,239 --> 01:53:41,119
for use

01:53:39,040 --> 01:53:42,960
it's all open source and something like

01:53:41,119 --> 01:53:45,679
this would make it easier for everyone

01:53:42,960 --> 01:53:46,239
to make images smaller honestly right

01:53:45,679 --> 01:53:48,560
now

01:53:46,239 --> 01:53:49,760
no cms really does this dribble could be

01:53:48,560 --> 01:53:54,080
a leader here

01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:56,159
in making images smaller on the web

01:53:54,080 --> 01:53:58,400
uh also here i think i mentioned this

01:53:56,159 --> 01:53:59,760
before if avif was supported that would

01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:02,239
be a great way to make images

01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:04,560
really small it currently isn't possible

01:54:02,239 --> 01:54:06,719
because it's not supported by libgd

01:54:04,560 --> 01:54:08,000
but i'm working on this now and i need

01:54:06,719 --> 01:54:09,599
some help

01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,880
if you want to help me out with this let

01:54:09,599 --> 01:54:13,360
me know because then it could be

01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:15,360
possible to do this in php gd

01:54:13,360 --> 01:54:16,880
and then that could propagate into not

01:54:15,360 --> 01:54:20,800
just drupal but also

01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:24,159
joomla other cms's let's go to the

01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:25,840
next slide over here also javascript

01:54:24,159 --> 01:54:28,000
minification is important

01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:29,040
make javascript small get rid of those

01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:30,960
comments

01:54:29,040 --> 01:54:33,040
make those gigantic property names

01:54:30,960 --> 01:54:34,400
smaller this already is possible with

01:54:33,040 --> 01:54:36,880
popular modules

01:54:34,400 --> 01:54:37,679
but what it was built into drupal why

01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:39,199
not do that

01:54:37,679 --> 01:54:40,639
then everyone could do this without

01:54:39,199 --> 01:54:41,920
actually having to find out that a

01:54:40,639 --> 01:54:43,360
module exists

01:54:41,920 --> 01:54:45,199
and i've seen plenty of drupal sites

01:54:43,360 --> 01:54:47,840
that have unminified

01:54:45,199 --> 01:54:50,000
javascript everyone does it sometimes it

01:54:47,840 --> 01:54:51,599
just happens that way

01:54:50,000 --> 01:54:53,920
yeah core can aggregate it but it

01:54:51,599 --> 01:54:54,480
doesn't minify it yeah aggregation is

01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:57,679
nice

01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:59,280
uh but minifying is also nice and uh

01:54:57,679 --> 01:55:00,560
also here's an issue over here this is

01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:03,119
fabian's idea

01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:04,000
what if not just images but all content

01:55:03,119 --> 01:55:06,560
below the fold

01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:07,360
was lazy loaded so anything not just

01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:09,840
images

01:55:07,360 --> 01:55:11,679
or iframes which you can do with html

01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:12,880
but say things that involve javascript

01:55:11,679 --> 01:55:14,639
and css

01:55:12,880 --> 01:55:16,159
the best most complicated sites out

01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:18,239
there do this already

01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:19,760
but drupal sites could also do it this

01:55:18,239 --> 01:55:21,920
is a fascinating idea

01:55:19,760 --> 01:55:23,760
and there is a link down there to get

01:55:21,920 --> 01:55:26,800
involved

01:55:23,760 --> 01:55:29,679
and yeah this

01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:30,880
this is an issue right now like so so gd

01:55:29,679 --> 01:55:33,599
already supports web

01:55:30,880 --> 01:55:34,320
webp but drupal does not out of the box

01:55:33,599 --> 01:55:37,040
without that

01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:38,960
uh contrib module and there's an issue

01:55:37,040 --> 01:55:41,440
right now to fix that in drupal core

01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:43,119
and honestly it's uh the issue looks

01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:46,560
pretty far along right now

01:55:43,119 --> 01:55:49,440
but if anyone is into that type of stuff

01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:49,840
the link is at the bottom and here's a

01:55:49,440 --> 01:55:52,719
link

01:55:49,840 --> 01:55:54,639
on where to learn more so there's tons

01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:56,480
and tons and tons and this doesn't even

01:55:54,639 --> 01:55:57,679
begin to scratch the surface right here

01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:58,480
but there's a couple like really cool

01:55:57,679 --> 01:56:00,320
links

01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:02,480
up in here that smashing magazine link

01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:04,239
is just like this huge huge

01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:05,520
front-end performance thing and it's

01:56:04,239 --> 01:56:08,480
just amazing

01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:09,840
there's a couple conferences i've been

01:56:08,480 --> 01:56:11,440
to the performance matters conference in

01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:13,840
california before and there's also

01:56:11,440 --> 01:56:14,800
a like a similar conference call

01:56:13,840 --> 01:56:16,880
performance now

01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:18,639
that happens in amsterdam and they

01:56:16,880 --> 01:56:22,320
usually happen every year but of course

01:56:18,639 --> 01:56:24,159
um of course like the the coronavirus

01:56:22,320 --> 01:56:24,560
has changed things uh the performance

01:56:24,159 --> 01:56:27,280
now

01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:28,400
conference in amsterdam has some dates

01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:29,920
announced for next year which is in

01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:32,239
november which is like really really

01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:35,520
exciting i'd really like to go to it

01:56:32,239 --> 01:56:35,840
and uh that's our last slide and we met

01:56:35,520 --> 01:56:39,040
we

01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:40,719
we have four minutes left and uh maybe

01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:43,840
we could take some questions

01:56:40,719 --> 01:56:45,920
um for these four minutes i know

01:56:43,840 --> 01:56:47,840
one more here that's in the q a which is

01:56:45,920 --> 01:56:50,560
webp isn't always the sl

01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:51,199
the most compact thing is worth using at

01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:52,960
all

01:56:51,199 --> 01:56:54,719
and i think my answer for that is that

01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:56,400
it's not always the smallest thing but

01:56:54,719 --> 01:56:56,960
it's usually the smallest thing compared

01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:59,760
to like a

01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:01,119
png or a jpeg but you're right you've

01:56:59,760 --> 01:57:03,199
got to try your image out in different

01:57:01,119 --> 01:57:04,639
formats and see where it looks the best

01:57:03,199 --> 01:57:06,880
and where it can be the smallest and

01:57:04,639 --> 01:57:08,560
choose what's better in most cases it's

01:57:06,880 --> 01:57:10,080
going to be a bunch smaller and actually

01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:11,119
for example the amp cache will

01:57:10,080 --> 01:57:12,880
automatically

01:57:11,119 --> 01:57:14,960
um convert images to webp because

01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:17,360
they're usually just smaller

01:57:14,960 --> 01:57:19,760
and look just as good or better but

01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:22,719
you're right not always

01:57:19,760 --> 01:57:24,320
and i would like to like also like point

01:57:22,719 --> 01:57:27,679
out uh there's a saying called

01:57:24,320 --> 01:57:28,159
uh tools not rules and what that means

01:57:27,679 --> 01:57:29,760
is

01:57:28,159 --> 01:57:31,520
like measure everything like if you're

01:57:29,760 --> 01:57:33,040
implementing a webp and web piece slows

01:57:31,520 --> 01:57:34,320
your website down well first of all make

01:57:33,040 --> 01:57:35,760
sure you're

01:57:34,320 --> 01:57:37,520
make sure you're measuring it properly

01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:38,960
you know in real world conditions

01:57:37,520 --> 01:57:40,960
but secondly if it slows your website

01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:43,119
down don't use it you know

01:57:40,960 --> 01:57:44,560
um an example of that is like as i was

01:57:43,119 --> 01:57:45,280
prepping this talk you know i'm

01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:46,880
pre-loading

01:57:45,280 --> 01:57:48,800
on lullaby.com we're pre-loading like

01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:52,159
maybe five or six fonts

01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:52,880
um and i as i was doing my web page test

01:57:52,159 --> 01:57:55,040
waterfall

01:57:52,880 --> 01:57:56,400
uh graphs like trying to compare so i've

01:57:55,040 --> 01:57:58,320
noticed that the ones where i'm doing

01:57:56,400 --> 01:57:59,520
the preloading is taking longer to do

01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:02,159
that initial

01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:02,880
rum paint and i was thinking like why is

01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:05,520
this the case

01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:06,080
and i didn't go into actually measuring

01:58:05,520 --> 01:58:08,239
that

01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:09,920
but it's certainly a case where like

01:58:08,239 --> 01:58:11,679
maybe those are offsetting some other

01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:12,239
resources that should come in first so

01:58:11,679 --> 01:58:13,760
i'm gonna

01:58:12,239 --> 01:58:15,920
dive into that at some point as soon as

01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:16,400
i can get time but the fact is is like

01:58:15,920 --> 01:58:17,760
measure

01:58:16,400 --> 01:58:19,679
everything you know and if it doesn't

01:58:17,760 --> 01:58:21,199
work then it doesn't work but make sure

01:58:19,679 --> 01:58:23,119
you're measuring it properly

01:58:21,199 --> 01:58:24,800
yeah and along with that building on

01:58:23,119 --> 01:58:26,960
that also you know use your best

01:58:24,800 --> 01:58:29,360
judgment use your human judgment

01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:30,400
metrics are useful and scores are useful

01:58:29,360 --> 01:58:32,880
and people say

01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:33,520
this is a 47. it's got to be 51 or

01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:35,760
higher

01:58:33,520 --> 01:58:36,639
that's great but really just go to your

01:58:35,760 --> 01:58:39,280
favorite you know

01:58:36,639 --> 01:58:40,320
dev tools kind of thing throttle to 3g

01:58:39,280 --> 01:58:42,719
connection

01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:43,679
load up your site see where it's slow

01:58:42,719 --> 01:58:45,280
you can tell

01:58:43,679 --> 01:58:47,280
and where it's slow find those things

01:58:45,280 --> 01:58:49,119
and make them faster

01:58:47,280 --> 01:58:51,360
and this presentation there's a question

01:58:49,119 --> 01:58:52,239
on where this presentation is so like if

01:58:51,360 --> 01:58:54,239
you if you have that

01:58:52,239 --> 01:58:55,599
that github link it's the right up here

01:58:54,239 --> 01:58:59,040
it's a dc

01:58:55,599 --> 01:59:00,560
eu web perf um there's a link to the

01:58:59,040 --> 01:59:03,840
slide deck right at the top

01:59:00,560 --> 01:59:03,840
so you can just get there

01:59:04,239 --> 01:59:08,800
and yeah again over here i'm going to

01:59:05,760 --> 01:59:10,080
copy one more time uh mike's github

01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:11,760
which i actually added a couple things

01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:12,320
too i put the pr's in there during the

01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:14,639
talk

01:59:12,320 --> 01:59:16,400
you can accept those after the talk even

01:59:14,639 --> 01:59:18,480
more links

01:59:16,400 --> 01:59:20,719
i'm not going to accept theirs no

01:59:18,480 --> 01:59:23,280
decline

01:59:20,719 --> 01:59:25,440
um yeah here let me merge these right

01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:25,440
now

01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:34,719
