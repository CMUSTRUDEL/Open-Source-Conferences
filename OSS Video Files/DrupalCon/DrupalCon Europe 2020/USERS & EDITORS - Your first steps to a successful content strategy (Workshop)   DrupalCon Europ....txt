00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,440
this is going to be a workshop and how

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,119
does a

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:24,800
workshop work in a virtual conference

00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,680
well we are or i am going to try to

00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,920
to go through a lot of examples how we

00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,320
do content strategy at onex internet and

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,840
how

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,559
we have been doing it i'm gonna try to

00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,800
show you all examples

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,040
and and i would actually love if

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,040
if it is possible to hear stories from

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,120
you all of you

00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,480
and again i would be really happy if you

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,160
feel comfortable of putting on your

00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,920
video then i can actually see you while

00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,600
i talk to you

00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,320
but i also you know no stress and i also

00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,559
i know that that's totally fine if you

00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,719
don't want to put on the video

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,280
you all have access to put on your video

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,320
you have access to actually speak

00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,760
so feel free also to jump in and ask a

00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,280
question

00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,080
or anything like that and i think we're

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,119
just going to dive into this

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,640
um again here

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,240
i want to make sure that even though you

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,479
put on your photo and

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,759
image or you you start to chat don't

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,840
feel

00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,400
obliged to be here for the whole two

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,880
hours

00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,560
because this is a two-hour workshop it

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,320
means that we are going to be going over

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,560
a lot of content

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,240
and i don't expect that people after a

00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,520
whole day of a conference that they are

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,920
going to hang out here for

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,280
all two hours if you do then great work

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,040
uh if you don't like i totally

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,880
understand it so

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,640
i'm gonna be here for the two hours but

00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,399
if you like i said

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,159
if you need to drop out just drop out

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,840
and come by to at their booth tomorrow

00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,759
and say hi if you want to chat about

00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,600
content strategy

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,360
so i think we can actually just start

00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,000
and

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,680
welcome to the workshop of your first

thank you for joining anya i see you

00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,159
here and

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:47,360
others um so we are a full service

00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,200
digital agency

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,480
and we are one of the leaders in the

00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,879
european market

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,200
and development of web based solutions

00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,799
based on drupal

00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,400
and what we are going to be talking

00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,159
about today is a little bit the

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,920
everything that we do in the sense how

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,080
do we build a web project and how

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,040
does content strategy play a big role in

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,640
that

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,000
um one of the things that we i always

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,120
like to mention because i'm just so

00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,439
proud of it

00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,959
is that our team are 45 people and we

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,079
speak actually

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,959
i think over like 20 languages

00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:22,560
and and it's actually not so common to

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,759
be from germany when you're working for

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,759
our company

00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,199
but anya who is here for example she is

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,120
actually german and

00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,360
and working in our company so really

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,199
happy to have also

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,880
people from germany but we are actually

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,880
many of us from all over the world

00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,800
so what are we gonna cover in these two

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,160
hours

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,759
we are going to cover um what i think it

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,600
is important to start with is like

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,479
general information about

00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,880
how do we execute web projects and why

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,400
am i going to talk about that

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,800
i am actually going to talk about the

00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,080
general information because

00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,919
i think it is important for you to

00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,199
understand why content strategy is

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,720
important so therefore we are going to

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,720
go through the basics

00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:10,000
of how do you execute a web project

00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,320
um then we are going to go into the

00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,680
content strategy part a bit and we are

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,639
going to go in a little bit into the

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,120
history of

00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,600
of what is changing in the internet

00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,240
today why do we also need to adopt

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,320
that adapt to that then we are going to

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,680
go into the user personas and user

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,560
journey and i'm going to show you

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,400
templates

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,160
and so actually because this is a

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,479
workshop i actually

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,160
want you know you to have something that

00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,240
you can actually maybe start using in

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,360
your next project

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,880
it doesn't mean that we are going to be

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,800
doing it together we would be doing it

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,479
together if we were really together

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,800
together but we are not together now we

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,479
are only virtually together

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,840
so i'm just going to have like a lot of

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,320
q a's in between

00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,919
and then we are going to go into content

00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,039
templates and this is something that our

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,800
team has been

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,639
working on how do we create like content

00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,919
templates so we can create easier

00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,120
content

00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,240
and then in the end there's going to be

00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,479
a q a so in between each section we are

00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,160
also going to do q a's

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,680
and discussions and i want to hear from

00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,680
you and

00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,759
uh and yes we should do a break or

00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,440
something in between so i suggest that

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,240
way maybe at quarter past

00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,199
five we just take a five minute break or

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,520
something we just go

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,560
all and stand up and have a coffee or

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,560
water or something like that

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:30,080
so to start off uh again here

00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,840
if you have any questions i am looking

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,520
at the chat in front of me

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,720

00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,080

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,120
feel free to put on your photo and your

00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,520
your video if you feel comfortable doing

00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,240
that

00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,240
and we are going to be jumping into the

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,599
first part about general information

00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,360
how do we execute web projects um

00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,440
so this is we are going to start with a

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,039
traditional session about just

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:06,400
how do we do it and this is our circle

00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:08,960
for all of our web projects maybe you're

00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:12,000
familiar with some of these things

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,800
so we talk about that if you want

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,080
to execute a successful web project

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:19,280
there is

00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,759
at least 10 things that you need to keep

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,840
track of when you do that and i'm gonna

00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,560
go through every single one of them with

00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,879
you

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,599
for for us here to understand like what

00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,959
do we talk about as being a successful

00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,080
execution of a web project keep in mind

00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:36,479
something like uh

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,760
creating the cms or designing it it's

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,800
only point

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,120
only point six and seven meaning

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,880
that the implementation part is very

00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,760
often like the

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,040
the one that people focus a lot on but

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,640
they forget that

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,399
there's a lot of things that need to

00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,680
happen before if you're going to be

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:56,640
creating something

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,640
that people need

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,279
so we start with the business goals so

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,959
this is what we do when we meet our

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,240
clients we sit down with them and we say

00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,120
like why

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,839
are you doing it and how is that going

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,959
to help your company to go forward

00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,519
so we try to go with the client through

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:17,279
that the

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,800
the business goal needs to be defined

00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,560
clearly and

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,000
very often like the business goals of

00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,000
the site or the product

00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,920
that you're doing that's pro most likely

00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,839
also derived from the overall business

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,720
goal of the company

00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,320
so what we are start asking these

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,640
questions what are the goals of the

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:37,040
website and how do they relate to the

00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,680
overall goals of the whole company

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:42,000
and how actually do you measure the

00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:44,959
success like of these goals

00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,080
so if you have a product in front of you

00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:50,880
or you're working

00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:53,360
with a project try to do this exercise

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,600
um where you actually just go through it

00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,519
and you think about like hey how can i

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,120
you know how can we do this you know do

00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,839
you know this already about the product

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,040
that you're doing

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,880
you know most likely you you do and i

00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,240
like to use an as an example

00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,240
i like to use the iceland air because

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,640
i like using iceland as an example

00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,440
because people remember that

00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,560
and the icelander website is actually

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,360
very

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,279
interesting website because the business

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,160
goal of iceland there is to bring per

00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,880
bring a person from a to b it's to sell

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,880
seats

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,399
in an airplane so if we think about

00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,399
iceland there and if we're going to be

00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,680
using this example throughout our

00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,360
presentation here

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,200
you know that is the goal of their

00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,760
business is to sell

00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,680
seeds in an airplane to bring people

00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,680
from a to b it doesn't matter from where

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,040
so in this case iceland air has of

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,120
course their headquarters in iceland and

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,560
they fly to all these areas

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,920
so there's a lot of things that they

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,680
have to do they have to create a lot of

00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,360
different content for that

00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,160
so most of most important is to

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,640
understand like that this is how an

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,720
airline works you know maybe there's a

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,920
little bit fewer lines today

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,760
due to the pandemic but but still this

00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,040
is how it would look like in a normal

00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,519
day so

00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,079
then we basically start diving into the

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,000
content strategy of that website

00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,079
and now let's you know always continue

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,600
with the icelander example

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:27,680
um and and by the way i'm not like

00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:31,040
you know i do not get paid from iceland

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,279
there you know i'm not sponsored by them

00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,880
uh and and they are also not our client

00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,959
they are actually just an example a

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,640
random example that i like to use when i

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,839
go through this

00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,720
so to create a content strategy you know

00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,600
you have to like

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:47,360
plan the content based on what the goal

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:52,480
of the website is

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:55,600
so on one hand it must be a very

00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,120
useful content for humans like us but at

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,639
the same time it actually also needs to

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,040
be very useful for

00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:01,920
search engines so you have to start

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,120
thinking about

00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,000
very many different aspects uh it has to

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,000
be

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:13,040
accessible it has to be this like visual

00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,519
it needs to be a lot of content so

00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,360
search engines will find you

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,160
um so you start to think about what are

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,800
the content sections of the website

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,680
um how do you break down the content

00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:28,000
where what are the main landing pages

00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,440
uh how do you have overview pages how do

00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,200
you do your menu structure

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,639
is there any cross-linking strategy for

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,959
the landing pages

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,800
and inter interestingly we talk about it

00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,519
for the city of reykjavik

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,720
that we say like every single pages is

00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,360
an important page

00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,480
so it is not just your start page the

00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,959
page where

00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,519
you think that everybody come to but

00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,639
actually

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,959
all of the other pages on the site they

00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,560
are

00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,560
extremely important because normally

00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,440
people come and they land on those pages

00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,279
so

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,480
when we talk about landing pages that's

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:00,399
the

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,160
you know where the airplane lands on

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,920
that that's you as a user you come and

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,800
you land on this page so therefore you

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,680
should get the information that you need

00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,040
so if we think about that for for

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,200
iceland there you know we have like

00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:15,360
these landing pages for like

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,720
skeeg and whistler you know we have a

00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,079
landing page for

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:24,000
the barcelona vacation and so

00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,720
on and and regardless of what it is like

00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,240
you have to

00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,680
you have to have different photos you

00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,279
have to have different images you have

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,079
to have different content and so

00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,600
so on so when you're finished with doing

00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,200
your content strategy and by the way we

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,480
are going to go into deep diving about

00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,399
how we are going to do that actually

00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,560
but then we go and look at the user

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:46,000
audience

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,079
so you look of course like

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,680
who are the personas that come on your

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,680
website and i would actually like to ask

00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,959
a question now

00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,240
who here and you can raise your hand or

00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,199
something like that or do this

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,160
um who here has already done a persona

00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:04,399
analysis on

00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:08,480
on a website or on your own website

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:13,680
let's see one two three

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:15,440
four so many of you

00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,440
it's actually important because i don't

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,279
want to go into too much detail like

00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,560
you know i have a lot of content on it

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,120
and maybe i'm going to go faster a

00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,880
little bit through it later so

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,320
most important of this this is what

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,360
normally one of the first things that

00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,279
people do

00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,199
to think about the personas and

00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,120
if we go and think about the personas

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:38,399
for iceland there

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,360
you know we can immediately think about

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,360
four personas

00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,600
one being the family that is going to be

00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,920
buying seats to go

00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,959
from a to b then there is the young

00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,360
couple

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,160
then there is the business traveler and

00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,560
then it is the pensionist

00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,880
and if you start to look at that and we

00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,199
we saw earlier barcelona

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:03,120
being a destination you know you

00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:05,040
probably imagine you start to imagine

00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,880
how do i build up a content that fits

00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,639
actually to all these personas or do i

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,839
actually need to create

00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,480
different content for every single

00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:16,399
persona

00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:18,399
because showing the pitch for the family

00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,839
is you will probably show completely

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,279
different photos

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,639
for the family that you would actually

00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,000
show for the young couple who is

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,560
probably going there to have a little

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,760
bit more

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:31,199
fun in the bars

00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,199
while the family is going to

00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,959
you know be playing maybe with the kids

00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:37,199
there

00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,240
does anyone have a question because a c

00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,519
still hands up

00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,839
was it just because you were raising

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,839
them or

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,920
and now you're quick putting it down

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,079
leslie are you gonna

00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:53,279
ask a question no

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,279
feel free to if you want to

00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,959
um so what i was actually explaining

00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,399
there is that

00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:02,800
you know you have um you know you you

00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:05,680
start to segment your content into

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,160
uh being like we thought about a family

00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,160
trip

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,199
going to barcelona or young couple in

00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,920
barcelona

00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:14,160
so as soon as you start to do the

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,160
persona analysis you also start to think

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,920
about like the contents rarity before

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,600
what what what am i going to show and

00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,320
then you start actually

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,320
to build up these segments being in

00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,759
whistler that's in canada

00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:31,199
for yeah diego and mike you know

00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,639
using the whistler example

00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,639
there's obviously going to be a

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,320
difference if you're going to

00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,680
there's a family or if you're going as a

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,560
young couple because you will just

00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,720
immediately show

00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,720
different photos or different content

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,160
for that

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,199
so therefore then we start to think

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:49,759
about the user journey

00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,560
um so we need to plan the user journey

00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,399
and

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,519
and the content personalization so what

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,639
we were looking at is like the

00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:59,120
personalization what do we show for whom

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:01,279
so users they will navigate the content

00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,079
of the website very differently

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:05,839
and we want to plan this as much as we

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,679
can

00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,720
and by the way we will find out probably

00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:09,360
in the end that it's going to look

00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,799
different

00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:16,079
than what we expected um

00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:18,000
so so therefore we we try to

00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,079
build this up based on the segments and

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,360
all of that and again here

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,839
you know the segments can actually

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,079
overlap and i want to give you as an

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,679
advice please don't over complicate

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,960
things for your website

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,400
right um you can so easily start to

00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,160
create like all kinds of different

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,760
variations and then at the end

00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,280
you think like you have to probably hire

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,640
50 people to do the content for your

00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,559
website

00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,240
that's not our goal today but our goal

00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,960
today is at least to figure out

00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,760
i always say at least two personas are

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,919
important

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,120
i think for one x internet our company i

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,840
think we have five

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,600
identified personas you can actually we

00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,480
will actually look at one a couple of

00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,919
personas for

00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,919
our agency later on

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,480
so when you start to plan the content

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,160
and now i'm actually showing you so i

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,760
tried to play around here a little bit

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,480
and i created like different content

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,440
based on

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,640
um what are you doing so if you for

00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,720
example here

00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,679
you're flying to you're going skiing in

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,559
whistler

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,120
you know depending on you will show

00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,679
different

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,480
tours you will see different hotels

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,559
depending on

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,240
what user persona you're actually trying

00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:27,280
to target

00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,559
and you will potentially also put in a

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,919
little bit different

00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,600
texts and you will maybe focus for the

00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,080
young couple you will maybe focus a

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,200
little bit

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,039
less expensive hotels while maybe for

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,919
the elderly

00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,679
you know senior people going there they

00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,919
maybe have a little bit more money

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,960
in their hand so you would target like a

00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,320
little bit more

00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,320
expensive hotels for them

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,280
um so therefore depending on that like

00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,120
you know

00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,480
that's actually what i was saying that

00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,640
you you would actually

00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,640
think about you know what am i gonna

00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,919
show in which case if i'm gonna do

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,840
a different content or if you wanna

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,480
personalize it and actually just like

00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,080
inject

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,039
different things in different places

00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,960
so we've covered already four things in

00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,600
the whole overview of how do we

00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,960
when we haven't even started to create

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,720
any ux

00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,080
we haven't even started to create any

00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,760
design

00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,919
you know we have definitely not started

00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,960
to set up any drupal

00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,400
because we were here in drupalcon um

00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,160
but there's a lot of work that needs to

00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,000
happen before and it's a little bit we

00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,960
we talked about that in some workshop

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,039
yesterday a

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,320
chicken egg problem because somebody

00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,600
says but how can i do a pro

00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,400
how can i do content for something that

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,880
i don't know how it's going to look like

00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,600
and then the ux designer says yeah but

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,520
how can i do

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,480
ux design for a content that you don't

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,480
even know what it's going to be

00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,480
if anyone has a good answer to what you

00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,400
should do first

00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,080
uh let me know but we try we think that

00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,360
this is the right way

00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,400
we still often figure out that

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,720
that you need to have a really good

00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,080
guidance with the client throughout the

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,080
first phase and the client not

00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,720
necessarily has a budget for it all the

00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,520
time

00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,280
because they often have a budget for the

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,000
more

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,679
development part and the ux part and the

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,200
design

00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,039
but we try to guide them in a way that

00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,840
say like i keep a little bit of budget

00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:25,600
for this part

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,960
to start with so now let's look at the

00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,640
ux so i'm going to go a little bit

00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:31,600
quicker through this

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,320
i'm not going to show that examples but

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,919
creating ux is also crucial

00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,799
we always talk about like doing

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:41,600
wireframes before we do the design

00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,280
and wireframes are important because

00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,480
like you can start actually injecting

00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,919
content in there

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,600
so you can start creating your content

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,440
even before and start to play around

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,520
with real content

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,640
before you start to define how it is

00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,640
going to look like in the end

00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:02,400
then it goes into the design part

00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:04,320
and the front end so we like to split

00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,880
the front end from the back and not

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,360
being decoupled but we at least like

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,240
you know our front and we can start

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,520
front end

00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,520
by using something like storybook or

00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,760
pattern lab and start creating all the

00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:21,200
templates before actually we start to do

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:25,039
the back end or the other way around

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:27,600
so to continue on that like you know

00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,200
here we also watch out talk about like

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,200
things in the front end like are we

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,720
doing performance thing correctly are is

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,679
accessibility

00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,960
requirements already defined our browser

00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,760
requirements defined

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,000
resolution requirements defined our

00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,039
device requirement refined and one of

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,799
the things that i feel

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,640
really helpful is to ask the client like

00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,240
what devices are you using in your

00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:52,240
company

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,919
um sometimes we for when we forget that

00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,799
and we all figure out afterwards like oh

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,640
they're all using

00:21:54,799 --> 00:22:02,640
internet explorer you know or the

00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:06,320
the boss is always using this big ipad

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,520
which sometimes causes a problem too um

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,960
and that is the person that actually

00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,760
needs to pay the bill in the end so we

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,080
need to really

00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,760
make sure that we we ask those questions

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,840
before we start

00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,200
designing and i see from mike

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,880
um maybe you can tell us a little bit

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,159
about this after in your

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,679
in the discussion and q a um you know

00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,559
your get up thing but let's go through

00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,559
that a little bit later

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,720
so we are at step seven and step seven

00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,880
like we probably are

00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,960
all very familiar too because that's the

00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,919
drupal part right

00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,200
now we need like a modern back-end

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,640
system

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,880
to you know we need a cms

00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,559
um again here we need to think about

00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,480
things like is the user interface of the

00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,120
back-end defined how are the editors

00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,600
going to be using the

00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,280
the thing and going through a persona

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,000
with the editors is as

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,799
important as doing the personas for the

00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,400
users

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:08,320
for the website because you can only

00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,440
have a successful

00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,280
web project if the people that are

00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:15,200
putting in content on that can actually

00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:20,000
use it

00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,520
so i am actually curious because i hear

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,559
that mike needs to go and i'm really

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,720
happy to have him

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,320
here in the chat mike do you want to say

00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,720
hi to us and do you want to show this i

00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,360
actually

00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,440
i'm i'm really happy to go and jump here

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,520
a little bit between

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,039
are you i'm going to see her because you

00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:38,720
need to go to another

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:40,159
session right yeah in a bit it's it's uh

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,760
i just wanted to go off and say that

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,480
there's there's a lot of

00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,159
um effort to try and include uh people

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,600
with disabilities in personas

00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,440
um and and even if you're not

00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,799
necessarily looking at people with

00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,720
permanent disabilities if you're only

00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,480
selecting five people

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,400
it's much easier to actually expand it

00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,840
to look at people who have

00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,240
temporary or situational disabilities so

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,080
somebody who wants to go off and book

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,480
their flight on their phone on a sunny

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,240
day

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,600
and they're outside trying to book their

00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,919
flight or they're trying to

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,960
to to manage that but they they don't

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,440
have ideal lighting

00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,720
conditions or somebody has broken their

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,200
their uh their wrist

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,000
and they're trying to go into uh type

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,679
single-handedly

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,840
on the website to find the information

00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:23,919
with their non-dominant hand

00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,919
there's ways to build in that creativity

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,799
so we're getting people to think about

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,120
accessibility

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,640
through the process of of defining a

00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,559
persona and

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,840
helping people realize just the the

00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,600
breadth of of uh

00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,600
of accessibility challenges that people

00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,679
have

00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,279
oh thank you so much and for those if

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,039
you don't know mike mike is very

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,799
involved in everything related to

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:48,000
accessibility in the drupal project as

00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,840
well so thank you for that mike

00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,279
and thank you for sharing this so i'm

00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,559
actually curious i have a little i have

00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:55,120
one question for you mike

00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:56,080
um so i have heard something about the

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,200
number of like

00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:02,400
25 or 30 percent of like users

00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,799
uh have some kind of a disability

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,240
um what are the percent like the correct

00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,159
percentage

00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,440
it depends on the who's doing the who's

00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:12,799
gathering the stats but

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:16,000
uh but the u.s government uh has has uh

00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,480
put it as as a one in four so about 25

00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,480
percent

00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,679
uh people have a dis have a permanent

00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,919
disability

00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,039
um and uh there's there's different

00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,120
stats whether you're looking at the

00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,240
united nations and and how you define a

00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,400
disability

00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,360
uh but uh but there's there's a wide

00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,279
range and

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,039
unfortunately one of the the sad things

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,559
of of uh one of the other sad things

00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,000
about kovit is that there there are

00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,679
actually going to be people who have

00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,760
long-term disabilities

00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,039
because of covid um and and that's

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,480
something that we haven't

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,320
we haven't really thought through enough

00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,720
about what are the the long-term effects

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,760
of

00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,080
of people who who who've gotten covered

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,720
and

00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:54,320
are still trying to to uh we'll will be

00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,320
suffering from it from years afterwards

00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,799
correct uh we also have a client who is

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,840
also

00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:02,080
in you know experience something similar

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,600
and

00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,760
they are actually talking about similar

00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,840
things so thank you so much for sharing

00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,799
this because i think this is extremely

00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,400
relevant and and for all of the not just

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,520
doing the personas

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,279
and doing that correctly in the

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,480
beginning but also like reviewing this

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,120
when you are doing

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,880
your back end or your front end or your

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:23,360
you know ux and design just make sure

00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,799
that you always keep this in mind so

00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,120
very good input so see if like

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,919
more of you this is a workshop again so

00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:35,520
if you have

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:35,520
uh input in any way or questions

00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:41,840
let me know so the next step we go into

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,000
the number eight that is actually what

00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,200
we say like creation of the content

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,960
that could actually be like i'm

00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,880
migrating the content from somewhere or

00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,400
i'm already starting to create it and so

00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,600
on so

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,360
um that is also like

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,919
you know we can start putting in the

00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,320
content and we normally do it before

00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,080
and and here we also like think about

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,880
like you know are the formats all

00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:08,799
correctly and we all know how it is like

00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,320
just showing like drupal drupalcon

00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,200
you know doing all this twitter thing

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,720
you know you have to have different

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,919
photos for twitter you have different

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,840
photos for

00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,120
facebook and linkedin and then on your

00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:21,039
website is different so like my my ux

00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,559
art director she is like creating i

00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,159
don't know how many different types of

00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,080
photos so they actually can make sense

00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,720
so you have to also when you produce the

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,840
content

00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,960
you have to go into that as well

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,200
so now comes to the to the part where we

00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:37,039
think about like okay and now we've done

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,760
all this groundwork and we are ready to

00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,480
go and

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:41,279
um what do we do then then actually we

00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,120
should

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,640
and if you're not doing it already we

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,279
should start

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,720
measuring the results and we start

00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:50,320
putting up the tracking and i am

00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,640
actually happy to see

00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,000
a couple of people from our like anya

00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,120
and rina

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,320
uh from our online marketing team they

00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,279
could actually talk a little bit more

00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,960
about this but

00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:05,279
uh so setting up the tracking is um

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,320
maybe the you know the simple thing to

00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:08,159
set it up

00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,760
so you have to add a snippet right

00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:13,039
google tag manager or something

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,880
that's the easy part but configuring it

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,720
is not an easy thing and now there is

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,120
coming something called google analytics

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,960
version 4 i've heard which is like

00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,960
completely different

00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,120
how you actually track things there

00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,279
everything is based on events

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,440
and you also need to understand how to

00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,360
use these tools being like matomo or

00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,480
being google analytics or

00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,240
being whatever you're using so you have

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,679
to think about this in a perspective or

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,080
like is there a tracking strategy

00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,399
defined for all the user journeys

00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,159
and are do we have goals like do we want

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:47,039
to measure the downloads of

00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,679
something do we want to see how people

00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,919
scroll

00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,360
down or how do we want to measure the

00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:53,039
content that we're putting on our

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,799
website

00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:59,600
um so is the data like

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,600
is it prepared for analysis so like um

00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,399
very often when we take over

00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,919
google uh accounts for example we see

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:07,360
that there is like everything is in

00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,120
there you know there's all the traffic

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,080
from everyone is in there the bots are

00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,520
just like

00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:16,240
messing up with the traffic and so on so

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,720
we need to clean that up as well and

00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,360
then

00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,919
of course based on all the data that we

00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,000
have

00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,120
we of course want to run monthly

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,559
analysis

00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:28,720
and you know we need to

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,880
gain the insights if the business goals

00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,000
of the website are being met

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,320
so we need to like create like what is a

00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,480
good

00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,000
report what should be included in the

00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,640
report

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:42,880
and um and are we actually then getting

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,039
out of it what we need so

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:47,279
looking at the last slide and seeing the

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,919
10 going back into one two three four

00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,240
five

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,080
you know four this is like where we

00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,360
start to verify

00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,720
are we doing the right thing therefore i

00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:01,200
always want to see this as a

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,559
as a you know we we cannot be out there

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,559
telling our clients that we are going to

00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,559
be doing a project for

00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,159
50 000 years and then you're gonna get

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,840
it and that has all of this

00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:13,200
and then goodbye you know we need to

00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:14,960
also in the process when we speak to our

00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,320
when we speak to our clients or if you

00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,880
are an end user

00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,919
asking an agency to work with you that

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,679
we need to like

00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:24,000
be aware of that this is an iterative

00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:26,159
process because

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,440
based on what we find out then in the

00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:30,000
end

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,200
you know were all our assumptions that

00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,640
we did in the beginning were they

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,000
correct and most likely

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,919
the answer is going to be no and we

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,679
need to then be able to like iterate on

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,320
it because we can't be

00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,440
we can't know it all beforehand so

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,480
normally we see

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,080
that after a year or so the client or

00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,720
like

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,159
eight to ten months the client comes and

00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,440
normally says like hey we need to do a

00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,799
little bit of changes we've seen like

00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,159
that this is not working and this is not

00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,760
working even though we thought it was

00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:01,440
the best idea

00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:03,600
to start with so

00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,080
prepare yourself if you're doing a

00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,720
project that you should actually like

00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:10,799
be able to iterate on it if you can so

00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,240
that's how you should actually plan your

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:16,240
your web product um

00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,440
so i always talk about it like this that

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,120
then then like

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,640
we should start small let's not try to

00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,200
like

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,840
win in the first run you know and do it

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,399
perfect

00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,080
because if we try to do that then we

00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:31,519
will probably never go live with our

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:33,120
first sight

00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,720
so let's just start small let's just

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,799
iterate on it and

00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,799
because as soon as we go a little bit

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,399
further we start realizing that like and

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,159
now i'm making the example of

00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,440
going into the content strategy again

00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,120
like that

00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,360
there are more that there's more than

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,200
whistler and barcelona

00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,039
you know we have like 50 more

00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,320
destinations to cover

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:56,640
we have 16 different languages

00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,000
we have like many many more we have the

00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,519
business travel that we have to think

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,080
about that wants to do everything

00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:03,360
quick on the website and book very many

00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,919
flights

00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,600
then we have like the expiration of

00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,360
segments

00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,559
and the expiration of segments is

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,840
something that is interesting where we

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,279
need to think about like okay the

00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,720
business traveler is interested in

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,559
barcelona today

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,080
but as soon as the person has like

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,000
bought the ticket

00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,200
the person starts to think about like

00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,320
going to

00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,840
seattle or something like that so

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,159
i'm sorry here's a little noise here but

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,960
okay

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,320
so if you start to enter it a little bit

00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,919
more there's like

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,679
then you have like of course like much

00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,960
more than only this website you also

00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:38,159
have like all of your marketing

00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,600
activities that you have to start

00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,360
thinking about you have like the

00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,159
newsletters and the ad campaigns in the

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,440
social media

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:48,240
and then you have people that like text

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,320
but i know i like reading but my husband

00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,000
he likes looking at video

00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,000
you know he wants to get information by

00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,480
looking at quick videos well i like to

00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,399
have

00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,559
all the opposite like just making fun

00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,080
you know so

00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,760
if you start to think about this like

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,720
this becomes a big

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,240
big you know you know like oh my god how

00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,080
am i gonna do it i'm only the only

00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,000
i'm only one person doing marketing in

00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,360
my company

00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,039
how am i going to accomplish this so

00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:16,240
don't worry

00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:19,600
that's why we start small and

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,120
if we figure out that we can you know

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,720
we can be smarter and do a little bit

00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,600
more than we can this actually

00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:28,399
you know we can we can get more people

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,399
to help us so

00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:35,840
this was like the first part

00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:39,440
i am going to for the q a discussion i'm

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:42,720
actually going to go back into

00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:44,000
this picture here and i would be really

00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:48,399
interesting to hear from you

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:50,720
really in you can ask questions please

00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:53,440
does anyone want to discuss something or

00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,720
ask about something

00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,679
yeah haike um yeah i would like to know

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,760
how many people

00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,760
are involved in the whole cycle

00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,399
or how many different departments

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,399
can you tell more about that

00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,520
so that of course depends really on the

00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,560
size of the project

00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:18,720
right sure um so i

00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,599
i would assume for iceland there it's a

00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:24,800
it's a probably a lot of people

00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,960
um but in a in a mid-sized

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,200
project and i would say maybe because i

00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,760
i also know your project for example

00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,320
like a

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,599
you know a big website dealing with you

00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,599
know au pairs and

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,000
and you know health being families to

00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,480
find au pairs and all this stuff

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,560
probably if you want to do that really

00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,119
successfully you would probably have at

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,240
least

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:48,480
from you know at least one person

00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:50,879
or even two people taking care of the

00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,679
first four steps

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,280
normally you have like a a one person

00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,960
doing the ux design

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,359
and then you have developers or then

00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,560
maybe you know

00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:02,960
four five six you know and then one two

00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,839
people

00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,640
in or one person doing the the tracking

00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:08,079
and so on so

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,440
i'm talking about full-time equivalent

00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,920
i'm not talking about people and it's

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,599
like

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:16,079
talking about how much effort so we see

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:17,119
that so in our how we set up our

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,320
projects

00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,560
we normally have at least like a

00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,000
a couple of days per month for online

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,119
marketing

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,040
so maybe five days per month and then

00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,960
for the first part like we try to do a

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,960
couple of workshops and these workshops

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,079
have definitely a

00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,839
you know ux designer

00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,280
content strategist or a solution

00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:42,160
architect there

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,560
that understands the business and helps

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,119
with

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,839
you know and then the development team

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,280
is of course like

00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,680
dependent it can also be like one

00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,880
developer you know it

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,880
it's difficult to say but

00:35:53,280 --> 00:36:00,720
any more questions okay thanks

00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,720
yeah christina christina hi

00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,880
hi um yeah i have a question about um

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,680
how you do

00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:09,119
the personas before you do after you do

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,280
content strategy

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:14,240
because i yeah it's it's like the hen

00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,160
act problem

00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:20,480
you mentioned later on i was like wait

00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,240
yeah i know and and i think we struggle

00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,720
a lot with this part then actually i

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,320
have

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:28,240
we have like thought about if we see

00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,240
this two put two three and four together

00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,040
of that being one thing do you know what

00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:34,160
i mean because i'm not necessarily

00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,160
you know i think you have it correct

00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,680
christina you know it's not necessarily

00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,599
i start here and go here and go here

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:42,000
okay user journey you need to do after

00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:44,480
use a persona

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,839
but i agree with you there that maybe we

00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,320
could actually put this picture a little

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,320
bit different

00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,800
yeah ifrick

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,720
um yeah i've been wondering you started

00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,880
with the different personas

00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,720
and then you mentioned the the boss of

00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,119
the company with the big ipad where you

00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,800
need to make it look right for as well

00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:07,119
and i come across that problem as well

00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,320
before that we've defined personas for

00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,040
an organization

00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,040
and then the funder comes who has a very

00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,400
specific need and they still needs to be

00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,160
targeted

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,160
does it make sense to actually then have

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,079
that kind of decision maker also as a

00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:22,960
persona at least somewhere hidden away

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:26,240
in your mind

00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:29,520
i think yes i think so

00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,960
we normally in the kick of all the way

00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,240
in the start

00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,000
we we put this on our in our it's it's

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,720
like a risk

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,079
document you know being like who is

00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,599
going to be the one who is actually

00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,200
making decisions in the end of like

00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,280
paying the bills or

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,359
or you know because and and what type of

00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,119
a person is that

00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,480
you know because that person can could

00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:54,560
can actually

00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:58,160
be really difficult in the end right yes

00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:01,760
okay thanks yeah

00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:05,839
um we had a question from

00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,839
yeah we can just

00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,359
we'll be next

00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,960
hey why can't i not have your yeah i

00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,480
know why like

00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,079
i'm trying to see how i can see your

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,520
name and

00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:25,200
anyhow hey stefan

00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:27,280
now i see your name stefan yeah um

00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,560
yeah it belongs a little bit to the

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,280
question before

00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,079
um or not yeah it's not directly a

00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,480
question but

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,680
we also have this issue sometimes for

00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,920
example

00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:43,040
that the plunder uh for this project

00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:47,280
um has some special browser needs also

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:50,720
or also the yeah

00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,839
the the marketing company which prov

00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:56,560
or which sells the ads and they have

00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,119
customers with some special browsers and

00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:00,320
so on

00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:01,920
but i think this is sometimes very

00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,920
difficult because when they use for

00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,160
example the internet explorer

00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,200
which provides not all the stuff and

00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,640
then

00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,920
we build all the necessary stuff into

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,400
the websites

00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,400
that makes them slow because all of the

00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:19,520
polyfills and so on

00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,800
and yeah after this they said oh why

00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:23,599
our website is so slow and i don't get

00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,720
why

00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:30,160
it is not possible to say to them

00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:32,560
please use a modern browser stack

00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,359
like all your visitors for the website

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,920
because

00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:37,359
you have to check your website like the

00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:39,359
most of your visitors

00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:41,119
you get for example the information for

00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:44,400
you from your tracking software

00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,680
or from your logs that you see oh your

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,280
visitors

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:52,079
are using mostly the the most common or

00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,280
yeah the latest releases of the browsers

00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,400
why you

00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,160
try to solve all the layout and

00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,440
javascript issues for the

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:04,560
old browsers for one or two people

00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,599
and yeah i think that was

00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:10,160
really horrible in some projects yeah

00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:12,160
i think and this goes actually into your

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,480
content strategy as well like we often

00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,319
see

00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,160
also the the marketing people they want

00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:18,560
to have like all these stuff like they

00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,319
they saw something on the apple website

00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,440
that does something and like all these

00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,200
great things

00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,599
but they don't have the content for it

00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,400
as well you know so we often like as

00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,160
developers

00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,760
if we are developing the thing we we

00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,599
spend a lot of time creating

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,440
something that actually nobody can

00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,720
actually use right

00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,040
so it goes into all direction did we

00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,839
have

00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,000
did sarah or did anyone else have a

00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:43,040
question

00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,440
because otherwise we can actually

00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,119
discontinue a little bit and we're gonna

00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,599
have more time for more questions is

00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:49,599
that okay

00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,000
yep i'm gonna i'm gonna think about so

00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,000
okay

00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,880
we're um where are we now like now we

00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,560
just i want to just to put the ground

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:02,880
you know like that we all have the same

00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,079
understanding of

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,880
how does how what do we define as being

00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:10,480
a good project to execute and how should

00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,720
that be done and who should be involved

00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,359
in

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:14,240
it again like to hike as question

00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,760
earlier

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,599
you know there is not necessarily always

00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,119
the budget to actually do everything

00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,720
right so maybe sometimes you have to

00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,240
start creating the website before you

00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,599
start thinking about that so you can

00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:27,839
also iterate

00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:30,560
in any direction so now i'm gonna

00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,040
go a little bit into the like a little

00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,319
bit

00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:36,000
this is like how do you say like why is

00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:37,599
it important and now i'm just going to

00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,280
talk about like a little bit of general

00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:43,359
things

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,680
um and i want to actually just take you

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:46,960
all

00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,640
back to you know if i look at the photos

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,440
here of you know maybe you will all

00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:52,640
remember this

00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:57,119
with me right when we had

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,720
tvs and back in the days when we had tvs

00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,480
they were like actually it was

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:01,280
completely controlled what we were

00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,319
allowed to see

00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,839
when depending on what was on tv and

00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,839
there were ads coming

00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,079
so you probably all remember waiting for

00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:12,240
the news coming or you remember the

00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:14,240
animation show that was before news and

00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:17,040
in between there came like

00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,560
you know the ads and i don't i sometimes

00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,240
miss it a little bit because i feel like

00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,640
i'm actually missing out of like things

00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:23,839
that i

00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,599
don't that i'm not interested in because

00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:26,560
i don't see any ads anymore i'm only on

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,200
netflix

00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,240
you know that i pay for because that's

00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,319
the life today

00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:34,240
you know everything is digital um and

00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:37,920
this is what we are actually all

00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:38,480
in this industry and what is interesting

00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,440
to see

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:44,800
is that the estimated daily tv and

00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:48,880
internet connects conception you know

00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:51,920
in 2019 more people were using

00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:55,280
internet to consume

00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,960
information than the tv and

00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,480
probably like all of you know you know i

00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,040
don't know is any one of you that

00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,640
actually

00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,240
i'm in germany and i know that many of

00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,920
you are in germany

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,000
you know does any one of you like this

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:08,319
turn on air day and you just watch it

00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,319
all day

00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,839
probably not right

00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,000
and and this is just what is happening

00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:18,079
so therefore the importance of the

00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,359
content strategy for your website or

00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,480
your rep product is

00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:25,599
getting extremely important because

00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:30,319
people users expect to see

00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:34,000
information that is relevant to them

00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:36,079
because otherwise they will just leave

00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,240
and this gets really tricky for us in

00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,720
our business because

00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,240
wow i'm gonna personalize everything how

00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,599
can i do that you know that gets even

00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,359
more complicated but

00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:46,960
this is what the users and especially

00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:49,119
the young people and i see this in my

00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,680
son he's 10 years old and

00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,520
you know i see how they are just like on

00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:55,359
the web and how they just

00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,520
if it doesn't fit them now they're just

00:43:55,359 --> 00:43:58,640
going to go and look at the next one

00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,160
and this is how they're going to be

00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,119
behaving when they come on your website

00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:06,800
too in 10 years from now

00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,280
so what do i mean by that it means like

00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,800
that

00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,119
depending on where you you know this is

00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,839
the same netflix account

00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,680
this is the netflix account of my family

00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:18,240
but when you log in as my

00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,000
son and my daughter you see what you

00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,880
have there on the left side

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,040
but when you log in as me and my husband

00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:28,319
you see what you see here on the

00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:29,839
right down so obviously like crystal and

00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,520
i we were watching the last dance there

00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,040
with michael jordan which is a great

00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,560
documentary

00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,319
and you know you see a little bit what

00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:38,720
we are interested in

00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,920
uh in the same time like the kids are

00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:41,920
watching something else so like

00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,440
we are even on the same platform we even

00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,440
go in the same place and we see

00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,359
completely different things

00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,000
of course the same goes for my spotify

00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:52,160
account obviously my daughter

00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,599
and my son they got into my account so

00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,839
therefore i get the

00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:56,800
you know the dry fragrance which is like

00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:59,839
a

00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:02,480
children's show uh but obviously like i

00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:05,280
am a little bit more interested in like

00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,960
you know some nice songs and of course

00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,640
the same thing is about my amazon

00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,599
account so everywhere i go

00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,520
things are just being targeted to me and

00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,480
and i actually i'm starting to expect

00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,160
this

00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,240
which is really weird and i don't know

00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:20,640
if you have the same feeling

00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,480
you know you you just you go there and

00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,000
you actually just expect to get the

00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,760
information that you

00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,359
want to have and this is also how you

00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,880
start to behave when you start to go on

00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,400
websites

00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,880
if you go on the website and you

00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,400
immediately i go a lot to the newspaper

00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,400
websites

00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,760
and if i if i see like something that

00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,880
i'm not interested in i just go on the

00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,319
next newspaper

00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:45,280
website um

00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:46,000
so this is something about like what is

00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,599
relevant to

00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:50,160
whom and if you look at the person and

00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:53,280
let's talk about like me generally

00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,800
you know i normally have like a general

00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,240
interest

00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:59,520
and i have a current interest so me the

00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,640
persona

00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:05,839
being like maybe 40 year old

00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:08,079
woman with a computer science background

00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:09,599
working in an agency that maybe is me as

00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:11,359
a persona

00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,800
i am like i have a general interest and

00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:14,480
my general interest is that i'm

00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,079
interested in digital strategy

00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,040
i'm interested in digitalization

00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:20,800
technology drupal course

00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,359
but the current interest is like how

00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:26,240
does co with 19 test work today

00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:27,520
because i want to travel to iceland so i

00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:29,040
want to go to iceland so actually the

00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,119
only thing i'm looking for at the moment

00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,440
is just go with 19 tests

00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:34,560
you know where do i do them can i do it

00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,640
here and then

00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,400
fly over do i have to do it in iceland

00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,640
and so on so like

00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,160
even for somebody who is a what we

00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:45,440
talked about before i'm a

00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:47,280
40 year old woman i have two kids and i

00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,359
work in an agency

00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,880
um i am certainly like interested in

00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:52,000
something that you maybe would have not

00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:55,119
expected that i'm

00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,240
interested in at the moment so that can

00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,680
change a lot

00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,839
and my current interest is probably

00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,160
going to be you know maybe the current

00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:04,640
interest a day is actually drupal

00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:06,400
if i would be really honest and like

00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,040
watching the trees not getting inspired

00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,240
by that

00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,960
and tomorrow it's going to be the co

00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:12,960
with ending test

00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,160
so what we see is like we have very many

00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,400
different stakeholders

00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,920
in this whole content strategy part and

00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,319
we have different people

00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,000
and there are three things that i want

00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,160
to give with you that you

00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,040
you i would like you know to think about

00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:29,200
in

00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:32,079
in your next web project

00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,520
number one is actually so this these

00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:35,280
graphics are taken from the city of

00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,559
reykjavik design language system so we

00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:39,200
are currently rebuilding the

00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,319
new website for the city of reykjavik

00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,280
and one thing is to

00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:44,400
we need to understand the user and we

00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:47,440
need to understand

00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,559
what is the user going to accomplish on

00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,319
our website

00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,079
that's number one that i think that we

00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:55,920
need to focus on

00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:57,760
so from being very confused of like

00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,760
you know hey where should i go and why

00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,720
is there you know how can i find this

00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:04,079
and whatever it is

00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:05,599
into being understood i come to your

00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:09,520
page

00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:11,280
and i feel being understood

00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,720
you know you are helping me it's not

00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:14,559
about me

00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,319
the websites should not be put up in a

00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:18,000
site map and folders the website should

00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:18,720
be put up in a way like how can i help

00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:21,839
you

00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:21,839
because i'm understanding you

00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,040
so this is about the understanding of

00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:28,319
the user and that's why we put the focus

00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,319
on the personas and the content strategy

00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:31,920
but we also need to understand the

00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:34,000
editor

00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,000
the person who is going to be creating

00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:38,160
the content

00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,319
because if that person does not know how

00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:43,119
to create content and how to build that

00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:45,839
up then we are not going to be able to

00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:48,800
understand the user

00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:50,880
so we need to do persona analysis on and

00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,800
like on our editors who are they what

00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,480
are their background how do they how do

00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,800
they create content like what do they

00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,720
know

00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,720
are they already do they feel

00:48:56,720 --> 00:49:00,160
comfortable with the cms system do they

00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:03,599
need training

00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:06,240
do they you know how do they feel

00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,359
and last but not the least you know we

00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,520
need to

00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:11,760
stay in budget and now i'm actually

00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:14,559
focusing on like

00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:16,480
if we we figure out the that we need to

00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,720
understand the user we need to know that

00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:18,240
we

00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:20,720
need to understand the editor who's

00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,800
using the website and creating content

00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:26,079
but this all needs to fit into some kind

00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:29,200
of a bucket that has a budget

00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:31,280
and that is the most complex part of it

00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,960
because i can say yes to everything

00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,800
which this woman is doing on the

00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:39,599
picture and i can tell and advise the

00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,079
the client to do everything we think

00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:42,400
about

00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,280
and being the most awesome you know

00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,079
having the best

00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,440
strength strategy content strategy that

00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:50,559
i've seen

00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,640
but if that doesn't fit into the budget

00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:53,760
and you know being able to be reusable

00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,839
and flexible

00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:59,839
and you know using the same elements in

00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:59,839
all savannah but then we have failed

00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:04,400
and maybe i'm missing something here

00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:07,520
maybe i'm missing some

00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:10,640
person or you know

00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:13,599
so thoughts what are you thinking what

00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:16,960
do you want to share with us

00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,960
anybody in the group

00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,000
because we're doing a workshop we need

00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:25,040
to like we need to you know

00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,040
we need to work right

00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,599
so to start doing random random

00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,599
questions here

00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:35,520
do you agree with this that or do you

00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:36,960
feel that um do you sometimes i'm

00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,040
actually curious to hear do you

00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,240
do you think about the editor of the

00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,760
website who is the

00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:43,599
the marketing person who's going to be

00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,160
creating the content do you do you think

00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:47,359
about that

00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:49,599
or yeah christina

00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:51,839
um yes but the problem is to get

00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:55,520
everyone else to think about them

00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:58,480
um from from our so from the developers

00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,680
who are like it just has to work to

00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,960
actually the customer

00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:05,359
itself himself because often

00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:06,720
the editors in the end are not the ones

00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:10,079
who are

00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:13,599
initializing a project so they are not

00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:15,200
thinking about it we i mean we try to

00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:17,359
get into contact with them

00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,839
so with the editors to get this

00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:22,400
information but it can be really hard

00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:24,559
sometimes

00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,920
yeah and you're you're working uh so

00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:27,520
you're also working for an atc you're

00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,280
actually doing very similar things that

00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:32,400
what i'm doing at work right

00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,400
yes yes

00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:37,200
yeah you're can i see your face do you

00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:39,760
want to share something with us jurgen

00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:40,400
i think talking about ages there are

00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,440
probably

00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:46,800
two aspects to that one because

00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:51,200
um one one component is

00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:54,000
understanding the workflow for editors

00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:56,079
and the second piece is understanding uh

00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,720
where they are coming from personally so

00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,720
what

00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:02,160
skill level do they have what experience

00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:02,160
do they have with technology

00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:08,400
and i think to be honest

00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,119
most of the time we expect editors to

00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,599
learn

00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,920
with regards to the second aspect so if

00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:17,040
they are not capable yet

00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:19,839
or not experienced yet

00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,880
uh most of the time they are expected to

00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:23,920
learn

00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:26,240
but what's also important is you know

00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,680
uh what is the benefit what is the

00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,319
purpose of their role

00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,119
so where do they get the information

00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:35,359
from

00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:37,599
how quickly do they have to publish

00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:39,280
what are the components where you know

00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:41,280
how do they have to prepare

00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,040
is there a review process and all that

00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:44,800
sort of stuff and i think that's equally

00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:47,839
important

00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,839
to their personal skills

00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:55,440
yep 100 and

00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:57,200
efric yeah i also think um

00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,680
actually concentrating on the editor

00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,280
experience is an important step for most

00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:03,040
of the sites i'm working on

00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,559
because they're quite often the people

00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:07,440
that use the site

00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:08,720
daily or several times a week where most

00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:12,079
of the visitors come

00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:13,359
much less often so taking into account

00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:15,440
that what we're doing is actually

00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:17,440
building a tool that they have to spend

00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,440
their eight hour work day with

00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,800
i think it's really important so

00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,440
therefore also creating

00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:25,359
extra admin pages to be able to do their

00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:28,240
job

00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:31,040
and reducing the amount of onboarding

00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:32,960
that the editor needs especially when

00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,319
um you might have worked with an editor

00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,839
they know how it works

00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:37,520
and then they go on holiday or they have

00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,160
new staff and they don't get that

00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,240
training

00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,920
and you come back to the site like

00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,200
sometimes half a year or a year later

00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,800
and you realize that they haven't

00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,680
actually used one of the things that you

00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:47,280
built

00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:49,920
because the next editor didn't even know

00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,200
it existed so i think editor experience

00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:54,160
is a very important

00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,160
persona as well

00:53:54,800 --> 00:54:00,480
i think that's so you're so much echoing

00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,000
stuff that we are hearing and we are

00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:05,280
experiencing

00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,480
uh and some and sometimes i feel like

00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:08,079
that

00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,760
i actually feel like that the editor is

00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:12,559
the one that we forget that

00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,280
quick like that we tend to forget very

00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,480
quickly

00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:18,319
or not forget is not think about and uh

00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:21,359
and i sometimes even even i would

00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:25,119
sometimes like to send the developers

00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:28,400
to let them create content

00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:29,760
so like as a as like a like

00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,359
what are you building why are you

00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:33,680
building it like this like have you have

00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:36,079
you ever tried to use it

00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:37,359
that's actually what um what we're

00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:39,359
trying to do is that

00:54:37,359 --> 00:54:40,880
the content that goes into the test site

00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,440
is real content

00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,400
and if that means you're copying content

00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,839
from for example

00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,079
an existing site when you build a new

00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:48,960
one they actually know what's going in

00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:50,799
there

00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,160
it's not a lower ips bit that you can

00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:54,160
copy or

00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:56,079
just typing in a few keys it's the okay

00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,760
yes this really needs

00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:00,079
pictures that are sometimes in portrait

00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,559
and sometimes in landscape or so and

00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:04,000
actually spending the time and putting

00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:06,160
that in

00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,920
in an earlier step i think usually gives

00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,720
quite a good feedback already as well

00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,160
from the

00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:15,520
from the developer to the developer

00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:18,640
yep 100

00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:21,680
so advice uh

00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:24,319
give your developers uh assignments

00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:26,880
sometimes to create like content

00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:27,680
clara are you i see that you're chatting

00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,680
clara

00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:33,119
do you want to share something with us

00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:36,319
yes in fact working with the editors is

00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:38,000
is hard as long as you're um you don't

00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:39,359
have a minimum viable product to show

00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,079
them and to to go to

00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:43,760
it's with them so we're just one week

00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:46,839
ago we showed the first

00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:51,520
iterations of our drupal 8 website with

00:55:46,839 --> 00:55:54,079
paragraphs and yeah it's it's a huge

00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,960
distance between the ux designers who

00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:57,680
have made

00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,839
have ideas for how to use this type of

00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:02,160
content this blog this blog and

00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:03,520
yeah they had talked with editors about

00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,839
it

00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:07,200
but they hadn't accomplished anything in

00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:09,520
preparing them for the fact that they

00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,960
would have to use paragraphs

00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,119
so you have this content type you have

00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:15,440
this paragraph in it and yeah

00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:16,319
we'll have to hide the title from the

00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,920
paragraph

00:56:16,319 --> 00:56:19,760
because for them it's impossible to have

00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:25,359
two titles and

00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:25,359
work with that and yeah we're making um

00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:30,160
we're going to make a book for them a

00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,680
recipe book for how to make pages

00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:35,359
because otherwise it won't

00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:36,079
work yeah so what the designers made

00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:38,799
will have to

00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:40,160
translate that for them and to give us a

00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:41,920
little bit of context so you're you're

00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,200
working for the flemish government so

00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,960
yes we're working for the flemish

00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,920
government we have already moved our

00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:47,920
internet and extra

00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,240
to drupal 8. so now we're doing the

00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:53,040
website and so the

00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,920
content team which is the biggest team

00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,440
uh

00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,200
working on that they have they'll have

00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,799
to prepare for

00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,880
doing their content work in drupal 8

00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:02,720
there'll be lots of personalization

00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:05,119
so we'll need those paragraphs to be

00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,520
able to put in the right widgets into

00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:08,559
the

00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:11,920
content so yeah exactly

00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:14,640
so i feel like yeah christina um

00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,920
actually about um introducing paragraphs

00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:19,119
i actually saw a

00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:20,240
session yesterday about sketching where

00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:23,760
they basically

00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:27,040
went and had a workshop

00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:29,040
and used index cards as paragraphs

00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:30,160
and tried to build websites with the

00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,960
editors

00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:34,880
to introducing the concept of how to do

00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,400
that

00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,400
and then this was this was happening

00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:41,200
yesterday interval con yes

00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,160
it's oh that's nice i think in the

00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,760
afternoon um

00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:45,520
i think at three or something i'm not

00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:49,200

00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,640
i wanna like i thought i really i i

00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:54,720
thank you

00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,839

00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,040
to come in also

00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,720
because this is exactly how we need to

00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,720
have these sessions because we need to

00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,640
learn from each other so it's going to

00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:09,119
be a two hour thing

00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:10,160
so we have already been now for one hour

00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:12,240
here and i'm gonna

00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,680
allow just everybody just to stretch

00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:17,040
yourself you know

00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:18,559
so let's take like a maximum five minute

00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,280
break i'm gonna be here still you know

00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:22,960
so like

00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:24,720
let's take a little break and uh

00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,799
you know so you can go and grab yourself

00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:29,200
water or take a break

00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:29,839
just you know and let's see each other

00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,079
here in

00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:33,920
four or five minutes is that okay it's

00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:36,799
now quarter past

00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:38,240
the hour so we're gonna be in 20 past

00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:39,839
and we're gonna start the deep diving

00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:43,200
into the user persona

00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:51,839
okay suck it see you in a bit

00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:51,839
have yourself water or something else

01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:37,280
so we're starting again in like two

01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:40,000
three minutes so therefore

01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:43,839
if you if anyone is doing now then

01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,839
you're just taking a small break

01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:50,319
and i actually realized that i could

01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,400
actually show you something more from

01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:53,040
what i was talking about in the drupal

01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:56,960
con

01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:59,119
global so that was

01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:11,839
browsing around so two two two three

01:00:59,119 --> 01:01:11,839
more minutes

01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:34,559
so is anyone else also this missing just

01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:36,000
having a little coffee break and just

01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:37,280
chat with somebody else

01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:40,960
like the coffee breaks are getting

01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,960
really silent right right

01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:48,640
yeah but the the hallway track sessions

01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,640
are certainly enjoyable

01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:53,599
talking to some people and then five

01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:56,240
minutes talking to the next group of

01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:56,240
people so

01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,960
yeah that's replaced the coffee breaks i

01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:03,119
think

01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:04,720
yeah so we we changed it actually so

01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:06,160
yesterday i don't know if you noticed it

01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,599
probably you did like yesterday the

01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:10,640
hallway track was like a

01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:12,640
15-minute thing and pre-defined groups

01:02:10,640 --> 01:02:15,839
and stuff so

01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:17,440
um that was like a you know we we said

01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:19,119
like yesterday i think the koni team

01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:21,520
said like we need to change this and

01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:22,400
and then they today it has been much

01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:24,880
more fun

01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:26,720
i tried one and it was like only the

01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:29,440
plus four years through

01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:32,400
four years and i was alone i tried the

01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:32,400
second time i was still

01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:37,599
it takes a moment alone the rest of the

01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:40,400
people appear in the

01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:42,960
in the group so you need a little bit of

01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,960
patience

01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:48,000
um i'm actually just preparing a couple

01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,760
of things because i think like it's

01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:53,200
sometimes good to see that

01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:54,799
um when we have like interactive things

01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,880
that we can also a little bit

01:02:54,799 --> 01:02:58,240
change around them yeah see now i don't

01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,240
even have an access

01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:03,119
so dieco if you can give me access

01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:05,760
somehow then let me know

01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:06,160
um but we're just going to start again

01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:09,680
and i

01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:13,599
see that peter is he just

01:03:09,680 --> 01:03:15,599
landed he said and we have already

01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:17,039
talked about general information of how

01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:20,160
to execute

01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:21,920
web projects and we've talked about how

01:03:20,160 --> 01:03:23,200
white content strategy is important and

01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:27,359
now we're going to

01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:30,240
start looking at user personas

01:03:27,359 --> 01:03:32,480
user journeys and content templates and

01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:33,760
uh

01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:35,119
we need to do that a little bit quick so

01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,640
i'm actually going to do it a little bit

01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:38,480
quick through the user personas

01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:40,079
and for the reason why many of you

01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,359
actually raised your hand and you said

01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:44,240
that you have already

01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:46,079
experienced with it and i have a lot of

01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:48,240
content on it

01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:49,680
so i am actually going to go into the

01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:51,839
content that i think it is

01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:53,440
uh important and let me start a little

01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:56,799
bit still in the

01:03:53,440 --> 01:04:00,480
in the beginning here so let's look at

01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:04,160
a user personas this is like a

01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:06,640
it's very big kazi in front of me here

01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:07,440
so a buyer persona is actually a same

01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:10,079
fictional pers

01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,280
represents representation of your ideal

01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,119
customer based on

01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:14,880
market research and real data about your

01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:18,880
existing customers

01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:20,319
so like i told you before a persona is

01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:23,839
not like

01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:25,599
you know buddy who is 40 year old and

01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:28,240
whoever i am

01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:30,160
actually it is a person that is maybe

01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:32,559
four-year-old and

01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:34,960
it is a person who has this type of a

01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:38,319
background and so on

01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:40,480
so the reason why we do it is

01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:42,880
it it is because it provides you

01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:44,880
structure and context for your company

01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:46,240
to make it easier for you to map out

01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,920
content

01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:51,280
and um to achieve like

01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,760
you know the the stuff that you need to

01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:56,799
do for for your your

01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:59,119
website and so on so

01:04:56,799 --> 01:05:01,520
using the time to learn about your ideal

01:04:59,119 --> 01:05:05,039
customer and think about this as well

01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:05,839
you know spend time on figuring out your

01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:08,960
ideal

01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:10,480
persona but you should also think about

01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:13,039
the persona that you maybe want to

01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,839
spend less time on so you also like you

01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:15,839
they are

01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:17,440
differently important for you as a

01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:19,520
company

01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:21,760
so you think about their challenges

01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:24,960
their goals their

01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:26,799
situation and so on and

01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:28,880
that actually helps you to set the

01:05:26,799 --> 01:05:29,839
strategy around like who do you want to

01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:33,920
focus the most

01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:37,920
on and who is going to be in the

01:05:33,920 --> 01:05:40,880
end your top persona and it will

01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:43,119
sometimes surprise you that uh when you

01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:45,520
go through these exercises

01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:46,559
that the persona that you will end up

01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:48,400
with

01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:49,680
that's maybe not necessarily the persona

01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:52,079
that you are actually today creating

01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:54,319
content for

01:05:52,079 --> 01:05:55,839
so how many personas should you have uh

01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:58,079
depending on your business you could

01:05:55,839 --> 01:06:00,000
have like one or two personas

01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,599
uh you could also like have ten or

01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:05,200
twenty like we looked at the uni

01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:07,359
in the iceland there but

01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,240
if you're just new to it start small

01:06:07,359 --> 01:06:11,520
start with

01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:13,839
doing two three personas for your

01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:14,880
project and don't worry you can always

01:06:13,839 --> 01:06:18,319
develop more

01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:21,760
and add to it

01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:25,520
so like i said before you know

01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:27,680
um you you want to maybe do

01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,280
this ideal one and the negative one so

01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,640
you want to actually think about it in

01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:32,240
both ways you want to think about like

01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:34,079
who is the one that you want to

01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:35,680
engage with get you know engaged with

01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:37,039
your company but you also maybe want to

01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:40,079
think about like

01:06:37,039 --> 01:06:42,319
who do you not that much want to

01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:44,319
you know have as a customer if that is

01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:47,359
the case

01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:48,799
so how to use this

01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:51,119
this will allow you to create the

01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:53,760
content that appeals to

01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:56,240
them which is hopefully your target

01:06:53,760 --> 01:07:00,400
audience

01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:02,720
so i don't know about you like you know

01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,520
it depends on the project what you want

01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:06,720
to look at like

01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:07,520
does education matter you know sometimes

01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:09,839
it does

01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:11,359
sometimes it doesn't does it matter

01:07:09,839 --> 01:07:13,599
where the person is coming from doesn't

01:07:11,359 --> 01:07:17,039
matter if it is a man or a

01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:19,920
or a woman or unidentified

01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:20,240
doesn't matter the age it really depends

01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,400
on

01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:24,400
your project so

01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:28,240
think about that in the beginning what

01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:30,880
actually is important for you

01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:32,559
and what is it that you want to focus on

01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:34,799
and i can show you the personas that we

01:07:32,559 --> 01:07:37,200
have developed for our company

01:07:34,799 --> 01:07:38,400
and we are again like a digital agency

01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:42,880
so we are creating

01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:44,319
um web projects for end users

01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:46,240
so what you are going to do too you're

01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:49,920
going to give the personas a name

01:07:46,240 --> 01:07:54,079
and we refer to the names a lot so

01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:57,680
when we prepare stuff for drupal europe

01:07:54,079 --> 01:08:00,319
we actually we focus on

01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:02,240
uh saying like for whom is it and we

01:08:00,319 --> 01:08:05,359
actually have two personas

01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:07,760
in mind when we create a marketing

01:08:05,359 --> 01:08:09,680
material for drupalcon europe

01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,799
so one of the personas that we have is

01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:13,839
called david

01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:16,239
and he's the senior developer

01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:18,480
in a company you know maybe the flemish

01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:20,319
government i'm looking at clara here

01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,679
and he's actually coming to like one of

01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:22,880
our sessions like this and he gets

01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:24,640
really interested in the technical

01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,560
things that we are doing and therefore

01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:27,759
he goes back to clara and says the clara

01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,880
hey clara we need to work with one

01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:31,120
ex-internet

01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:33,199
so so we when we think about how we do a

01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:34,799
marketing material for our company

01:08:33,199 --> 01:08:36,560
for drupalcon europe for example we

01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:38,400
think about the personas

01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,679
so it's not just about for your website

01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:42,319
but it's also for like

01:08:39,679 --> 01:08:44,560
how do you do things so in that case

01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:48,960
david is an important one for us

01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:51,279
or robert robert is the head of i.t um

01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,880
and we also have really cool women as

01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:55,920
our personas

01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,400
they are actually the the ones that you

01:08:55,920 --> 01:08:58,480
know the

01:08:56,400 --> 01:09:01,839
in charge of like a business development

01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:04,480
in the pro in the company and so on so

01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:06,640
uh you need to choose like a gender and

01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:09,279
age or you can do that it makes like

01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:10,799
it's it's like it's gets it's just

01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:13,839
easier so like

01:09:10,799 --> 01:09:14,319
you know what we try to like avoid was

01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:16,880
like

01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,480
an unintentional gender or aids biases

01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:20,080
and stereotyping

01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:22,880
well the two examples that i gave you

01:09:20,080 --> 01:09:26,239
they were both like very stereotyping

01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:28,719
examples but uh tamara she is actually a

01:09:26,239 --> 01:09:32,080
developer too who is actually attending

01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:35,600
drupalcon and is one of our developer

01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:38,480
who is one of our personas as well

01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:39,279
so we choose a name and we talk about

01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:42,319
the

01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:43,759
we research like you know

01:09:42,319 --> 01:09:45,359
what it is that the person is doing and

01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:47,040
let's just go and look at it we define

01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:48,960
the strengths and the weaknesses of them

01:09:47,040 --> 01:09:52,000
and we actually do a

01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:55,120
visualization of that person

01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:58,560
and we put it the best would be in one a

01:09:55,120 --> 01:10:02,080
a4 like one document one pdf

01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,840
so this is an example that could be a

01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:06,560
persona

01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:08,159
so this could be this is not a persona

01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,560
for our company this is just a random

01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:13,520
photo that i found somewhere online

01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:14,239
so a persona could be the name george

01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:17,679
he's

01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:19,040
a age 31 interest in food travel and

01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:22,159
communities

01:10:19,040 --> 01:10:23,840
loves cooking homemade food goal is to

01:10:22,159 --> 01:10:26,400
help others to learn how to cook

01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:28,800
and he's good in connecting with others

01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:31,040
and he's tolerant and he's a little bit

01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:33,520
vulnerable to criticism and too selfless

01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:33,520
and so on

01:10:33,679 --> 01:10:38,000
i put a link here to hubspot.com make my

01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,520
persona

01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,280
and i actually encourage you i'm going

01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:43,840
to show you that briefly

01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:46,880
before we go into robert who is actually

01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,880
one of our personas

01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:50,800
i'm going to show you this because

01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:58,000
this is just a really cute tool

01:10:55,360 --> 01:11:00,159
that helps you to make this a little bit

01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,600
nicer

01:11:00,159 --> 01:11:03,840
i'm going to give you the link here in

01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,640
the chat if you don't have graphic

01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:07,120
designers

01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,880
in your company then this like does it a

01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,960
little bit so i want to like make my i

01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:13,040
want to build my persona

01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,880
so i can give it here a name it could be

01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:18,000
here butty

01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:20,640
the avatar is this here

01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,040
and then i go to the next step and so on

01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:25,040
and i

01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:26,640
say like how old this buddy and you know

01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:28,400
what is she doing and so when i go

01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:30,640
through this and in the end you actually

01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:32,080
you know you end up with a persona that

01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:35,840
you could use in your company that

01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:37,199
looks like this so this is just a really

01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,440
nice tool that you can do

01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:41,040
if you don't have graphic designers to

01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,960
work with

01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:44,320
and you can build it up so check that

01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,000
out there are probably more tools out

01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:49,679
there if you know about any

01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:51,840
let us know so

01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:54,000
that is how you build up your personas

01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:56,480
and i am going to show you two personas

01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:59,840
that i just took randomly from our

01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:02,960
persona um analysis for

01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:04,880
our company and we are a digital agency

01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:07,440
and maybe some of you are also working

01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:10,000
in a digital agency

01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:11,120
so this is a persona that we are really

01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,920
familiar to

01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:15,280
so robert is the head of i.t he's a male

01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:17,520
45 year old

01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:18,400
has a bachelor degree in i.t 20-year

01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:22,080
experience

01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:23,840
married teenagers he is actually the

01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:26,880
single point of failure for the iit

01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:29,600
operation in the company and he

01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:30,400
you know he doesn't like to take risks

01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:33,360
and

01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:34,880
his challenges and this is again like

01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:36,320
focused on our company as one

01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:38,159
ex-internet

01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:40,000
so his challenges are actually he's

01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:40,480
spending too much time on solving urgent

01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:43,440
i.t

01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:45,520
problems he has an aging infrastructure

01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:46,719
he's lacking resources he's not having

01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:49,360
budget

01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:50,000
he's lacking reliable i.t suppliers

01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:52,880
which is

01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,320
like ours he has too many requirements

01:12:52,880 --> 01:12:56,080
from too many departments

01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:57,679
and he is actually having lack of

01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,199
investment from management

01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:01,199
you know the management thinks about him

01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:03,280
as being like yeah this is just i.t

01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:05,280
you know like he just gets this money

01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:08,400
what he has but but he is like

01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:10,080
living in this digital world so

01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:11,840
his goals are actually to find a

01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:14,159
reliable partner to work with

01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:16,159
to outsource some of his work to

01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:18,560
decrease his stress level

01:13:16,159 --> 01:13:21,440
to stabilize and simplify his iot

01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:24,640
operations and modernize it

01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:26,320
so we also put out our metrics matters

01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,280
being like what is this technology

01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:29,280
understanding so

01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:30,880
when we build content for him what you

01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:32,560
know does it have to be like a high

01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:35,520
quality technology

01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:37,760
driven content or you know experience

01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,800
decision powers obviously like he he's

01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,239
normally

01:13:38,800 --> 01:13:42,000
the one who actually can just say like

01:13:40,239 --> 01:13:45,280
this is what i need and he gets

01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,280
he will be listened to

01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:49,120
relatively conservative budget he has

01:13:48,239 --> 01:13:51,520
like in the middle

01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:52,960
somewhere friendliness you know hey he's

01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:57,360
just so he's like

01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:58,719
turning up fires he's just you know like

01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:01,840
what do you say turning off fires

01:13:58,719 --> 01:14:04,239
everywhere so extremely

01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:06,640
tired in that sense but he has a lot of

01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:07,920
organizational impact and

01:14:06,640 --> 01:14:09,920
and in this case we were talking about a

01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:11,679
medium-sized company he reports to the

01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:13,840
ceo he has a team

01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:15,679
and he has responsibilities and this is

01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:16,640
how you actually contact him and reach

01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:20,080
him

01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:20,800
so this is important for us to see and

01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:23,520
understand

01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:26,480
like where are we going to reach this

01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:28,560
person if we want to reach to him

01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:30,400
you know so most likely because

01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:33,760
depending on how you looked at it

01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:34,400
robert is just too busy turning off

01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,239
fires

01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:38,000
so probably he's not going to be hanging

01:14:36,239 --> 01:14:40,640
out on on twitter

01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,320
like you know doing he's just like he's

01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:44,480
reading the newspaper in the morning

01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:46,159
he's looking at this one tech thing and

01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,800
then he maybe goes to one two

01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:50,159
conferences

01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:52,320
that's where we need to reach to him

01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:54,159
so i'm gonna show you another example of

01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:54,880
persona in our company and i hope that

01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:56,480
you

01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:59,199
you know again here you know this is a

01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:00,880
work we're trying to do a workshop but

01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:02,800
you know like it's not so easy to do a

01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:03,440
workshop try to imagine this for your

01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:05,120
company and

01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:06,880
you will get access to all these slides

01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:08,239
so you can copy this

01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:09,920
and you can try to go through these

01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:11,440
exercises and i really encourage all of

01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:15,840
you to do that after the

01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:19,280
yeah after the workshop

01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:20,320
so here we have frank and frank is also

01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:23,520
in a in a

01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:25,760
position in his company you know that

01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:28,000
he's ahead of marketing

01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:29,679
and really interestingly we see both

01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:30,560
these personas that come to us it's the

01:15:29,679 --> 01:15:32,239
iit person

01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,920
the head of it and it is the head of

01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:34,480
marketing and they are completely

01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:37,760
different

01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:39,520
wow they are so different because the

01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:40,880
you know the frank is thinking about

01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,920
leads lead growth

01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:46,800
you know getting better you know

01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:47,840
change you know make fast decisions so

01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:50,640
if we look at

01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:52,719
um him he he needs to look at the

01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:56,239
challenges and the goals

01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:58,560
he needs to like make fast decisions

01:15:56,239 --> 01:15:59,840
create customer-centric focus on for the

01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,679
organization you know

01:15:59,840 --> 01:16:03,600
stay on top of the fast changing world

01:16:01,679 --> 01:16:05,920
he needs to be like

01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:07,679
finding you know and finding keeping

01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:08,960
good employees because everything goes

01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:11,760
so quick

01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:12,400
enable internal team and deliver the

01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:14,800
best

01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:16,159
results so he's normally like being

01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,960
focused on the kpis

01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:21,520
and like you know it's like completely

01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:24,880
different from robert

01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:28,000
and his skills are just like to

01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:30,480
know his goals sorry are about like

01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:31,760
you know executing the successful

01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:33,600
campaigns and like

01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:35,199
reach their personal bonuses and this is

01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:38,480
how we often see this

01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:41,840
this type tick so when we talk

01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:42,880
to this persona we need to like talk a

01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:44,880
lot about like

01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:47,840
how quick do you get to results and

01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:50,560
arrow eyes and we need to like approach

01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:51,520
if we want to reach to this person or

01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:53,280
persona

01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:56,080
we need to speak to him completely

01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:58,719
different from how we speak to robert

01:16:56,080 --> 01:17:00,400
for robert we need to show like that we

01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:02,960
are

01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:05,199
we are calm and we are trustworthy we

01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:08,239
are going to help in a system but

01:17:05,199 --> 01:17:08,960
for frank we need to be like we are

01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:10,640
quick

01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:12,800
we think for you we are going to be like

01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:16,880
enabling you you're going to have like

01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:19,120
200 growth in next year

01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:20,320
so in both cases like they both go on

01:17:19,120 --> 01:17:23,760
our website and they

01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:25,440
but they come completely different to us

01:17:23,760 --> 01:17:27,440
and we're gonna look at that in the user

01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:30,239
journey how do they

01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:32,159
how do they reach to us so for example

01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:34,480
uh frank

01:17:32,159 --> 01:17:35,920
you know he's like he's reading all the

01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:37,600
blogs and he's on linkedin

01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:39,199
and he's on facebook instagram

01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,880
everywhere you know that's where

01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:43,120
he is because he is trying to keep up

01:17:40,880 --> 01:17:45,520
with the pace

01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:47,600
while while robert is not robert is much

01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:50,400
more conservative

01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:52,640
in a way of like you know having less

01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,640
time

01:17:52,719 --> 01:17:57,520
so that that is about like personas i

01:17:56,239 --> 01:17:58,800
hope that you know

01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:01,920
we're going a little bit quick through

01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:03,920
this but um i actually want to check if

01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:06,640
if i can actually look at the person not

01:18:03,920 --> 01:18:06,640
that we have

01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:11,679
i can't find it i have like a i have a

01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:14,000
persona also for

01:18:11,679 --> 01:18:16,560
for the conference drupalcon but you can

01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:18,880
maybe imagine that's a senior developer

01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,640
and if we look at the senior developer

01:18:18,880 --> 01:18:22,239
or the junior developer or

01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:24,960
you know whatever developer there is

01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:27,360
like they also take very differently

01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:29,840
so they want to learn they want to grow

01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:32,239
so developers normally want to like

01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:34,000
you know so we need to show them that

01:18:32,239 --> 01:18:35,600
that they can if they join our company

01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,040
that they will they will grow and we

01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:40,400
will help them to grow in their

01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:43,600
job and so on

01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:46,000
so any questions about this a lot of

01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,000
content

01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:55,840
any thoughts because we yeah

01:18:57,199 --> 01:19:04,320
is this exercise saying

01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:08,400
a small company is this about

01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:10,239
my clients and the people that my client

01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:13,199
is going to be serving

01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:14,880
is this about the people that i want to

01:19:13,199 --> 01:19:18,800
serve as an agency

01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:20,840
or both and in particular

01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:22,880
i want to know especially if you're a

01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:26,080
small organization

01:19:22,880 --> 01:19:29,440
should you like think and

01:19:26,080 --> 01:19:30,320
have different personas even beyond what

01:19:29,440 --> 01:19:33,840
you

01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:35,440
currently have like like thinking in

01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:38,640
growing your business

01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:40,239
yeah so in

01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:42,640
in this case these are just real

01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:45,679
personas for our business for

01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:46,960
for our my company like our company 1x

01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:50,320
internet

01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:52,159
and so when we are trying to like sell

01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:54,719
our services or we are trying to get

01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:57,040
like more clients or

01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:58,719
you know that's how we look at it from

01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:02,320
our perspective

01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:04,080
so you know even though depending on

01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:06,800
your size like

01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:08,800
you know it you know normally like there

01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:12,159
is somebody that you are talking to or

01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:14,080
who is your ideal customer right

01:20:12,159 --> 01:20:15,199
so for us like we normally speak either

01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,120
to a cto

01:20:15,199 --> 01:20:18,239
or somebody in the it or we speak to

01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:21,920
somebody in the

01:20:18,239 --> 01:20:25,120
in the marketing department um

01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:27,520
so thinking about like you know

01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:29,040
you know maybe say you know the flemish

01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:30,000
government flemish government would be

01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:33,360
like

01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:34,960
the persona is the the person who has

01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:38,159
children going to school and needs

01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:41,600
school service or there's like a

01:20:38,159 --> 01:20:43,920
somebody who needs like for

01:20:41,600 --> 01:20:45,280
you know the old elderly people or

01:20:43,920 --> 01:20:47,440
wherever it is like

01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:50,560
just depending on who you are does that

01:20:47,440 --> 01:20:50,560
answer your question where is you

01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:56,159
yes yes i was trying to get a sense of

01:20:54,480 --> 01:20:57,840
from which perspective you're writing

01:20:56,159 --> 01:21:01,840
the person

01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:03,920
thank you yeah so this is exactly from

01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:04,960
these two personas are real personas for

01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:09,199
our company

01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:12,880
so i'm actually so if you look at the

01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:15,840
um let's see the reykjavik

01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:15,840
so we have the

01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:20,400
uh where is it it's the hana or is it a

01:21:19,440 --> 01:21:24,320
sign

01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:24,320
maybe the echo here in the corners

01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:31,199
designed that's a zero height

01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:31,920
so in in the city of reykjavik like this

01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:34,400
is already

01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,440
public and and so i know it is an

01:21:34,400 --> 01:21:37,760
icelandic but

01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:39,280
uh so in the city of reykjavik we can

01:21:37,760 --> 01:21:40,880
actually somewhere here

01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:43,280
find in the design system that they're

01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:45,520
doing we can find actually the personas

01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:49,600
that they are using

01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:49,600
and uh where are they

01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:53,120
so for the city of reykjavik we would

01:21:52,719 --> 01:21:57,440
hear

01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:59,440
here is so

01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:01,520
a little bit like maybe i can translate

01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:04,480
this i'm going to show you this real

01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:04,480
personas here

01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:13,040
no it doesn't translate too bad

01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:14,320
but if you just look at this one here

01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:16,639
you have uh

01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:17,920
in this case one two three four five six

01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:20,560
seven eight nine

01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:22,480
yeah yeah 10 11 personas and friedrich

01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:25,840
is for example

01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:26,560
you know 50 years old married has three

01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,840
children

01:22:26,560 --> 01:22:31,440
has like a father that is uh has a

01:22:29,840 --> 01:22:34,159
disability

01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:36,159
and wants to do some new work at home or

01:22:34,159 --> 01:22:39,040
like you know wants to build something

01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:40,960
and he's going to connect to the city of

01:22:39,040 --> 01:22:43,760
reykjavik because he needs to like get a

01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:46,080
building permit or whatever it is

01:22:43,760 --> 01:22:47,360
then you have like etta she's like an

01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:50,000
elderly woman

01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:50,480
and she wants to like find out things

01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,880
what

01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:55,679
can seniors do in the city of reykjavik

01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:58,560
as a senior so

01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:59,040
if you go here here's actually sikki

01:22:58,560 --> 01:23:03,120
sikki

01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:06,159
is like even 90 years old and

01:23:03,120 --> 01:23:09,280
he is also like needs like um

taxi or like help to get around

01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:14,239
and because he wants to be independent

01:23:12,639 --> 01:23:16,719
you know and then you have isaac here

01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:18,239
he's four years old and isaac is even a

01:23:16,719 --> 01:23:19,840
persona

01:23:18,239 --> 01:23:21,360
isak is like he just started

01:23:19,840 --> 01:23:24,719
kindergarten

01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:26,239
and you know and he also like

01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:27,760
you know is maybe not gonna go directly

01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:29,360
on the website but he's definitely a

01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:30,639
persona that the city of reykjavik needs

01:23:29,360 --> 01:23:32,719
to think about like

01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:34,320
you know how can at least his parents or

01:23:32,719 --> 01:23:35,199
some of them are going to be his parents

01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,440
here

01:23:35,199 --> 01:23:39,760
then you have here gudeni who is like a

01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:41,520
you know so

01:23:39,760 --> 01:23:42,880
to make it short like these are just

01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:44,639
examples of

01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:46,840
you know it's really nice to visualize

01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:49,440
these personas

01:23:46,840 --> 01:23:52,159
um i hope this

01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,639
ideas like helps a little bit here's ore

01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:55,679
he's

01:23:52,639 --> 01:23:58,320
uh uses a wheelchair

01:23:55,679 --> 01:23:59,600
and he's going to university 23 years

01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:02,080
old and

01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,679
and when when the city of reykjavik is

01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:05,760
building content they are always keeping

01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:08,480
these people in mind like for whom am i

01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,480
doing it for

01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:15,280
yeah so sorry if you're in

01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:16,159
in a company or a part of government as

01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:18,400
a specific

01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:20,080
group of people that you work for as a

01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,120
city you have to work for everybody in

01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:23,600
the city which is very

01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:24,960
large it's they have need so many

01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:27,040
personas

01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,719
for example i work for a part of the

01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:29,120
flemish government that works for people

01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:31,679
who

01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:32,560
need the job and people who need people

01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:35,120
yes and

01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:36,800
it's very more specific like or you're

01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:37,280
searching for a job or you're searching

01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,600
for

01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:41,520
education to get a job or you're some

01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:44,719
company that needs people

01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:46,880
so it's like exactly smaller so

01:24:44,719 --> 01:24:48,480
yeah i know and for the city of

01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:50,480
reykjavik this work has been going on

01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:52,320
for more than a year now just to do the

01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:53,679
content strategy before they actually

01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:56,480
started to work on the website

01:24:53,679 --> 01:24:56,960
so efric you had a question too um yeah

01:24:56,480 --> 01:24:59,440
because

01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:01,199
on the one hand yes the personas will

01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:03,040
will help a lot in actually getting

01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:05,600
different types of users

01:25:03,040 --> 01:25:06,400
like and to to keep in mind that they

01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,239
are there

01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,920
but how do you avoid kind of falling

01:25:08,239 --> 01:25:13,760
into stereotypes

01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:16,960
and or maybe having a too small

01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:18,719
too small base of of personas

01:25:16,960 --> 01:25:20,719
is there a good way of making sure that

01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:24,639
you really catch

01:25:20,719 --> 01:25:29,040
also users that you hadn't slaughtered

01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:29,040
yeah you normally find that out

01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:33,760
so i'm actually going to show you what

01:25:32,239 --> 01:25:36,800
happened to us

01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:39,040
so we did like so working on a persona

01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:41,600
takes for us like at least a day it took

01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:43,679
us for each persona in our company

01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:45,280
like it was two of us and we just were

01:25:43,679 --> 01:25:47,280
brainstorming about robert and we

01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:48,800
disagreed with some things and and you

01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:50,000
know had like our arguments about if

01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:53,120
robert was really

01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,800
the right person for us and so on then

01:25:53,120 --> 01:25:55,280
what happened is that we had six of

01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:57,199
those

01:25:55,280 --> 01:25:59,280
or something like that and when we start

01:25:57,199 --> 01:26:01,120
to do the user journey

01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:02,800
we start to realize that we could

01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:05,120
actually start to merge the personas

01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:05,120
again

01:26:05,199 --> 01:26:09,760
so i think that to answer your question

01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:11,600
you find that out a little bit

01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:14,159
on the way when you start like looking

01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:16,560
at their journeys

01:26:14,159 --> 01:26:18,400
yeah i didn't hear the part after you

01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:21,440
start to realize

01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:23,760
maybe so you start yeah you start like

01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:25,920
we started to realize is that even

01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:28,480
though these two personas are very

01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:29,520
different from for us and we need to

01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:32,159
speak to them

01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:33,760
maybe in a little bit different language

01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:35,199
how we are going to be reaching them is

01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:37,199
probably going to be still a very

01:26:35,199 --> 01:26:39,280
similar way

01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:40,320
you know and you know and then you find

01:26:39,280 --> 01:26:42,800
out like oh let's

01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:44,480
just like start by creating one content

01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:47,360
and for all of them so

01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:49,120
we start to merge the personas or we

01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:51,199
start to add a new persona that we

01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:53,920
realize that we find

01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:54,560
um you know somewhere else and we see

01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,400
like hey

01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:57,920
actually this persona here that is

01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:01,280
actually never for us

01:26:57,920 --> 01:27:02,960
relevant so

01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:04,560
i wanna there are two more topics that i

01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:06,239
to get over with you and one

01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:07,600
actually what this in the end gonna be

01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:09,360
really

01:27:07,600 --> 01:27:10,960
you know interesting for my part is

01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:12,159
actually the content templates because i

01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,760
think like that's also something that

01:27:12,159 --> 01:27:15,920
you can maybe use directly

01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:19,840
so i'm gonna continue so we have time in

01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:22,880
the end for questions right

01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:25,679
so user journeys um

01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:26,400
that is typically what you do next and

01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:30,000
um

01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:33,600
and they tend to be sometimes

01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:35,840
you know a lot of work to do

01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:37,679
i feel like a lot of our clients they

01:27:35,840 --> 01:27:38,800
have the personas there but they don't

01:27:37,679 --> 01:27:41,760
have a user journey

01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:43,760
map because this is very often a little

01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:45,280
bit harder part to do

01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:47,840
because it takes a lot of time because

01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:50,000
you need to think about their motivation

01:27:47,840 --> 01:27:51,360
when they come and engage with you i

01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,679
need to think about their needs and

01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:57,040
their pain points

01:27:53,679 --> 01:27:59,440
so let's look at this a little bit that

01:27:57,040 --> 01:28:00,719
the best way is actually to map this out

01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:03,840
and this could be done with an

01:28:00,719 --> 01:28:05,679
extra sheet or you know

01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:08,080
or what we did like you you maybe saw

01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:09,920
also our persona it's not that

01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:11,520
looking good it's just because like

01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:13,679
crystal and i we did

01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:15,760
most of it just at home and we're not

01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:17,360
really good in doing graphical stuff

01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:19,040
so the same is for the customer journey

01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:20,159
mapping you know

01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:23,040
i'm going to give you a template for

01:28:20,159 --> 01:28:24,880
that as well so

01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:26,800
how do you create it you actually list

01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:30,159
out the touch points and here

01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:31,679
you need to decide um

01:28:30,159 --> 01:28:33,440
do i want to start to list down the

01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:36,560
touch point of like

01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:38,800
i am in a conference and there i see

01:28:36,560 --> 01:28:40,800
maybe the company wants internet

01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:42,000
and then i actually go on the website or

01:28:40,800 --> 01:28:43,760
do you want to like start

01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:45,360
on the website or where where do you you

01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:47,199
know what is the touch point where what

01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:50,800
is the beginning

01:28:47,199 --> 01:28:52,400
of your thing and i'm just going to show

01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:54,239
you that

01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:56,080
yeah you think about the emotions and

01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:57,199
the motivations on the way how is the

01:28:56,080 --> 01:29:02,000
person

01:28:57,199 --> 01:29:03,920
feeling um what is the emotional journey

01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,400
what are the obstacles and the pain

01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:08,840
points what is like stopping the persona

01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:11,440
to make decisions

01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:13,360
um so for example

01:29:11,440 --> 01:29:14,480
one of your customers could love your

01:29:13,360 --> 01:29:16,639
product but

01:29:14,480 --> 01:29:18,719
is abandoning the cart because it

01:29:16,639 --> 01:29:19,600
discovers an unexpectedly high shipping

01:29:18,719 --> 01:29:21,120
rates

01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:23,520
you know what is like what could be an

01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:25,360
obstacle um

01:29:23,520 --> 01:29:27,440
so highlighting these potential

01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:28,080
obstacles in the customer journey

01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,840
earlier

01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:31,600
could probably be like a better

01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:34,320
experience for the user

01:29:31,600 --> 01:29:36,400
and you're gonna end up getting a uh

01:29:34,320 --> 01:29:39,520
somebody to buy

01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:42,239
so you know you if you think about like

01:29:39,520 --> 01:29:44,320
what could be an obstacle so we talked

01:29:42,239 --> 01:29:46,639
earlier about robert

01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,639
and

01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:52,560
robert's user journey is just thinking

01:29:49,679 --> 01:29:54,560
about remember he is the cto he's like

01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:57,760
he just doesn't have any time and

01:29:54,560 --> 01:30:00,719
he's just you know

01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:02,400
turning off fires all the time so he is

01:30:00,719 --> 01:30:04,000
just at the moment like really thinking

01:30:02,400 --> 01:30:05,280
i need professional partners to work

01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:09,280
with

01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:11,120
and he's validating you know partners to

01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:13,360
help him so this is what you start with

01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:15,840
here you

01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:17,920
you know you start to describe what it

01:30:15,840 --> 01:30:21,120
is that he's trying to do

01:30:17,920 --> 01:30:24,400
so we think about it from three stages

01:30:21,120 --> 01:30:26,000
and these stages can be changed

01:30:24,400 --> 01:30:28,639
depending on how you

01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:30,560
what your product is so you have the

01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:32,719
awareness phase

01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:35,760
then you have the research phase and

01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:39,040
then you have the decision phase

01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:40,719
so for robert he has

01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:42,159
if you look at it on the left side he

01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:45,120
has like some actions

01:30:42,159 --> 01:30:46,639
he had some thoughts thoughts he has

01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:48,239
emotions

01:30:46,639 --> 01:30:50,560
and then he has pain points and

01:30:48,239 --> 01:30:53,679
opportunities and the pain points are

01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:57,280
not bold and the opportunities are bold

01:30:53,679 --> 01:30:59,760
in this case so let's look at the

01:30:57,280 --> 01:31:03,120
awareness

01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:04,560
so he is like asked to evaluate partners

01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:06,159
or he is actually just

01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:07,920
thinking about i need to evaluate some

01:31:06,159 --> 01:31:10,400
partners so

01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:12,159
we we think that he may be just so he is

01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:14,080
obviously using drupal

01:31:12,159 --> 01:31:15,760
or wants to use drupal we go from that

01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:18,560
in that case

01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:20,080
you know so he goes and directly just

01:31:18,560 --> 01:31:22,000
checks the technology part

01:31:20,080 --> 01:31:23,440
portals because he immediately like if

01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:24,639
you're looking for a react developer you

01:31:23,440 --> 01:31:25,920
probably go somewhere and you look for

01:31:24,639 --> 01:31:27,360
react developers or if you're looking

01:31:25,920 --> 01:31:29,520
for dribble developers you would maybe

01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:32,800
go on drupal.org

01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:34,159
so you know he he goes there and he's in

01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:36,320
this awareness phase he's like

01:31:34,159 --> 01:31:37,760
wow okay this seems to be a good partner

01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:39,199
they have a high visibility

01:31:37,760 --> 01:31:41,840
and they are professional and they are

01:31:39,199 --> 01:31:44,159
like very many people on drupal.org and

01:31:41,840 --> 01:31:45,199
ah but i'm like i'm still skeptical

01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:48,239
right

01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:50,080
that's emotional like it can't be true

01:31:48,239 --> 01:31:51,600
you know none of the partners i worked

01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:53,360
with like it's never been true like

01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,960
they've always failed or you know

01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:56,400
like there's all these things that he's

01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:58,960
going through

01:31:56,400 --> 01:32:00,639
and and what his pain points are like oh

01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:02,000
it's hard to distinguish between the

01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:03,600
partners like they all have nice

01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,520
websites

01:32:03,600 --> 01:32:07,120
you know and you know what what are

01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,920
actually the questions that i should ask

01:32:07,120 --> 01:32:11,280
like i don't know

01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:14,239
and uh so we find an opportunity

01:32:11,280 --> 01:32:16,000
you know help him to find you know like

01:32:14,239 --> 01:32:18,639
help him to go through this space like

01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:21,040
help him to make good decisions

01:32:18,639 --> 01:32:22,960
so we you know what happens then when

01:32:21,040 --> 01:32:24,560
he's already like

01:32:22,960 --> 01:32:26,480
gone through the awareness phase he goes

01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:27,760
into the research where he really starts

01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:29,199
sticking into like

01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:31,440
now i really am going to find that out

01:32:29,199 --> 01:32:32,960
when he's already short cut it

01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:35,440
you know he's already found like maybe

01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:36,960
five partners to work with

01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:38,719
then he like he really starts like

01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:40,159
checking references like is this really

01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,760
true have they worked with a company

01:32:40,159 --> 01:32:43,920
like mine before

01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:45,280
you know oh have their teams or are

01:32:43,920 --> 01:32:47,920
their team are the team

01:32:45,280 --> 01:32:49,280
really active in drupal or you know and

01:32:47,920 --> 01:32:51,440
then he goes through the thought like

01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:53,199
you know hey wow they actually like

01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:54,719
you know well they are international i

01:32:53,199 --> 01:32:56,400
hope that they speak german because

01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:59,280
that's what he's thinking because he's

01:32:56,400 --> 01:33:01,040
in germany you know so so we are

01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:02,880
actually identifying already like stuff

01:33:01,040 --> 01:33:04,080
that we can start communicating to him

01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:07,120
in the face

01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:08,800
when he goes on our website so in this

01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:10,239
case he's actually really concentrated

01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,800
he's really trying to find the right

01:33:10,239 --> 01:33:13,040
partner

01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:14,880
at least to find the three good partners

01:33:13,040 --> 01:33:17,600
that he want to work with

01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:19,280
and his pain points are like all the

01:33:17,600 --> 01:33:20,880
mentors they seem to offer the same

01:33:19,280 --> 01:33:22,480
things and it's really hard to find the

01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:24,960
right information

01:33:22,480 --> 01:33:26,960
so our opportunity here is like you know

01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:27,440
helping to find the relevant information

01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:29,679
fast

01:33:27,440 --> 01:33:31,120
provide resume checklist or summaries

01:33:29,679 --> 01:33:32,480
like provide like him with the

01:33:31,120 --> 01:33:36,400
information that he is going through

01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:39,440
when he's looking

01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:41,360
um and then in the decision you know he

01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:44,320
probably does some reference calls

01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:46,239
he he does meetings he reviews offers

01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:47,600
and he thinks about like oh there are

01:33:46,239 --> 01:33:50,320
nice people

01:33:47,600 --> 01:33:51,600
they have deep technical know-how and in

01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:53,040
some areas they are even

01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:54,800
you know they know even more than me

01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:56,400
about the things which is even better

01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,040
because that's gonna help me in the long

01:33:56,400 --> 01:34:00,159
run

01:33:57,040 --> 01:34:02,159
so he gets really hopeful and

01:34:00,159 --> 01:34:03,679
his pains points are still like you know

01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:04,000
really hope that they know what they're

01:34:03,679 --> 01:34:05,679
doing

01:34:04,000 --> 01:34:07,040
because i can't be like spending the

01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:10,159
next 100

01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:12,639
000 euros on another company and it's

01:34:10,159 --> 01:34:15,840
not gonna work out so he is still like

01:34:12,639 --> 01:34:17,280
you know having these pain points so and

01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:18,800
you know so we said like be

01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:21,679
prepared for technical questions because

01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:24,560
he wants to really know that we are

01:34:21,679 --> 01:34:24,560
the experts so

01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:28,400
i hope you get it this is like you know

01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:30,800
i hope that you

01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:32,480
you know i hope that you can we can look

01:34:30,800 --> 01:34:33,679
at one more but i see crystal has a

01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:36,480
question

01:34:33,679 --> 01:34:39,679
do you only use proto personas or do you

01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:43,040
switch to real personas later on

01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:47,280
um normally

01:34:43,040 --> 01:34:49,679
robert is based on in our case at least

01:34:47,280 --> 01:34:51,280
he's based on real a couple of real

01:34:49,679 --> 01:34:53,600
personas and we have already put them

01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:55,679
into the persona

01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:57,119
so this is based on our experience what

01:34:55,679 --> 01:35:00,960
we already have

01:34:57,119 --> 01:35:04,480
experienced in our inner work

01:35:00,960 --> 01:35:06,410
but you don't really do user research

01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:08,719
it's just assumption

01:35:06,410 --> 01:35:12,239
[Music]

01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:13,679
so good question uh you should you

01:35:12,239 --> 01:35:15,280
should actually if you have time for

01:35:13,679 --> 01:35:18,239
doing that you should actually do

01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:20,159
you know this is based on experience uh

01:35:18,239 --> 01:35:21,679
because we are already in business for

01:35:20,159 --> 01:35:24,159
10 years

01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:26,800
so we feel like that we know our persona

01:35:24,159 --> 01:35:29,920
pretty well today

01:35:26,800 --> 01:35:31,119
but uh if you for example kristoff do

01:35:29,920 --> 01:35:32,480
not you know

01:35:31,119 --> 01:35:34,960
where do you come from what is your

01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:38,080
background

01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:40,000
i'm a ux architect and a front-end

01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:41,760
developer

01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,159
working in an agency or working with web

01:35:41,760 --> 01:35:48,560
projects yeah

01:35:44,159 --> 01:35:51,119
so if you if you don't have like

01:35:48,560 --> 01:35:52,480
if the client does not know this already

01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:55,760
if the client

01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:57,679
is unsure themselves then

01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:59,280
you should actually go into doing some

01:35:57,679 --> 01:36:01,040
research on it and you should actually

01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:04,560
do like interviews

01:36:01,040 --> 01:36:06,639
and all of that um

01:36:04,560 --> 01:36:08,080
in most of the cases like luckily we are

01:36:06,639 --> 01:36:08,800
at least lucky that the client is

01:36:08,080 --> 01:36:12,719
actually

01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:12,719
knows it pretty well you know

01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:17,760
so i want to show you here you know the

01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:20,880
the user journey for the

01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:24,000
for the marketing person so

01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:24,960
the awareness phase there is like um you

01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:27,119
know

01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:28,080
he's like attending digital conferences

01:36:27,119 --> 01:36:30,320
reading marketing

01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:31,360
magazines linkedin sings searching on

01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:32,960
google

01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:35,119
and what the marketing person we've seen

01:36:32,960 --> 01:36:35,920
a lot like is talking a lot to peers and

01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:37,679
colleagues

01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:39,119
you know getting information from others

01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:42,159
like what are you doing

01:36:39,119 --> 01:36:44,320
sitting in like you know

01:36:42,159 --> 01:36:46,880
bars with friends and just asking the

01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:49,760
others how are you all doing it

01:36:46,880 --> 01:36:51,119
so constantly thinking about like what

01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,320
are all the companies doing what

01:36:51,119 --> 01:36:54,639
solution exists

01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:56,560
like are the differences how does it

01:36:54,639 --> 01:36:57,360
bring maximum effect is the technology

01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:00,159
good enough

01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:03,040
it's a little bit desperate and the pain

01:37:00,159 --> 01:37:05,520
points of this persona is often like

01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:06,719
you know i can't differentiate between

01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:09,840
like

01:37:06,719 --> 01:37:11,280
the tools that i'm being presented so

01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:13,760
everybody is coming to me and trying to

01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:14,800
sell me the next perfect lead generation

01:37:13,760 --> 01:37:17,760
tool but like

01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:19,679
i don't know so much about it so for

01:37:17,760 --> 01:37:20,080
this persona we should actually like do

01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:21,520
key

01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:23,440
you know thought leadership in the

01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:26,080
beginning we should try to like

01:37:23,440 --> 01:37:28,719
give this persona a little bit like of

01:37:26,080 --> 01:37:29,440
information so that persona can grow in

01:37:28,719 --> 01:37:31,920
his

01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:33,600
awareness phase and become a little bit

01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:36,880
more educated

01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:39,040
why is hubspot no look let me make an

01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:41,040
exam why is google analytics

01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:42,719
uh better than matomo or the other way

01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:45,440
around so we can actually give

01:37:42,719 --> 01:37:46,000
you know these little simple things and

01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:49,199
tease

01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,760
teasers about that so in the research

01:37:49,199 --> 01:37:52,320
space

01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:53,199
uh it's again here probably going on

01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:55,520
google

01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:57,199
looking at the partner website and

01:37:55,520 --> 01:37:58,400
probably checks out your social media

01:37:57,199 --> 01:37:59,840
things

01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:01,280
because the marketing manager is

01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:02,719
probably going to say i'm only going to

01:38:01,280 --> 01:38:05,840
work with a company that knows

01:38:02,719 --> 01:38:05,840
how to do this themselves

01:38:06,880 --> 01:38:10,719
do they have a relevant experience are

01:38:08,719 --> 01:38:13,360
they modern do they have an

01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:15,440
energetic team do they have their own

01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:18,239
marketing under control

01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:19,600
so we are gonna like just like the

01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:21,199
developer persona

01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:22,639
is probably gonna look at like are we

01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:24,320
doing our website correctly from the

01:38:22,639 --> 01:38:26,800
performance perspective and so on so we

01:38:24,320 --> 01:38:29,920
need to like think about that

01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:31,840
and you know getting hopeful in the

01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:32,320
research space but doesn't have too much

01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:34,800
time

01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:36,719
so so you know opportunities here is

01:38:34,800 --> 01:38:39,040
like you know

01:38:36,719 --> 01:38:40,800
have case studies for like rois quotes

01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:42,480
from clients success stories

01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:44,800
because the marketing manager often

01:38:42,480 --> 01:38:47,280
wants to get like the promotion or the

01:38:44,800 --> 01:38:48,880
you know so we need to tell the

01:38:47,280 --> 01:38:49,119
marketing persona that if you work with

01:38:48,880 --> 01:38:50,800
us

01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:52,960
then you're like and you're going to

01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:54,719
grow

01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:56,239
and then in the end like the decision

01:38:54,719 --> 01:38:57,679
phase like this is probably going to be

01:38:56,239 --> 01:38:59,040
somebody who's going to look for very

01:38:57,679 --> 01:39:00,000
many different offers from many many

01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:02,320
different vendors

01:39:00,000 --> 01:39:04,000
and he's actually going to just do the

01:39:02,320 --> 01:39:04,480
meetings with those who he likes the

01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:08,000
most

01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:11,440
and you know gets excited

01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:12,000
and and yeah so we just in this case we

01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:14,400
need to like

01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,080
our offer material we do need to be like

01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:18,239
shiny

01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:19,440
so when we are when this persona comes

01:39:18,239 --> 01:39:22,560
and asks for an offer

01:39:19,440 --> 01:39:24,320
from our company we probably

01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:26,400
would give this persona a little bit

01:39:24,320 --> 01:39:29,040
more of a shiny material in the offer

01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:31,360
then probably would give to the cto

01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:32,480
who just wants the direct facts so you

01:39:31,360 --> 01:39:35,679
also like

01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:35,679
in your general like you know

01:39:37,199 --> 01:39:41,199
and this we've done for all of our

01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:43,840
personas

01:39:41,199 --> 01:39:45,360
and thinking again about iceland there

01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:47,040
going back to iceland there here you

01:39:45,360 --> 01:39:50,239
know iceland there is settling seats

01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:51,600
in an airplane and you need to think

01:39:50,239 --> 01:39:53,600
about like

01:39:51,600 --> 01:39:55,199
where is the person coming from was the

01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:56,960
person coming from an ad

01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:58,880
on you know was the person reading

01:39:56,960 --> 01:40:01,679
spiegelty

01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:03,040
saw an ad about barcelona and from the

01:40:01,679 --> 01:40:06,080
ad

01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:07,679
they got really excited of going to

01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:08,960
barcelona

01:40:07,679 --> 01:40:10,880
but then they did a little bit of

01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:13,199
research and figure out that this

01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:15,119
airline is a little bit more expensive

01:40:13,199 --> 01:40:16,880
and then how do they make the decision

01:40:15,119 --> 01:40:19,520
you know

01:40:16,880 --> 01:40:20,000
so going through these exercises again

01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:22,880
like

01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:24,560
spend time on it it's gonna take you

01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:26,719
like i say a day to create something

01:40:24,560 --> 01:40:31,040
like this

01:40:26,719 --> 01:40:33,520
so um to your question before hiker

01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:34,800
you know when you said you know how much

01:40:33,520 --> 01:40:36,159
time do you need for it or how many

01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:37,920
people do you need for it like if you

01:40:36,159 --> 01:40:39,600
want to do it really well and depending

01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:41,679
on your size of how far you want to go

01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:43,280
like this just takes time

01:40:41,679 --> 01:40:46,159
because trust me we have to iterate on

01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:46,159
this very often

01:40:47,760 --> 01:40:54,639
so is this helpful

01:40:51,600 --> 01:40:57,040
are you getting a lot of

01:40:54,639 --> 01:40:57,040
input

01:40:59,360 --> 01:41:03,760
yeah it's like so you you come back to

01:41:02,400 --> 01:41:04,000
it because you get feedback from the

01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,520
real

01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,360
world and the real world is never like

01:41:05,520 --> 01:41:09,119
you think

01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:10,400
but if you do this for a client help

01:41:09,119 --> 01:41:12,560
them to make personas

01:41:10,400 --> 01:41:15,440
you only have one shot probably and

01:41:12,560 --> 01:41:18,880
they'll have to continue

01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:22,159
yeah sure

01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:23,360
um so i wanna like because we only have

01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:25,199
15 minutes and

01:41:23,360 --> 01:41:26,880
um i want to talk a little bit about

01:41:25,199 --> 01:41:28,480
content templates because we we have

01:41:26,880 --> 01:41:31,679
already now

01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:33,760
um we've already not like

01:41:31,679 --> 01:41:35,440
we know where we need it or we think we

01:41:33,760 --> 01:41:37,280
know that why we need it

01:41:35,440 --> 01:41:38,880
and we know how to do the personas and

01:41:37,280 --> 01:41:40,639
we know how to do the user journeys and

01:41:38,880 --> 01:41:41,360
we figure out maybe in the user journey

01:41:40,639 --> 01:41:42,800
that like

01:41:41,360 --> 01:41:44,960
hey the user journey for everyone is

01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:47,119
this the same so let's just

01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:48,719
do one thing or we figure out that the

01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:50,800
user journey for every single person is

01:41:48,719 --> 01:41:53,440
different so therefore we need to

01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:56,560
you know do different things so let's

01:41:53,440 --> 01:42:02,320
look at content templates

01:41:56,560 --> 01:42:04,000
um okay we have a content pyramid

01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:06,639
and and like i'm gonna spend time with

01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:09,679
this because i don't have very many

01:42:06,639 --> 01:42:10,800
um slides on this but i i wanna think

01:42:09,679 --> 01:42:12,480
about

01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:15,040
this is something that we we have been

01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:16,480
working on and and if anya is still here

01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:19,119
in the call

01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:20,239
you know she is often or like i'm

01:42:19,119 --> 01:42:21,840
actually going to show like a real

01:42:20,239 --> 01:42:24,639
template that anya has been working on

01:42:21,840 --> 01:42:27,199
to create like landing pages

01:42:24,639 --> 01:42:28,080
so you think about it like this there's

01:42:27,199 --> 01:42:30,000
the implicit

01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:32,159
information there's the explicit

01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:33,840
information there's the call to action

01:42:32,159 --> 01:42:36,239
and the supporting information and now

01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:38,639
i'm thinking about how do you create

01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:41,360
a content for a landing page i'm going

01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:43,360
to jump over to one more

01:42:41,360 --> 01:42:45,520
one slides here that i did for the city

01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:48,800
of reykjavik

01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:50,080
um where we i'm going to show you this

01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:52,719
here just so you understand what i'm

01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:56,320
talking about

01:42:52,719 --> 01:42:59,440
so when you have

01:42:56,320 --> 01:43:01,199
a navigation structure you have like you

01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:02,880
know you have like some kind of way so

01:43:01,199 --> 01:43:04,000
for example from the start page on the

01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:06,239
citizen

01:43:04,000 --> 01:43:07,920
you go to building permits you go to

01:43:06,239 --> 01:43:10,239
building permit itself and then you go

01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:13,280
into the application process

01:43:10,239 --> 01:43:16,880
so this is if you start from the start

01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:18,560
right so if you're creating the journey

01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:20,000
from that the person is going on the

01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:21,679
start page

01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:23,119
you like think that this is the way how

01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:26,560
the person is going to go but

01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:29,280
actually the person is going to land

01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:31,199
just somewhere on the journey and you

01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:34,239
don't know where

01:43:31,199 --> 01:43:38,159
so it means that every single page

01:43:34,239 --> 01:43:40,400
that you're creating you need to like

01:43:38,159 --> 01:43:41,600
create that in a way of the pyramid that

01:43:40,400 --> 01:43:43,360
i was talking about and i'm going to

01:43:41,600 --> 01:43:45,520
show you the pyramid again because

01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:46,639
when you land on the building permit

01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:49,119
site

01:43:46,639 --> 01:43:50,560
there are like there's information that

01:43:49,119 --> 01:43:51,440
you need to give to the person because

01:43:50,560 --> 01:43:53,360
he's already

01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:54,719
there but then you need to give the

01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:56,159
supporting information which is

01:43:54,719 --> 01:43:58,480
everything that the person may be

01:43:56,159 --> 01:43:59,760
potentially missed on the way

01:43:58,480 --> 01:44:02,159
that there's other things that the

01:43:59,760 --> 01:44:06,080
person can do

01:44:02,159 --> 01:44:08,000
so so therefore like

01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:10,159
with when we think about landing pages

01:44:08,000 --> 01:44:11,920
we always say every single page needs to

01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:12,960
be the perfect landing page because you

01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:14,639
don't know

01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:16,080
the person the persona that comes on

01:44:14,639 --> 01:44:19,119
your website is not gonna most likely

01:44:16,080 --> 01:44:21,040
not gonna go in your start page

01:44:19,119 --> 01:44:23,199
so when we go back to our content

01:44:21,040 --> 01:44:26,560
pyramid we think about the perfect

01:44:23,199 --> 01:44:27,119
landing page and the perfect landing

01:44:26,560 --> 01:44:29,520
page

01:44:27,119 --> 01:44:29,520
has

01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:34,800
the key points that you want to come

01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:38,000
across

01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:39,440
there's the secondary points

01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,440
and then there is the additional

01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:44,239
material the special material like the

01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:46,159
supporting information

01:44:44,239 --> 01:44:47,679
then there is some implicit information

01:44:46,159 --> 01:44:49,440
happening on the way which means like

01:44:47,679 --> 01:44:50,880
you know there are some emotions going

01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:52,320
on you want to show like you want to

01:44:50,880 --> 01:44:54,239
create like something that you

01:44:52,320 --> 01:44:55,679
you do not put in words you want to show

01:44:54,239 --> 01:44:57,280
like photos or something i'm going to

01:44:55,679 --> 01:45:02,159
show you an example of that

01:44:57,280 --> 01:45:06,960
it's going to go directly where is it

01:45:02,159 --> 01:45:08,719
it is a actually that was the process

01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:10,960
so i'm just going to show you the

01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:12,639
template but how you think about it when

01:45:10,960 --> 01:45:14,719
you create a landing page you just have

01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:17,520
to think about like okay when the person

01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:19,119
lands on this page i need to of course

01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:20,480
give the information about this page but

01:45:19,119 --> 01:45:23,040
i also need to then go

01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:25,119
and give that everything that is on the

01:45:23,040 --> 01:45:29,280
left side and the right side of the menu

01:45:25,119 --> 01:45:30,480
on in the journey so

01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:32,159
and then you also need to think about

01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:34,000
like how much space do i want to have

01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:34,880
for each section and in where do i want

01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:36,400
to put the

01:45:34,880 --> 01:45:38,880
the call to action i'm actually going to

01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:42,560
dive just directly into the

01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:46,320
the template that we use

01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:49,679
so anya here and many others in the team

01:45:46,320 --> 01:45:51,199
they are working on this template that

01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:55,119
we have when we are creating

01:45:51,199 --> 01:45:57,679
landing pages and if we use like a

01:45:55,119 --> 01:45:59,440
we are doing drupal services so we want

01:45:57,679 --> 01:46:02,880
to have a landing page for drupal

01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:06,960
it means that if somebody goes here on

01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:10,400
on google and stirs is like drupal

01:46:06,960 --> 01:46:12,960
again tour frankfurt you know that

01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:16,480
person is most likely going to land

01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:18,960
on this page

01:46:16,480 --> 01:46:20,159
and this page here is not going to be

01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:22,000
the first page

01:46:20,159 --> 01:46:24,159
and i'm of course logged in which is not

01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:24,159
good

01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:29,119
so this page here is not the landing not

01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:30,000
the start page of our website this is

01:46:29,119 --> 01:46:32,560
actually a

01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,440
a landing page actually because i was

01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:38,239
logged in

01:46:33,440 --> 01:46:42,880
sorry see

01:46:38,239 --> 01:46:42,880
i just have to go into a private window

01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:45,920
and now i'm paying for this this is

01:46:44,320 --> 01:46:49,280
stupid like i even pressed an ad so

01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:52,400
sorry anya sorry arena

01:46:49,280 --> 01:46:54,800
this cost us 10 euros

01:46:52,400 --> 01:46:56,080
so if somebody searches with drupal on

01:46:54,800 --> 01:46:59,199
google or something like that

01:46:56,080 --> 01:47:02,400
and does drupal agency frankfurt then uh

01:46:59,199 --> 01:47:05,920
this is the page that the person lands

01:47:02,400 --> 01:47:08,159
on and there's like some call to action

01:47:05,920 --> 01:47:09,840
there are links to clients there's like

01:47:08,159 --> 01:47:12,159
the people who are

01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:13,600
you know diego here who is here also hi

01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:16,960
diego you're here

01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:18,000
you go and and there's like references

01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:20,480
and so on so

01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:22,880
i'm giving you an example of like the

01:47:20,480 --> 01:47:25,199
landing page that you create or when

01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:27,199
anya and hata and our team is creating

01:47:25,199 --> 01:47:29,920
the landing pages

01:47:27,199 --> 01:47:30,239
they they have cert certain breathing

01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:32,719
that

01:47:30,239 --> 01:47:34,400
has to happen uh and there needs to be

01:47:32,719 --> 01:47:36,080
like a communication between us

01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:38,320
all so we understand like what is it

01:47:36,080 --> 01:47:40,159
that we wanna come across so i'm gonna

01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:43,040
show you the process a little bit first

01:47:40,159 --> 01:47:44,320
and go up here so the process is like

01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:47,520
there's

01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:50,239
you know the marketing prepares briefing

01:47:47,520 --> 01:47:51,760
there is like the owner which is maybe

01:47:50,239 --> 01:47:54,080
the owner of that

01:47:51,760 --> 01:47:55,840
landing page which in my case would

01:47:54,080 --> 01:47:56,639
maybe be me or diego we are doing the

01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:59,760
sales for

01:47:56,639 --> 01:48:01,760
drupal we define maybe the sections and

01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:03,360
fill in the briefing then there should

01:48:01,760 --> 01:48:04,800
be a briefing meeting and

01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:06,719
by the way this is not always happening

01:48:04,800 --> 01:48:08,159
in our company so like it's not always

01:48:06,719 --> 01:48:09,840
perfect but this is how we would like to

01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:11,760
have it

01:48:09,840 --> 01:48:13,360
so there's a briefing meeting interview

01:48:11,760 --> 01:48:15,199
that should take place

01:48:13,360 --> 01:48:16,800
the sale team goes on it and does

01:48:15,199 --> 01:48:18,719
keyword research

01:48:16,800 --> 01:48:20,639
the marketing creates the first version

01:48:18,719 --> 01:48:24,400
the owner reviews the draft

01:48:20,639 --> 01:48:27,760
there's a sale review and we go live

01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:32,000
so we have a process or we we

01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:34,000
there's anya hi anya

01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:35,760
we have a process and like would like to

01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:37,440
like accomplish this you know every time

01:48:35,760 --> 01:48:41,840
we do a landing page like

01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:43,840
um so this is a typical

01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:45,119
briefing that is and have already has

01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:46,639
already been filled in and the briefing

01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:48,639
is much longer

01:48:46,639 --> 01:48:50,000
so it is like okay who's the client well

01:48:48,639 --> 01:48:53,600
in this case it's us

01:48:50,000 --> 01:48:55,520
so we are the client so the url is there

01:48:53,600 --> 01:48:57,760
the topic is drupal and the target

01:48:55,520 --> 01:48:59,360
persona there's a link there to our

01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:01,440
persona analysis

01:48:59,360 --> 01:49:03,520
in this case actually just everyone we

01:49:01,440 --> 01:49:05,520
are just targeting them all

01:49:03,520 --> 01:49:07,360
the goal is to have an create an

01:49:05,520 --> 01:49:10,000
awareness or a lead

01:49:07,360 --> 01:49:11,119
we have a textile because in germany you

01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:13,440
need to think about like

01:49:11,119 --> 01:49:15,119
are you formal or not formal or do you

01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:16,560
like there's a

01:49:15,119 --> 01:49:18,159
all these different things in different

01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:20,639
languages

01:49:18,159 --> 01:49:21,520
so there's some starting point there is

01:49:20,639 --> 01:49:23,360
some

01:49:21,520 --> 01:49:24,960
inspiration website that i actually just

01:49:23,360 --> 01:49:26,320
took out in this case but like

01:49:24,960 --> 01:49:27,840
you know what have we seen from

01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:29,440
somewhere else like eunuch maybe

01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:30,719
christina i see you here

01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:32,320
you know maybe we saw something that

01:49:30,719 --> 01:49:33,199
eunuch did something really awesome that

01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:36,639
we want to copy

01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:38,320
or something like that or or through no

01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:40,840
mix i see also the local

01:49:38,320 --> 01:49:42,320
wolfgang or somebody from truenomics

01:49:40,840 --> 01:49:45,119
here

01:49:42,320 --> 01:49:46,639
um so and then we think about the

01:49:45,119 --> 01:49:48,639
technical requirements about

01:49:46,639 --> 01:49:50,480
accessibility so we just remind

01:49:48,639 --> 01:49:52,639
ourselves that we need to like have a

01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:54,320
structured content we need to have like

01:49:52,639 --> 01:49:57,360
h1 and h2

01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:58,880
and and so on we uh

01:49:57,360 --> 01:50:00,560
go a little bit through like this most

01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:04,239
of the stuff is this reminding

01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:06,880
stuff and then there are the sections

01:50:04,239 --> 01:50:08,960
and these are the if you think about the

01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:10,719
content pyramid we want to like

01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:13,199
we have the implicit information for

01:50:10,719 --> 01:50:15,920
example the emotional part

01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:17,760
we want to cover by we want to show that

01:50:15,920 --> 01:50:20,159
we are professional

01:50:17,760 --> 01:50:20,880
we want to show that we are diverse and

01:50:20,159 --> 01:50:23,440
large

01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:24,480
and we have a sympathetic team like we

01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:26,320
have a

01:50:24,480 --> 01:50:28,320
that we are like good people to work

01:50:26,320 --> 01:50:30,000
with so that's why we put in the

01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:31,920
photos of the echo for example on the

01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:35,599
side no we want to put

01:50:31,920 --> 01:50:38,080
photos behind their site

01:50:35,599 --> 01:50:40,239
we want to have a trust building quotes

01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:42,800
we want to have a top class design

01:50:40,239 --> 01:50:43,679
of course performing pages beautiful

01:50:42,800 --> 01:50:45,280
images

01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:47,360
this is like the emotional part that we

01:50:45,280 --> 01:50:49,040
want to accomplish

01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:51,199
but then on the right side there is like

01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:52,400
the sections like what is the most

01:50:51,199 --> 01:50:54,880
important

01:50:52,400 --> 01:50:56,560
actually this was for i copied it from

01:50:54,880 --> 01:50:59,199
sorry e-commerce or e-commerce landing

01:50:56,560 --> 01:51:01,040
page but okay doesn't matter

01:50:59,199 --> 01:51:02,639
you know what do we want do we want the

01:51:01,040 --> 01:51:04,719
reader to learn about us you know that

01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:07,040
we want the reader to learn that we like

01:51:04,719 --> 01:51:08,400
we build complex e-commerce solutions

01:51:07,040 --> 01:51:10,080
integrated hybris

01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:11,520
and commerce tools we use drupal

01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:13,679
commerce

01:51:11,520 --> 01:51:15,920
you know there's like all kinds of other

01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:18,000
stuff there are case studies

01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:20,000
you know what are more topics and

01:51:18,000 --> 01:51:23,199
related services so maybe the person

01:51:20,000 --> 01:51:25,679
also need the hosting and so on so

01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:26,560
so what we do with creating this here we

01:51:25,679 --> 01:51:31,280
are basically

01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:33,840
going through the content pyramid

01:51:31,280 --> 01:51:35,599
which is going to be like you know how

01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:38,320
do we build that up so when

01:51:35,599 --> 01:51:39,360
uh anya in this case you know when when

01:51:38,320 --> 01:51:42,480
she is

01:51:39,360 --> 01:51:42,800
building up this website here you know

01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:46,840
she

01:51:42,800 --> 01:51:48,000
she there's a reason why it has this

01:51:46,840 --> 01:51:50,239
structure

01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:52,159
from the content perspective you know

01:51:50,239 --> 01:51:53,599
why this is coming here and why this is

01:51:52,159 --> 01:51:56,000
coming there and

01:51:53,599 --> 01:51:57,119
you know why do we have a call to action

01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,360
here

01:51:57,119 --> 01:52:01,040
why do we have here a code from a client

01:51:59,360 --> 01:52:03,679
why do we have logos

01:52:01,040 --> 01:52:06,080
why do we have this here this is all

01:52:03,679 --> 01:52:08,000
based on

01:52:06,080 --> 01:52:09,199
the content briefing that we create for

01:52:08,000 --> 01:52:10,960
the sites

01:52:09,199 --> 01:52:13,280
and this is how the process is then

01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:15,199
between

01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:17,040
us or the marketing you know in many

01:52:15,199 --> 01:52:18,560
cases the marketing just still runs with

01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:21,679
it and just tries to do it and

01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:22,800
uh and then we iterate on it

01:52:21,679 --> 01:52:24,159
because we don't also don't want to

01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:24,960
spend too much time on it because anya

01:52:24,159 --> 01:52:26,719
can actually

01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:28,239
probably say it here you know you see we

01:52:26,719 --> 01:52:29,920
always say like you know i can't wait

01:52:28,239 --> 01:52:31,360
for buddy to

01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:33,760
you know approve all my content

01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:36,719
sometimes i just have to push it out and

01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:38,719
wait until buddy sees it and then i'm

01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:39,920
just going to change it

01:52:38,719 --> 01:52:42,719
but i think that it's extremely

01:52:39,920 --> 01:52:44,960
important to think about

01:52:42,719 --> 01:52:46,719
for your editors if we go back to the

01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:48,960
editors again

01:52:46,719 --> 01:52:49,760
you know in this case the editor being

01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:51,360
anya

01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:52,960
that only a little bit has a structure

01:52:51,360 --> 01:52:55,520
when she's creating the content

01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:57,119
because she can think about okay i'm

01:52:55,520 --> 01:52:59,119
going to start with the key points what

01:52:57,119 --> 01:52:59,920
is it that you know buddy and diego want

01:52:59,119 --> 01:53:02,400
to say

01:52:59,920 --> 01:53:04,000
because when they are referring to the

01:53:02,400 --> 01:53:05,520
page when they are doing sales pitches

01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:09,360
or something like that so

01:53:05,520 --> 01:53:09,360
that's how you go through it and um

01:53:10,840 --> 01:53:16,000
yes i

01:53:13,599 --> 01:53:17,360
am i think i don't have anything more

01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:20,159
about it

01:53:17,360 --> 01:53:20,639
i actually like it's almost two hours

01:53:20,159 --> 01:53:24,159
and i'm

01:53:20,639 --> 01:53:26,320
amazed that you know so

01:53:24,159 --> 01:53:27,679
i would actually like to ask you as any

01:53:26,320 --> 01:53:33,280
one of you

01:53:27,679 --> 01:53:35,520
using any content pyramids or

01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:36,639
when you are creating content are you do

01:53:35,520 --> 01:53:41,840
you have any good

01:53:36,639 --> 01:53:41,840
tips or something that you are using

01:53:47,199 --> 01:53:54,480
yep yes

01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:56,800
actually we have a name that way i mean

01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:57,520
this pyramid but that's basically what

01:53:56,800 --> 01:54:00,239
we have done

01:53:57,520 --> 01:54:01,199
also in the past but with brainstorming

01:54:00,239 --> 01:54:04,080
meetings

01:54:01,199 --> 01:54:05,280
um like for example i gathered the

01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:07,920
meeting say

01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:08,800
um tell a little bit about what what is

01:54:07,920 --> 01:54:12,080
going on

01:54:08,800 --> 01:54:14,719
i invite the sale seo pers

01:54:12,080 --> 01:54:15,679
person well the person in charge of

01:54:14,719 --> 01:54:19,440
esseo

01:54:15,679 --> 01:54:22,320
and also i invite the ux person and

01:54:19,440 --> 01:54:24,400
a designer that we have so that actually

01:54:22,320 --> 01:54:27,040
editors can get an idea

01:54:24,400 --> 01:54:28,239
what is possible with drupal uh this

01:54:27,040 --> 01:54:31,040
actually allows

01:54:28,239 --> 01:54:33,280
the editors to learn more and more okay

01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:35,520
i want to have a contraction here

01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:36,960
and what the possibilities are or maybe

01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:39,920
the emotional

01:54:36,960 --> 01:54:40,480
part maybe a video is possible rather

01:54:39,920 --> 01:54:44,000
than

01:54:40,480 --> 01:54:46,159
a picture or a text and

01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:47,679
actually this helps a lot to to get

01:54:46,159 --> 01:54:50,080
these

01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:52,080
everyone is learning from everyone

01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:54,560
within just one hour maybe

01:54:52,080 --> 01:54:57,280
or even less and that way i think

01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:58,080
editors get more and more confident with

01:54:57,280 --> 01:55:01,119
drupal

01:54:58,080 --> 01:55:01,840
because they they understand drupal more

01:55:01,119 --> 01:55:06,480
and more

01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:09,679
by every new landing page that we have

01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:11,119
and and sarah where are you what is your

01:55:09,679 --> 01:55:14,639
background what

01:55:11,119 --> 01:55:17,760
uh i'm i'm working at the power

01:55:14,639 --> 01:55:19,360
i was product owner for our content

01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:23,119
migration to drupal

01:55:19,360 --> 01:55:26,159
and i'm the head of content currently

01:55:23,119 --> 01:55:28,560
at what company is it opera wall

01:55:26,159 --> 01:55:30,000
yeah at opera where high ks too yeah

01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:33,199
nice nice meeting you i am

01:55:30,000 --> 01:55:33,679
originally a translator so i have like

01:55:33,199 --> 01:55:36,080
both

01:55:33,679 --> 01:55:37,119
but backgrounds the technical and also

01:55:36,080 --> 01:55:40,639
the

01:55:37,119 --> 01:55:43,280
editor part of it yeah yeah

01:55:40,639 --> 01:55:44,080
so i actually i i want to agree with

01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:46,400
danielle

01:55:44,080 --> 01:55:48,080
uh talking about like we should use

01:55:46,400 --> 01:55:49,599
inversed pyramid actually i haven't

01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:51,520
thought about that but

01:55:49,599 --> 01:55:53,360
very good idea i think next time i'm

01:55:51,520 --> 01:55:54,719
gonna turn it around because you have

01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:56,800
more content in the beginning and then

01:55:54,719 --> 01:56:00,320
you go down right

01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:03,360
so thank you for that

01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:06,800
um i work i work at rutgers university

01:56:03,360 --> 01:56:10,320
and uh we're very small teams

01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:12,560
and i'm constantly working with um

01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:14,080
content experts in their department

01:56:12,560 --> 01:56:17,679
subject whatever

01:56:14,080 --> 01:56:20,880
so we don't have the benefit of ux

01:56:17,679 --> 01:56:24,480
and you know we use like templated

01:56:20,880 --> 01:56:26,800
drupal type sites but

01:56:24,480 --> 01:56:28,239
it's always like starting from scratch

01:56:26,800 --> 01:56:28,639
every project because you're dealing

01:56:28,239 --> 01:56:31,119
with

01:56:28,639 --> 01:56:32,560
users who don't know anything about a

01:56:31,119 --> 01:56:35,920
website

01:56:32,560 --> 01:56:38,239
and your technical brief is awesome

01:56:35,920 --> 01:56:39,199
and that emotional section is also

01:56:38,239 --> 01:56:41,920
really great

01:56:39,199 --> 01:56:44,000
because you know as the like project

01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:46,480
manager you're always trying to explain

01:56:44,000 --> 01:56:47,280
this to someone you know how to draw

01:56:46,480 --> 01:56:50,560
people in

01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:52,960
and how to create that experience

01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:53,679
and while most of them are just focused

01:56:52,960 --> 01:56:55,679
on

01:56:53,679 --> 01:56:57,840
what's the wysiwyg editor you know like

01:56:55,679 --> 01:57:01,920
how do i get bullets in here so it's

01:56:57,840 --> 01:57:01,920
it's difficult so this is really helpful

01:57:02,239 --> 01:57:06,159
yeah i wanna i wanna actually so if you

01:57:04,719 --> 01:57:10,480
if you didn't attend

01:57:06,159 --> 01:57:11,040
uh earlier crystal was doing a a talk

01:57:10,480 --> 01:57:12,800
about

01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:15,679
because i actually want to talk about

01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:17,360
templating if you're creating content

01:57:15,679 --> 01:57:18,960
so christoph had a talk about this

01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:21,520
earlier

01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:22,000
uh i think at 1 30 and it was called

01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:24,400
like

01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:25,599
increasing their editorial experience or

01:57:24,400 --> 01:57:29,119
something

01:57:25,599 --> 01:57:30,800
yeah so i want to show you like

01:57:29,119 --> 01:57:32,560
if you go into the back end of drupal

01:57:30,800 --> 01:57:36,400
that you provide for your client

01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:40,239
um we have created something like create

01:57:36,400 --> 01:57:42,480
content from template and

01:57:40,239 --> 01:57:44,080
again now thinking about like how do i

01:57:42,480 --> 01:57:46,320
create my content

01:57:44,080 --> 01:57:48,000
so if i go here and i want to create a

01:57:46,320 --> 01:57:50,000
page you know because you're probably

01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:51,920
all familiar with drupal

01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:53,679
it's really difficult to start here with

01:57:51,920 --> 01:57:55,920
a blank page

01:57:53,679 --> 01:57:57,280
because i don't know how am i going to

01:57:55,920 --> 01:58:01,119
accomplish

01:57:57,280 --> 01:58:02,960
building all this here in a nice way

01:58:01,119 --> 01:58:04,159
but i also need to understand how my

01:58:02,960 --> 01:58:05,920
drupal works

01:58:04,159 --> 01:58:07,199
so i go here and i start adding

01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:08,480
paragraphs

01:58:07,199 --> 01:58:10,000
and i have all these paragraphs that i

01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:12,400
have to use i have like an accordion

01:58:10,000 --> 01:58:15,360
remote video video two columns test

01:58:12,400 --> 01:58:16,080
these are books page reference image

01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:20,480
text

01:58:16,080 --> 01:58:22,560
like so what you then um

01:58:20,480 --> 01:58:24,159
can do and this is a really simple thing

01:58:22,560 --> 01:58:25,360
and we we have been contributing this to

01:58:24,159 --> 01:58:27,920
drupal

01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:29,520
is to add from a template so what you

01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:33,440
could then do

01:58:29,520 --> 01:58:34,880
you could create like templates

01:58:33,440 --> 01:58:37,920
for the stuff that you're trying to

01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:40,000
build so if you have here for example uh

01:58:37,920 --> 01:58:41,679
generic news there is this like a header

01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:43,520
there's a photo

01:58:41,679 --> 01:58:46,159
you know and there's a text so if you

01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:47,599
press that you just get that with a demo

01:58:46,159 --> 01:58:50,719
content

01:58:47,599 --> 01:58:53,199
cool already in there

01:58:50,719 --> 01:58:54,480
so you can actually like start building

01:58:53,199 --> 01:58:57,520
on top of that so

01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:59,599
this is actually a you know maybe

01:58:57,520 --> 01:59:02,239
lolo i see lolo is one of our developers

01:58:59,599 --> 01:59:03,920
he's here in the car and

01:59:02,239 --> 01:59:05,280
i know that he's been working on this

01:59:03,920 --> 01:59:06,239
this feature here together with

01:59:05,280 --> 01:59:09,679
christoph and

01:59:06,239 --> 01:59:13,840
and more and

01:59:09,679 --> 01:59:16,080
so here again you go into the

01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:17,920
into the persona of the one who is

01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:18,800
creating the content and you also try to

01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:23,520
enable

01:59:18,800 --> 01:59:25,920
that persona by having

01:59:23,520 --> 01:59:27,840
the employee here who's the position

01:59:25,920 --> 01:59:29,920
master of disaster and there is like

01:59:27,840 --> 01:59:30,400
some lorem ipsum in here whatever it is

01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:33,360
like

01:59:30,400 --> 01:59:34,480
but it's already ready there so these

01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:36,400
are one of the things that you can think

01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:39,280
about so look at christoph's talk

01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:39,920
from today another thing that i wanted

01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:42,320
that's a great

01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:44,719
idea another thing that i wanted to add

01:59:42,320 --> 01:59:47,520
to is like uh

01:59:44,719 --> 01:59:49,599
you know if you're also doing another

01:59:47,520 --> 01:59:51,040
thing that we've been contributing to to

01:59:49,599 --> 01:59:53,119
you know to make the editor experience a

01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:55,599
little bit better is also like

01:59:53,119 --> 01:59:57,520
that if you're here on the website it's

01:59:55,599 --> 01:59:59,119
really difficult sometimes for drupal

01:59:57,520 --> 02:00:01,920
editors

01:59:59,119 --> 02:00:03,280
because now i want to change i want to

02:00:01,920 --> 02:00:06,960
take out here

02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:09,440
quick so what i need to do i need to go

02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:11,280
in here i need to press here in view

02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:12,159
this is by the way using the gen theme

02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:15,040
which is like

02:00:12,159 --> 02:00:16,880
one of the themes in drupal i go in here

02:00:15,040 --> 02:00:18,239
and now i need to find out where it is

02:00:16,880 --> 02:00:20,400
and then i need to go and i need to

02:00:18,239 --> 02:00:22,880
press and i need to open here edit

02:00:20,400 --> 02:00:24,080
and i need to wait just to be able to

02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:27,280
change it

02:00:24,080 --> 02:00:28,560
so what we have also been doing in

02:00:27,280 --> 02:00:30,960
drupal

02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:33,119
is like to make it a little bit easier

02:00:30,960 --> 02:00:36,639
that you can actually just change it

02:00:33,119 --> 02:00:37,440
here and this is also what uh what lolo

02:00:36,639 --> 02:00:41,440
has been

02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:43,920
doing here together with the one x team

02:00:41,440 --> 02:00:45,520
you know like you see here or you you go

02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:47,360
in here you actually just want to do

02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:49,760
these quick changes you want to put the

02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:52,800
image to the left

02:00:49,760 --> 02:00:52,800
and you want to save it

02:00:53,440 --> 02:00:57,360
and then the image goes on the left so

02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:58,719
like think again about your personas and

02:00:57,360 --> 02:00:59,840
the reason why i wanted to show it to

02:00:58,719 --> 02:01:02,159
you is because

02:00:59,840 --> 02:01:03,840
here we are thinking about the persona i

02:01:02,159 --> 02:01:05,599
am an editor and i need to create

02:01:03,840 --> 02:01:08,159
content on the website

02:01:05,599 --> 02:01:09,360
how do i do that as simple as possible

02:01:08,159 --> 02:01:10,960
because in the end it's just using

02:01:09,360 --> 02:01:13,280
paragraphs

02:01:10,960 --> 02:01:14,000
so it's just drupal with using the gin

02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:15,760
theme

02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:18,400
and you know using paragraphs but it's

02:01:15,760 --> 02:01:22,159
all really like thought about

02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:25,920
how can that be easy for the person i

02:01:22,159 --> 02:01:27,599
am i'm doing it for so i hope that that

02:01:25,920 --> 02:01:28,960
makes sense for you to understand like

02:01:27,599 --> 02:01:30,000
how we

02:01:28,960 --> 02:01:32,000
you know when we are creating the

02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:35,599
content having templates and having

02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:39,920
having this we are over time

02:01:35,599 --> 02:01:43,760
but does anyone have a question or

02:01:39,920 --> 02:01:43,760
how should we continue these discussions

02:01:44,320 --> 02:01:47,920
i do have a question from the very first

02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:51,679
part of the

02:01:47,920 --> 02:01:53,360
workshop um is there a recommended time

02:01:51,679 --> 02:01:55,199
to spend on each part of the

02:01:53,360 --> 02:01:57,440
10 step process that you described at

02:01:55,199 --> 02:01:59,280
the beginning and this might depend on

02:01:57,440 --> 02:02:02,480
the size of the project but

02:01:59,280 --> 02:02:03,040
like even if in percentages like what is

02:02:02,480 --> 02:02:06,000
a good

02:02:03,040 --> 02:02:08,000
amount or limit to dedicate to each

02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:11,119
section

02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:12,880
so if i understand you correctly

02:02:11,119 --> 02:02:15,199
you know if we think about this photo

02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:18,480
here like

02:02:15,199 --> 02:02:19,360
yeah so should we not to say the good 20

02:02:18,480 --> 02:02:22,960
02:02:19,360 --> 02:02:26,159
in the sense of like or being then 20

02:02:22,960 --> 02:02:31,040
70 and 10

02:02:26,159 --> 02:02:33,760
of the total budget no i

02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:35,280
i just know that most of the projects

02:02:33,760 --> 02:02:37,280
that we take over

02:02:35,280 --> 02:02:39,440
they normally have they normally are

02:02:37,280 --> 02:02:41,679
failing or they are

02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:45,280
they ha they are struggling because the

02:02:41,679 --> 02:02:45,280
first four things were not done

02:02:45,520 --> 02:02:49,679
okay and um and i'm really happy every

02:02:48,880 --> 02:02:52,719
time that i see

02:02:49,679 --> 02:02:54,239
that at least the you know if the client

02:02:52,719 --> 02:02:57,360
has not thought about it we

02:02:54,239 --> 02:02:58,960
we that's okay like and again here you

02:02:57,360 --> 02:03:00,239
can also have a successful project

02:02:58,960 --> 02:03:04,800
without doing it i'm not

02:03:00,239 --> 02:03:07,199
i'm not generalizing it but

02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:08,880
you know often well what's out that you

02:03:07,199 --> 02:03:11,040
don't spend hundreds of thousands of

02:03:08,880 --> 02:03:15,840
years of creating something that nobody

02:03:11,040 --> 02:03:15,840
can use because things happen so quickly

02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:20,320
i hope that

02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:26,719
so i'm really i'm extremely happy like

02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:28,560
i'm i'm actually

02:03:26,719 --> 02:03:30,960
like i'm just going to be thoughtful of

02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:33,520
time i would love to spend

02:03:30,960 --> 02:03:34,159
a much longer time with you here but i i

02:03:33,520 --> 02:03:36,560
thought

02:03:34,159 --> 02:03:39,199
from my perspective really good to get

02:03:36,560 --> 02:03:42,239
the input from you

02:03:39,199 --> 02:03:44,719
and i feel like that this was like as

02:03:42,239 --> 02:03:47,440
good as we could do in a in a virtual

02:03:44,719 --> 02:03:47,440
situation

02:03:48,079 --> 02:03:52,639
um i am gonna get you the slides let me

02:03:51,199 --> 02:03:56,239
