about this and

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,240

many many years

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,239

00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,719
person that i am introducing

00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,640
but you can imagine how excited i am to

00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,039
be here today to do this job

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,399
but first please allow me to show you a

00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,399
couple of things

00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,239
the first one is the drupal shop and

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,920
this is a play that we have created

00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,680
to raise funds for the drupal

00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,760
association in a time which is

00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,520
particularly difficult for everyone and

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,559
the drupal association is no exception

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,079
to that

00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,400
i would like to recognize the word from

00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,640
people like will srabby

00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,240
rose from mautic or daniel and rachel

00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,159

thanks a lot for your help for making

00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,960
this possible

00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,640
and if you want to help these are the

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,759
ways in which you can do it

00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,600
the most obvious do some shopping we can

00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,280
you know you can also do something like

00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,200
joining the working group

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,799
give us your feedback or even promote

00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,799
your own events like netcam talking

00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,479

and i will give you a little drupal

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,400
trick

00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,200
if you visit the akibus you're gonna get

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,040
a free coupon for a t-shirt in the shop

00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,640
that's as well good money for the drupal

00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,880
association but

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,799
on top of that for a very good visit

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,240
accuse donating five dollars to black

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,079
girls code

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,399

00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,640
t-shirt please visit us and make drinks

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,040
and spend some money

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,640
um and the last thing i want to do is i

00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,280
would like to give you a glimpse of the

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,600
future

00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,119
or i should say the present and you know

00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,640
inaki we have this mission where we

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,039
think that having a website is not

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,040
enough like it was 10 or 20 years ago

00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,800
the market is much more competitive and

00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,959
users demand things like a

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,160
higher level of personalization for your

00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,680
websites

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,680
customers are aware of that and the

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,760
demand partners in ourselves to deliver

00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,480
the full rich digital experiences

00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,120
that those users are demanding so you

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,879
know

00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,879
we don't want to stop at hosting we know

00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,560
that that's this is just the first step

00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,840
so our teams have been working hard on

00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,640
the products that you can see in the

00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,840
screen

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,000
products like campaign studio

00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,239
personalization

00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,599
and the customer data platform that is a

00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,640
pillar full of them

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,879
that's what we call the marketing cloud

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,319
and if you're a developer and i know

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,040
there are a few here

00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,640
you are going to love the drupal cloud i

00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,720
don't think it's a secret that in ikea

00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,080
we are a hundred percent localists

00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,440
and our commitment and our passion is to

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,920
give you better tools for

00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,800
your daily work with drupal the result

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,760
of that

00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,480
is tools like migrate to speed up your

00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,120
migrations from drupal 7 to triple 8

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,040
or cite the studio a revolutionary low

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,480
code tool which is going to empower

00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,239
your front-end marketing teams and

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,959
decouple their work and give them the

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,920
freedom that

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,920
they are demanding and probably one of

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,239
my favorites which is cloud ide

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,120
cloud id is a super fast local drupal

00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,040
environment which

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,879
lives in the cloud and reduces the

00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,280
complexity to set up environments

00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:33,200
things like local performance issues

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,120
broken and civil recipes all of that is

00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,200
history with a cloud ide

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,080
so please visit the website or better

00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,400
visit us in the in the booth

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,319
and to finish my part let me have some

00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,560
words for the community

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,080
i've already said that it's been a

00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,680
particularly difficult for

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,920
uh difficult year for everyone i'm not

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,239
saying anything new a lot of things are

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,599
different in drupalcon this year

00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,480
but some of them are not and for example

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,120
our community

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,120
the drupal community we are an example

00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,840
for many other open source projects in

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,080
the world

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,439
and he wanted to call out in particular

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,439
the people that contribute

00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,040
to make that the way it is the

00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,280
leadership from

00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,560
the people in the leading initiatives to

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,439
the people maintaining contributed

00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,000
modules and

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,720
everyone in the middle in the community

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,959
and

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,160
you know if this uh if this community is

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,680
an example

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,400
the person that i am introducing is

00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,400
probably the most responsible for this

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,160
he's always that uh someone that always

00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,759
finds the time for for everyone

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,360
he replies to every message even the

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,880
most serious and stupid ideas that you

00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,520
can send him

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,000
and i'm not saying that i do that um a

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,120
lot

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,720
but anyway moving on um something

00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,120
interesting as well about

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,639
him is that people doesn't know that he

00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,000
struggles a little bit with spanish

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,400
accents

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,560
although i found that that is true with

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,280
my own particular accent and everyone

00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,720
else but

00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,720
don't worry this i won't go into the

00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,040
days with that so

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,320
please everyone welcome technical lead

00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,440
and founder of drupal

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:11,840
founder and cto of akia my boss

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:11,840
dress watered

00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:22,000
awesome uh thanks for having me um

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,440
i'm just getting set up here um

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,759
i wish we were live in barcelona but

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,280
unfortunately that couldn't be the case

00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,039
for barcelona is actually one of my

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,800
favorite cities in the world

00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,960
and have a lot of great drupal memories

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,199
in barcelona but um

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,080
in absence of that this will be a live

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,960
presentation

00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,280
except it won't be from barcelona so

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:46,240
with that said i'm i'm ready to go

00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,479
um what i wanted to do today um is talk

00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,800
a little bit about how we are optimizing

00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,120
for

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,039
impact which i think is a very important

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,360
part of what we do in the drupal

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,360
project and the way i want to talk about

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,280
that is by

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,479
telling you a little bit of stories you

00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,800
know things that

00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,639
i wouldn't have guessed when i started

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,280
drupal so i'll go back in time a little

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,919
bit

00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,800
and uh and talk about why i believe

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,600
drupal has

00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,560
a big impact on the world and so as you

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,560
probably know

00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:20,000
drupal is almost 20 years old on january

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:24,240
15th so in like a month or so drupal

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,560
will be will turn 20. and on the screen

00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,080
you actually see a photo of me like

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,039
young greece

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,080
where i was giving my very first drupal

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,240
presentation

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,360
and i was also wearing my very first

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,840
drupal t-shirt

00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,199
they gave it to me just before i walked

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,960
on stage

00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,440
um anyway um you know all of these

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,080
things

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,520
right drupal's upcoming birthday the

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,479
fact that

00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,319
2020 is kind of a strange year the fact

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,680
that we're close to the holidays

00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,720
it made me sort of want to reflect on

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,039
the past and i asked myself the question

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,080
like what if drupal didn't exist what

00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,639
would my life

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,479
what would my world look like and

00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,800
obviously my world would be

00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,080
very very different i'd probably be

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,479
living in belgium

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,039
working for a big bank writing software

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,919
or something along those lines

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,759
so i'm very fortunate with drupal and

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,479
the impact that drupal has had on my

00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,960
life

00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,919
now the bigger question is probably what

00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,720
would the world

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:28,720
look like without drupal it's worth

00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,360
taking a moment to think about that

00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,160
and the impact that drupal has on so

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,440
many people

00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,440
around the world and as you know drupal

00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,120
powers a lot of websites across many

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,599
different industries and

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,440
notably many non-profits tens of

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,479
thousands of nonprofits all around the

00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,039
world use

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,840
drupal and some of them have been using

00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,520
drupal even to help with covet 19.

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,520
and there's many many stories of that

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,639
but i just wanted to highlight

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,599
one story and that's the story of a

00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,680
non-profit

00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,080
in peru that helped with food

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,919
distribution to refugees

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,919
i'm not sure if you know but peru was

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,120
sort of one of the deadliest covet hot

00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,000
spots in the world

00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,560
they were really hit hard unfortunately

00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,680
there's also thousands of refugees

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:18,160
typically people from um venezuela

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,000
that live in peru that make money

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,639
selling goods on the street

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,879
and of course because of covet 19 their

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,000
stream of income you know disappeared or

00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,199
almost disappeared

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,240
and so there's a non-profit organization

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,599
um my my you know my spanish accent

00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,719
isn't very good so i'm not gonna try and

00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,399
read it but

00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,080
um this non-profit organization

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,320
excuse me they they've basically been

00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,000
helping with food distribution and i was

00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,279
logistically hearted to work with

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,040
spreadsheets and

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:49,040
sort of whatsapp messages all very

00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,519
manual and they couldn't scale it very

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,440
well

00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,279
and so what they did is they actually

00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,959
built a drupal

00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,519
and on the drupal site people could

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,480
register they could mark their location

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,800
on a map

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,720
and then they could basically using this

00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,399
drupal site to coordinate the

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,040
distribution of food

00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,000
taking into account people's location

00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,240
making sure

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,440
that people don't all pick up their food

00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,160
at the same time

00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,800
so they could do a good scheduling to

00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,720
allow people to keep their distance

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,120
and in building this drupal app and

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,519
using this drupal app they were able to

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,399
help

00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,320
10 times more people and so it's just an

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,920
amazing story one of thousands of

00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,920
stories of how drupal

00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,760
has been helping uh people all around

00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,120
the world and it wasn't just the

00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,200
technology in this case

00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,040
that made it possible it wasn't just the

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,399
drupal project but it was also the

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,399
drupal community

00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,800
i'm not sure if you know but actually

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:45,440
various people from the drupal community

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,519
came together to help build this app it

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,040
just goes to show how amazing the drupal

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,760
project is

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,440
and so i'm very proud to be you know

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,920
helping and supporting

00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,399
and promoting organizations that do such

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,800
good things in the world

00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,399
and if you think about that's just one

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,120
example but there's literally tens of

00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,040
thousands of

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,480
examples and i do believe that if drupal

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,399
didn't exist today

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:11,040
the world would look a little bit

00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,880
different you know and so

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,240
with that background story what i wanted

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,079
to do today is

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,000
do things a little bit different as i

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,240
mentioned and there's going to be three

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,160
sections to my presentation first i want

00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,040
to talk about things that i believe

00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:27,279
drupal did right i want to talk about

00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,000
things that i would do differently

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,279
you know almost 20 years into drupal

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,680
what would i do differently

00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,640
if i were to start over again and then i

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,560
want to talk a little bit

00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,279
a little bit about things that surprised

00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,760
me that i didn't expect would happen

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,680
all right and so i'll be talking about

00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,440
these things and then towards the end of

00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,680
the presentation

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,880
heather rocker our executive director of

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,760
the drupal association

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,120
she will actually come on stage as well

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,519
uh and she'll be talking about the

00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,839
drupal association's action plan now

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,959
you may wonder that sounds a little bit

00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:00,640
random

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,399
to have had their common stage to talk

00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,279
about an action plan

00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,040
but as you'll see the action plan

00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,279
actually ties back into

00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,480
what i will be talking about and so it

00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,560
will all make sense

00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,920
uh by the end of the presentation all

00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:18,560
right so with that said let's get going

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,600
uh first section is to talk about things

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,079
that i believe

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,680
we did right in the drupal project

00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,839
there's a lot of things we did right

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,680
otherwise we wouldn't be this large and

00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,519
this successful but i want to focus on

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,240
one particular thing

00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,560
and that is from day one we've always

00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,519
been

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,240
innovating and what you see here on the

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,760
screen

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,920
is actually a screenshot of a blog post

00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:44,160
that i wrote many years ago i was

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,880
wishing drupal a happy birthday

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,160
but in the blog post i actually quoted

00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,600
the original

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,760
drupal 1.0 release announcement

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,000
and i highlighted a few words that were

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:59,040
in that announcement so we had a modular

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,040
design which sounds very common today

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,000
but i can tell you at the time that was

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,480
groundbreaking

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,760
because every other cms was very

00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,760
monolithical

00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,360
we also had features like back-end

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,000
headline generation

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,200
not not words that we would use today

00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,279
but eventually

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,120
that kind of became well known or better

00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,519
known as rss

00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,040
right and so drupal adopted that before

00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,959
it went mainstream

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,639
we also had a feature that we would call

00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,720
public diary module

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,800
which eventually became blogging but it

00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,200
didn't have that name blogging yet so

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,839
in many ways we were blogging before

00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,200
blogging was cool

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:40,240
and so on this slide what you see here

00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,920
is a timeline of the last 20 years and

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,480
some of the technologies that have come

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,639
along

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,160
i mean i could have added dozens and

00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,399
dozens more

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,440
but what is remarkable is that drupal

00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,079
survived

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,320
through all of these changes in many

00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,079
ways we were born in sort of the era of

00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,920
the static web

00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:02,639
you know sites are pretty basic um

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,040
from there we evolved into what i call

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,200
the social web right the web became more

00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,360
interactive and eventually social with

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,880
solutions or platforms like facebook and

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,760
twitter and youtube

00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,480
tumblr you name it and then a little bit

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,560
later

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,480
we had the mobile web you know with the

00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,920
first mobile browser

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,120
with the iphone um we also had

00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:25,279
responsive design

00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,800
all of a sudden and drupal adapted that

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,399
and of course today

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,320
everything that we do is responsive

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,000
design but it's not something that we

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,880
should take for granted because we have

00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,839
to evolve

00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,839
through all of these things

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,920
years after that we saw this sprawl of

00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,560
javascript

00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,079
tools and frameworks and actually if you

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,199
look all the way to the left you see

00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,959
jquery

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,240
and i don't know if you know this but

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,880
drupal was

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:53,120
the first cms to adopt jquery and we

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:56,240
really helped validate jquery

00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,560
and contributed to its massive adoption

00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,519
and in doing so we also helped promote

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,040
the adoption of javascript more broadly

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,639
of course today there's all of these

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,519
different frameworks

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,600
out there and then more recently i think

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,240
the era that we are in today is what i

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,760
call the digital experience era

00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,000
you know and it's a combination of

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,480
different things at the core it's all

00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,519
about

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:22,320
integration and building really seamless

00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,399
experiences online which is why i use

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,199
the term digital experience era

00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,000
but what it means is new channels like

00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,800
you know

00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,120
watches or voice assistants or chat bots

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,639
or

00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,920
digital kiosks but also machine learning

00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,600
and ai but also integrations with

00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,760
e-commerce platforms with marketing

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,480
animation solutions with personalization

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,560
solutions

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,160
you name it and if you look at the

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,320
industry

00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,000
a lot of the proprietary competitors to

00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,800
drupal they've been evolving from

00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,079
just being a cms you know just building

00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,199
websites to digital

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,959
experience platforms that do a lot more

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,920
right and that's kind of the era that

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:04,320
we're in right now

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,160
but the great thing about all of this is

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,880
that not a lot of technologies on the

00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:11,600
web have survived for 20 years and even

00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,320
fewer organizations or technologies have

00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,240
thrived

00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,160
and have stayed relevant like drupal is

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,959
right and so it begs the question

00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,720
why why has drupal stayed relevant and

00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,639
why has drupal thrived

00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,480
over all these years and i think it's

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,720
pretty simple answer actually

00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,959
but first of all and this is where it

00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,279
starts you have to work on things

00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,160
that actually matter to end users you

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,639
have to solve

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,600
a real problem you know you can solve a

00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,839
small problem

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,399
and expect to you know grow as large as

00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,800
drupal

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,560
second and very importantly we were

00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,959
never afraid to embrace

00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,079
new technologies we were never afraid to

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,720
evolve

00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,839
with the you know with the technology

00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,600
landscape

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,199
now last but not least we actually made

00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,480
it easy for end users

00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:00,079
to adopt the technology that may sound a

00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,480
little bit funny because we talked so

00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,560
much

00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,959
so much about usability and how we have

00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,279
much work to do around usability

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,240
but for many many years especially in

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,720
the first

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,920
you know call it 10 to 15 years of

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,399
drupal

00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,120
the fact that drupal was open source and

00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,600
is open source obviously

00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,079
is what made it so easy to adopt right

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,000
like you didn't have to buy a license

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,680
you didn't have to go through a sales

00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,600
process and have sales meetings you

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,079
could just download and install

00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,720
drupal and that was incredibly instill

00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,279
is

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,320
incredibly empowering and in stark

00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,120
contrast

00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,639
with sort of traditional software now in

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,959
the last few years

00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,000
that has changed a little bit you know

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,040
sas software

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,440
is everywhere and sas software of often

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,360
has

00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:51,440
like free trials and so that ease of use

00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,600
that advantage that we had has

00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,279
disappeared or softened somewhat and

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,720
that's why we're very focused on other

00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,680
usability

00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,360
improvements in drupal but these three

00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,600
things i believe is why

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,600
we have you know thrived over 20 years

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,640
and so this is a chart it's kind of a

00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,880
classic chart

00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,079
of how technology evolves and what you

00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,520
see is four

00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,480
example waves of technologies and each

00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,760
wave

00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:22,160
you can see there's kind of a slow start

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,079
followed by fast adoption in the middle

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,480
and then the technology peaks

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,319
right and while the technology peaks you

00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,720
kind of have to make the leap to the

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,280
next

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,120
technology right as it takes off you

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,480
have to make the jump

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,960
and in order to stay relevant

00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,480
we have to keep making these jumps right

00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,480
and so today

00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,240
we can look at this chart and map it

00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,000
onto the previous slides that i showed

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,840
right in our world these waves could

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,120
map to the static web the dynamic web

00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,400
the mobile web and the digital

00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,880
experience era

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,000
and then in order to stay relevant what

00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,679
do we have to do

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,120
well i think there's a whole bunch of

00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,200
things we have to do

00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,240
but i think it comes down to integrated

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,760
solutions

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,760
you know bringing all of these different

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,840
technologies together

00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:07,600
websites aren't stand-alone applications

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,200
anymore they're integrated solutions

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,039
part of a bigger stack

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,240
and that's where decoupled and headless

00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,960
architectures are so

00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,840
important and fortunately we have a

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,320
great story

00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,440
around headless and decoupled you know

00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,840
we've made that bed

00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,480
many years ago and that's now starting

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,400
to pay off we are recognized as a leader

00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,400
in headless and decoupled

00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,080
another big part is composable or

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,760
reusable content

00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,679
and again this is something that we've

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,039
had for over a decade

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,640
with things like cck and views we've had

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:42,000
it for many many years

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:44,240
and guess what it continues to become

00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,440
more and more and more relevant it's

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,360
growing into us

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,440
if you will and then there's all these

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,520
different channels that i mentioned

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,799
uh or modalities if you want to call it

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,559
that

00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,160
and we're good at that too because if

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,360
headless and decoupled and to some

00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,679
extent javascript

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,760
is also an important part of that

00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,559
because a lot of applications want to be

00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,960
more

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,760
you know dynamic and application like i

00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,240
guess

00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,760
and so overall drupal is really really

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,520
well positioned

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:13,679
you know for this era which is great

00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,480
news now there's some things we have to

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,480
do

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,400
we have some legacy javascript we want

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,640
to add more web service coverage

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,840
but overall i think we're in a really

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,120
good position

00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,559
for the next um you know several years

00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,240
now the other big thing that's

00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,640
continuing to happen

00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,640
is that javascript continues to grow

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,480
very quickly in fact that growth is

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,600
accelerating you can see that on these

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,559
charts

00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,520
we now have explosive growth i would

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:43,440
call it

00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,520
for react and view and other frameworks

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,320
and you know fortunately again drupal

00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,240
can be used with all of these frameworks

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,600
and again there is always things we can

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,120
do better

00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,640
as well but you know we're never done

00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,360
right and so these two big

00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,799
trends if you want you can call it the

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,600
fort wave of the web

00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:04,320
or this digital experience era as well

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,559
as this explosive growth of javascript

00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,440
actually has led me to propose the

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,480
javascript

00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,600
menu component initiative um

00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:16,080
drupalcon global the previous drupalcon

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,240
i think four months or so ago maybe five

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,640
months

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,640
and the mission that i proposed is to

00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:25,520
provide the best way

00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,480
for javascript front-ends to consume

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,679
configurable

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:31,280
menus managed in drupal all right that

00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,240
may sound specific

00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,720
and it is but we picked menus because

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,280
almost

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,000
every site or every application has

00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,640
menus

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,919
and so it's a very usable component it's

00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,640
also a component

00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,760
with a lot of complexity quite frankly

00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,400
and so i showed this

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,320
image of the mountain i guess i use a

00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,480
lot of mountain slides

00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,200
but at the bottom of the mountain you

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,640
can see a set of capabilities or things

00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,679
that we need to do

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,320
that are specific to building a menu

00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,320
component right like you have to manage

00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,880
hierarchies of menu items

00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,799
there is menu items defined by code

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,960
programmatic or module defined menu

00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,760
items there's also user defined menu

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,600
items

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,520
these are menus entered by um

00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,840
you know a user of drupal through the

00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,480
admin ui you have to deal with routing

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:25,760
and path aliases all of these things

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,679
but then at the top of the mountain

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,039
you see things that aren't quite

00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,520
specific to

00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,799
menu items these are things that we have

00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,919
to do

00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,760
for any component that we would build

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,120
and part of the mission was to go solve

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,960
these things

00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,440
and the reason why we wanted to solve

00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,760
these things is because that will open

00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:48,000
the floodgates if you will to building

00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:50,320
not just one component for menus

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,600
but for building hundreds of components

00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,880
over time

00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,720
right and so that was secretly or not so

00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,360
secretly the real mission of this

00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,159
initiative

00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,600
is to figure out how we can have many

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,799
components in drupal

00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,440
and to use the menu component to

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:10,000
sort of create a path for others right

00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,799
and so the real mission is all about

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,720
how do we become the best decoupler

00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,320
headless cms

00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,400
and how do we have many javascript

00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,559
integrations not just one

00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,320
and so i put that challenge out there at

00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,919
the previous drupalcon

00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,600
and we've actually seen some great

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,440
momentum in progress on it

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,039
and so what i wanted to do next is show

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,760
you a video

00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,679
to show you how far we've come in just

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,559
you know four or five months or so

00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:36,559
so let's take a look

00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,440
hello everyone i'm gabe sillis one of

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,480
the coordinators for the decoupled menus

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,240
initiative

00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,840
i'd like to provide you with an update

00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,039
on what our team has been working on

00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,360
since streets recommended this

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,520
initiative at triplecon global

00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,520
but first let's quickly recap what the

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,520
initiative is all about

00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,880
the idea for this initiative is to work

00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,039
toward two goals

00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,039
the first give drupal the best

00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,080
javascript developer experience of any

00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:04,000
cms

00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,480
the second make drupal the best

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,240
decoupled cms overall

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,840
to achieve the first goal we need to

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,679
establish a pattern for building

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,480
shipping and maintaining javascript

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,240
packages

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,919
and then we need to make sure that those

00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,640
packages are high quality

00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,280
and easy to use to achieve the second

00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,200
goal

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,720
we also need to provide an excellent

00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,760
non-developer experience

00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,480
even in a decoupled architecture

00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:30,799
today fully decoupled architectures must

00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,200
sacrifice the non-developer experience

00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,960
or spend lots of time and resources to

00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,000
restore the features that you get out of

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,440
the box in a more

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,960
traditional non-decoupled architecture

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,360
since both of these goals are quite

00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,640
ambitious dries suggested that we focus

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,240
on a single use case

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,000
a javascript menu component in doing so

00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:52,559
we would establish a pattern that we can

00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,960
repeat until we've achieved success

00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:56,400
so how are we doing and what have we

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,240
been up to

00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,080
well we've been putting our team

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,559
together validating the idea

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,159
and doing research and discovery i'm

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:04,480
happy to say that we have put together

00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:06,640
an

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,919
awesome team of new and existing drupal

00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,919
contributors

00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,679
we've also validated the initiative idea

00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,240
and officially launched it as a drupal

00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,039
core

00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,840
strategic initiative what i'm most

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,039
pleased with

00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,200
is that through our research and

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,200
discovery we've already got two really

00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,679
exciting things to show you

00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,919
the first is that we wrote an rfc draft

00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:29,039
that standardizes how drupal will manage

00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,880
standalone javascript packages it covers

00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,720
many important topics that we believe

00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,440
will make our work a great contribution

00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,679
to the javascript evo ecosystem

00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,679
things like security coverage stable

00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,480
releases change logs continuous

00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,799
integration

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,960
code styles and more what we built is a

00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,960
hypothetical drupalcon web app

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,880
it serves as a reference single page

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,960
javascript application

00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,640
as you can see here we have a menu at

00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,640
the top of the screen

00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,840
without web services for decoupled menus

00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:57,520
in drupal core

00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,760
javascript developers are often forced

00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,400
to hard code menu items like these

00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,000
into their applications that means that

00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,279
every time a non-developer wants to

00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,840
change a menu item

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,760
a developer has to get involved that

00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,840
developer must make the change in code

00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,600
then rebuild the javascript application

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,960
and then must deploy those changes to

00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,120
production

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,200
these mini steps mean that even simple

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,000
changes can take hours or even days to

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
complete

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,200
depending on the developer's

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,039
availability and the complexity of the

00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,799
deployment process

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,960
our reference application showed that

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,919
providing menu items via drupal's json

00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,200
api

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,120
these deployment steps could be

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,039
completely eliminated and the decor

00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,120
javascript package could even reduce the

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:42,240
lines of code that a js developer has to

00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:45,120
write in the first place

00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,880
this simple use menu react hook could be

00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,720
one of the core javascript packages that

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,640
drupal eventually publishes

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,200
in order to improve the js developer

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,200
experience

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:58,720
now let's try following this logout link

00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,360
notice that it updates to a login link

00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,960
as soon as i do that's because this is a

00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,799
module defined menu link

00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,960
that's aware of the current user's

00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:09,039
authentication status

00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,000
if we look at the backend for this menu

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,320
we can see some other

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,520
module-defined and user-defined menu

00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,679
items

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,279
this home menu link is a module-defined

00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,400
menu item too

00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,400
let's try enabling it

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,320
as expected it appears as soon as we

00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,919
refresh the app

00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,080
this simple change that would have taken

00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,960
a coordinated effort to make if it were

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,200
hard coded

00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,919
takes only a click of a button even in

00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,480
this fully decoupled architecture

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,960
what about menu hierarchies the

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:41,200
reference app can handle those as well

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,360
let's reclaim some screen real estate by

00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,559
nesting these three track links into a

00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,799
drop down

00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:50,400
first we'll need to create a text only

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:53,120
menu item that doesn't link to anything

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:55,600
then we use the existing drupal menu eye

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,679
to nest our three tracks underneath it

00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,480
again we can refresh the app and the

00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,320
changes work as expected

00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,919
you may recognize that we didn't build

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,679
our own menu component

00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,400
this component is actually using the

00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:10,159
react bootstrap navbar

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,559
that highlights a very important change

00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:14,880
that we made in this discovery phase

00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,640
we realized that at this point in time

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,640
drupal shouldn't be trying to reinvent

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,559
the wheel by creating our own components

00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,799
with markup and styles

00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,720
instead we should integrate well with

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,480
the vibrant ecosystem of visual

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,760
components that already exist

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,600
so that it's easy for front-end

00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,039
developers to create and implement

00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,700
a unique look and feel for their

00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,880
projects

00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,640
[Music]

00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,960
what about user-defined menu items and

00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,720
routing let's see what that could look

00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,799
like by creating a new basic page for

00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,880
our application

00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:46,399
since this is a drupalcon app let's

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,399
embed video of the dressnote

00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,080
we'll create a menu item right here on

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,799
the node edit form and label it

00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,799
watch live

00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,919
we'll also give it a custom url alias

00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,240
sure enough as soon as we refresh the

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,000
app our menu item appears

00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,080
if we follow that link it indeed

00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,919
respects our custom url alias

00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,200
even in this single page application

00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,480
using react router

00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,080
a popular client-side routing library

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,480
what happens when the trees node is no

00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:18,240
longer live could a non-developer make

00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,840
that change on the fly

00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,159
while it wasn't on the original list of

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,840
foreseen challenges we also validated

00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,640
that these menus work with drupal's

00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,279
access control and publishing workflows

00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,880
all we have to do is unpublish the node

00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,520
since we followed that logout link

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,039
earlier

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,720
the menu item will automatically

00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,760
disappear once we navigate to a

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,240
different page

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,279
since we no longer have access to it as

00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,279
an anonymous visitor

00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,919
as you can see we've been working on

00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,640
some really cool and exciting things

00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,360
we have a few next steps what you saw in

00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,360
this demo

00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:53,840
isn't relying on very much new code at

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:55,440
all but there are a few minor changes

00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:59,200
that we need to get committed to core in

00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:01,840
order to add menu data to its http apis

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,960
the use menu react hook is only a proof

00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,640
of concept

00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,880
we want to build and ship javascript

00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,600
packages that are well documented

00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,840
production ready and continuously tested

00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,760
just last week we made our first commits

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,039
to the repository that will become the

00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:18,000
first official drupal core

00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:20,559
javascript package we also need to drive

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,320
the rfc draft to adoption

00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,240
we're happy to report that we're already

00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,399
working with the drupal security team

00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,159
the drupal core committer team and at

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:31,039
the drupal association

00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,480
to make all of it happen last but

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,880
definitely not least

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,760
we want your help if you're interested

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,520
in this project

00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,919
and want to volunteer or follow our

00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,640
progress please come join us in drupal

00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,480
slack

00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,799
in the decoupled menus initiative

00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,679
channel thanks for watching

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,679
see you again soon

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,440
awesome like if this were an in-person

00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,080
event so this is where there would be

00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,240
cheering

00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,760
and people would you know be excited and

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,320
you know and rightfully so

00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,480
right like this is a pretty impressive

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:05,039
demo in a short amount of time

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,799
the big deal about this in my opinion is

00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,520
that the experience the developer

00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:09,679
experience

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,600
and the marketer experience or the

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,919
content creator experience

00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,799
is actually better than that of our

00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,640
competitors

00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:18,080
it's better than contentful if we can

00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,880
pull this off

00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,000
which is exciting so as you could see

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,720
even though it was a proof of

00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,679
concept we kind of showed you a lot of

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,480
the things here

00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,520
up on the mountain track um you know

00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,640
indicated in

00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,919
in white but as we also learned

00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:39,520
or maybe confirmed is a better word

00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:41,120
is that the menu specific code wasn't

00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,880
really the hard part

00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,799
the hard part is the things that are

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,799
ahead of us up on the mountain

00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,080
the things that are maybe not specific

00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:50,159
to menus

00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,080
but those things related to release

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,279
management

00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,919
testing documentation security

00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:00,159
all of those things are important things

00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,159
and we're actively figuring these out

00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,279
with the help of the drupal association

00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:05,519
the security team

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,720
and many other people so lots of great

00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,760
progress

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,840
um so really to wrap up this section

00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,200
uh one of the things you know that we

00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,360
did is we renamed

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,440
the initiative so it's no longer called

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,640
the javascript menu component initiative

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,200
but instead

00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,279
it will be called the decoupled menus

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,000
initiative and that's simply because

00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:27,440
as gabe explained we realized we

00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,799
actually don't have to build the

00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:30,960
components ourselves

00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,000
really great components exist all we

00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,919
need to do

00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,080
is write some library code if you will

00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,720
to integrate with these components so we

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,760
felt

00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,840
this was a more appropriate name

00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,919
as gabe mentioned we've put together a

00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,760
great team of people lots of people are

00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,440
helping here are some of the people

00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,039
that have been involved we've had weekly

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,840
meetings uh you're

00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,559
more than invited to join these meetings

00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:55,360
as well

00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,919
but then one thing that gabe didn't

00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,080
mention

00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,559
and that i'm excited to announce today

00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:02,799
is that we're actually um

00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,679
promoting if you will two people from

00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,320
that team

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,200
uh just a fish or sally a nod or

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,399
theodore

00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,720
to become two new core committers

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,080
and that's a big deal uh because the

00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,440
core committee team is quite

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,480
small but adding two javascript

00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,919
focused core committers is really

00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:29,039
going to help us here and hopefully

00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:31,519
demonstrates our commitment

00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:33,120
the script architectures in in drupal so

00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:36,080
i'm very excited about that

00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,720
uh welcome to the team uh just the fish

00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,240
and

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,600
not all right

00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,000
so to wrap up um you know this section

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,880
you know something that we did right is

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,200
to solve

00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,519
important problems problems that really

00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:54,640
matter that were relevant

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,360
and be not afraid to embrace um

00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,880
technical innovation right and so we're

00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,120
continuing to do that

00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,480
with this initiative and uh i'm very

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,360
excited about it

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,840
now there's other drupal 10 initiatives

00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,240
um

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,679
i talked about these in my previous

00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,640
greece note when we

00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:14,320
launch them i won't give a detailed

00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:16,240
update on these here

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,960
but overall they're actually tracking

00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,279
well right three of the five are green

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,799
which means they're really doing well

00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,600
and two out of the

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:28,000
five are yellow so easy out of the box

00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,720
there's some really great work going on

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,840
on claro and other parts but we do need

00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,240
a little bit more help

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,919
with layout builder and media management

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,559
to make those a default

00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:40,720
out of the box solutions drupal 10

00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,399
readiness is a similar story lots of

00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,080
great things happening

00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:47,360
um with symphony support php 8 support

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,919
you know you name it

00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,760
but we do also have some gaps where we

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:54,399
need more help with jquery

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,039
as well as ck editor so looking for

00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,399
people

00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,399
to help us with these

00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,600
for more details there was actually a

00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,240
dedicated session

00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,080
at this drupalcon yesterday where each

00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,360
of the initiatives presented sort of

00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,760
their status

00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:11,200
and also ways for all of you to get

00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,240
involved so i would encourage you to

00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,879
check out

00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:17,599
that session it was recorded and these

00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:19,679
recordings will be made available so

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,839
definitely go check that out all right

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,480
so that was kind of the first section

00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:25,359
next i want to move on to things that i

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,240
would have done

00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:29,440
differently if i could start over again

00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:32,399
what would i change

00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,280
right and so the first item is all about

00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:38,560
a focus on ease of use

00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:41,119
um so the screenshot that you see here

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,240
is again a screenshot from a blog post

00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,560
that i wrote

00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,399
where i kind of you know said that for

00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,599
the longest time i was so

00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:52,079
focused on the purity of the code

00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,760
writing like beautiful code and i

00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,879
completely neglected

00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:58,000
ease of use as well as you know look and

00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:01,359
feel

00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,880
and you know i regret that basically and

00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:05,119
on this screenshot

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,640
that i'm showing now it's actually a

00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,839
screenshot of what the

00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:12,000
drupal back-end ui looked like

00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,680
uh it's kind of hard to see because i

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,599
couldn't find a better screenshot a

00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,160
bigger screenshot because it's

00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,079
probably 18 years old or something but

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,160
if you pay really close attention to the

00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,960
screenshot you can see that the links at

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,400
the top

00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,480
you know that represents the

00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,359
administration menu that we had at the

00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,040
time

00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:30,560
but if you pay close attention you can

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,160
see that they're actually sorted

00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,119
alphabetically

00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,119
so basically there's almost no

00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,560
organization to it other than sorting

00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,720
them alphabetically

00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,960
and it's a great example of how i

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:47,200
ignored ease of use

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:49,280
or user experience right and

00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,480
you know what happened is uh you know

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,320
drupal

00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,760
the drupal project attracted other

00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,320
developers you know people

00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,440
also interested in sort of that purity

00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,079
of the code

00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,000
and that led to some singular thinking

00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,839
and for the longest time

00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,040
drupal was built by developers for

00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,720
developers

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,560
and in some ways we're still kind of

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,839
suffering from that tunnel vision

00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,359
frankly and

00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:14,000
fortunately today we're a lot more

00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,400
focused on end users but it took a while

00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,119
it took a long time to break out of that

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,440
mindset

00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,599
and there was some drama along the way

00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,800
when we decided to focus on ease of use

00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,440
like people didn't like it

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,880
it's hard to maybe believe now but at

00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,560
the time that was very much

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,400
the case and so the big lesson learned

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,720
is that it doesn't really matter

00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,839
which technology is the best or is the

00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,720
most pure

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:39,680
in the end it's all about the end user

00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,000
experience

00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,359
it also doesn't matter who came first or

00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,160
second

00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:48,480
like wordpress in my opinion you know is

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,640
obviously more widely used

00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,079
but i'm very convinced that drupal is

00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,240
actually technically better

00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,520
and so it's a great example of of that

00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,560
as well right so

00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:02,240
in the end it's all about the end user

00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,200
experience and so one thing that i would

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,839
do differently

00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,040
is that i would try to be what i call be

00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,760
compelling beyond

00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,119
codes which means we have to think about

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:14,480
promotion and marketing

00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:16,640
branding fortunately we have a new logo

00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,640
but also about the ease of use of the

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,720
product and that includes

00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:23,359
great documentation that includes a

00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:27,040
great installation experience

00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:27,920
etc etc right and so we have made that

00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,400
transition

00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,240
i think there's more work to be done but

00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:34,240
definitely a lesson learned

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,440
for me personally and hopefully one that

00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,560
we can all

00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:39,680
take to heart the second thing that i

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,760
would do differently

00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,760
has to do with how open source is

00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,560
developed and to explain that actually

00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,760
have to go back

00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:51,200
in time a little bit but open source

00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,800
you know 25 years ago or so was really a

00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,960
renegade movement

00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,720
you know it was a rejection of all

00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:59,280
things proprietary

00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:00,320
rooted in a strong desire for personal

00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,560
freedom

00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:04,160
and in my case i got involved with open

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,880
source like 22

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,599
23 years ago i was very excited about

00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,640
that

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:13,920
i wanted to be part of that movement um

00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,640
but after a few years in drupal what we

00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,119
saw

00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,240
is that we started to see companies

00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:20,400
involved with drupal

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,720
you know people built digital agencies

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,560
drupal shops around drupal and we and

00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,200
ended up actually with a healthy

00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,440
commercial ecosystem around drupal

00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:31,440
and i saw the advantages of that you

00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,480
know i saw how that would help drive

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,400
drupal's adoption

00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:37,359
and i actually really encouraged it and

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,960
helped promote the commercial ecosystem

00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,960
but it wasn't always easy for the

00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,920
community i mean i remember when we

00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:45,599
hired

00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,920
our first full-time paid contributors

00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:50,000
you know i think it was jacob reading at

00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,359
the drupal association or neil drumm

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,400
you know these were amongst the first

00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:56,720
hires ever and it cost like a shockwave

00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,560
in the drupal community people thought

00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,040
we had ruined the project

00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,640
because people were working on drupal

00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,440
full-time and getting paid

00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,760
to work on drupal or i remember how

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:11,040
people drupal would

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:13,200
fail once i announced that i had raised

00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,640
seven million dollars to start a company

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,800
around drupal aqua

00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,839
people were really freaked out about

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,320
that

00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:21,680
um and so in many ways we saw kind of

00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:24,480
like the rejection

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,680
of commercial interest but to me too

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,599
many people confuse

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,720
commercial efforts with proprietary

00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,320
efforts

00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,119
you know we have to be thoughtful about

00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,520
how we think about these things

00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:37,200
and even today commercial interests

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,800
still get some backlash

00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,800
but in my mind if you look at the

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,520
history of drupal

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,359
um you know the commercial interest in

00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:49,119
drupal has actually

00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:51,359
allowed us to grow much faster you know

00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,680
um i think it really helped us to stay

00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:56,240
in the project and you can see that

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,800
on this chart and actually today

00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,480
two-thirds of all of the contributions

00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,359
are sponsored meaning paid for by

00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,880
organizations

00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,119
and so in a way it's probably fair to

00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,000
say that we're dependent now

00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,599
on those commercial sponsors right like

00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,640
what would the world look like without

00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:15,760
them today

00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,680
and so commercial interests i think are

00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,920
actually really valuable

00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,520
for you know all these reasons but also

00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,839
for other reasons like commercial

00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,680
interests allow us to be a more diverse

00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:28,560
and inclusive community

00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,119
because not everybody can contribute in

00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,359
their

00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,400
free time you know free time is still a

00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,400
privilege

00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,839
not everybody has it so not everybody

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,599
can contribute

00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:41,599
on their free time obviously today

00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:43,440
we have contributions coming from a lot

00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,680
of different organizations

00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,560
over a thousand actually over a thousand

00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,440
hundred

00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:51,440
different organizations and that's super

00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,160
healthy that we have that many people

00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,160
that many organizations involved and and

00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,240
all of that actually let me

00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:59,920
to take an even stronger stance

00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,839
something that i started talking about

00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:05,040
you know one or two years ago

00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:07,200
which is that i believe we need to

00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:08,960
not only encourage commercial interest

00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:12,400
but we should actually

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,160
actively reward the makers

00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,000
right if we want to maximize

00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:18,560
contribution we should

00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,520
promote and reward the makers and the

00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,160
makers are those

00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,119
organizations who contribute back to

00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,880
drupal

00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:27,359
you know and this in contrast with

00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,800
takers who don't contribute to drupal or

00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:32,000
contribute maybe

00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,400
very very little and we must reward the

00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,720
makers to encourage them to invest more

00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,400
and it's kind of the equivalent to you

00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,160
know shopping local

00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,640
i'm sure you've seen that in your local

00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:45,040
community but to help sustain

00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,240
a community whether it's your local

00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:49,040
community

00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,839
or the drupal community we need to

00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,680
encourage

00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:55,119
end users to do business with the makers

00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,680
right that's how you sustain those

00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:59,200
communities and it also means steering

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,319
away business

00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,240
from takers to discourage them and

00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:06,160
importantly while we do that we

00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:09,280
obviously have to work

00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:13,200
with the takers and encourage them

00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:15,200
to become makers right and so

00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,119
for me that's really kind of my second

00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,319
thing that i would do differently

00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:22,079
is to embrace that faster you know

00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:25,440
looking back i see

00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:28,240
all the value that comes from having

00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,520
a healthy and balanced ecosystem with

00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,000
volunteers

00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:34,319
and organizations contributing but i

00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,680
also recognize that for organizations to

00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:38,480
contribute

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,359
um there's things that we can do to help

00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,400
reward them

00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:45,040
for that behavior all right so that's

00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,640
the two big things that i would um do

00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,240
differently

00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,319
lastly i want to talk a little bit about

00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,720
things that surprised me

00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:53,520
before i do i wanted to show you a quick

00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:59,839
you know one

00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:59,839
one minute video so please take a look

00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,240
i have a concept that i go back to and

00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,560
it's a concept that should be familiar

00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,640
to

00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,720
everybody since the beginning of human

00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:10,960
history it's idea of the commons

00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,640
this shared place in the center of town

00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,720
town square

00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,319
the quad but it's the place where you

00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,520
come together your community

00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:19,760
and you can listen to people on

00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,680
soapboxes with different ideas

00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,520
and you can be very different but you

00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,359
come together because you know together

00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,359
we're stronger than being a part and

00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:28,880
today when i think of the commons

00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,400
i think i extend it to kind of the

00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,000
resources we all share

00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:34,720
collectively owned like the air we

00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,000
breathe i think of schools

00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,280
parks i think of the intelligence we

00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,359
share

00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:43,040
we can share in libraries or the

00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,000
internet and i think the internet's

00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,119
important in this

00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,119
digital age that shared humanity that

00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:51,040
access to be together in the commons is

00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,640
at our fingertips

00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,319
but we're not using it that way we're

00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,240
not coming together

00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:58,400
to choose that path towards the commons

00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:01,760
and to be with each other

00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,760
you also have to choose love

00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,520
that's a hard thing but i know you can't

00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,160
go to the town square

00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:08,720
filled with hate for the town you can't

00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,119
lead

00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,839
a people you don't love you can't lead a

00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:15,760
country

00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:17,119
you don't love and uh

00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,720
i don't think you can change the world

00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,160
and say i'm only gonna change it for the

00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:21,760
people just like me my own circle of

00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,319
friends not for the people i hate not

00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:25,839
for them

00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:28,880
it doesn't work so this is

00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:30,640
just a snippet of a great presentation i

00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:33,280
encourage you to watch it

00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,200
um i wanted to play the video because

00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,720
when i watched it it got me thinking

00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,480
you know got me thinking about a whole

00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,720
bunch of things actually but

00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,920
uh it also really got me thinking about

00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,880
the evolution

00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,680
of my my why you know why do i do what i

00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,920
do

00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,119
right and if i think about that the

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,760
reason i

00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:52,400
i'm part of the drupal project is for a

00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,079
number of

00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:56,720
different reasons like when i started

00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:58,000
drupal i just wanted to learn php

00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,839
and my sequel i wanted to build

00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,640
something for me and a handful of

00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:03,920
friends

00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,680
so i build it for myself but as drupal

00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,520
started to grow

00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,280
i started to care more about other

00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,200
people contributing to drupal

00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,400
so all of a sudden i was caring about

00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,359
code contributors

00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:17,200
which is basically people like me and

00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,280
over time i started caring about

00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:20,960
end users we talked a little bit about

00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,440
that right

00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,079
and today i actually care about what i

00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,800
call

00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,760
non-users which is interesting right

00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,319
because

00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,440
non-users are people that have never

00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:34,560
used drupal

00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,480
and frankly may never use drupal ever

00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,240
but i still care about those people

00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,240
because

00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,599
of things like the open web it's about

00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,800
making the web open

00:45:41,599 --> 00:45:46,240
and making sure it remains open right so

00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,240
that's an example of caring about

00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:52,319
non-users

00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,319
but the big thing here is that over time

00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,760
for me personally making an impact on

00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:00,000
others

00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:02,480
became more and more important

00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,200
the other realization that comes with

00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,839
that for me

00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,280
is that everybody's why is deeply

00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:10,319
personal

00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:13,599
and everybody's why can be different

00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:16,319
and also everybody's why like my why

00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:18,079
can evolve over time and that's in a way

00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:21,200
kind of the messy part

00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:23,760
when we talk about our purpose or

00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,640
our why right like there's maybe not one

00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,920
why

00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,760
um it's hard to define a singular why

00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,079
and today

00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,280
when i think about my why they're all

00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,960
still there

00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,280
and that's that's the interesting part

00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,319
to me you know i still do drupal for

00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:39,920
myself

00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:42,000
because i'm still learning so much from

00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,800
drupal and that was my original why

00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:46,640
to learn about new technologies but i do

00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,720
drupal because it's my livelihood

00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,680
you know i've been getting paid if you

00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,079
will to do drupal for 13 14 years

00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:55,200
i love being part of a community and i'm

00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:57,200
very interested in

00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,920
being part of the future of the web

00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:01,920
building software that everyone can use

00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,960
so all of these things are compounding

00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,520
for me

00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:06,960
in a way so there's not a single reason

00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:10,079
it's a combination of

00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:12,319
all of these reasons

00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,680
and as you know nisha said in the video

00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:15,760
clip that i showed

00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:17,119
you know you can come to the town square

00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,520
with hate in your heart

00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:21,599
i mean i love that sentence and i think

00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,599
of drupal as sort of the ultimate

00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,400
town square you know drupal is the

00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,880
comments that she references

00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:29,920
and my big takeaway is that you can't

00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,960
really make

00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:33,839
global change without caring for

00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,319
everyone

00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:38,000
or almost everyone you know you can't

00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:41,040
lead a people you don't love

00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,160
she said which was so beautiful

00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:46,240
and so to maximize impact you have to

00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,800
care for people you don't know

00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,960
and ultimately if we have to pick a why

00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:53,520
if we have to pick a purpose

00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:55,440
i think that's what we have to pick

00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,760
right we have to pick

00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:59,280
the fact that we care for the web that

00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:03,359
we want to build

00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:05,599
an open web a web for all um

00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:06,559
because the web impacts everyone it's a

00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,319
part of

00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,559
modern life you know it's a key

00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:13,760
component of education of

00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:15,119
communication of collaboration of

00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:17,680
business of

00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:18,960
entertainment of society as a whole and

00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,000
so

00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:23,839
we have to build a web for everyone like

00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,160
literally everyone

00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:28,240
you know and i think we have a big role

00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:31,680
to play in that as one of the largest

00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:34,240
open source content management systems

00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:35,119
and so web for all i think is a really

00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,280
important goal

00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:39,599
it's it's worthy our time and our

00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:42,240
attention and our commitment because

00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:42,720
it doesn't only help everybody that's

00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,440
sort of

00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,559
around today it helps everybody that's

00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:48,640
about to

00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,160
come online and get access to the

00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,640
internet and it's helping

00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:55,760
everyone that comes after us frankly too

00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:58,960
like our children and our grandchildren

00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:00,079
these kinds of things and needless to

00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,800
say

00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:04,079
diversity and inclusion are also a big

00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:06,960
part of that

00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:08,319
right and so that's kind of sort of my

00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,520
second point here

00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:13,599
um you know as i mentioned

00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:16,079
something that i didn't expect it right

00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:19,440
um because that's the the topic here but

00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:21,040
as i mentioned i started drupal thinking

00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:22,400
just about myself

00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,800
you know i think that was okay right

00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,160
because i was scratching my own itch

00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,160
and i didn't really think about

00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,680
diversity and inclusion i literally

00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,160
didn't think about it

00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,000
i was building drupal for myself and for

00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:35,839
the people closest to me

00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,680
and ultimately i actually made a bad

00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:41,119
joke a sexist joke

00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:44,720
at drupalcon copenhagen 2007 like

00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:46,400
you know 13 14 years ago and

00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:48,400
you know i got called out by a few

00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,599
people in the audience and after my

00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,880
keynote

00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:56,400
and specifically called out by people

00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:58,079
i would say not from europe and at first

00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:00,960
i was

00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:03,920
kind of frustrated by that and i kind of

00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,839
said i mean it's political correctness

00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:08,720
but what i've learned since is that

00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:11,040
those jokes they actually hurt people

00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:13,040
you know i hurt people's feelings and i

00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,599
i felt really bad about it that i felt

00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:16,480
awful

00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:19,040
that i hurt people's feelings and i

00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:21,040
apologized obviously

00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,800
but it's when i understood that that

00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:25,839
joke kind of was

00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,880
exclusive you know like it excluded

00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:29,839
people

00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:30,880
and so i finally understood that it had

00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:33,760
nothing to do

00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,960
with political correctness and that's

00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,319
when i started

00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:39,520
to realize over time didn't come like in

00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:42,319
one

00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:43,599
flash but over time i started to realize

00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:46,079
that

00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:46,800
diversity and inclusion really really

00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,680
matters

00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,119
that in order to build a web for

00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,960
everyone

00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:54,319
everybody needs to be part of building

00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,319
drupal

00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:57,440
it has to be that way or it doesn't work

00:50:56,319 --> 00:51:00,800
otherwise

00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:03,839
and so we have to care for and love

00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,520
everyone or almost everyone and that's

00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:06,800
why i'm so proud of the work that we're

00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,480
doing now you know like

00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:11,680
there's so many examples but i'm proud

00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:14,079
of the focus on accessibility

00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:16,079
within the drupal project you know and

00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,160
the fact that we take that serious

00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:19,440
i'm also excited about all sorts of

00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:22,640
features that we launch

00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:23,760
that help like drupal 9.1 which we just

00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,960
released

00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:28,559
we have lazy loading of images may sound

00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,240
like a small feature but

00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,240
it actually helps people with slower

00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:35,200
internet connections and that's awesome

00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,760
that helps us be more uh inclusive and

00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:39,440
you know

00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:41,359
embraces uh the diversity

00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:43,119
and it's also i'm happy to see more

00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:45,200
sponsors development frankly

00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:47,440
because as i mentioned free time is

00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,599
still a privilege for many

00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:52,160
and that's all of this is not something

00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:54,800
that i understood 20 years ago

00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:56,400
not not even 15 years ago so it took me

00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,400
a while to understand it

00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:00,000
and so looking back that definitely

00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,319
surprised me right and so if i think

00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:06,400
about the things that surprised me

00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:09,040
um is that i didn't expect to be caring

00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,240
about the open web when i started drupal

00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:13,760
and i didn't expect

00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:16,319
to be focused on helping to cultivate a

00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,800
diverse and inclusive community

00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:21,440
and so to wrap up my presentation and to

00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,839
put it all together

00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,680
if you want to optimize for impact which

00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,319
i want to do and i hope we all want to

00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:29,440
do

00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:32,800
we have to solve real problems and we

00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:35,920
should continue to embrace innovation

00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,119
and new technologies but we also need to

00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:40,079
maximize

00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,960
our speed you know we need to go fast as

00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,280
a project

00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,960
and to go fast we need to reward the

00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:48,880
makers it's something that we really

00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,880
have to start doing more of

00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,960
it's not enough to have a great product

00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,839
or great technology you also have to be

00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:57,119
compelling

00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:59,280
beyond code you have to advocate it you

00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:02,400
have to promote it you have to market it

00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:05,599
you have to make it easy to adopt right

00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,520
we have to focus on a web for all with

00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:10,400
accessibility in mind and all of these

00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:11,839
things and last but not least

00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,480
the only way we're going to be able to

00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:17,680
do that and truly maximize our impact

00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:19,200
is to also build and cultivate a very

00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:22,400
diverse and inclusive

00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,520
community and so that's what i wanted to

00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:25,760
talk about

00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:26,960
i'm sure some of you may say well it's

00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,800
all nice and

00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,480
but what are we actually going to do

00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,559
about it right

00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,760
and i think that's a fair question now

00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:36,400
we have been working

00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,400
um on this and heather uh rocker from

00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:41,599
the drupal association will

00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,680
join us on the virtual stage but heather

00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:45,040
and her staff and the board of directors

00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,119
including myself

00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:49,520
we've been working the last few months

00:53:47,119 --> 00:53:50,800
on sort of an action plan for the drupal

00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,640
association

00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,920
and she's going to talk a little bit

00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,720
about that

00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:58,559
and i think you'll see how it ties into

00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:00,960
some of the things

00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:03,200
that i just spoke about so without

00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,920
further ado heather welcome

00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,920

00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,640
things that you talked about

00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:23,119

stay put i'll be here and i'll bring you

00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:29,920

okay great all right well thanks again

00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:35,599
dries for sharing your why with us uh

00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,559
we at the drupal association have been

00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:39,200
focused on

00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:40,799
ry as part of our strategic planning

00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:43,280
this year as well

00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:44,880
and so before i get to the drupal

00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:46,640
association's why

00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,880
i'd really like to talk about my

00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,720
personal why just to tag into a little

00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:52,319
bit of what dries talked about

00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:56,799
and how it applies to my work with

00:54:52,319 --> 00:54:56,799
drupal in leading the drupal association

00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:04,079
as i mentioned at ned camp last month i

00:55:02,079 --> 00:55:04,559
believe drupal has the potential to

00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:08,160
create

00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,160
positive impact in the world

00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:12,880
for me my personal values and my

00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,160
professional talents really align best

00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,799
when i'm working with

00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:18,559
purpose toward a mission and i've had a

00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:21,280
chance this year to see just how much

00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:23,440
drupal enables those doing good work

00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:26,480
allowing them to do it both efficiently

00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:28,559
and effectively

00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:31,760
i'm also driven by the opportunity for

00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:33,680
all of us to serve as drupal ambassadors

00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:35,680
we really have an opportunity to make

00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:36,160
connections and partnerships around the

00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,079
world

00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:39,440
not only to empower organizations

00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:41,760
through open source

00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:43,040
but to empower individual careers as

00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,880
well

00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:46,960
so the local associations and

00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,240
organizations you see on this slide

00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,720
partnered with us at the drupal

00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,520
association to recruit over 150

00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:53,920
drupalcon

00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:55,760
scholarship attendees this summer most

00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,599
of whom were new to drupal

00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,440
so these are the moments that inspire me

00:55:57,599 --> 00:56:03,839
to push ahead and i hope that they

00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:05,280
inspire you as a community as well

00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,880
so if we talk about our drupal

00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,880
association vision

00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,400
which the vision for an organization is

00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,119
the ultimate goal right

00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:16,799
and ours is ultimately a safe secure and

00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:17,839
open web for everyone so we get there

00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:19,520
through our mission

00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:21,760
which is to accelerate the drupal

00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:24,799
project and support the growth of our

00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:24,799
drupal community

00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:29,119
once you know your why you have to

00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:31,040
figure out the how

00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:32,880
so this year as dries mentioned i had

00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:34,240
the opportunity to collaborate with our

00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,240
board of directors

00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:38,480
to create a three-year roadmap for our

00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,880
work and what this is gonna do

00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:43,119
is give us additional focus and energy

00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:45,040
around how we meet our mission

00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:47,359
i'll talk more about how we're already

00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:50,880
putting this strategic plan into motion

00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:52,799
in just a bit first i want to take a

00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,920
moment to give thanks to our supporting

00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:55,839
partners

00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:58,319
funding from these organizations is

00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:59,599
critical in supporting the non-drupalcon

00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:01,839
work that we do

00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,839
which includes supporting the

00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:05,680
development of drupal 9 and getting

00:57:03,839 --> 00:57:08,240
ready for drupal 10

00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:10,400
maintaining drupal.org funding

00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,359
infrastructure and contribution testing

00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,440
fees

00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:14,640
emphasizing diversity equity and

00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,960
inclusion

00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,559
enabling contribution and expanding the

00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,680
types of contribution that get

00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:21,599
recognized

00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,799
and collaborating with various drupal

00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,559
working groups

00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:27,839
like the security working group which

00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:29,680
helps keep the project secure

00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:34,160
so thank you again to our supporting

00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:34,160
partners that make this work possible

00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:40,000
again this is an opportunity for anyone

00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,000
who might not be

00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,760
a supporting organization at this time

00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:48,480
but is interested you can reach us at

00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,480
partnerships at association.drupal.org

00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,960
and we can't talk about support without

00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:55,040
talking about drupal cares

00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:57,280
so the drupal association along with so

00:57:55,040 --> 00:58:00,559
many other organizations was deeply

00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:02,400
impacted by the kovid 19 crisis

00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:04,319
earlier this year we had a lot of

00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,160
difficult community conversations about

00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:08,559
what the project would look like if the

00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:11,680
drupal association wasn't able to exist

00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:13,440
anymore because of that impact

00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:15,200
as we worked through every possible

00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,799
financial scenario

00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:18,720
we got a clear signal from you the

00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:19,680
community that you stood by ready to

00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:21,200
help

00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:24,799
and the drupal cares emergency

00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:26,640
fundraising campaign was born

00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:28,319
early into the launch of drupal cares

00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,760
dries and his wife vanessa gave an

00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:32,240
incredible pledge of support to

00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,920
encourage other donations

00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,520
then a group of dedicated drupal

00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,400
business leaders came together to make

00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:39,839
the campaign

00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:41,599
even better this group announced the

00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:43,440
launch of yet another matching gift

00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:44,480
challenge which made every individual

00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,240
cash donation

00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:48,559
and new or renewed membership have

00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,480
triple the impact

00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:52,640
community members got creative and we

00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,559
saw wonderful projects emerge to support

00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:57,200
the cause

00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:58,640
every action mattered every donation

00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:01,119
every message of support

00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:02,880
every membership you made a difference

00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:04,640
and you ensured that we met the drupal

00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:07,680
cares emergency fundraising goal

00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:08,400
in record time you demonstrated once

00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,400
again

00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,319
the power of the drupal community the

00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:16,000
sustainability of drupal

00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:16,000
and the importance of open source

00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:19,760
and thanks to all of that support we

00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,960
were able to keep working on the things

00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,640
that matter most

00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,640
so i want to highlight a bit of what the

00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,200
drupal association has accomplished this

00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,960
year

00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,480
in support of project innovation and

00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:32,720
contribution enablement

00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:34,000
despite the daunting challenges of 2020.

00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:36,000
as we like to say at the drupal

00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:36,400
association we build the tools to help

00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,040
you

00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:40,000
the community build drupal and as you

00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:41,520
can see with all the

00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:43,599
individuals and organizations

00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:47,839
contributing we're one of the most

00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:49,760
active open source projects in the world

00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:51,359
this spring we released the new

00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,359
evergreen drupal logo

00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:55,119
it was designed to support the drupal 9

00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:57,200
launch and beyond

00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:59,040
and not only did drupal 9 launch but it

00:59:57,200 --> 01:00:01,359
launched in the earliest of three

00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,160
projected release windows on june 3rd of

01:00:01,359 --> 01:00:04,319
this year

01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:07,040
marking an incredible accomplishment for

01:00:04,319 --> 01:00:09,440
all involved

01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:10,480
our community of innovation as i like to

01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,400
look at it

01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,760
is fueled by collective wisdom and

01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,000
contribution

01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:17,280
and the launch of drupal 9 on time and

01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:19,760
in a year of crisis

01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,880
is an example of that amazing collective

01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:22,319
effort

01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:24,400
here's a quick look at the global

01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:26,400
contribution to drupal 9.

01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,839
and since we're at drupalcon europe i

01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,640
want to say a special thank you to

01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:31,040
europe

01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:32,880
uh who for your continued leadership as

01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:35,440
contributors you can see that

01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,240
in this pie chart you're a major part of

01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,040
the success

01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,040
of drupal 9.

01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:44,160
so one initiative we're incredibly

01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,920
incredibly proud to celebrate

01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:47,440
is the launch of merge requests on

01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,520
drupal.org

01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:51,359
the drupal.org merge request feature

01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:52,720
gives contributors a more advanced

01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:54,720
modern workflow

01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:56,079
and should make it easier for developers

01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,240
familiar with github

01:00:56,079 --> 01:01:00,079
git lab or other tools who want to join

01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:02,079
the drupal community

01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:04,400
issue forks and merge requests have only

01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:05,920
been available for about a month now

01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,599
and yet we're seeing contribution

01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,680
accelerate as a result of that

01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:12,079
implementation

01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,920
it's been inspiring i've seen twitter

01:01:12,079 --> 01:01:15,920
threads and heard stories of people who

01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:17,599
haven't contributed in years

01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,119
that are coming back to join in to

01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:20,960
drupal again

01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:22,160
i'm also hearing about contributors who

01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,440
are diving in

01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:25,680
where previously they were too

01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:27,119
intimidated or unfamiliar with the patch

01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:29,520
workflows before

01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:31,680
so this is an incredible win and one

01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:34,000
that took years of drupal association

01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:36,160
and community effort so thank you to

01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,559
everyone who provided feedback along the

01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,960
way

01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:40,960
helped with testing and to those using

01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,240
it now to make drupal the best cms on

01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,839
the web

01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:45,920
if you've not contributed to drupal

01:01:43,839 --> 01:01:47,920
before now is your time

01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:49,839
there are contribution mentors here at

01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:51,200
drupalcon europe all week who can help

01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:52,559
you get started

01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,000
please take a moment to visit their

01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:57,359
booth at the exhibit hall to get

01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,359
connected to next steps

01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,920
i'm also really proud that we launched

01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:04,319
the drupal steward program

01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:06,160
so if you don't know drupal steward is a

01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:07,200
joint program between the drupal

01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:10,000
security team

01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:11,920
and the drupal association it offers a

01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,920
web application firewall

01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:15,839
that protects sites from certain highly

01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,960
critical and mass exploitable

01:02:15,839 --> 01:02:19,599
vulnerabilities

01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:21,359
easy for me to say right not so much it

01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:24,000
gives you the chance to

01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:25,119
update sites on your time when it's more

01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:27,039
convenient

01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:28,480
so it really allows you to manage your

01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:30,400
teams in a healthy

01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:33,200
non-panicked way when it comes to

01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:35,520
security updates

01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,799
our drupal steward founding partners uh

01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:39,200
from our platform level

01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:41,200
are aquia and pantheon so those

01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:42,720
organizations are now able to deploy

01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:45,680
drupal steward protection

01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:46,400
across their entire customer base that

01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,400
said

01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:50,000
through our community tier and our

01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,920
agency partner program

01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,839
we're also able to provide drupal

01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:55,839
stewart directly for those partners who

01:02:53,839 --> 01:02:57,200
want to protect their client sites

01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:59,760
and for those that want to buy it

01:02:57,200 --> 01:03:01,440
directly as site owners

01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:03,359
if you're interested in learning more

01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,720
you can go to this url to set up a

01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:06,000
consultation

01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:07,760
and in case you're worried that getting

01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:09,760
started is difficult we've seen

01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,880
site owners activate with as little as a

01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,880
20 minute phone call

01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:17,359
so now that we've had a chance to look

01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:21,200
back at 2020 highlights i want to switch

01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:21,200
gears and talk about what's next

01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:25,599
as i mentioned earlier we recently

01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:27,680
crafted a three-year strategic plan to

01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:30,000
focus the work of the association

01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,119
in order to provide maximum impact for

01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,119
drupal

01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:35,119
i'd like to provide an overview of these

01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:37,119
projects we already have in motion to

01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:39,039
support these strategic goals

01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:40,640
you'll notice that many of them align to

01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:41,440
the imperatives that dries just

01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:45,599
mentioned

01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:47,359
in alignment with success for drupal

01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:48,799
first let's talk about diversity and

01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:51,520
inclusion

01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:53,200
we know we have an issue in open source

01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:56,839
and i'm really committed

01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:58,079
that it's time for all of us to take

01:03:56,839 --> 01:03:59,920
action

01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:02,400
a clear business case for making

01:03:59,920 --> 01:04:04,079
diversity and inclusion a priority

01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:06,160
this work is important to drupal's

01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:06,880
success and needs to be a collaborative

01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:10,000
effort

01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:11,760
across our entire community and i do

01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,160
want to thank those leading the way

01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,640
including drupal diversity and inclusion

01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,880
and all of the individuals organizations

01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,359
and

01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:23,520
agencies that are making diversity and

01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:25,599
inclusion a priority in your workplace

01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:27,520
one way that we are supporting this goal

01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:29,440
is through a community driven program to

01:04:27,520 --> 01:04:31,200
provide drupal talent development

01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:32,640
with an emphasis on diversity and

01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,880
inclusion

01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:36,880
so you'll see a little information here

01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:39,520
and what we are doing is working with

01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:41,039
the community to develop a pilot program

01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:42,799
for talent development

01:04:41,039 --> 01:04:44,160
which is going to include three career

01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:46,079
pathways for the pilot

01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:50,160
that's going to be front end developer

01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:50,160
site builder and back end developer

01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:54,160
thank you to all the drupal

01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:55,520
organizations that answered our call for

01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,359
collaboration

01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,520
since this group is currently

01:04:57,359 --> 01:05:01,200
representative of north america

01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:03,280
we would love to add training

01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:05,359
organizations from other regions around

01:05:03,280 --> 01:05:07,359
the world to expand our reach

01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:08,720
please contact us if you're interested

01:05:07,359 --> 01:05:10,480
in serving as one of our training

01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:12,640
partners it's fun

01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:14,319
we we have a good time as a group it's a

01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:16,480
great volunteer experience and i think

01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:17,920
you'll get a lot out of the program

01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:19,359
and if you'd like to donate to the

01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,160
program which helps get it off the

01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:22,240
ground as well

01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:23,200
or serve as a volunteer please let us

01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:25,200
know

01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:26,960
and let us know quickly because we're

01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:29,119
actually pushing toward launching this

01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:32,960
program in the first cohort of students

01:05:29,119 --> 01:05:32,960
in the first quarter of 2021

01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:37,359
so as dries mentioned the need to

01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:39,680
maximize the speed of innovation by

01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:41,280
rewarding makers to optimize impact is

01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:43,119
important

01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:45,200
so we've created an extension of the

01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:46,799
drupal association supporting partner

01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:48,960
program which we call the drupal

01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:51,440
certified partner program

01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:53,119
and this is established to recognize and

01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:54,079
promote companies for both their

01:05:53,119 --> 01:05:56,640
expertise

01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:58,480
and their contribution to the project

01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:01,119
this program also has a focus on

01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:03,920
improving the end user journey

01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:04,319
through enhancements both on drupal.org

01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,319
so

01:06:04,319 --> 01:06:08,319
literally when they get to drupal.org

01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:10,480
how do we make a more robust experience

01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:12,400
for someone evaluating drupal

01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:14,240
but we're also adding customized

01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:16,559
evaluation consultations

01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:18,720
by the drupal association on behalf of

01:06:16,559 --> 01:06:22,240
these drupal certified partners

01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:24,720
so there's a bit of there's more uh

01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:26,000
inclusive matchmaking when it comes to

01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,520
those evaluators

01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:30,079
and we're going to be putting in more

01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:31,440
work from a person perspective to make

01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:31,680
sure that they get what they need from

01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,440
an

01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:36,079
information and partner matching

01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,079
perspective

01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,799
so we heard you sometimes it's hard to

01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:43,839
know what's happening across

01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:45,760
all of drupal this week we launched a

01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:46,880
new communication to help solve part of

01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,799
this problem

01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:50,880
it was created to help both current and

01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:53,920
potential contributors find your ideal

01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:55,680
place to engage with the drupal project

01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,920
we want to help you find the best

01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:59,119
opportunity and the best use of your

01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:01,200
skills and talents

01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:03,039
while ideally developing new skills and

01:07:01,200 --> 01:07:04,720
talents along the way

01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:06,480
we do hope you'll take a moment to look

01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:08,960
at the initiative update found in the

01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:10,400
community blog area of drupal.org

01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,319
and we really would like to get some of

01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:15,839
your feedback about how we can iterate

01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:15,839
on this communication moving forward

01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:21,839
as we also heard from dries there are

01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:23,599
important initiatives underway to

01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:24,880
support the future of the drupal

01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:27,039
platform

01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:28,000
more than ever the drupal association is

01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:30,160
directly involved

01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:32,079
in many of these initiatives primarily

01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:33,119
to support the initiative teams in their

01:07:32,079 --> 01:07:35,039
work

01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:37,039
i'd like to talk about some milestones

01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:38,000
we've achieved some work that's still in

01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:39,599
progress

01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:42,559
and what we have planned for each of

01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:44,319
these initiatives

01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:46,559
in recent years there's been an

01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:48,640
increased focus on drupal's front end

01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:50,559
and on ease of use in general

01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:51,839
to help our front end developers work

01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:53,599
more efficiently

01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:55,920
drupal core issues will now

01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:58,160
automatically generate a live deployment

01:07:55,920 --> 01:08:01,440
preview whenever a merge request is

01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:02,000
opened we want to thank the tugboat qa

01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:03,839
team

01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,480
who power both these core deployment

01:08:03,839 --> 01:08:08,839
previews and the simply test me service

01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:11,039
for their partnership in making this

01:08:08,839 --> 01:08:13,680
happen

01:08:11,039 --> 01:08:15,680
you can see how live previews work here

01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:17,520
on any drupal core issue with an open

01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:19,520
merge request you'll see a view live

01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:20,960
preview button

01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:22,880
when you click on the live preview

01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:24,799
button it will take you

01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,239
to an automatically generated drupal

01:08:24,799 --> 01:08:28,159
site preview

01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:29,359
where your merge request is already

01:08:28,159 --> 01:08:30,880
applied

01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:34,400
we hope this helps you review core

01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:34,400
contributions more easily

01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:38,560
it feels like just yesterday we were

01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:40,400
celebrating the release of drupal 9 but

01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,279
of course drupal 10 is just around the

01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,719
corner

01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:44,640
so this is an area where much

01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:46,319
collaboration is happening behind the

01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:49,199
scenes between the drupal release

01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:51,120
managers and the drupal association team

01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:52,799
and i'm pleased to say that the tooling

01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,480
is ready to support what we need to make

01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:56,560
drupal 10 a success

01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:59,759
and if future requirements appear we're

01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:59,759
ready to meet those as well

01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,239
on the subject of drupal 10 readiness

01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:06,400
though as some of you may know there are

01:09:04,239 --> 01:09:06,719
still significant parts of drupal that

01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:09,359
use

01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:11,440
jquery 3. there's been a long-running

01:09:09,359 --> 01:09:13,920
proposal to deprecate those usages

01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:16,159
in favor of a more modern javascript but

01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:17,440
it's been hard to gain traction

01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:19,440
we want to partner with current

01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:20,400
contributors interested in deprecating

01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:22,159
jquery

01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:24,000
and we're also looking for sponsorship

01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:24,400
of this work all to ensure that it's

01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:28,480
ready

01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:28,480
by the time we need to launch drupal 10.

01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:32,640
the automatic automat automated updates

01:09:31,679 --> 01:09:34,799
initiative

01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:35,679
is one that we actually took an early

01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:37,520
interest in

01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:39,279
and that's because updates to drupal

01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:41,120
software have always been packaged and

01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:43,040
delivered as a service by the drupal

01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:44,960
association team

01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,480
so last year as you may remember we

01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,319
began this process

01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:50,319
by creating a contributed module

01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:52,719
prototype with support from the european

01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:54,960
commission and tag one consulting

01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:56,320
but to go beyond that katrib prototype

01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,600
we had to deal with composer

01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:59,840
dependencies

01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,840
and composer one as many of you may know

01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,480
had both slow performance and high

01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:05,520
memory

01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:08,080
usage so i'm thrilled to say that

01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:10,159
drupal.org composer endpoints now fully

01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:12,320
support using composer 2

01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:14,560
which means it's much much faster and

01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:16,719
much more memory efficient

01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:18,640
so what does all that mean it means site

01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:19,840
owners can build and update their sites

01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,520
more quickly

01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,199
automated testing that depends on

01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:25,199
composer runs faster

01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:26,960
and the possibility of running composer

01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:31,760
updates during automatic updates of

01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:34,400
drupal is now much more achievable

01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:36,880
in the first quarter of 2021 we hope to

01:10:34,400 --> 01:10:39,360
have the secure signing infrastructure

01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:41,280
updated for the new requirements so that

01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:43,600
drupal core can work towards

01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:45,199
validating signed updates in the core

01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:47,199
update manager

01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:48,880
this initiative will make drupal site

01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:51,520
ownership both easier

01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:51,920
and more secure and will be a tremendous

01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:55,280
leap

01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:55,280
forward for the project

01:10:56,080 --> 01:11:00,400
so last but certainly not least i want

01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,960
to talk about the decoupled menus

01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:04,640
initiative that dries mentioned earlier

01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:06,480
so the drupal association is putting

01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,320
this initiative toward the top of our

01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:09,280
engineering priorities for the coming

01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:11,600
year

01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:14,159
our goal is to make the drupal.org and

01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:16,960
get lab tooling as robust as it can be

01:11:14,159 --> 01:11:18,800
not only for php code but for javascript

01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:20,880
and frankly any other language that we

01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:22,159
may want to use in the future

01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:24,320
we're working closely with the

01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:26,719
initiative team to create the best

01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:29,280
tooling possible which is going to allow

01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:32,159
drupal to expand to these new ecosystems

01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:34,239
while remaining a unified community

01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:35,520
and i do think it's worth mentioning

01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:37,840
that unity of

01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:38,560
housing a single drupal project all

01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,760
collaborate

01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:44,239
all collaborating together on drupal.org

01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:46,159
is one of our fundamental strengths and

01:11:44,239 --> 01:11:48,800
that's why we're approaching the project

01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:48,800
in this way

01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:54,800
so with that i would love to give you

01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:56,400
some opportunities to reach out to us if

01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:58,640
you have any questions about what i

01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:01,280
mentioned so there's a drupal.org panel

01:11:58,640 --> 01:12:03,520
immediately following this session

01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:05,600
there's a dries note q a where dries and

01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:07,280
i'll be available to do a deep dive

01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:09,280
it happens in about an hour so if you've

01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:10,640
got any questions about what we talked

01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,760
about today that's an excellent

01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,440
opportunity

01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,960
and there's a q a with the drupal

01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:16,960
association tomorrow

01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:18,239
and that'll actually be a blend of board

01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,480
members and staff

01:12:18,239 --> 01:12:22,880
all of those are opportunities to learn

01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:24,800
a little more ask questions you may have

01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:26,800
or find a way that you want to engage in

01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:30,080
the parts that are meaningful to you

01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:31,199
so with that i would love to bring dries

01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:32,880
back

01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:37,840
because i have a couple questions i want

01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:37,840
to ask you too

01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,199
i'm back all right

01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:52,159
thank you you make it look so easy

01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:54,159
so one one thing that's come up and

01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:55,520
again some of these are conversations

01:12:54,159 --> 01:12:56,719
we've been having with community

01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:58,320
stakeholders and some of this

01:12:56,719 --> 01:13:00,640
information is new

01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:02,560
um but given that contribution

01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:04,400
enablement is such an important goal

01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:05,520
dreis for both you from a project

01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:08,640
perspective

01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:11,600
and for us as a drupal association

01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:12,560
how do we know when we are successful

01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:14,719
and

01:13:12,560 --> 01:13:18,159
and what do we do beyond what we talked

01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:19,760
about today potentially as well it's a

01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:21,280
good question i mean i can give you my

01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:23,760
personal answer to that

01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:25,520
question um but i think we should

01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:28,880
measure

01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:31,440
um the output you know like

01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:33,120
enabling contribution is in a way like

01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:35,280
it's very important but it's kind of an

01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:36,880
input but the output is actually the

01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:38,080
innovation let's say that comes out of

01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,080
drupal

01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:42,719
in my mind right so that how i would

01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:45,199
measure success is that um

01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:46,000
we see drupal accelerate from an

01:13:45,199 --> 01:13:48,640
innovation point

01:13:46,000 --> 01:13:49,760
of view and ultimately the output of

01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:53,040
that

01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:56,080
is more and more adoption so

01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:58,320
right that's how i look at it but

01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:59,760
it's easier to measure inputs sometimes

01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:02,000
so i mean

01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:03,040
in terms of number of people

01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:06,480
contributing i would

01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:10,159
love to see us make dramatic

01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:13,280
increases there honestly um

01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:14,800
you know like if i think about

01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:16,880
how many people contribute today

01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:18,080
obviously there's over 8 000 people that

01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:19,760
contributed

01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,120
sort of in the last 12 months which is

01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:23,520
an incredible number

01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:24,880
right the same time if you look at the

01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,760
data

01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:28,000
um the top 30 people which is like what

01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:31,920
the

01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:34,239
top point zero two percent or something

01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:35,760
uh my math isn't this good on on the fly

01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:38,400
but like it's a fraction

01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:40,000
of these 8 000 people like 30 people

01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:42,480
they do like 20

01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,600
of the work so there's an incredible

01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:47,040
long tail

01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:50,480
of those top 30 people um i don't know

01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:53,760
i'm guessing but maybe 20 are full-time

01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:55,360
but i would love to see us go to 200

01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:57,520
full-time people

01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:59,760
you know and so that's a 10x increase

01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:02,480
like how do we go from 20 to 200

01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:04,800
and for me if i look at if i take five

01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:08,719
steps back and i look at our competitors

01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:11,440
let's say they have 200 people full time

01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:13,600
and obviously we don't need to measure

01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:16,239
only full-time people because we have

01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:17,679
8 000 non-full-time people which is

01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:18,800
really valuable and they do a lot of

01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:21,600
work too

01:15:18,800 --> 01:15:22,000
but yeah basically long-winded story

01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:24,159
here

01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:26,400
but i would love to see us really make

01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:30,159
some dramatic changes not

01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:32,800
incremental or small changes

01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:34,560
and i know the team at the drupal

01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:35,679
association and i and and the board

01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:37,040
injuries you've been part of some of

01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:39,120
those conversations about

01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,640
okay but how do we affect that kind of

01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:41,360
dramatic increase and what does that

01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:44,000
mean

01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:45,520
especially for us as the association you

01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:47,440
know what what are the new

01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:49,040
kind of business focuses that we need to

01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:50,480
have to make sure that we're doing what

01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:52,960
we can to do there so

01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:54,640
i know i've got some ideas about how we

01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:56,239
create more of that

01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:58,560
and you talked about some things today

01:15:56,239 --> 01:16:00,159
some ideas and i was able to show a

01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,840
little bit of what we've already got in

01:16:00,159 --> 01:16:02,880
motion but are there things you think

01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:05,520
about

01:16:02,880 --> 01:16:06,080
or that you see in other communities or

01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,679
you know

01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:09,360
are there are there things that are on

01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:10,640
your mind or that we should emulate to

01:16:09,360 --> 01:16:11,920
get there faster

01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:15,040
yeah yeah i mean i think there's a lot

01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:18,000
of things we have to do or could do

01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:20,960
and so rewarding makers is one path but

01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:22,800
actually one of the things that um

01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:24,080
you know that i was excited about like

01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:26,080
when we first met

01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:28,640
you know when you were you know applying

01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:30,800
for the job if you will like you talked

01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:32,880
about your previous experience with

01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,640
forgot the terms you used but like

01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:37,199
enablement programs

01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:38,320
that you put in place and that got me

01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:40,320
really excited

01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:42,080
and so i might be worth sharing but i

01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:44,320
think that would be a great thing to do

01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:45,600
and obviously you come with experience

01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:47,199
so

01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,520
yeah so it's interesting you bring that

01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:50,960
up so the term i typically use is

01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,560
strategic volunteering

01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:54,400
and that's the framework that i've put

01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:56,880
in in various organizations

01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:58,800
over my professional career we're

01:16:56,880 --> 01:17:00,400
looking at how we take that framework

01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:01,040
and apply it to the contribution

01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:03,360
framework

01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:04,880
of drupal and the team and i have

01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:06,400
actually spent a lot of time about how

01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:08,400
we can actually try to get that into

01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,920
place as soon as next year

01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:11,600
to support what already happens from a

01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:14,000
contribution perspective

01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:15,360
but there's an element of it and you'll

01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,840
see it as soon as we launch our

01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:19,440
volunteer call for drupalcon 2021 where

01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,920
we're going to embed that a bit

01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:24,000
and and kind of test things out but

01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:25,360
there's a couple key factors to it that

01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,800
i feel really

01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:28,880
strongly that are going to help with

01:17:26,800 --> 01:17:29,280
what we're trying to do here and one of

01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:32,080
those

01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:33,040
is the stewardship element of

01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:36,000
volunteering

01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:37,360
slash contribution right so um we're

01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:38,960
starting that a little bit with the

01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:40,800
communication i mentioned around hey

01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:43,920
what is happening and where do they need

01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:46,480
help and how do i get started

01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:47,679
there's a matchmaking element to making

01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:50,239
sure people not only

01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:51,440
understand what the opportunities are

01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:53,600
but that they find

01:17:51,440 --> 01:17:55,280
the right opportunity based on what's

01:17:53,600 --> 01:17:56,719
their interest what are their skill sets

01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:58,000
where do they want to grow personally

01:17:56,719 --> 01:17:59,679
and professionally

01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,440
we have an opportunity as a drupal

01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:02,719
community to provide that experience

01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:05,679
which i think

01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:07,840
could be really compelling um also helps

01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:10,400
justify a bit of your contribution time

01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:12,080
so if you're not a paid contributor what

01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:13,840
are you getting out of it other than

01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:15,840
feeling like you're helping drupal which

01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:18,640
is huge but is there a way

01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:19,679
that it can help you with your skills or

01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,280
with your network

01:18:19,679 --> 01:18:22,880
it can propel your career and i think

01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,840
there's a way that we as the drupal

01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:26,159
association

01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:27,679
can embed that in what we're doing

01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:28,719
across the community and make that

01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:32,000
possible

01:18:28,719 --> 01:18:34,159
the other piece of that is we need

01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,840
we as the drupal association are looking

01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:37,760
at we're calling it our contribution

01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:39,360
enablement team which is a new part of

01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,800
the team we haven't had before

01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:42,719
so we're shuffling a little bit of

01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,760
shuffling the deck chairs to try to

01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:45,280
reorganize

01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:47,760
that's really going to support where we

01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:49,040
want to go with both the strategic plan

01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:51,520
and the project

01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:54,080
but you're going to see us as a team

01:18:51,520 --> 01:18:56,159
really putting more time and effort

01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:57,120
and personalization around making sure

01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:59,760
that anyone

01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:00,400
who's a potential contributor really has

01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:01,520
what they need

01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:04,159
there's a lot of tools that are

01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:05,600
available once you know where to go

01:19:04,159 --> 01:19:07,360
but i've talked to a lot of people that

01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,960
don't know where to get started or they

01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:10,320
contributed a long time ago and don't

01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:12,400
know where to fit in now

01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:14,159
and when we talk about diversity and

01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:15,280
inclusion part of that inclusion is

01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:18,080
helping people

01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:19,840
fit in and fit into the right places and

01:19:18,080 --> 01:19:20,560
work on things like succession planning

01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,239
so

01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:23,679
a lot of that's getting embedded to how

01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:24,480
we're approaching this and i think it

01:19:23,679 --> 01:19:26,320
can really

01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:28,480
i think it can really help our community

01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:30,480
in a lot of really positive ways that

01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:31,920
have an effect not only on the project

01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:33,280
but on people as well which

01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:35,199
dreams i know you and i are both

01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:36,880
passionate about people getting

01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:38,880
getting what they need out of this too

01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:40,000
right and this is such an opportunity to

01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,679
help people

01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,040
in a variety of ways and this is just

01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:44,800
one way to do that

01:19:43,040 --> 01:19:46,320
yeah and we give them great learning

01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,760
experiences um

01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:49,679
you know collaborating with people all

01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:50,000
around the world some of the best people

01:19:49,679 --> 01:19:51,840
on

01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:53,920
specific topics in the world i mean i

01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:57,199
think it's a win-win

01:19:53,920 --> 01:20:00,640
but um i love what you said because

01:19:57,199 --> 01:20:02,960
one of my personal learnings is that

01:20:00,640 --> 01:20:03,840
it's hard for people to jump in

01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:05,760
sometimes it's

01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:07,600
there's big barriers you know obviously

01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:09,440
you need to know

01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,360
you know what you can do and where help

01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:12,480
is needed that information can be hard

01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:14,159
to find but

01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:15,920
even if you make all of that available

01:20:14,159 --> 01:20:17,920
sometimes people are

01:20:15,920 --> 01:20:19,760
a little bit shy i don't know if that's

01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,239
the right word but they may not feel

01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:22,639
like

01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:25,199
they're capable enough to help right and

01:20:22,639 --> 01:20:26,880
so it's a big step for a lot of people

01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:28,960
and what i've learned is that just

01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:31,600
asking them

01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:33,280
can really help result in a lot more

01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:35,199
contribution like just that

01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:36,800
little notch of like hey would would you

01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:38,639
mind helping with this like we really

01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:40,400
could use your help

01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:42,639
and i've always been surprised about how

01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:44,400
many people

01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:46,719
you know that's all it takes sometimes

01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:47,920
and so i like how these enablement

01:20:46,719 --> 01:20:50,800
programs can have a big

01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:52,000
impact and i believe there's a lot of

01:20:50,800 --> 01:20:55,120
low-hanging fruit

01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:56,000
too i mean i haven't created an account

01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:58,880
on drupal.org

01:20:56,000 --> 01:21:00,800
in a long time but i imagine it's still

01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:04,000
more or less the same

01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:04,639
where you know we don't really nurture

01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,880
people

01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:08,719
after they sign up and like it could be

01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:10,159
nice just like a week later to like hey

01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:11,920
here's a little thing

01:21:10,159 --> 01:21:13,840
we would love your help with this and

01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:15,120
maybe we asked them a few questions

01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:17,679
about their skill sets and

01:21:15,120 --> 01:21:18,639
to your point we can personalize it i'm

01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:21,520
kind of

01:21:18,639 --> 01:21:23,199
dreaming here um but um i think a lot of

01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,800
these things could really make a big

01:21:23,199 --> 01:21:27,679
difference you know

01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:28,960
so you're you're right and and i think

01:21:27,679 --> 01:21:31,280
too

01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,320
a couple things one is you know if the

01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:34,080
community will go

01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:35,679
go there with us there's a lot of things

01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:38,239
we want to try um

01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:40,000
and pilot and get feedback on and and

01:21:38,239 --> 01:21:43,040
even things like how do we

01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:44,639
how do we infuse more more really

01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:47,760
strategic contribution

01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:49,520
stewardship into things like drupalcon

01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:50,800
so that may be hey when you register

01:21:49,520 --> 01:21:52,560
you're going to let us know are you

01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,920
interested in contribution but also what

01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:55,280
are your skill sets what are you

01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,960
interested in

01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:58,400
what appeals to you so we can do more

01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,920
matchmaking before you get to

01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:02,560
contribution day

01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:03,440
so that's an example but i think this is

01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:05,199
an area too

01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:07,679
where it's not just about the drupal

01:22:05,199 --> 01:22:10,400
association layering in a framework

01:22:07,679 --> 01:22:12,719
but it really is an opportunity for

01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:15,280
local associations local events

01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:17,040
you know how drupal's not about just

01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:18,719
what's happening at the top it's about

01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,719
all of the local and regional events

01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:21,920
that happen that feed into the project

01:22:20,719 --> 01:22:23,199
in the community

01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:25,199
and i think that there's a lot of

01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:27,280
opportunity for us to work with all

01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:28,239
those associations and event organizers

01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,679
to say

01:22:28,239 --> 01:22:31,679
you know how do we tackle a couple

01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:35,040
things and one is how do you help us

01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:37,840
at that local high touch um

01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:39,600
opportunity help with the stewardship

01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:42,480
around contribution

01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:44,159
but it also will feed into how we do

01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:45,600
more work at a local level around the

01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:47,040
diversity and inclusion

01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:48,880
and when i talk about the drupal

01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:51,280
ambassador opportunity

01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:52,000
how we make sure that we've infused that

01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:54,080
at every level

01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:56,159
of the organization so i think there's a

01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,600
lot of opportunity to do that

01:22:56,159 --> 01:22:59,280
there's going to be a lot of volunteer

01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,639
opportunity for people to help us come

01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:03,520
figure out volunteering

01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:05,199
which is ironic but also very cool so um

01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,320
there's you know if you're a member of

01:23:05,199 --> 01:23:08,080
the community and you're

01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:10,000
you're hearing us talk about this and

01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:11,840
and this kind of gets you excited

01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,040
and this speaks to you and your personal

01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:14,560
why please reach out

01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:17,199
because there's a way that i would love

01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:19,040
to to infuse contribution

01:23:17,199 --> 01:23:20,560
we need contribution to help us figure

01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:22,159
out how to get more contributions so

01:23:20,560 --> 01:23:23,600
it's a little bit complicated but it's

01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:25,440
an opportunity it's a non-code

01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:26,480
contribution opportunity to to get

01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:29,040
involved

01:23:26,480 --> 01:23:30,320
in the project yeah all of that is

01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:32,320
awesome

01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:33,760
we're lucky to have you and to have your

01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:36,080
leadership

01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:37,360
in this there's also a lot of great

01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:38,560
things happening in the community

01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:40,639

01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:42,480
like the mentorship program like these

01:23:40,639 --> 01:23:44,960
are awesome programs that help people

01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:46,719
get involved so we should definitely

01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:48,639
help amplify or

01:23:46,719 --> 01:23:50,000
point spotlights on those as well which

01:23:48,639 --> 01:23:51,920
we're doing but

01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:53,280
it's it's worth recognizing all the

01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:54,719
