drupal design system

00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:36,320
and claro and i'm also the creator of

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,320

and clara as well

00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:55,280
so in this session today

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:59,039
i will talk about how to deliver a

00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:01,440
better experience for content editors

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,480
i did split up the talk in three main

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,040
areas

00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,840
so first i will talk about the interface

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,200
than about

00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,760
useful or helpful modules some quick

00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,479
wings

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,760
basically everybody can do and

00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,000
afterwards i will quickly

00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,360
talk about the stuff uh which is

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,720
supposed to land in core

00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,439
at some point and finally like the key

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,200
takeaways

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,439
like what should you take away from this

00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,439
talk

00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,759
so the interface

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,400
um lately i read a lot of things on the

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,960
internet

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,680
that people say that drupal is

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,400
complicated drupal is ugly

00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,600
um does it still exist and like the main

00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,960
thing is drupal looks

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,520
and feels outdated um we heard that a

00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,960
lot

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,479
and uh because of that uh basically like

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,840
the initiative around claro like the

00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:59,759
admin ui initiative was created

00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,680
so basically claro came to the rescue

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,680
there was some outstanding work done

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,079
here by the team

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,000
led by lori and christina and others

00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:12,000
there also like dozens and dozens of

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,480
contributors um it's worth mentioning

00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,280
that like this theme is accessibility

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,160
first

00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,360
so we basically put on the stamp on

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,400
accessibility

00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,440
to make it the the main priority here

00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,360
and um yeah we we basically had a talk

00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,160
at drupalcom amsterdam last year where

00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,840
we basically

00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,239
deep dived into into clara

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,560
but when it comes to the interface um

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,280
today i want to talk about chin

00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,280
um some of you might already heard of

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,640
about it it's a custom

00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,200
customizable experience um basically

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,160
it's it's based on the foundation of

00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,440
claro and the

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:53,120
drupal design system but it evolved a

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,680
lot over the past

00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,280
couple of months so it's a way more than

00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,120
just a sub theme to claro

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,519
as some said it would be

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,319
and i want to give you just a brief

00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,319
outlook how

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,400
this interface looks and why you should

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,200
use it

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,959
so chain has a sleek new layout as you

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,400
can see here

00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:19,040
it it uses quite a different

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,519
layout than all the other admin themes

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,120
you know

00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:24,879
so far like per default we use a

00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,720
vertical navigation approach

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:31,280
as you can see here on the left

00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,799
we also have like a sticky bar at the

00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,680
top with

00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,319
call to actions so the content editors

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,840
or like also the site admins always have

00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:45,280
a clear visible call to action

00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,200
and we use like regions with

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,519
the layering technique so we have like

00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,239
multiple visual layers

00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,840
uh which helps to encapsulate um you

00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:57,439
know like content elements

00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:01,519
uh and yeah hills or it helps to

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:03,360
distinguish elements better

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,599
but i think like the main star or the

00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,080
main reason to use the the chin admin

00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,120
theme

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,560
is basically the node edit form as you

00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,080
can see in the screenshot

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,000
this has evolved a lot so

00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,120
i call this an improved editor

00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,840
experience

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,400
um a lot of users really like it because

00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,560
uh it reminds them of using a word or

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,040
you know like a google docs because of

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,040
the the main content area in the middle

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,639
and you have like the the navigation on

00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,520
the left and then on the right side you

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,840
have a sidebar

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,440
one of the main concerns i usually hear

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,400
from content editors is

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,600
that the preview published and safe

00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,400
actions

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,759
are not reachable so if you're basically

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,000
side building

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,400
um with a lot of fields and you know

00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,120
like using paragraphs and whatever

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,960
the node edit form can get quite long

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,479
and it's really hard to reach the save

00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,479
button if it's at the end

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,000
so the user always needs to scroll to

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,360
the far button

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,639
to just save a note which is

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,720
for some uses really a concern and

00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,080
with this approach we take in chin is

00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:13,120
basically that you always have

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,960
like the thing you can see outlined here

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,039
in orange is basically

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,960
always sticky and always visible so you

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,120
always have like quick access to those

00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,880
actions

00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,160
um as i mentioned before the content

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,680
main area

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:31,120
is is you know just like a a4 paper

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,600
it looks like a paper it's also visually

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,560
uh you know like sent a center piece of

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,000
for the content

00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,639
area and we use like a sidebar

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,440
which actually also look and feels like

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,120
a sidebar

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,120
which is attached to the right side

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,280
um qing provides a lot of customization

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,400
options

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,199
um so you know you can basically set up

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,319
chin

00:05:53,199 --> 00:06:00,000
and if you don't like the the vertical

00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:02,560
um you know like um toolbar approach um

00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,400
no worries we have solutions for that so

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,880
you can either use like the default

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,039
vertical toolbar

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,919
you can but you can also use like a more

00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,639
modern

00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,560
minimized toolbar as you can see which

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,199
just contains one row

00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,840
but also if you fancy to use like the

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,919
classic

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,360
i call that the legacy toolbar from

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,800
drupal

00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,800
you're fine to do that as well

00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:35,440
i think chin attracted

00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:38,240
many new editors and and site admins

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,960
when we introduced the dork mode so i'm

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,960
happy to

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,000
to say that gin is basically the first

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,720
admin theme

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,160
which provides you a dark mode which you

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,639
can enable

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,400
it's still experimental but um it

00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,160
already works pretty well with a lot of

00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,759
modules

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:58,000
so check that out um

00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,080
like all the customization options we

00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,199
have like you can change the x and color

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,680
you can change

00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,360
or enable a dark mode you can enable a

00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,720
high contrast mode

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,479
you can choose the toolbar options and

00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,120
you know like to further customize the

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:16,000
experience you can basically enable that

00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,080
users can override their own settings so

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,280
if you have site builders who prefer to

00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,520
have like the

00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,440
legacy drupal toolbar because they're

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,039
used to it and they're way faster in

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,960
building sites with that

00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:28,960
um that's totally fine your content

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,240
editors or yourself you can basically

00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,319
customize the ui

00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,319
to your liking you can change the accent

00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,560
color toolbar and so on

00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,319
so you have really have like a a

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:42,639
streamlined

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,639
experience for each user if you want to

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,160
i quickly wanted to show you some

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,360
examples of

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,240
uh some clients we have at uniq just to

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,520
showcase

00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,440
you some customized experiences um

00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,639
those experiences are basically just an

00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,039
uploaded logo

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,080
changed you know like the the colors to

00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,080
a custom one

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,120
from the branding or from the ci cd of

00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,440
the client

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,199
and then decided if we want to uh you

00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,319
know which toolbar we want to use for

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,080
for for those clients so this is the

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,160
first example

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:16,000
this is like a drugstore network in

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,639
switzerland it's called droppa

00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,919
and it's a multi-site and we basically

00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,560
use

00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,479
themestatics for each brand so this

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,039
brand has orange another one has

00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,240
a greenish color and the third one has a

00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,000
red one

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,399
so you can really customize the

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,880
experience for the clients needs

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,719
or you could also use it you know for

00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,000
for the branding of your agency if you

00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,800
want to

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,640
you know go that route um the second one

00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,200
is a multi-vendor marketplace

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,000
for safety equipment it's called subpros

00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,480
as you can see

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,760
here we use the horizontal the minimal

00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,880
toolbar

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,519
it's an e-commerce shop and yeah as you

00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,839
can see it's also quite customized

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,600
and it was just like a few clicks in the

00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,000
back end uploading a logo and you're

00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,760
done

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,080
so you can do that in a couple of

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,080
minutes

00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:13,279
the last one is um grabuan tourism

00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:16,160
which is a tourism site here as well

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,959
that the branding goes a bit further

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,880
because we also have a customized login

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,480
i will talk about that later which

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,760
basically inherits

00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,640
all the customization options from chin

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,880
so including accent color the logo and

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,959
everything

00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,200
you can download chin at drupal org

00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,959
project chin

00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,360
it's also worth mentioning that it's

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,240
it's already the default theme uh in

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,120
distros like

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,680
open social and formos and others are

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,519
currently

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,360
looking into it if they want to adopt it

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,519
or not um

00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,120

thanks a lot without you it wouldn't be

00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,760
possible to

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,640
invest this a lot of time to this to

00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:30,560
this project

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:34,959
so many many thanks

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:38,000
good moving on to modules

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:41,279
so um i want to outline some some

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
modules um i think like the first

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,279
few modules are really like stuff you

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,279
should install in every drupal instance

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,640
keep in mind that this is not like a

00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,600
final list of modules

00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,600
i just outline a few highlights so it's

00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,880
rather a small collection of modules to

00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,880
start with

00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,079
and yeah as i mentioned like the first

00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,800
three modules i think

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:08,320
everybody uses already so let's dive in

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,800
good so admin toolbar i think everybody

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,360
would

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,079
uh you know like be on the same page if

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,000
i say

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,760
this module for sure should be in core

00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,160
this should be the default

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,600
um it provides you sub menus for all the

00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,279
main menu items

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,680
in in in drupal it easiest and that

00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,320
you know like navigation through the ui

00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,720
um

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,760
it has a neat feature to add custom

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,959
entities uh

00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,720
custom entries sorry to to the toolbar

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,480
um so if you have like modules you want

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,240
to outline in the main menu or in the

00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,480
sub menu you can do that

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,800
and also make sure that you basically

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,600
enable the admin toolbar extra tools

00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,399
which you know provide you more sub

00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,399
menus as well

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:54,959
the second one is coffee coffee is

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,760
really handy for content editors

00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:59,120
so if you're new to drupal as a content

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,320
editor and you're

00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:05,279
not so familiar with the ui um this

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,880
this l thread or or for mac users like

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,040
this spotlight

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,120
like uh quick search is really handy

00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,959
because you can it provides you like a

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,839
quick search you can search things you

00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,240
don't have to

00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:17,680
navigate through the ui or to the

00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:21,040
navigation if you're not

00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:23,600
familiar where to expect things

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,079
so which leads to another problem which

00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,320
we might

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:28,480
address in the future but uh from the

00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,440
informa information architecture point

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,839
of view but

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,079
in the meantime this is a handy module

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,720
um and as you can see it also supports

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:39,839
all the

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,839
customization options options of chin

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,279
the field group module this is a very

00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,839
powerful module

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,200
as you can see in the screenshot i

00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,600
created a field set

00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,880
called details so this is like an

00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,040
employee

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,720
content type we have a picture and we

00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,839
have like a full name last name

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:01,680
and profession and so on and with this

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,800
module i'm able to basically

00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,320
group fields together that they appear

00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,800
in a field set or

00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,160
in you know like horizontal tabs or

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,000
vertical tabs

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:14,880
as you can see in the screenshot as well

00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,120
uh horizontal tabs are used to basically

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,160
break down the content into pieces as

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,760
well

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,279
so this is really um this module really

00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,920
helps to clean up the clutter

00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,920
and easy things for content editors

00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:36,560
um the next module is media library

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:39,360
it's it's in core i believe since 8.8

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,720
um you just it's there you basically

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,639
just need to enable it

00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,560
um there's also no need anymore for

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,040
media entity browser with that so

00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,040
it provides its own widget it's nicely

00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:51,600
integrated into drupal and you really

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,600
should use it

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,880
the next one is drop zone uh js so

00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,000
as an addition or it works pretty well

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,720
with medium

00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,560
there is a patch you might want to use

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,519
to basically override all the upload

00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,760
forms

00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,240
in media entities with the drag and drop

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,120
upload it also supports multiple file

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,600
uploads

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,720
so content editors basically can just

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,360
drag and drop

00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,279
some media files and then just you know

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,360
like bulk upload them

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:25,360
which is really really handy and we got

00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,360
a lot of good feedback about that

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,760
if you're having a site which uses

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,040
paragraphs

00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:37,519
and i believe a lot of you guys do

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,399
um layout paragraphs is something worth

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,760
checking out

00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,839
so it's basically just providing a field

00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,839
plug-in widget for paragraphs so you can

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,959
easily switch it over

00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,160
to layout paragraphs and it basically

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:53,440
gives you the

00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,000
the option to use core layouts

00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,000
but you can also freely add paragraphs

00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,440
so it's a more visual approach to

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,399
paragraphs um you can you know like drag

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,720
and drop them you can layouts from core

00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,680
it gives you this nice visual overview

00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,480
on preview

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,959
of content pieces in the back end um

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,600
it's

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,440
a really great module and you know you

00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,600
can easily switch back to the normal

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,639
paragraph or the paragraph experimental

00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,639
widgets if you want to

00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:28,000
inline entity form um so

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,079
you know instead of just using simple

00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,800
reference fields like the outer complete

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,800
field

00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,199
um this can make a huge difference for

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,920
content editors if you basically

00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,560
want to um you know like enable inline

00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,519
editing of entities like nodes

00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:45,279
or if you just you know want to provide

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,440
a better visual

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,480
expression to to the to the content

00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,920
editors

00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,079
um you know just like typing into

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,040
an autocomplete field is not the same as

00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:59,120
like choosing from a content browser

00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,639
which is the next one so you can use

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,120
entity browser for that

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,480
which provides you like a nice as well

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,800
like a nice overlay

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,880
like media the media selection where you

00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,600
can choose your entities your notes for

00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,680
example

00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,120
of a specific content type so in this

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:16,320
example we would use that

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:18,399
or we we would choose the employees and

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,759
afterwards you also have you can set

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,160
like a

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,160
you know like a view mode and and edit

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,839
the view modes that it appears nicely in

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,079
the back end so you have just like a

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,120
rich snippet of the content you re

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:34,240
refer to instead of having a list uh

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:37,600
in example in an autocomplete field

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:39,519
it's really really handy and

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,959
last but not least it would be the chin

00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,360
login so we saw

00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,639
a screenshot earlier um you know in the

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,000
branding example

00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,000
so if you tend to have a decoupled site

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,720
like a headless site um

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,839
instead of just you know creating a nice

00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,560
looking

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,399
login you can just install chin login um

00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,480
it provides an out of the

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,079
like a nice out of the box experience

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,400
for for a locking screen

00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,400
and as i mentioned before it basically

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,600
supports all the customizations of

00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,600
options of chin as well

00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,640
there are a lot more modules um some of

00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,640
them are also

00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,959
i think there there are like talks about

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,400
some of the modules at this drupalcon

00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,959
so check them out like the autosave

00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,120
forum

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,959
content log responsive preview

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,520
paragraphs ee and gutenberg if you want

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,480
to go

00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,080
another route and with paragraphs these

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,000
modules are worth a look to

00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:37,679
to you know further improve the

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,679
experience for content editors

00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,640
good so

00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,320
let's talk about some quick wins so

00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,400
basically

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,520
how can you improve the content editor

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,080
experience

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,120
with very little effort like you know

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,360
like um

00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,400
changes which which only take a couple

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,320
of minutes but

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,280
can make a huge huge difference to

00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,280
content editors

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,720
um so first the first thing i would

00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,240
i would recommend to do is basically

00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,880
create custom admin views in the backend

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,280
as you can see in the screenshots you

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,280
know

00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,720
usually you have the content the files

00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,840
and media

00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,880
tabs but you can easily create new admin

00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,760
views

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,760
examples for persons here or for you

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,120
know like employees or whatever content

00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,840
types you have

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,200
and then you can change the the view to

00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,480
to showcase

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,480
you know in this particular

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,200
you know like example we want to show

00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,880
that the face of of of the person

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,960
we want to show the last name the first

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,480
name maybe you want to show the birthday

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,960
or the email address like

00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,840
relevant content for the content type

00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,720
itself

00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,360
so this can make a huge impact uh you

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,080
know

00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,679
in in enhance enhancing the management

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,039
like the management experience for

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,880
content editors

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:10,400
a lot the second thing is

00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,640
um you can use hx for admin views

00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,160
uh it's literally there you just it's

00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,720
not enabled by default

00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,400
um so you can just check use ajax for

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,360
for all the views for all the admin

00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,600
views

00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,200
um which provides you a more responsive

00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,000
and modern modern feel

00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,880
to those views um so you know like the

00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,039
filtering

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,640
and the search functionalities are

00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,720
basically instant

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,880
and you don't need to always have like

00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,799
this page load in between

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,120
um so this can be a quite a good

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:42,320
enhancement for content editors as well

00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:46,320
that like drupal look and feels

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,320
more natural and more modern

00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,039
so using the field group module i think

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,520
it's

00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,480
this can be also a very very good

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,600
enhancement

00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,160
um to you know like group elements

00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,159
together

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:05,280
which belong together i think that's the

00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:05,280
important message here

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:11,360
so basically in in in the

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,320
example below you can see that we use

00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,320
tabs here

00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,000
to group the api which is called

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:20,000
discover swiss information

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:23,679
geo information media tour information

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,760
um just to have like content pieces

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,120
and not like having a free form which is

00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,320
very very long

00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,679
and you know like so better split up

00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,559
content into chunks

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:36,880
you can use tabs you can use vertical

00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,640
tabs accordions field sets

00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,919
the the field group module basically

00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,919
provides you a lot of options

00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,000
use field descriptions so in drupal you

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,360
can use prefix and suffixes and

00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,440
also help texts and i think this can

00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,840
also make a huge difference for content

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,799
editors so basically you can show them

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:01,200
what the system expects for them

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,240
in the x in the shared example below you

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,919
can see we have a

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,400
duration and we have the height

00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,720
so basically for the duration if i

00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,960
wouldn't write it that we expect

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,720
you know from the content editors that

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,120
they provide it in minutes

00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,480
they could also provide it in for for

00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:21,440
whatever reason in

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,120
seconds or hours or days but you know

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,159
like with that we can basically

00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,960
just uh guide the the content editor a

00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,840
bit better

00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:31,600
and show him what the or what drupal

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,679
expects from him

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,440
um also in the in the height example uh

00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,400
we show that we want to have it in

00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:39,039
meters so

00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,799
we make an assumption here that we want

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:42,000
to have the metric system and not the

00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,280
imperial one

00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,200
um also with the help text we can say

00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,880
provide us the minimal height so if you

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,919
have a minimal and the maximum height

00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,559
please provide us the minimum one um

00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,159
this really helps the user uh you know

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,039
like the content editor

00:21:56,159 --> 00:22:00,880
to fill in the right informations it's

00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,240
also very helpful for new content

00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,240
editors to onboard

00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,320
to your system so they have like a

00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,320
guidance on what to expect

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:15,039
um this is something you can do

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,840
literally in two minutes um but i

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,159
always see sites which don't use it um

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,120
so

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,919
you can basically provide um you know

00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,919
for a true

00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,159
what you see is what you get for a true

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,240
visibility experience you also need to

00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,919
provide like the styling of your front

00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,159
end um

00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,760
you know in the in the info yaml file of

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,000
your frontend theme you can add

00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,440
these two lines like the seeker editor

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,480
style sheets and the path

00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,400
to um you know like a a custom style

00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,440
sheet or two main style sheet which just

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,960
contains

00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:49,760
basically like all the the text styling

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,600
um you do a drush cr and then the

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,200
content editors basically have a live

00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,840
preview of how to

00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,520
perceive you know like text and listings

00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,159
and and headlines and everything in the

00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,799
visual

00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:02,559
editor um so i think every site should

00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,120
use that because otherwise it's not a

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,320
true

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,320
visibility experience

00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:13,840
um if you tend to use chin um

00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:16,400
there's a new feature since alpha 31

00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,440
so you can provide a chin custom css

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,440
file

00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,039
you can place that in your public files

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,200
directory which is normally

00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,240
sites or per default its size default

00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,600
files

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,799
um you you basically just put in all the

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:31,440
overrides you want to do

00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:33,840
to customize your drupal backend so for

00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,000
small adjustments like logo size or you

00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,799
want to just override some

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,159
functionalities or visually override

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,919
some functionalities of chin or

00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:43,679
enhancing stuff for or you know

00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,840
customizing stuff

00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,799
there is no need anymore to do a sub

00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,360
theme

00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:53,679
you can easily just for smaller

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,679
adjustment use this css adjustment file

00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,360
another thing if if you use the

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,840
paragraphs module

00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,880
you should use paragraph icons so each

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,600
paragraph type can use an icon

00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,279
this helps content editors you know like

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,840
visually

00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,120
basically to keep the different

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:16,080
paragraphs

00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,760
separated from each other so there's an

00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,480
open source lib

00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,120
icon library called feather icons which

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,279
which

00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,640
really fits nicely into chin as well so

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,600
you can use them

00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,960
um they're open source uh you know just

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,840
to use them as

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,840
as icons for for paragraphs

00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,400
again if you use paragraphs try out the

00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,760
experimental field plugin widget which

00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,600
is there for

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,880
i don't know it feels like it's there

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:48,400
forever and it's

00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:50,480
forever experimental but if you use the

00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,440
experimental field plug-in widget then

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,919
basically chin provides you this

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,159
new modern way of outlining the

00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,440
paragraphs so it uses enhancements in

00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,200
the chin theme

00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:05,039
to just provide you a more modern

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,039
approach to paragraphs in general

00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:11,360
also you know this might require some

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,640
more work

00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,919
but it's it's worth it so you can also

00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:20,000
use a view mode you can use a preview

00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,320
view mode for paragraphs

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,840
and you know if you if you use to

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,640
showcase like the

00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:27,760
the paragraphs in a in a preview in in

00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,840
the back end

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,159
you you basically can provide styling

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,159
for them just to

00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:35,679
give content editors a better preview of

00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,400
the content which can

00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:39,360
reassemble a bit like or outlining how

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,600
content will

00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,720
look like uh when published in the front

00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,960
end as well

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:48,000
so it's easier to identify and gives

00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,000
them a rough preview

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,039
if you use layout paragraphs on the

00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,080
other hand

00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,600
at unik we basically created a custom

00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:59,840
implementation to render

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,640
the paragraphs in the backend with you

00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:05,440
know like the front-end paragraphs

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,799
so this is a bit more effort than than

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,200
the last one you saw

00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,240
but it basically renders the real

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,400
front-end

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,039
uh you know like styling and template in

00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,200
the back end so content editors have

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:19,440
if they want to have a more visual

00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,400
editoring experience which goes more

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,600
into

00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,600
uh you know like direction of other

00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,279
cmss then basically they have like a

00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:30,480
live preview of content

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,480
chunks in the back end

00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,960
good um you know

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:42,400
as you might have read through like this

00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:46,240
uh you know like talks description i

00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,360
i said i will provide a demo repository

00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,840
and

00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,240
i did that on the weekend so basically i

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,200
updated my drupal lender starter kit

00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:57,279
where you can get from from this url and

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,960
i integrated a lot of the features and

00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,200
enhancements we

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,000
had a look at today so basically you can

00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,960
check that out

00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,400
it's it's quite easy to install you can

00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,159
dive in and maybe

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,159
you know use some stuff as a reference

00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:19,600
good so i also want to give you a brief

00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,440
outlook of what's expected to land

00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,760
sooner or later in drupal core

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,120
or you know like open issues and and

00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,200
stuff

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,440
so i think the most important thing

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,279
currently to date

00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,159
well at least from my perspective is

00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:36,880
that we're getting claro stable in core

00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,000
as chin relies on it and also that claro

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,760
out of the box

00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,240
you know it provides you a very nice out

00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:44,960
of the box experience for drupal

00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,320
this is a very very important thing and

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,039
this is the issue where you can

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,520
basically

00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:51,520
go into and help out if you want to

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,399
then there's another issue which

00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,559
basically wants to add

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,960
a content editor role to the standard

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,760
info installation profile

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,679
this will be very handy in the future to

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,000
further customize the experience

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:09,520
you know like specifically targeted for

00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,919
content editors

00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,640
so having this role in the default or in

00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,880
the standard

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,399
installation profile will help with a

00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,520
lot of customizations in

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,520
in the end in the future

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,360
there's also a proposal to make the

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,240
admin menu

00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:28,320
as a config so there is a proposal with

00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,399
a working patch

00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,640
you should check that out so this

00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,480
potentially provides a custom menu

00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,240
specific for content editors so you

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,000
could set up a menu which

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,440
specifically address the needs of

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,080
content editors

00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,960
uh you know like to just don't show them

00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,760
like all

00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,240
the the configuration options um you

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,720
know like

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,679
you might need to build up the site but

00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,720
rather

00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:55,440
provide them uh main menus which they

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,799
like for example a content menu maybe a

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,399
media item

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,080
and so on like really stuff they're

00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,000
working on and which

00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,399
will be very very handy for content

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:06,640
editors

00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:08,559
and there's another proposal to to make

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,720
the admin views basically use

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,840
hx per default so that you don't have to

00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:15,039
do it

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:17,520
manually i think that will also be there

00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:18,000
is one thing we need to consider or to

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:21,120
fix

00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
that we can do that but yeah so this is

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,320
also something

00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,840
i'm really looking forward to to discuss

00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,840
if you want to do that in the future

00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:42,559
so what are the free

00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:46,559
learnings or key takeaways you know

00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:46,559
you should take out today from this talk

00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,799
so the first thing is that site building

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,120
is crucial

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,880
i think the site builder has a very

00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,840
important role in your team

00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,039
and we should embrace that so the site

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,039
builder is basically

00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:05,440
in charge of building a great user

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:08,399
experience for content editors

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,039
um you know i think it's also important

00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,919
that you

00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:14,640
review like the the sites you build in

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:17,039
the back end also with the ux team

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,919
you know to outline how the content is

00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,000
structured

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,200
how it's visually shown to the content

00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,080
editors

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,440
and that leads me to the second point

00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,039
don't overdo it

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,799
like always keep in mind or always think

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:34,799
if you would use it yourself

00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:37,919
so usually less is more don't overdo it

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,600
and if you don't find the fields or the

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,679
content you're looking for

00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,720
the content editor most likely won't

00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,840
find it either

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,840
just keep that in mind

00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:51,840
and in general the experience is king so

00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,039
a good user experience will always help

00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,200
with adaption

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,840
and i mean that in two different ways

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,919
like in adaption for your product or

00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:01,200
site or platform or distro or whatever

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:03,120
you're building

00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,679
um you know like to onboard new content

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,000
editors or new users to your platform

00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,799
but also it will help like if you

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,880
provide a

00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:13,039
great user experience it will also help

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,720
with the adaption of drupal in general

00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:17,200
because people will talk about it

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,399
they will show it to other persons to

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,480
other people

00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,880
and in the end drupal will be the big

00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,880
winner

00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:31,120
so i was a bit faster than expected so

00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:34,240
that's basically already it

00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:37,200
i wanted to mention two more things

00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,919
so first of all there will be a birth of

00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,320
a feather

00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:41,679
called chin ebbington tomorrow at 10 30

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,200

00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:47,120
so if you have any questions or you want

00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,760
to discuss feature requests

some work on chin uh

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:09,679
if not i would highly recommend that you

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,840
join the claro contributions because

00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,240
this will also you know be in favor for

00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,080
chin

00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,919
yeah and at the end please give me

00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,240
feedback

00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,000
let me know if you like this session so

00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,120
it was quite a packed

00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,240
session but also addressing

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:32,799
beginners as well hopefully and

00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,799
now i will be ready to take on questions

00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,360
so um you have quite a few

00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:44,640
questions do you want to go through them

00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:44,640
or shall i pick some

00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:53,120
i let you pick some okay um

00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,600
so let's go from first the toolbar can

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,159
be

00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:58,399
personalized by user i guess everyone in

00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,960
content teams feels differently about

00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:00,960
options

00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,640
can you repeat that sorry the toolbar

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,880
can it be personalized by the user

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,080
i guess if you want yeah go ahead yes

00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,279
yes it can so

00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,919
um in chin you can enable a setting

00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,159
called

00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,760
uh you know like to let users overwrite

00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:20,559
the default behaviors

00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,600
so every user for its own or like every

00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,320
user who has a

00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,440
an uh like a user account in drupal can

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:28,399
basically

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,480
override um you know those settings so

00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:32,720
they can use whatever toolbar they like

00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,720
yes

00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,200
uh does gene work nicely with layout

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,519
builder

00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,799
um it does support it um i think there

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:44,080
are the the same

00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,640
issues as claro had have um currently

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,919
but there's a nice module built for

00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,799
claro which works

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,159
uh totally fine with chin as well i

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,519
think it's called

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,480
lb layout or something like that or cb

00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,159
layout i don't

00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,840
don't remember the the right name but

00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:00,559
there's a module for that which provides

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,559
you

00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:07,120
um like a nicely styled uh interface

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:09,679
until we basically got that fixed in

00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,679
clarence

00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,560
how do you handle problematics like

00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,280
providing your client a custom admin

00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,040
menu

00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,760
while still providing the default

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,679
administration menu to your team

00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,720
are there any modules you use in these

00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:27,679
cases you'd recommend

00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,040
um i think there's a lot of things which

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:32,720
currently go in this

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,960
direction but i think in the end

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,639
the goal should be that you can assign a

00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,280
menu to a role

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:39,679
um you know to if you have like this

00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,919
this

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,240
content editor role in drupal core in

00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:46,320
the installation profile and

00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:48,399
we would have basically like a feature

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,520
like that that you can customize

00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:54,079
the the menu in in drupal core

00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,040
uh then you could just assign a customly

00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,320
created

00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:00,560
um you know like menu to each

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,000
um you know like for example for the

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,640
content editors for the site

00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,400
builders for other like administrators

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,280
and so on so like for all the different

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,440
roles

00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,960
that would be one of the possibilities

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,960
to to tackle that problem

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,880
um we have two questions about the save

00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,640
button uh

00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,640
when the save button is at the end of

00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,560
the page it can be easily reached by

00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:25,040
hitting the end key on your keyboard

00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:26,000
without the need to use any scrolling

00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,079
will home work

00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,280
the same way to get you up to the save

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,480
button

00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,240
it should yes if not create an issue for

00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,240
that please

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,760
and a follow-up question to that if you

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:40,079
use tabbing to move

00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,800
from field to field are you jumping up

00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,560
to the top

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,640
of the page to save once you have

00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,480
reached the last field

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,480
um there's no need for it because the

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,720
safe button is sticky so it's all

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,680
it's it's basically fixed at the at the

00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,240
top of the site

00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:56,320
so the focus will just switch over to

00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,400
this sticky bar

00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,640
so that's basically how we we tackle

00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,640
that

00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,000
george is saying he likes the look and

00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,599
feel of this theme

00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,400
is there an eta for a stable build

00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,720
um yeah there's there's no eta for it

00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,160
but

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:15,359
um we're very very close to release the

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,680
first batter build

00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,680
um so i think from a you know from a

00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:22,800
standpoint if it's stable or not

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,160
the theme is already quite stable um but

00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,040
you know like each maintainer takes that

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,240
differently

00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:31,040
what a stable build is and i really want

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,119
to have it

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,440
stable stable before doing a stable

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,440
build

00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,560
and i think as long as claro is not

00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,200
stable

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,280
chin cannot be stable as well because

00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,040
that would be

00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,440
you know a bit weird

00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:51,920
what do you recommend to have help test

00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,280
text description for long text fields or

00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,680
other tool fields

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,800
because default drupal description under

00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,320
the field is not

00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:03,680
too useful in this case in my opinion

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:07,200
um that's a really good question there's

00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:09,359
also a module which basically

00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,400
gives you the option to place a help

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:13,760
text

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,240
above you know like a field so this

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,680
could be

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:18,400
maybe or potentially a solution but yeah

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,240
i mean

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,480
another solution would be that you could

00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,599
place like a sticky

00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,440
um you know like as a sticky help text

00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,680
to the right of the field for example if

00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,320
you

00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,200
if you limit the width of the field but

00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,960
there's no

00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,560
module i would know that that can

00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,320
provide that but

00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,599
you could customize that in the gym

00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,240
custom css

00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,480
file so you could basically provide this

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,920
this with some css overrides if you

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,280
if you like to what about nested

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,440
paragraphs in gene

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,680
when will the duplicate handlebars issue

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,400
is likely to get solved

00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,160
um there's no ether for that because

00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,599
it's basically a core issue

00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:02,560
um if you if you head over to the

00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:05,280
to the chin issue sorry to the chin

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:08,400
project overview i linked there

00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,160
basically the issue in drupal core

00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,960
with you know like the relevant patches

00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:15,040
you need to get that working

00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,800
it's the same issue with claro as well

00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,760
like clearing core

00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:23,440
but i think this should be solved with

00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,440
the next release of clara

00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,440
accessibility is important for all users

00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,440
how accessible

00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:34,400
is the gene admin theme um yeah as

00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,880
you know like we we have quite um a

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:40,000
strong focus on accessibility and claro

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:42,160
and qin basically inherits the whole uh

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,079
templating system and the whole design

00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:48,240
um design system from claro

00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:50,000
it should also be quite accessible

00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,079
there's still like outstanding tests

00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,640
there are also some elements which

00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,640
might be a concern currently which we're

00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:59,599
looking into how we want to fix that

00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,280
from an accessibility point of view so

00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,200
accessibility will also be a high

00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,200
priority

00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,200
for chin as well in the future

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:15,839
our roles additive which is chosen then

00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,960
can you repeat that sorry all roles but

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:21,680
roles are additive

00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:25,520
which is chosen then this was us by

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:29,040
if rick i'm not sure if it's clear

00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:31,280
not not really to me follow-up question

00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,960
okay and while we are waiting for some

00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,400
maybe some clarification on this can you

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,119
please repeat when the

00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,079
buff will be and uh i guess it's going

00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:43,359
to be

00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:46,880
ct but what will be the time

00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:51,280
