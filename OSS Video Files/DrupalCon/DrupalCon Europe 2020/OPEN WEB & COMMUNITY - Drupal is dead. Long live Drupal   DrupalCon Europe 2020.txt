Description: 
	With the release of Drupal 9 our open source CMS has reached a new stage in its life cycle! Weâ€™ve come a long way, and grown a lot, through some challenges and a lot of success. What has changed with Drupal, its components and dependencies recently and why? What do some of these changes mean for the future of Drupal, for open source, and all of us as contributors and users?

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,320
so yes

00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,680
uh welcome everyone we are live right

00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,240
now so

00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,920
kevin thank you very much uh you can

00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:23,279
start your presentation whenever you're

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,320
ready

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,359
okay um hello everybody i i

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,000
i'm a little fragmented because i just

00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,480
went through some

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,040
fun technical issues getting this set up

00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:36,480
so did not really have as much time to

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,040
play with the platform as i would like

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,960
so bear with me as i figure this out

00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,879
um the session that you're currently in

00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,079
is called uh drupal is dead

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,760
long with drupal um it should be an

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,640
interesting conversation i think i gave

00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,840
a similar

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,160
uh kind of talk uh maybe

00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,760
at drupalcon austin when i did the state

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,440
of devops presentation you're more than

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,039
welcome to go back and

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,640
review that it's on youtube if you'd

00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,760
like to look it up um

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,799
but uh very similar points then as i'm

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,400
making now

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,320
and i think that they still are are

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,080
pretty relevant the big difference is

00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,280
now i have a lot more insight from a

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,880
business perspective

00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,020
of how some of these problems might

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:19,209
actually translate into solutions

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,209
[Music]

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,400
so basic agenda for what we're going to

00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,080
do

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,680
is we're going to go through uh three

00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,759
different sections we're going to talk a

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,880
little bit about how drupal has changed

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,400
we're going to talk about what those

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,000
changes might mean for the future of the

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,520
project in the greater open source

00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,799
system ecosystem

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,960
and we're going to talk about how to

00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,880
cope with all of this change

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,439
drupal and is dead is completely

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,720
tongue-in-cheek uh it's parading the old

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,759
champ the queen is dead

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:51,040
long live the queen uh when one one

00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,320
one monarch passed away and another

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,320
uh rose to the throne the role remains

00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:58,320
the same but the occupant changes

00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,520
in our case drupal as we used to know at

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,079
15 years or

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,600
at least i 15 years and four months ago

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,680
when i started contributing

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,119
is dead and gone and a new drupal has

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,000
taken its place i've been in this

00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,399
community for

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,760
a significant amount of time i've seen a

00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,959
lot of changes i've helped

00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,200
grow drupal in significant ways and i

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,720
i i have nothing but gratitude for the

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,520
community and the things that it has

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,520
taught me

00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,879
this project has changed my life and it

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,920
has changed the lives of

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,480
millions of people it is a very positive

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,760
effort um it is a very positive energy

00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,920
but i think there are things that can

00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,160
make it a little bit better

00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,000
um you know this is also a time to be

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,280
extra thoughtful about our technology

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,200
our community and our place in the

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,800
broader ecosystem in the world there are

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,640
several sessions at drupalcon about

00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,840
drupal 9 specifically so this is not

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,040
really going to go into too many

00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,800
technical details

00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,840
so much as talk about the open source

00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,920
ethos

00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,680
um so let's

00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,000
talk a little bit about how drupal has

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,000
changed

00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,200
major changes in drupal this year

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,400
basically

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,959
in the preceding 12 months um

00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,319
number one awkway is now owned by vista

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,120
equity partners

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,959
this is a significant change um not a

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,200
lot of people

00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,440
talk about this accurately so uh we'll

00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,360
touch on this in a little bit

00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,280
significant migration from drupal 8 to

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,519
drupal 9 has been designed to be as

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,040
easy as possible you know i remember

00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,159
doing drupal before

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,640
uh migrate modules existed or before

00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,519
you know anybody had a good system for

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,239
doing that

00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,159
and doing migrations was the single most

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,000
problematic expensive thing that you

00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,040
could do moving from one version

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,239
of drupal to another um so i find it to

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,319
be

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,959
really encouraging that this is you know

00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:48,080
a first-class citizen now in drupal 9.

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:50,080
it's a huge win for everybody uh

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,440
drupal is closely tracking symphony and

00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,560
php life cycles

00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,920
so a lot of what we're going to be

00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,439
touching on is getting more in touch

00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,480
with the open source communities that

00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,560
surround drupal

00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,920
um and and really participating in them

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,080
and i think that this is a really good

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,640
stride in that direction

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,760
uh we've moved from drupal uh specific

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,840
simple tests

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,959
you know i worked with jimmy berry and

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,799
randy fay and

00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,560
a bunch of others way back in the day to

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,239
help put together some of the first

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,959
iterations of the simple testing

00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,639
framework and it's really great to see

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,440
all of that being gutted and replaced

00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,000
with something that

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,880
is more industry standard that is easier

00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,040
for

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,639
you know outside drupal people to be

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,880
able to understand i think that's going

00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,639
to have significant ramifications

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,240
ramifications for the future of the

00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,320
project

00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,160
um we've got some amazing work happening

00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,440
with drupal themes like oliveiro and

00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,520
clara

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,199
these are are you know really helping to

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,560
address some of the usability issues

00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,360
that i might touch on a little bit in

00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,680
this session

00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,280
uh really helping to address some of the

00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,040
learning curve for some of the newer

00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,639
people that are starting to use drupal

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,440
and i think it's making fantastic

00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,639
strides

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,680
towards you know really lowering the bar

00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,360
of entry for group

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,960
in a lot of way for a lot of people so

00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,120
there's a lot of positives

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,080
um we've got more dependency changes for

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,479
9.0

00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,280
uh we've had major updates with twigs

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,400
symphony

00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:13,039
um composer there's a lot of

00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,320
major updated components underneath the

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,680
hood in drupal now and

00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,680
that's pretty fantastic

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,800
um drupal however doesn't really

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,120
stand on its own there's a lot of

00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,960
adjacent projects that we really need to

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,560
pay attention to in order to be really

00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:33,120
effective with drupal

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,360
i'm in in 2020 drupal can serve

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,440
as just one piece of a really complex

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,360
puzzle of services and tools

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,520
that are needed to create and deploy a

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,479
relevant contemporary project

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,160
um contemporary basically means that you

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,000
move outside of

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,280
you know the things that you're you're

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,039
you're historically

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,320
used to and you start to see some new

00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:55,120
players enter

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:56,880
into the field um you get things like

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,319
the cloud native foundation you get

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,880
things like docker you get your

00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,160
traditional php systems like

00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,319
a composer and you have

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,199
a whole host of additional projects that

00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,840
are spanning up

00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,199
outside of the drew maybe not outside of

00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,440
the drupal space but

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,680
as anxiety efforts to be able to provide

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,560
functionality that is not being provided

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,280
by the core

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,840
project these include tools like ddev

00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,080
lando doxel you've heard a host of these

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,960
um docker-based development tools coming

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,280
up

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,039
and you know i think it's very healthy

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,280
the competition is good

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,440
the ability to focus on problems

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,039
holistically and as a community is good

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,880
and i think it's really fantastic um

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:42,720
these days drupal is pretty popular as a

00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,720
decoupled cms background

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,960
that's moving it in the right direction

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,160
pairing it with front end frameworks

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,800
like gatsby and vue.js is a fantastic

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,720
move

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,560
it opens up the doors for many new

00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,000
contributors and is is really a great

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,759
way of moving

00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,840
we rely a lot on other projects to

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,360
support and paradrupal or well beyond

00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,360
contribute modules

00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,800
composer in the shift an object oriented

00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,560
approach brought drupal more in line

00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,479
with broader php community

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,280
which of course is when backdrop for

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,199
drupal to stay on a different path

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,639
there's some debate you know when

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,479
backdrop forked as

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,240
you know the concept of simple core

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,199
maybe that was a better direction for

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,440
drupal

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,319
we're going to talk a lot about making

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,080
sure that we're

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,360
addressing the right problems in the

00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,680
space and

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,039
it there's a debate as to whether drupal

00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,000
chose to address the right

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,680
problems when that division ended up

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
happening

00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:38,240
but we'll get into that in a little bit

00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,240
so

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,199
let's go over

00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,879
a couple of quotes we're going to start

00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,879
with preston so

00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,720
today headless cmss are all the rage

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,400
among developers due to their front-end

00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,720
agnosticism

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,319
and rich developer ecosystems unbridled

00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,400
builders who have shaved against the

00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,639
restrictions that outdated presentation

00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,840
layers and traditional web-based cms is

00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,280
long imposed

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,879
it's leading to an environment where

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,520
headless cmss are by

00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,919
developers for developers and legacy

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,400
cms's are for everyone else

00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,680
so here's an interesting thing i i'm you

00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,759
know

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,360
i i i've been involved in a lot of

00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,120
business circles and a lot of business

00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,400
conversations and i'm on a lot of

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,319
mailing lists and

00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:26,560
uh technical related conversations

00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:30,080
um in every instance across those lists

00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,479
when anybody on that list asks

00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,560
how to get their content how to publish

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,760
their website what's the best way of

00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:42,159
very rapidly prototyping an idea i have

00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:45,920
never once seen drupal recommended

00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:46,720
period there is nobody in these circles

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,920
in this

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,880
contemporary world that is defaulting to

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,560
drupal

00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:57,360
um to be able to quickly and easily

00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,240
get their message out in a secure way

00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,880
you're dealing with

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,600
enterprise adoption at this point that

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,680
is

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,640
willing to take on additional complexity

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,880
to solve

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,080
more complex needs right other cmss have

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,519
data built with api

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,000
access in mind and it's a different

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,839
structure so if you're going to

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,760
go the jam stack route you compile

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,959
everything out of drupal into js every

00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,720
time it changes

00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:23,040
just using drupal as the back end

00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,920
because you happen to have drupal around

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,519
it's not the future um it's it's

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,560
something that we need to

00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:32,560
really address and understand so

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,040
in order to really address it we need to

00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,360
understand what drupal is really good at

00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,800
maybe still it's the full front end back

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,519
end but maybe

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,200
it's not maybe it's a smaller component

00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,200
maybe it's a set of services

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,440
maybe it's the ability for people to

00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:49,920
extend in a very rapid way maybe

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,440
it's being able to output much like

00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,920
views does in different

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,440
formats you want static html you want

00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,720
javascript you want

00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,240
you know any number of things um

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,399
and that's what we really need to focus

00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,399
on

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,240
so there have been a number of changes

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,240
to how we contribute

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,519
uh these are very interesting to me for

00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,440
a number of reasons

00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,200
you know we have new issues forks and

00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,480
merge requests are available

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,040
uh following a more familiar workflow

00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,920
from

00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,079
github open source work uh patches are

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,160
still available as forks are new as of

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,839
november 2020.

00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,720
you know i i i don't mean to come across

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,560
a cynical

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:36,480
or or anything like that but

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:39,399
we were working with pull requests with

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,360
drupal in 2012 when we built

00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:43,360
examiner.com

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,360
we needed to because working with

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,680
patches

00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,720
is a very different way of doing things

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,680
it's not

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,800
in alignment with the broader open

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,040
source world

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,640
that is something that drupal i think

00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,640
can stand to learn a little bit from

00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,880
um

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,560
i'll just keep going so uh one of the

00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,320
coolest things i think that's happened

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,959
in the past year for drupal

00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,600
is the relationship between the drupal

00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,800
association and tugboat

00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:20,320
and simply test me i think uh so

00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:23,040
basically um the drupal association

00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,800
simply tests me lullabot and tugboat

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,880
work together to provide environments

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,200
for drupal projects that are pool based

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,640
um so whenever you submit a pull request

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,680
you have the ability to go

00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,680
and evaluate that site in real time uh

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,360
based off of the code it's it's it's a

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,240
very similar system to what we have

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,170
working with

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,360
you know with ddev live

00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:43,120
[Music]

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,880
and it's very effective for people so

00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,360
what we're finding is that

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,640
the ability to very and quickly spin up

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,200
these these things

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,880
to give you these sites that provide

00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,760
additional context into what you're

00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,000
working on

00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,240
removes massive amounts of barriers for

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,519
people it really lowers the bar of entry

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,040
for a lot of folks and i think that

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,720
that's really important

00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:07,760
um i i just can't

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,800
uh congratulate these folks enough for

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,519
this

00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,360
uh the contribution process itself has

00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,079
now changed for code contributors with

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,839
the move

00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,360
to get lab and merge requests

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,279
contributors have a somewhat less

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,079
complex path to offering and reviewing

00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,680
changes

00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,240
the risk here is that any change will

00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,600
also cause existing users drop

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,240
off so as much as i think that

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,720
you know personally pull requests are

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,720
fine

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,880
and maybe should have been implemented

00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,760
earlier there are people out there

00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,120
that can only work with patches for

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,079
whatever reason

00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,800
um when we make a change like this we

00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,880
isolate and we cast those people off

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,600
um if they're not willing to make the

00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,399
change to move themselves forward

00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,839
um it's it's it's an interesting

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,639
paradigm it's something that we need to

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,320
think about that we need to be aware of

00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,000
uh i don't know if you've noticed this

00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:03,360
but the drupal community has

00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,880
opinions um and that's great

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,639
that's why we're pretty happy with the

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,079
diversity of solutions available for

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,000
various problems

00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,279
that's the spirit of open source debate

00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,600
about these things

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,920
is really good as long as what you're

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,160
doing is getting to the root problem

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,959
and you're solving the right root

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,040
problem

00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:22,639
and i think that that is the lesson that

00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,880
that we can all learn from a little bit

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,880
more

00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,959
what those changes might mean for the

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,440
future of the project in the greater

00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,440
open source ecosystem basically i think

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,680
everything's like a pendulum right

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,880
uh and i think that this pendulum

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,839
centers around

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,959
our ability as humans to learn and

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,519
understand

00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,040
so whenever you know you know you have a

00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,839
bunch of engineers in a room

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,480
those engineers are going to solve

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,519
problems

00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,519
that are specific to engineers um and

00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,920
they're going to do it in very

00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,199
engineer-focused ways

00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,440
you know one of the things that i've

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:02,639
learned

00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,920
over time is that when an engineer

00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,199
creates

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:09,440
a solution to a problem it's likely

00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,720
technical in nature and might be a

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,839
little bit difficult

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,680
for a non-technical human to understand

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,160
or interact with

00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,959
that pendulum needs to swing between

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,920
those two

00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:24,160
extremes until it finds a happy medium

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,000
and then both sides of the equation can

00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,920
equally engage in it i see this

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,160
consistently in technology

00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,160
i see it you know with kubernetes

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,279
everybody wants to use kubernetes now

00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,120
that's coming back

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,760
i see it with docker everybody wants to

00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,360
use docker and now that's coming back

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,360
and and that's another case study that

00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:45,839
we'll get into um

00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,839
it's is a very interesting thing so

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,880
it's just you have to take time to

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:55,760
understand what you're doing

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:58,639
you have to maybe not evaluate the shiny

00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,680
um you know it's very easy to go to

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,680
extremes

00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:04,720
um a good example uh would be the rdfa

00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,920
conversation

00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,440
and i don't know how many of you

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,120
remember drupalcon i think

00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,120
possibly denver maybe a little bit

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,240
earlier dries

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:20,079
got up on stage for this keynote and

00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:23,279
you know sold rdfa as the next

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,560
major development in the internet and

00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,800
and something that drupal was going to

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,639
embrace wholeheartedly it did have

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,160
positive effects but it would in no way

00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,720
shape or form

00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,160
it lived up to the expectation that

00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,079
drewes had set

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:40,000
for the community um and that's a very

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,839
good example of that pendulum the

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,440
expectation was very high

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,199
reality brought it back a little bit

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,759
more to the

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,639
the medium and now we have a very

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,920
functional

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,720
implementation of rdf a that is very

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,399
useful

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,800
but not quite what we thought it was

00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,800
going to be

00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:01,680
by working closely with other open

00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,720
source projects and communities to

00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,360
define and create

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,759
agnostic best practices as well as

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,720
software solutions we can change

00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,600
we can help support each other as our

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,040
own cms

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,040
changes this is the the ethos of why

00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,480
i created the company that that i've

00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,800
created dev

00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,000
um let me give you an example of how

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,040
this can work

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,920
uh that's specific to drupal so you know

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,920
when views was brought into drupal core

00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,399
there was a very

00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,199
interesting decision that that was made

00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,480
right

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:39,360
and that was to make views

00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,759
a part of drupal core if we had stepped

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,600
back

00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,360
and maybe evaluated things a little bit

00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,320
differently and said

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,600
okay well what we really need is a

00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:51,040
generic

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,600
tool that will transform

00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,639
information from a multitude of data

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,720
sources

00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:02,320
and output it into a multiple

00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,440
set of formats json xml html whatever we

00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,600
want

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,559
and we make that as an independent

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,199
project

00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,079
that is designed to have generic

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,720
interfaces

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,559
so that it can be used in any project

00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,280
instead of just drupal

00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,559
and instead we maybe keep a smaller

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,760
version of drupal

00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:25,679
that we can really do really well uh

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:27,760
and we you know

00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,919
we do that so basically what you have

00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:32,160
now is two separate projects

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,400
kind of like the maybe the cloud native

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,360
foundation looks over a multitude of

00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,440
projects

00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,000
let's say for example another cms comes

00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,880
along and they happen to be php based

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,760
they're looking for a query uh builder

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,960
essentially

00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,720
uh they suddenly realize hey this great

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,080
person from the drupal community

00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:54,960
came to my uh meetup in germany or

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,720
whatever uh and explained to me that

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,760
they've got this really great tool

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,440
it's agnostic i can use it in a variety

00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,400
of ways so let's pull it into our

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,760
project

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:07,919
so instead of creating

00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,799
a lot of overhead a lot of security

00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,000
issues

00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:15,360
um a lot of problems really

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,280
to solve the specific editorial

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,640
issues that we were experiencing at the

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,240
time

00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:26,480
may not have been the right decision um

00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:28,400
because what you did is you neglected to

00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,520
capitalize on those different

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,280
communities

00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,120
and experience the world as a larger

00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,480
whole and

00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,640
it's possible that you have blocked

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,120
people from contributing to the project

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,039
in different ways as a result of it

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,400
and that's just a hypothetical there's a

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:45,520
lot of different ways of looking at

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,360
these things

00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,360
um so i encourage you to just kind of

00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,880
really think about the roots of what

00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,520
what we're doing you know why

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:57,280
why things exist the way they do how can

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:59,120
they really be better

00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,799
first of all drupal is not dead but i

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,880
would argue it's not in a healthy place

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,200
relative to competing projects as it was

00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:08,799
in its heyday in the early 2010s

00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,880
this is from jeff gearling in drupal's

00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,799
case a major effort was made in drupal 8

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,880
to get off the island and replace many

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,280
core apis and systems with symphony and

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,080
other php ecosystems

00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,960
ecosystem libraries it was an ambitious

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:25,760
effort and drupal today is a pretty well

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,120
architected php application but it broke

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,360
the implicit trust

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,039
developers built over many prior

00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:33,679
releases

00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,400
product process has to fit how the user

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,440
works or

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,000
wants to work not the ideal engineers

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,559
thinks

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,240
is best so here's an interesting thing

00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:46,000
that i've learned over time

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,000
i engineers cannot

00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:52,720
traditionally write a business case

00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:54,000
statement um and i've seen it tie i've

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,360
done it i've done it

00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,640
is many many times i can't define

00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,559
things without using technical jargon um

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,559
and what i've discovered is that when i

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,960
go through and evaluate the problem

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,240
and i try to define what that problem is

00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,320
and i read it

00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,240
i'll write it i'll pause i'll go take a

00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,840
break drink a cup of coffee whatever

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,280
come back read it and if there's

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,000
anything technical in there

00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,280
i need to take it out and continue that

00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,520
iterative process

00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,760
until finally i'm left with the pure

00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:26,559
essence of what that problem is

00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,280
as it relates to humans we need to get

00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,840
better at

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,840
articulating things from a human

00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,760
perspective so that we know that we're

00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:36,720
architecting and engineering

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,120
the correct solutions to problems and i

00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,840
don't think that we've done that because

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,240
we're we're good engineers we're an

00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,039
exceptional community of amazing

00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,520
engineers

00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,960
and we are very likely to jump onto

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,799
engineering first

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:56,080
approaches to solving problems

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,880
that might be why in those mailing lists

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,360
and in those

00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,159
other communities that don't participate

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,799
in drupal

00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,480
drupal's not not a buzzword it's not

00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,200
something that people recommend

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,360
you know it's possible that we missed

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,559
the real human experience that we needed

00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,840
to connect to

00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:19,679
to be able to continue to be valuable to

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,679
people just something to think about

00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,080
here's another quote from a gentleman

00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,760
named alex

00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,520
it was decided that the dollars behind

00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,200
the development would also decide the

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,919
direction of the cms

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,760
this was the fulcrum changing everything

00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,760
larger companies got to push their

00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,000
decisions for drupal's future

00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:40,320
that no longer cared for the smaller

00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,520
companies and amateur developers

00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:47,360
who have now lost their voice

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:49,840
so this is a contentious issue um

00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,799
it's possible that this is a good thing

00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,440
it's possible

00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,919
that this is a bad thing it's impossible

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,120
to

00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,679
say for sure whether it's good or bad

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,760
but drupal is losing market share to

00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,480
wordpress and simple site builders like

00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,480
wix

00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,080
and it's fantastic that the drupal

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,760
community you know with the the last

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,919
keynote that i saw from dries

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:11,200
is starting to addre address that

00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,600
problem with some of these out of the

00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,600
box

00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,080
initiatives i think that's a very good

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,039
step in the right direction but again

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,440
are we really solving the right problem

00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,440
is

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,960
the real question that we need to be

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,200
asking

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,280
um again we've learned that the drupal

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,280
hammer really is too big for many jobs

00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,559
and too complex for developers who just

00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,120
need to get a simple job

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,080
done we run the risk of excluding new

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,720
developers

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,200
and new contributors because the drupal

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,520
learning clip is still very steep

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,640
um and that's directly from alex's blog

00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,960
post

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:49,600
so again you know i i'm trying to incite

00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,520
thought uh gearling also mentions the

00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,159
focus on high dollar enterprise

00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,640
projects thereby losing market share to

00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:00,720
simpler site building platforms

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:03,840
dries even said d8 plus is for ambitious

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,840
digital experiences but

00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,200
what about those people that don't have

00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,320
ambitious digital

00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,799
experiences what about those people that

00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,000
are

00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:17,039
doing a website for their their brother

00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,400
or friend that runs a mom-and-pop

00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,400
business down the corner

00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:22,480
and they don't need anything complicated

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,799
they don't need the enterprise

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,919
complexity of drupal they don't need the

00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,880
consistent

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,559
security threat of drupal they just need

00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,679
to get their message out there

00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,960
very much as the internet was when i

00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,000
started developing it

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,400
in the 90s the early 90s you know the

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
end result is html it's a very static

00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,720
thing it's a very simple thing to

00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,600
deliver

00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,159
but we've made it so complicated that it

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,760
takes significant effort we've created

00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,960
our own

00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,559
industry essentially and again are we

00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,200
really solving the right problems and

00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,080
who are we

00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,000
really solving problems for i think are

00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,640
very critical things that any open

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,400
source

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:07,039
engineer or technologist needs to ask

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,039
themselves

00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,080
so do we care about the total number of

00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,520
sites out there if they're paying more

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:18,640
i mean really if you need a

00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:20,400
million small sites to be able to make

00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,159
enough margin to

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:28,880
make your investors happy

00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:32,240
but you only need 250 very large sites

00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,520
to make those same investors happy i

00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,960
i don't know it's it's just an

00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,679
interesting thing to think about a lot

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,080
of different ways

00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:41,679
i'm going to lead you leave you to come

00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,679
up with your own conclusions on that

00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,799
and this is a quote from me uh once you

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,480
start to disenfranchise the people who

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:54,880
help to build the project you

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:57,120
start to have some significant issues um

00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,320
you know i i know many people in the

00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,320
drupal space

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,600
that are no longer in the drupal space i

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,080
know many people

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,360
that have been significant contributors

00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,400
to this community

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,960
that have burned out or been used or or

00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,080
have been

00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:14,159
abused or have if there's just

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,960
any number of reasons that they're not

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,200
here anymore

00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,640
that's a problem you've got some of the

00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,360
smartest people in the world that

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,320
created an amazing project that changed

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,960
the world

00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,200
we introduced how open source should

00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,960
work to larger organizations

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,600
organizations like the cloud native

00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,480
foundation organizations like kubernetes

00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,440
who

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,679
took lessons from us and established

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,279
governance models that really worked

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,120
right out of the gate because they were

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,039
able to see what we accomplished

00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,120
they were able to see our growing pains

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:50,640
they were able to see what we were doing

00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:53,279
and they learned from it i

00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,080
think drupal should do the same they

00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,159
need to look

00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,000
off the island drupal needs to get off

00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,240
that island and they need to look around

00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,679
to learn from other people we can do

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,440
more pendulum

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:05,840
back and forth between open source

00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,360
communities we were trendsetters and

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,279
have set the tone for open source

00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,240
communities in the industry

00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,919
as a result of the popularity of drupal

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,960
people learned from that readdress the

00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,559
problem with that additional

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,640
understanding and built on it

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,559
drupal needs to go back now and learn

00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,320
from them conversely there are

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,000
underserved communities that are simply

00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,679
trying to survive

00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,279
there are a lot of lessons that can be

00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,039
brought to these other communities that

00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:31,120
we learned here in drupal

00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,799
there are people trying to make a living

00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,360
for themselves

00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:36,799
that could learn a lot from us that

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,120
we're not engaged with

00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:41,440
and we could also learn a lot from them

00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,520
to make sure that we're solving the root

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,120
problems that we need to continue to be

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,159
a successful

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,159
open source project

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,279
so i guess really the question is do we

00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,200
sustain or evolve

00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,320
people's perceptions do change as a

00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,080
project changes

00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,559
we all wrangle against change but it

00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,480
happens as drupal has evolved the goals

00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:04,240
and needs of the project have changed

00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,600
drupal has gone in a direction we're

00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,039
just trying to support it

00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,600
and the corporate influence and

00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:12,720
enterprise adoption and financial shift

00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,799
is real is it bad

00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,159
it's different but many of us in the

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,840
community aren't there

00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,000
we're in different environments and

00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,080
that's what we're trying to address

00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,720
you know it's community first for me

00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:27,360
it's not business first for me

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,520
drupal is dead long lived drupal still

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:31,440
drupal but completely different

00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:34,080
so what are we trying to do now sustain

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:38,240
or evolve

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,919
right so when we want to be inclusive

00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,960
not break things or people and create

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,600
something useful

00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,960
you can't be a technical purist i say

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,480
that as someone who is extremely

00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,240
pro-open source and have made some

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,960
internal shifts to a couple commercial

00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,320
tools

00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,240
specifically because they work better

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,320
and are the best fit to accomplish the

00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,760
goals that i need for that specific

00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,440
problem

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,960
what ends up happening is that you have

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,520
to do things from a product

00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,080
first approach and what that means is

00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,000
you're

00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,080
really identifying what that root

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,840
problem is from a human perspective

00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,760
to make sure that you're building your

00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:14,960
problem or your product

00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:17,120
to provide value right that's

00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,080
business 101 that's what you want to do

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,080
to be successful

00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,600
in order to do a product first approach

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,799
you have to be able to define the

00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,640
problem you're trying to solve a

00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,559
non-technical term

00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,159
it's that's really hard for engineering

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,720
folks like we already covered

00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,320
or anyone who's in the day-to-day work

00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,080
you got to know what pain you're trying

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,240
to solve before you make changes

00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,520
otherwise you wind up hindering someone

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,120
in some way

00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,799
until you understand that problem all

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,720
the technical changes in the world won't

00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:50,240
solve the problem for the user

00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,240
you know we use a process of prds

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,360
that is an industry standard you know it

00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,480
starts off by

00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:59,520
really defining what that business

00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,880
case is what that business problem is

00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:05,600
um and then from there you go into maybe

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,640
a a description of how that product can

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,960
address

00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,640
the business problem and you use that

00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,399
business problem as a guiding light to

00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,480
make sure that all of your technical

00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:17,679
decisions from that point forward

00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:19,279
support the end goal and what's

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,480
interesting is i've seen teams

00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,520
transformed

00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,640
from complete chaos where they are

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,399
incapable

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,320
of making forward movement they're doing

00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,480
lots of work tons of work

00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,360
lots of really amazing engineering

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,279
really smart people doing so many things

00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,039
but they're not moving the needle

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,760
towards that goal because that business

00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:42,880
goal has not been identified properly

00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:45,360
so the work that they're doing might

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,960
feel burdensome after a while because

00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,399
they're taking on so much

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,159
they're burning themselves out because

00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,840
they're doing all this amazing stuff

00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,360
but the problem's not being solved and

00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,440
they don't know why

00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,559
i'm stepping back and evaluating where

00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,080
you want to go

00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,840
what the problem is that you want to

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,600
solve and then using a framework to be

00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,840
able to execute on that

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,279
by defining how the product's going to

00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,000
address the business

00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,960
problem and then further defining the

00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,520
feature set

00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,480
of that product specifically as it

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,159
relates to

00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,880
how that product will solve that problem

00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,480
um that gets translated into epics and

00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,279
then from there you have the ability to

00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,159
go through

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,440
and start subdividing a massive amount

00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,960
of complexity

00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,720
and technical nuance that the business

00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,120
never needs to understand

00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,000
and if you remove the word business from

00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,440
that and you just

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,880
use the word customer or human um

00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,720
you know it it kind of works

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,240
for drupal it feels like product market

00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,880
research has shifted from doing it for

00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,039
each other

00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,520
to doing it for the big enterprise you

00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,760
know when i started working in drupal

00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,960
i did it because all my friends were

00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,440
doing it um i

00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,799
i did it because i was trying to solve i

00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,440
wanted to put my pictures on the

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,480
internet

00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,559
you know i thought that was cool um so

00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,960
i found a platform that i could do that

00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,559
with i suddenly figured out that there

00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,600
was this whole world of other people

00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:10,799
just like me

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:13,279
i'm a high school dropout i learned html

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,919
in my mom's basement essentially um

00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,840
sitting on

00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,559
a very very very cheap computer in a

00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,399
very

00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:24,080
poor scenario um as a result of the hard

00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:25,679
work and the effort and the learning

00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:29,039
that that i

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,919
took on myself i was able to elevate

00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,519
myself

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,960
through the use of drupal and through

00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:36,000
the use of this community

00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:37,039
and as a result i helped enrich many

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,799
people's lives

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,960
i helped contribute to the project in

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,640
great ways we were all

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,120
working together to solve these really

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,440
cool problems for ourselves

00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,159
we weren't really solving them for

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,919
customers just then

00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,080
there are common things that our cms's

00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,000
php applications specifically

00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,360
all have to deal with solving things in

00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,039
an open way

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,279
kind of like that views example that i

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,240
gave you allows us to move on to other

00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,399
problems

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,320
it's hard to find and separate those

00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,080
solutions so others can reuse them

00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,360
but the more we use the frameworks of

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,679
drupal 8 and 9

00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,200
we can start being more impactful in our

00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,480
sister projects

00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,320
a really great example of this are the

00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,120
the you know when you do a composer

00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,799
install of drupal or you do a composer

00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,720
install of typo3

00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:26,320
if you would have done that a year ago

00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,640
and looked at that output

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,799
you would not have seen a lot of

00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,159
cross-pollination between the libraries

00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:34,480
that are being delivered

00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,840
for those two projects they're both php

00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,600
based cms's

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,080
now when you do a composer install of

00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:42,559
drupal you see typo3 libraries

00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,480
when you do a composer install of typo3

00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,960
you see drupal libraries

00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,640
that is how it should be um the

00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,640
functionality that we're looking to

00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,120
create to solve our problems

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,880
can be shared and utilized with

00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,840
additional communities that

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,679
further addresses the problem of getting

00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,559
new people to participate in the

00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,120
community

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,799
and greatly increases the effectiveness

00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:07,120
of our engineering efforts

00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,919
we get more feedback we get a broader

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:11,120
range of

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:12,880
use cases and we know through

00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,320
outreach and communication and working

00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,799
together that we're solving the right

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:19,039
problems

00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:20,880
it boils down to the pace of innovation

00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,159
things are going to continue to change

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,640
and change rapidly

00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,360
the takeaway is that the things that do

00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,200
really well

00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:30,000
are the things that focus on solving

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,760
root problems not reinventing the wheel

00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,279
dig for the root and you find a group

00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,840
focused on solving it

00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,440
join their efforts no need to lose time

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,480
and energy and money trying to do it

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,200
your own way

00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:43,679
apply our open source principles and

00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,679
achieve a more durable result

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,519
working together the open source ethos

00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:49,360
that's what it's all about

00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,159
it's important to everyone in these

00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,519
communities who can reach out and see

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,919
what's happening in the world around

00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,080
them

00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,519
and be a part of it there are solutions

00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,960
in progress out there that are solving

00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,840
the problems that are causing your

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,200
struggles

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,880
no need to struggle when there are

00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,320
others you can collaborate with and come

00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,320
up with a solution that can help

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,399
everyone it's almost like one of these

00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,720
cheesy team building exercises you can't

00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,280
see

00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:13,599
with succeed without everybody working

00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,359
together

00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,679
so another thing that's interesting to

00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,919
talk about and this is a quote from

00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:22,000
ash dryden she wrote a really

00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:23,599
interesting blog post on the ethics of

00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,480
unpaid labor and the open source

00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,679
community

00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,599
and to summarize i want to see all

00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,159
people fairly compensated for their

00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,800
labor

00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,800
without feeling forced into it i do not

00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,359
want to see free and open source

00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,200
software stopped we can talk about the

00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:41,359
technical details all day but the core

00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:43,200
of open source work is our contributions

00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:44,879
and collaboration on the project

00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,040
the pattern seems to be that a project

00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:50,159
starts out small and open source

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,800
maybe grassroots a bit nerdy a community

00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,560
forms around it and develops a project

00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,720
users contribute enhancing and

00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:58,320
strengthening the project for everyone

00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,160
eventually as we've seen with drupal

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,440
things get a bit corporate a bit more

00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,440
commercial and motivation

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,640
shift this is where things can go really

00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,119
wrong

00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:09,280
who is benefiting who is doing the work

00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,200
without a fair and equitable ecosystem

00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,839
our communities can be taken advantage

00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,000
of

00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,680
plus not everyone can contribute equally

00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,280
due to various barriers and that means

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,160
that some voices aren't heard in the

00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,680
project

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:22,079
honestly that's more important at the

00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,240
end of the day at the end

00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,040
of the day than the latest web of

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,520
complexity we've spun for ourselves

00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:31,280
so take a look at that blog post um i'll

00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,599
have links in references at the end of

00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:37,520
the slide deck

00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:39,280
so removing barriers um

00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,359
how do we flourish i mean plain and

00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,960
simple we have to remove barriers

00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,720
every time you have to struggle to do

00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,960
something that's outside of your

00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,960
technical ability it detracts you from

00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,480
focusing on what you're really good at

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,560
there's a time and a place to learn but

00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,079
when you need to deliver you want to be

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,800
able to live in the space where you're

00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,200
competent

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,720
not in a whole new space the more we can

00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,640
help remove barriers the more we can

00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,760
help solve the really complex problems

00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,680
so people don't

00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,839
have to think about them unless they

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,720
want to so they can focus on where they

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:08,880
excel

00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,640
the better off we will be the more you

00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,880
can find companies that adhere to that

00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:14,320
ideology the better off you'll be

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,000
by surrounding yourself with those

00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,720
people you know again

00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,560
this is why we make tools like ddev

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,560
especially now with covid you see people

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,200
reaching out to open source projects

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,880
like mine asking how to support the

00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,400
project financially

00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,160
people ask about a business model

00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,040
because they want to make sure this open

00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,920
source tool

00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,839
will continue to be around in the future

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,960
to deny the fact that people need to be

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,640
able to make a living

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,240
in addition to the benefits of open

00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,040
source is pretty privileged

00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:45,280
perspective i very much respect folks

00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,359
who won't use anything but open source

00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,560
but many of us can't live on that in the

00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,560
world as it is today

00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:57,619
and

00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:57,619
[Music]

00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,480
no longer able to navigate between

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,280
slides

00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,880
so there we go sorry about that so the

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,480
next section is basically how to cope

00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,560
with all these changes i'm going to pick

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,720
it up a little bit because i'm a little

00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,160
short on time so this is a lot with

00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,760
drupal edging more and more into

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,200
decoupled territory

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,520
it's going to take a lot to kind of

00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,359
really focus on these things

00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,880
right now the complexity of today

00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,880
today's environment technically and

00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:26,800
socially can be a lot to manage

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,079
drupal has always been complex in and of

00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:30,560
itself and not only is this

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,440
getting more so but we're adding so much

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,920
more to it

00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,000
in unique stacks and workflows that

00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,880
shift to some more static sites is

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,040
completely

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,000
understandable maybe we've finally

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,079
outgrown the

00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,599
drupal hammer syndrome and are more

00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,079
correctly pairing the hammer with the

00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:46,000
job

00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,920
we're selecting a different angle kind

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,400
of a different hammer

00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,760
kind of like how that pendulum works

00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,320
well as a former and

00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,079
now distant past builder of websites

00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,359
i've spent plenty of time thinking about

00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:59,520
this and talking about it with

00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:00,560
many people who know a whole lot more

00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,599
than i do

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:05,440
and it's been amazing

00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,599
that's part of the beauty of open source

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,280
right you get to admit that you're not

00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,440
the smartest person in the room

00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,720
you get to learn from the collective you

00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,200
get to get better

00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,480
as a result of working with the people

00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:20,800
around you

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,800
that is what drupal should do

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:29,680
revisiting problem solving you know

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:32,720
it's you get the most amazing minds

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,800
stating the simplest things here's steve

00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,040
jobs if you define the problem correctly

00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:39,520
then you almost have the solution

00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,599
here's einstein if i had only one hour

00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,200
to save the world i would spend 55

00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,880
minutes defining the problem

00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:47,359
and only five minutes finding the

00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,599
solution if you look at this as a

00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:52,000
you know i would have looked at this as

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:54,560
a an active drupal engineer

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,320
i would have not appreciated the

00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,320
sentiment here i would have thought that

00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,560
both of these people were crazy

00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,680
and that i could engineer a solution

00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,599
that would be perfect

00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:08,800
in a matter of you know give me a night

00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,680
and i'll i'll prove them both wrong that

00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:15,839
was me

00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:18,640
before i had a bit more knowledge

00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:20,400
what works for one digital experience

00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,040
may not work for another

00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,440
it will be hard going forward for

00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,760
vendors to enable the novel workflows

00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,320
approaches and architectures required

00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,560
but what will result is a new brand

00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,640
compromise for a future ready cms this

00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:36,960
is another quote from preston

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,560
he wrapped it up really well and i think

00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,320
the real question is are we up to the

00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,880
task

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,320
so just a quick recap uh we spent a

00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,680
little bit of time talking about how

00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:47,520
drupal has changed

00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,880
uh we went over a little bit about what

00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,760
those changes might mean for the future

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,000
of the project

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,040
as it relates to the greater open source

00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,520
ecosystem

00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:58,000
and gave maybe a few suggestions on how

00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,400
to cope with all this change

00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,920
um i'm not sure the order to take

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,920
questions now so i'm just going to go

00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,240
ahead and put up

00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,680
kevin very much we only have a few

00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:11,200
minutes left

00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,800
um i do have a couple of questions and

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,319
maybe you want to tell people how to

00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,400
reach out to you i don't know

00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:18,240
uh participants are not aware that you

00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:21,359
do not have access to the general

00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:24,960
chat okay so let me continue the

00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:28,560
conversation with you elsewhere

00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:30,240
uh that works uh so my twitter username

00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,960
is cyberswat

00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,000
uh definitely reach out to me willing to

00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,640
talk to anybody

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,440
uh you can bring me in drupal.org slack

00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,920
i am cyber swat there as well

00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,839
great and then we have timing for one of

00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,359
the questions from ruth

00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:48,400
um it has been noted in various places

00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:51,440
that europe does

00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,760
more work on drupal while usa generates

00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,240
more

00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,000
income is this related to the problems

00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,359
you've been talking about

00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:00,319
very much so um i i think that there's a

00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:03,839
paradigm where

00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:06,319
there's a very core group

00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:08,400
that is making money from drupal and

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:11,440
will continue to make money from drupal

00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,319
i think that it's possible that they're

00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:15,760
doing it at

00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,440
you know on the shoulders of the people

00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,240
that are doing the work that may not be

00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,560
benefiting

00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,800
in a fair way that's what i was

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,720
referring to with ash gryden's post

00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,079
talking about fair and equitable

00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,680
treatment for people that are

00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,680
contributing to open source projects

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:32,720
okay great and then there's another

00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,240
question

00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,760
um from ruth as well um drupal has in my

00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:40,640
opinion two big problems

00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:42,160
one maintaining country many projects

00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:44,000
are not being maintained well

00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,160
and it's hard to see in a commercial

00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,560
world how that can be fixed

00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,880
and two drupal has an issue with people

00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:52,960
not wanting to pay for ongoing security

00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,760
maintenance for small sites do you have

00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,800
any thoughts

00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,560
of how these can be addressed so a

00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,000
couple of things number one the

00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,880
module system for drupal is very um

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,200
amorphous anybody can create a module

00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,400
that module does not have to have a good

00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,800
business case that it's solving right so

00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,400
so i think that one thing that we might

00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,119
want to look at is like in that views

00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,599
example

00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,400
really identifying what the problem

00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:20,880
we're solving

00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,319
is and then what collection of

00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,640
technology will

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:26,400
do that maybe separate it from the

00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,960
drupal space a little bit so that it can

00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,359
be

00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:30,640
shared in a broader context and made a

00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:33,760
little bit more generic

00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,680
and then used inside of the drupal space

00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,119
i think that's one way to help address

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:39,599
the module space

00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:41,520
because if the modules are properly

00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,240
defining the business cases that they're

00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,240
solving

00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,680
you might find that you don't need as

00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,599
many modules right

00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,119
that you're getting closer to that root

00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,400
problem and you can solve it more

00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:53,680
directly

00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:55,760
so there may be a case where extra

00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:56,640
modules are actually adding confusion to

00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,880
the problem

00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:01,839
when it comes to the security questions

00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:05,040
don't use php on the front end

00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:06,480
export everything to static html use

00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,560
existing libraries

00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,960
split things up into services so that

00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:14,240
you can protect the endpoints

00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:16,640
in different ways that is the number one

00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,520
way to reduce the security issues with

00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:21,040
group

00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,319
period if you do a search on google or

00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,359
duckduckgo

00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:27,680
for drupal and you click that news tab

00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:28,560
the first page is nothing but security

00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:31,839
alerts

00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,839
it's not new innovation

00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:41,119
um thank you very much kevin for this

00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:45,599
reality check we only have a few seconds

00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:47,599
left um and we'll make sure to

00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,800
um share those slides maybe in the

00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:53,920
handout here on

00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,440
on the platform um thank you very much

00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:57,280
great thank you all very much for

00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,040
attending and again reach out to me if

00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,800
you have any questions i would love to

00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,800
engage in this conversation a bit more

00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,880
great thank you thank you all for

00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:09,839
attending

00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,839
