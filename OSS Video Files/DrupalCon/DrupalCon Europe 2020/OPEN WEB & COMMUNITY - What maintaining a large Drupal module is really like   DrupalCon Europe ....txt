Title: OPEN WEB & COMMUNITY - What maintaining a large Drupal module is really like   DrupalCon Europe ...
Publication date: 2021-01-13
Playlist: DrupalCon Europe 2020
Description: 
	Without contribution, there would be no Drupal. Our beloved (or hated) framework does not rely on core maintainers alone, but countless of contributors worldwide who help build the ecosystem around it. One of these key contributions is the vast amount of modules that can be found on drupal.org.

00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,400
but welcome to this session

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,800
about what it's like to maintain a large

00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,199
drupal module

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,840
as usually with my sessions i start with

00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:26,880
a slide about who i am what i do

00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,080
so let's get that out of the way um i'm

00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,720
cristian van ne

00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,920
i work at factorial in hamburg but not

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,000
really because i

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,960
work fully remotely almost all year

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,840
rounds and i

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,440
i do that from antwerp belgium i'm the

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,879
maintainer of the group module

00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:46,079
which is the module that inspired me to

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,680
to have this talk i'm married i'm very

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,440
proud to be a dad and i'm ruled by

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,960
cats and because i'm presenting from my

00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,039
home

00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,960
there is a very large chance that my cat

00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,879
will somehow disrupt this talk

00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,320
so you'll see why i mentioned that i'm

00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,120
ruled by a cat

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,680
i'm also a highly sensitive person um

00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,520
it's

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,040
a sort of it's not really an affliction

00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,560
or disease it's just something wrong

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,760
with your brain

00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,600
where everything is very overwhelming it

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,720
sometimes leads to panic attacks

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,840
mental health issues and and everything

00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,720
nowadays i'm doing fine but um

00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,479
i just wanted to pause at this i usually

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,840
don't anymore

00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,320
because with kovit there is a lot of

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,400
people

00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,920
alone at home right now and and you know

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,439
it's not a great time to have mental

00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,840
health issues

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,640
so even if something goes wrong this

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,560
talk

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,960
i just wanted to pause here so that you

00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:43,439
know if i can do this then you know

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,320
you will be able to one day maybe not

00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,640
today

00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:51,840
you will be able to things do get better

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,680
keep that in mind in these dark days

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,960
um and then my drip on the door handle

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,320
is just my full name

00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,159
and on twitter i'm magentix so

00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,079
before we begin this session there are a

00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,040
few things i need to get out of the way

00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,520
so there's a little disclaimer here um

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,040
so

00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,840
i don't know if you know neil degrasse

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,959
tyson he's this um

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,120
very famous scientist and i i

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,040
i've read some of his books and is

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,800
really interesting person in my opinion

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,800
and he has this statement about there

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,959
being three types of truths

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,239
there's the objective the personal and

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,400
the political truth

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,599
um because this is a drupal concession

00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,040
i'm just gonna ignore the fact that

00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,640
there's a political truth

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,080
and i'm just gonna focus on objective

00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,680
and personal

00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,480
objective means that it's just a fact

00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:40,000
like you can try and argue that gravity

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,200
doesn't exist but if you jump off the

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,959
top of a building

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,720
you're gonna quickly find out that it

00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,400
does exist in fact

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,879
and then you have personal truths this

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,519
is the experience you've had throughout

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,440
your life

00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,040
leads you to believe certain things even

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,920
though there might not be scientific

00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,480
backing

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,080
to make those effects for instance some

00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,319
people believe

00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,239
that as long as you do good people will

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,760
do good to you

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,599
that's a personal truth there's no

00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,120
scientific evidence for it it's a nice

00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,040
thing to believe but

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,800
there's no evidence the reason i'm

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,800
saying this is because

00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,159
my previous sessions were all based on

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,720
facts they were about

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,720
codes so the code doesn't lie it's

00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,800
always going to do the same thing

00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,560
so when i say something about that codes

00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,239
or i give some examples or

00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,920
tips those are facts but this session

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,319
is based on experiences and this is

00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,080
totally new territory for me as well

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,760
i don't think i've ever given a session

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,840
before that was purely about my

00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,040
experiences as a maintainer or anything

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,480
else

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,879
so while this is new to me um i hope

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,640
you'll

00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,560
you'll you'll stand by me as i try to

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,959
explain things well but keep in mind

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,000
that this

00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,599
is personal so whatever i say today

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,840
may not be the same for another

00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,360
maintainer of a large module

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,040
just keep that in mind this is my

00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,000
personal take on what it's like to be a

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,280
maintainer of a large triple module

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,120
but the goal is still to paint an

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,040
accurate representation

00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,040
i'm not going to go too deep into the

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,879
details of my personal life i still want

00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,959
to

00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,959
make it so that everyone well in the

00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,799
room is a weird statement right now but

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,120
everyone watching

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,919
knows what it can be like to be a

00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,120
maintainer of

00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,960
a large module secondly

00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,479
we also need to get the definition of a

00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:26,400
large module out of the way because it's

00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:27,600
pretty ambiguous so this is what i mean

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,080
by it

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,199
i mean it's it's got a large code base

00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,520
and impact

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,840
and the end is important because you

00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,639
could have a very large code base

00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,240
which just sends out a tweet once a day

00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,840
that's not really impactful

00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,680
and you could have a small code base

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,400
with a very large impact which is really

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,240
cool

00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,840
but that doesn't fit my definition of a

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,400
large module

00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,440
because smaller code bases are usually

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,800
rather easy to maintain

00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,280
so i'm talking about code that has

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,400
the ability to do a lot rather than does

00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,680
a lot so

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,960
more often their apis or their packages

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,000
which fits the main needs of a certain

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,919
niche

00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,600
but then based on the actual

00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,160
implementation there might be other

00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:17,680
needs and those are usually filled by

00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,520
um smaller um extending modules

00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,080
developed by either the same team or

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,199
person or even other people

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,800
um so it's really like just like core

00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,800
is the heart of your website sometimes

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,720
these modules are the heart of

00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,280
functionality of your website think

00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,080
commerce commerce is just a small module

00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,160
per se

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,280
in say but there's a lot of extensions

00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,800
to it so it's not really based on the

00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,120
number of installs although it's often

00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,880
related if you have these large modules

00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,039
they often do have a large amount of

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,039
installs but that doesn't need to be the

00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,280
case

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,039
suppose you write really important

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,240
functionality just for the banking

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,600
sector

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,039
yeah that's not going to have as many

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,880
installs as something that you could use

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,160
on any websites but it's still a very

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,680
large module because it's really

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,759
impactful and will probably have a lot

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,440
of code in it

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,759
so what you should think about is you

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:11,199
know battery versus nuclear power plants

00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:13,280
both very useful both large scale

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,600
but one has a little bit more

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,840
maintenance than the other

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,680
also this is my take on what it's like

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,960
when a battery first meets power plants

00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,639
i don't know i just felt like

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:26,400
adding a drawing so there's that

00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:28,400
one sec gonna have a little drink and

00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,199
then we can uh talk about what it's like

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,199
to get started

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,840
okay so how do you get started as a

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,800
maintainer of a large module

00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,000
rule number one don't be an idiot i'm

00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,400
not talking about you

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,120
i'm talking about this guy when i got

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,280
started

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,120
i did everything wrong in hindsight my

00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,759
hindsight is always 20 20 but my

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,280
foresight

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,199
not so much so i did everything wrong so

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,400
here's what i learned and what i would

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,479
like you to consider

00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:01,280
first before you want to start writing a

00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,280
large module

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,360
collaborate on something that exists i

00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,120
cannot stress this

00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,800
enough this is something that i failed

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,479
to do i tried

00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,520
i tried with what you may know as

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:16,240
organic groups um

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,759
i was young i was naive i've told this

00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,960
story before

00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,840
on podcast and and everything but um

00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,120
essentially i thought that i could do

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,759
better

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,039
and instead of having the patience

00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,560
patience of trying to convince the

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,280
maintainers to

00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,199
you know have a have a listen to my

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,759
vision and perhaps collaborate and

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,240
have it go in a separate direction or i

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,800
don't know

00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,240
i i just did it on my own it's not a

00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:44,639
great idea

00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,240
if you can and this holds true for all

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,199
open source

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,039
look at what's there first if it's not

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,599
there well obviously you can fill that

00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,759
gap and

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,440
create it if it is already there try to

00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,360
collaborate it won't always work

00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,560
maintainers can just you know

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:02,400
show you away or they they

00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,599
can you know have very different visions

00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,479
about what

00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,759
you are trying to do to fill that gap so

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,280
there might still be a need for

00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,280
something else but please try to

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,840
collaborate first you'll save yourself a

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,840
lot of effort

00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,560
if you can't ask yourself what do i want

00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,080
to build

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,479
try to describe the product in its

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,240
finished state

00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,400
this is also important because sometimes

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,080
you get really enthusiastic like

00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,919
all of the people saying oh i have a

00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,520
billion dollar id i want to build a game

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,560
and it's going to be about racing in

00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,240
space

00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,640
and then when you try to fill in the

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,159
details everything falls flat because

00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,599
you don't have a picture of the full

00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,760
product

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,320
so try to have that this is really

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:47,360
difficult but try to have that

00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,880
also um ask yourself what features do i

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,480
want to support and this is something

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:54,800
that i also fail to do

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,320
miserably it's um when you do have that

00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,040
idea of what you want to build

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,320
and you start getting feedback it's good

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,760
to know beforehand

00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,279
what you consider your core

00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,839
functionality and what you consider

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,720
should come from outside extensions

00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,480
because when i was building a group for

00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,680
drupal 7

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,240
people started getting really

00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,160
enthusiastic and they started saying hey

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,920
what about subgroups what about

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,399
this what about that what about you know

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,080
having an integration with domain access

00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:26,640
and my answer to everything was yes

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,440
which is not great in hindsight because

00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,480
drupal 7's group module turned out to be

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,519
one huge unmaintainable

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,800
bloat of a module it was filled with

00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:39,120
code that

00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,320
would restrict me from writing more code

00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,920
in the future because

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,839
i would break something that was already

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,600
there it's just it was a huge nightmare

00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:46,160
instead of building an api i just built

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,959
a

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,880
sort of swiss army knife that did

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,760
everything out of the box

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,760
really bad id

00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,839
also ask yourself do i want to spend the

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,959
next years of my life on this

00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,320
and you should really ask yourself this

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,160
question it's not necessarily like

00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,839
you're gonna be stuck

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,839
it's a little dry in here one sec

00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:18,320
but you should consult the people in

00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:21,440
your life and by that i mean

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:24,880
for instance if you're like me

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,160
and you have this high sensitivity i

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,640
you know there's a good chance that i

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,680
should never become a politician

00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,480
because it would destroy me like utterly

00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,959
destroy me

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,079
and my wife knows me so she would tell

00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,399
me

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,279
hey um i i know you're trying to do this

00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,120
but

00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,519
have you considered the impact of this

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,440
on your mental health you know

00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,680
same goes for your employer your spouse

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,160
or partner or your kids

00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,600
whatever makes part of your personal

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,680
life

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,200
try to balance that try to figure out

00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,200
like is this something i can

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:05,839
i can do for the next couple of years

00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:08,959
sorry really dry throat at the moment

00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,040
um so start sensibly

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,800
so don't get distracted and stick to

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,399
your battle plan

00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,920
what i mean by that is if you've done

00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,839
all your homework and you have this

00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,600
vision of what you want to build what

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,360
is the main feature of the thing you

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,839
want to build

00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,200
stick to it just like i explained when i

00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,480
uh when i

00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,480
built group for drupal 7 just listen to

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,200
everyone's ideas and say yeah that's no

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,519
just stick to what you wanted to build

00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,800
and

00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:43,279
maybe occasionally deviate from that but

00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:46,959
don't do it too often

00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:49,120
find like-minded people this again is

00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:52,240
really important

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:55,920
i've been going edits alone

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,639
for seven years and sometimes it's a

00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,519
nightmare

00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,639
when i go on vacation everything stops

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,519
when i fall sick

00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,519
everything stops

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,519
so it's um it's really annoying um to be

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,560
alone and

00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,279
you want to form a team from the get-go

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,040
so that onboarding someone after effect

00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,040
is not something you have to worry about

00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,639
because now that i have this very large

00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,160
code base it's really hard to find new

00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,480
maintainers

00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,040
that want to help me out so i have found

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,839
some people who want to help me out

00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,560
more on that later but it's really hard

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,720
once you've

00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,040
already started so do that from the

00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,040
start

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,079
sorry i've really got i'm gonna just

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,720
pause for

00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,720
30 seconds and i'll say

00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,279
perhaps open a window for some fresh air

00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,399
no that's going to lead to noise sorry

00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,519
all right so let's try again

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,959
so you want to adhere to certain

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:13,600
standards um what i mean by that is

00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,560
you want to have these standards that

00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,240
are

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,600
that you can find throughout the whole

00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,440
industry um

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,800
and and just discuss them beforehand

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,519
with the team

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,160
because it will lead to being able to

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:29,600
work on each other's codes more easily

00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:32,800
and it will mean that um if everyone

00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,120
does their own thing then you're gonna

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,760
get

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,000
these sorts of silos that the the rest

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,160
of the team just can't touch

00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,360
try to avoid that try to adopt a few

00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:44,480
standards

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,399
and go with it um i miserably failed at

00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,040
this as well because i started the group

00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,880
module without any tests

00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,320
so that was a huge pain in the ass when

00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,839
i wanted to add new features and got a

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,639
ton of bug reports

00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,240
so now i do have tests but i've i've had

00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,720
to come from a place where i didn't have

00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,160
them which was really annoying

00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,079
um so again the more you plan beforehand

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,399
the less pain afterwards just get

00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,360
everything stored at from the get go and

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:13,760
you should be good to go there is no

00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,720
recipe for success only failure

00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,160
by that i mean you can do everything

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,720
right

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,399
and still fail there's no guarantee that

00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,079
you will succeed

00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,639
but what we tend to do really well as

00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:30,240
human beings is avoid what we

00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:33,120
the what we did wrong in the past so the

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,760
recipe for failure is there just

00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,399
make the same mistakes again you will

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,240
fail

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,000
but learn from these mistakes and you'll

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:43,199
be one step closer to success

00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:47,440
but there is no recipe for success

00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:49,279
so to close off this slide

00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,880
i have the lyrics of one of my favorite

00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,320
um songs by um

00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:56,839
mike shinoda who also performs under the

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,000
gnomer ford miner he's part of linkin

00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,160
park

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,360
and it's it's about you know the effort

00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:04,320
he had to go through

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,760
to become the artist he is and this is

00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:09,120
like the equation that he says

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,839
uh it takes to be that person so you've

00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,560
got 10

00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,199
luck 20 skill i'm not gonna read the

00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,279
rest of it because of my voice

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:19,040
but what i like about the lyrics of that

00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,399
song is that he's got the ingredients

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,839
right

00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,760
there is some luck involved and

00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,199
sometimes it won't be fun but there is

00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,360
also a lot of pain involved and

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:30,639
in the end based on your skill and your

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,880
ability to

00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:37,040
push through you will succeed in the end

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,399
but it's going to take a lot and you

00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:43,839
know you need to be aware of that

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:46,079
so um once you've gotten there

00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,040
you started building this module it's

00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,120
being picked up

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,880
you're a maintainer of a large module

00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,440
now what is that like

00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,920
like um how does your everyday life look

00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,839
like

00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:01,440
when you um have built this large module

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:03,680
so here's uh first of all here's some

00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,360
general advice this applies to everyone

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,360
like if you're a maintainer of a small

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,079
module or a large module doesn't matter

00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,360
this

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:12,800
applies to everyone so

00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,120
you need to figure out your response

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:17,600
time do you want to

00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,279
respond to bug report support requests

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,040
all the time

00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:24,560
or just during what is called office

00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:28,079
hours or something in between

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,600
if you have a clear a clear

00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,120
communication about this that's going to

00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,800
help you and the people using your

00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,199
software

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,839
so what some people do is they form a

00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:40,720
team and they communicate that every

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,800
tuesday or thursday or whatever between

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,040
this hour and this hour

00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,279
they are available to ask questions live

00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,920
on slack

00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:52,160
some people like i used to would just

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,160
have

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,240
everything go to your inbox and it would

00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,639
um

00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:01,360
it would just you know spam you all

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,040
night long that's not really great but

00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,120
figure out what how many uh how much

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:07,280
time you want to spend in responding to

00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,120
uh requests

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,319
so email filters are your friends so

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,760
drupal.org

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,360
has this functionality where it sends

00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,880
you an email for every new issue or

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,439
reply

00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:20,400
and that's at the start i said yeah sure

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:21,919
send me all the emails

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,679
and that quickly led to a couple

00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,079
thousand emails in my inbox

00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,679
and my wife or girlfriend at a time

00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,039
being very pissed because every night i

00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,240
would just

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,840
continuously be on my phone so

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,760
i've put it into place some email

00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,679
filters and now almost nothing gets true

00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,200
except for direct messages and some

00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,960
critical stuff

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,799
everything else goes into a folder and

00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,280
on a very rainy day

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,080
it actually almost never happens i go

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,520
through that folder

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,360
but yeah no not really choose your

00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,120
channels

00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,880
so um drupal the door and slag are

00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,520
really good for this so people can

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,240
contact you

00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,679
through dupout.org with the issue queue

00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,960
they can contact you on drupal slide

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,160
that's really good

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,679
um email and twitter depends i don't

00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,320
like having a conversation on twitter

00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,960
it's

00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,919
not the right format for me and emails

00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,080
well i'm

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,679
notoriously bad at paperwork so if you

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,200
send me an email

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,120
chances are you'll get a reply about

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,919
half a year later

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,840
it's just not my thing i i do use email

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:25,360
obviously but

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,360
it's not the right channel to reach me

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,440
maybe for for some some edge cases but

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,919
in general not really and then facebook

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:33,600
bad

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:36,559
um i've had occasions where

00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,120
people um created an issue on drupal.org

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,919
and

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,280
about 45 minutes later they found me on

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,880
facebook added me as a friend and

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,480
started sending

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,400
questions regarding their issue like

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,440
literally 45 minutes later

00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:52,160
because it was urgent um don't do that

00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,919
facebook is really bad at that

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,520
nowadays it's bad in general the only

00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,679
thing i think it's still good for is

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,919
undermining democracy

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,880
so don't contact people facebook um

00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,280
block that

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,799
you'll do yourself a favor whether you

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,000
want to block emails and twitters that's

00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,160
up to you

00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
um but drupal.org is like our generally

00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:15,039
great channels to um

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,039
to be contacted through um one sec

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,760
by the way this is pissing me off to

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,360
know and the fact that my voice

00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,720
gave out at the start of my session

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,720
that's you know really annoying

00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,640
so it's not bad practice to prioritize

00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,880
paid work

00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,080
what i mean by that is obviously you

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,520
still want to have the core of your

00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,080
module

00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:40,640
but if 10 people request a new feature

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:43,120
and no one wants to sponsor that

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,000
and two people request a feature that's

00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,760
also useful

00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,400
and they do want to sponsor that it's

00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,640
not a shame to go for that one

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,240
it's not a democracy it's not like the

00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,400
more people shout for something

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,320
that they'll get it um it's still up to

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,000
you to manage this

00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,919
and at the end of the day you need to

00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,440
pay your bills

00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:05,679
so if you are looking for some funding

00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,840
people want to hand that to you and it

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,400
still benefits your module

00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:11,520
definitely go for it and curb your

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,679
enthusiasm

00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,200
as you've probably already extracted

00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,520
from everything i've said until this

00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,520
point

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,840
don't go overboard turn off those

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,280
notifications at night

00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:27,840
um don't spend your nights um lying

00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:31,039
awake thinking about new features

00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:34,799
i still find myself doing that sometimes

00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,280
and it just it doesn't help if you lie

00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,120
awake

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,880
all night thinking about codes and the

00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,559
next day you're exhausted you're not

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,480
going to have a fresh mind to actually

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,919
bring that code into practice to to

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,919
write it down

00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,240
it doesn't work that way so try to curb

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:51,679
your enthusiasm

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,080
so drupal.org is also your friends so it

00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:56,480
has the issue queue obviously

00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,919
but using issues you can filter by you

00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,240
know

00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,159
by critical for instance keep in mind a

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,400
lot of people abuse the status and put

00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,840
it to critical meaning it's urgent to me

00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,679
it's not really what it's for so just

00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,720
bump that back down to normal or if you

00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,320
want to tease them

00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:14,320
minor um and the issue stars

00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,000
like the old one comments is something

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,799
you can filter by in the advanced view

00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,840
so if you have some time to add new

00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,200
features

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,960
just sorts by feature requests uh filter

00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,799
by feature request and sort by stars and

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,159
then you can see oh hey there's like 500

00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:31,679
people who want this feature

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,840
let's have a look um so that helps

00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,280
and there's nowadays there's gitlab

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,360
integration

00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,960
there already was for a while which was

00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,400
cool to look at um

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,280
the code base because we used to have

00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:45,039
this old cgits.drupal.org and

00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,559
that was a mess to navigate but um

00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,280
gitlab is actually pretty nice to

00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,559
navigate

00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:53,679
um and nowadays we have this new

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,480
issue fork thingy where um you can sort

00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,240
of have this

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,760
pull request flow but using drupal.org

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,480
it's really nice uh good job to the

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,120
people who

00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,480
implemented that by the way and we have

00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,080
the code of conduct and the issue

00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,799
priority field so i already touched

00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:12,559
briefly on the issue priority fields

00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:14,640
if people um use the wrong priority

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:18,000
just link to that one my slides will be

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,400
up later as a pdf

00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
so you don't need to worry about what

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,679
this link is you'll be able to click it

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,760
once you download my slides

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,919
just link people to that page tell them

00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,360
hey you've bumped this to critical

00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,120
i don't think it is please read through

00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,919
this page why it's not

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,440
um we also have a code of conduct um

00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,039
there's no nice way to put this but

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,840
people can be real

00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,400
and when they are um you should just you

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,919
know

00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,520
act according to the code of conduct

00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:46,559
perhaps report them or

00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:49,760
um try to kindly tell them

00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:53,280
that they're being unfair or

00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:56,799
 um i'm really bad at this

00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:59,919
on on bad days where my um my

00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:03,200
mental health issues act up i get baited

00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:04,000
really easily um so sometimes you'll

00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,320
find comments

00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,240
of me on drupal.org i'm not swearing or

00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,679
anything but i i will be very short and

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,000
direct telling them hey you're acting

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,600
like an

00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,679
this is personal everyone has their own

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,559
way of dealing with it this is mine it's

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,559
not the best

00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:22,240
i admit so yeah hopefully

00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,000
or let me put it differently if you ever

00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,919
do this in my issue queue and you see me

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,240
kindly link to this i'm having a good

00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,080
day

00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,600
otherwise you'll you'll notice something

00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,120
else um

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,760
so what are the struggles of being a

00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,760
maintainer

00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,799
so obviously um it's not all rainbows

00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,360
and sunshine in

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:43,039
in maintainer lands so there are some

00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,000
struggles and i just briefly touched on

00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:48,000
the first one

00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,320
people are needy people have this

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,279
notion that because they're using your

00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,240
code for free

00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:55,840
you owe them supports you owe them your

00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,360
life you owe them your every waking

00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,520
moment if there's a bug

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,840
you are a horrible person for having

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,400
introduced this bug into your code

00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,760
there are people like that here's an

00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,559
example

00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,960
before i read it please do not google

00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,440
this

00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,760
and try to find and harass that person

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,200
they may have been having a bad day it's

00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,520
not cool to

00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,000
dox people or whatever so i stripped out

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,440
personal information please respect that

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,200
and keep it that way the only thing i

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,080
can say is this wasn't a new person this

00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,840
person

00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,919
has been on drupal.org for more than 10

00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,960
years and then you get these comments

00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,200
saying you know

00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,039
if no one cares to resolve it i will put

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,960
it to critical again

00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:38,480
nobody seems to care about it blah blah

00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,760
blah come on drupal community

00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,760
yeah this motivates me a lot to start

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,240
working on whatever is your issue

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,880
well no not really so please don't do

00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,559
this but

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:52,000
you're going to meet people like this um

00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,000
it's also difficult to maintain a

00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,840
healthy work life balance i've touched

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,480
on this a couple times

00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,080
but even though with all the advice that

00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,279
i have been giving so far

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:05,360
and with with everything that you can

00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:08,080
probably figure out for yourselves

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:08,480
there are going to be times crunch time

00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,400
or

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,000
uh whatever where it's still hard to

00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,320
maintain that work life balance

00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,200
a good example is when i released the

00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:20,159
first full version of group for drupal 8

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,480
i was stupid or daring depending on how

00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,880
you

00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,039
view it enough to completely remove the

00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,720
node grant system

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,080
i replace it with a generic entity

00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,000
access system which is coming from

00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,279
entity api all really cool

00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,640
worked except

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:39,760
there was this slight security issue

00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,240
and because i was in you know i was over

00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,919
the moon

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,640
after all these years i had my first

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:48,159
release so i panicked

00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:50,799
and i haphazardly wrote a 1.1 which

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:52,640
worked but broke something else

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,240
yeah i have tests but somehow it still

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,840
snuck by them

00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,520
and it broke something else and that was

00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,760
also the security issues then i had to

00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,240
release 1.2 and

00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,480
those week and a half two weeks of my

00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:07,919
life had been hell

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,760
because i kept worrying about the fact

00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,000
that you know what will people think

00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,840
that

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,840
after all these years i've created this

00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,760
module's full version it's now supposed

00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,039
to have security support

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,880
and right off the bat i have two

00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,039
security releases

00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,039
it just completely ruined my sleep um

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,039
put me in a really bad mood my wife

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,799
really didn't like having me around

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:29,600
those two weeks

00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:30,320
um so yeah it's it's going to be hard

00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,159
sometimes

00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,919
you can do all you want but sometimes

00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:35,520
it's it's definitely going to be hard to

00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,720
have that balance

00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,480
um so be aware of that even you know

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,000
the best laid plans can often go to

00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,840
waste so

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,080
there's there's no predicting what it

00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,400
will be like

00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:52,159
so and as part of this um it's sometimes

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,159
hard to find peace of mind when things

00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,760
aren't going your way but you really

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,799
should

00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,240
so um this is the most stupid advice

00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,320
that someone

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,360
might receive depending on your state of

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:05,520
mind but

00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,120
people who are depressed often hear like

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,080
oh don't worry about it

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,840
yeah that's that's not helpful but once

00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,840
you manage to not worry about it that's

00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,559
actually how you get out of depression

00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,000
um so it's weird to give that advice at

00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,960
that point because you're really not

00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,880
helping

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:23,120
but it is actually the right advice it's

00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,960
just it doesn't resonate at that point

00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,039
in time and and that's the thing

00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,039
finding peace of mind when things aren't

00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,159
going great is really important and

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,200
there is no

00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:36,480
golden way um i don't

00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,159
like many sports so going out running

00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,320
didn't really get it for me

00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,600
i recently found a sport that i do enjoy

00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,640
so when things aren't going

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,279
my way i do that but play video games

00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,000
read a book

00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,440
whatever you really enjoy try focusing

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,960
on that more when things aren't going

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,320
your way just try to

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:57,760
have some distraction because just

00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,760
um just dwelling on it that's

00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,799
not going to go well for your mental

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,559
health so

00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,720
really try to avoid that but you are

00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,640
going to face that don't miss don't be

00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,399
mistaken you are going to

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,399
be in that situation sometimes

00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:14,000
um and one of the struggles is also

00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:17,120
trying to find funding to keep

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,480
developing and improving

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:23,600
more on this later but

00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,720
it's it's um in

00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:29,520
open source it's just it's hard to get

00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,120
you know a model working where you you

00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,799
have funding to work on this but it's

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,440
also not for profits it's

00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,039
weird i'll talk about that later in more

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,480
detail but um

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:42,240
that's definitely something that's going

00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:45,440
to um occupy your mind sometimes

00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,279
also this asterisk um keep in mind that

00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,919
the needy people are usually the ones

00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,600
who are

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,600
facing issues and they're the ones

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,200
shouting the loudest but for every needy

00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,720
person there's definitely

00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,880
like two or three people using your

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,279
software just fine being happy about it

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,320
but

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:02,320
they're just not voicing that

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,919
so that was the bad part what's the good

00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
part the good part is i just need to

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,799
drink

00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,799
again but

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,200
okay so the good part is that people are

00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,399
also grateful

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,760
um here's an example words are in yellow

00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,679
because i had to search my inbox that's

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,360
how often it occurs but still people are

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,440
grateful

00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,799
um so people occasionally send you

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,720
emails saying thank you

00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,559
and i really appreciate that so when i

00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,000
say that your emails won't reach me well

00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,880
if you send me one of those emails i

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,960
will reply

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,480
it will be like two words saying awesome

00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,679
or something like that like awesome

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,720
thanks

00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:41,200
but i won't reply um but people are

00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,200
grateful it's just that for every um

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,159
annoying person you meet on drupal.org

00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:48,080
or facebook messenger or whatever

00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,760
for every 10 of those you'll probably

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,480
get one email from someone who is

00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,240
grateful

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,320
so it's rare but it does happen and

00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,279
those are very fun times like

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,880
you wake up out of the blue you you see

00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:00,720
like a notification on your phone

00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,480
because someone from the united states

00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,159
in a wholly different time zone sent you

00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,240
an email overnight saying hey man

00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:08,080
you rock that's a great way to wake up

00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,919
and and that does happen so that's

00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,480
that's really an awesome part of being a

00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,480
maintainer

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,640
you get to build really awesome software

00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,760
and this

00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:23,760
this right here is the point that

00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,880
is the thing i'm totally sold on this is

00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,760
what does it for me

00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,039
it might be something else for you but

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,880
at heart

00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:36,080
i'm a builder i love building huge

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:40,159
pieces of software that

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,919
fulfill very complex um use cases

00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,080
i love building them the right way it's

00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:47,520
just to me it's like

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:50,320
a huge puzzle and i love that it's

00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,880
it puts your um it puts your skills to

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,039
the test

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,720
that puts your skills yeah to the test

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,200
whatever um

00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,960
it like pushes you to the to the maximum

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,559
so you can figure out like how far can i

00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,799
go with my skill set

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,000
and and this is what is really rewarding

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:07,039
to me

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,919
thinking about something for weeks then

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,799
putting that into into code and seeing

00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,679
it work

00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,360
that's a really rewarding experience and

00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,159
you often don't get to do that for

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,720
clients

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,200
projects so that is something that you

00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,559
only get on these really large projects

00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,919
well usually um and you get to follow

00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,519
best practices so

00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:30,240
when i said at the start that i didn't

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:33,519
follow them in the beginning

00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:34,960
nowadays i'm completely convinced that

00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,799
you do need to follow them

00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,080
and it really frustrates me sometimes

00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,080
that when you're working on a client

00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,279
project you don't get to

00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:44,960
but now you do because you have all the

00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,559
time in the world so to speak and you

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,480
get to build awesome software following

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,159
the best practices also very rewarding

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,039
to know that everything in your code is

00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,960
tested

00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,240
and that it is following the solid

00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,360
principle or whatever

00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:59,760
floats your boats um

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:01,440
let me watch my time okay 10 minutes

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,679
it's also a nice change of pace from

00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:05,919
everyday client work as i mentioned

00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,080
um and it leads to career opportunities

00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,039
so because you're known on drupal.org

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,279
and because people

00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,159
can actually see your code you don't

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,799
need to

00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,880
keep a resume up to date because your

00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,240
code is your resume people will see what

00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,760
you're capable of and that's

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,799
that makes it really easy to find a new

00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,799
job if you ever need to

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,799
so last part maintainability i'm not

00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,559
going to have a lot of time for

00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,480
questions but this is the the most

00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:32,720
important part so

00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,559
well thing that i wanted to put up for

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,159
discussion so how i do things i'm going

00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,840
to rush through this a little bit to get

00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,559
to the end

00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,320
so i work one day a week on group thanks

00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,799
to factorio

00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,000
i also work on course sometimes but not

00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,880
that much anymore

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,720
i um so with one day a week there's only

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,440
so much i can do so i focus on critical

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,519
issues

00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,360
sorely needed features and security

00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,519
issues obviously

00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,919
i try to answer support requests but i

00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:02,320
don't usually get to those anymore

00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,760
i try to improve legacy code which i

00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,840
still do because that benefits the

00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,120
module as a whole i try to bring it into

00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,760
this new

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,159
way of doing my code instead of the

00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,320
online which wasn't great

00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:17,039
i very rarely get sponsored to add new

00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:18,880
features um right before the summer

00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,200
we got lucky enough to get sponsored by

00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,240
anna from japan

00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:25,919
to create the subgroup module and

00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,919
as part of that effort also finished

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,799
group to have the 1.0 release so that

00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,159
was awesome

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,159
but that doesn't happen too often

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,039
and i try to get stuff into core but to

00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,600
me it's really demoralizing again this

00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:41,360
is a personal opinion

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,279
group often bumps into the limits of

00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,000
core such as

00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:48,880
some caching issues and some entity

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,799
access issues i've tried to fix them

00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,919
some of them went into entity api some

00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,799
of them i had to release

00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,640
as my own features but whenever i tried

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,519
to get those into core

00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,720
i usually hit a wall at one point it's

00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,480
um it's starting to become very

00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,559
demoralizing so i try not to focus on

00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:07,279
that but this is something that

00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,560
if core maintainers are watching and you

00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:10,639
want to talk to me about

00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,560
um this is something that i notice is

00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,359
bothering more people

00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,599
and that's not great for drupal so how

00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:21,119
do others do things this is from

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,839
observing so others like open social for

00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,800
instance

00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:27,359
are yeah commerce like centauro they

00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:29,760
have a team working on the main product

00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,359
um but they like they have a full

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,720
business around it so they have sales

00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,560
people finding clients that need

00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,639
implementations where they can consult

00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,159
or build the whole thing

00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,240
they get sponsored for adding new

00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,159
features too

00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:43,679
they have office hours on slack usually

00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,480
i know commerce has them

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,000
i can imagine open social has them too

00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,240
they also try to get some intercourse

00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,040
but i can't speak for them so i i really

00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,720
don't know how they

00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,720
they do things but i still wanted to add

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,639
this slide to contrast how i do things

00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,880
and others do things that i know of

00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,480
so there are various ways of keeping

00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,320
things going

00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,480
um but to me this is no longer

00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:05,920
sustainable it's gotten to a point where

00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,200
i need to choose between group

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,720
or core a group if often blocked by core

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,400
and there's not enough time anymore for

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,400
me to do both

00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,480
so preparing for drupal contenting to

00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,599
the issue queue replying to emails if

00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,200
ever

00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,200
planning et cetera that all leads away

00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,760
at my one day a week budget and i cannot

00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,680
ask factorial to give me more because

00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:28,000
simply by paying me one day a week to

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:29,760
work on countrypens sometimes score

00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,839
they're already sponsoring me way more

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,839
than the large part of the community

00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,920
ever has

00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,400
so then i noticed this after all these

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,160
woes out of the blue this happened so i

00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,079
saw this tweet by mats who

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,079
up until recently worked for centauro

00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,839
aka commerce

00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,440
and he said you know maybe wordpress has

00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,760
been doing it right all along

00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,280
where we have these um plugins or

00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,200
modules that you pay for

00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,200
to get releases for the next couple

00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,880
months and after that it's still your

00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,599
code it's still open source you can keep

00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,640
it

00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,200
but you don't get newer releases anymore

00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,480
and that automatically helps funding and

00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,079
a while later so as

00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,680
you can see this was in october and then

00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,800
in december uh

00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,880
josef krugmberg was asking

00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,480
the same question and one of the answers

00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:17,760
from a belgian uh colleague of

00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,920
mel not khalib fellow drupalists

00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,320
um said you know like matt mentioned

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,880
paying maintainers might actually be

00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,800
an easy way to have a big impact or like

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,200
christiansen did just ask for some

00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,119
features and then focus on those

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:34,079
and it got me thinking like group is

00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,960
installed on more than 10 000 websites

00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:38,160
if i got 10 euros for each install a

00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,880
year which is

00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:42,480
negligible for for most people using

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,920
group because they're usually very large

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,359
expensive websites

00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,000
then that would give me enough money to

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:50,320
work on group full time all year long

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,760
and by doing so i would immediately also

00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,160
have enough time to

00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,320
fix core whenever i needed to fix rate

00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,839
and actually have the time to pursue and

00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,240
persevere and

00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,960
and and get that into core for everyone

00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,320
to benefit

00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,960
instead of just having it in another

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:07,359
standalone module or entity api

00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,359
so this might fix multiple problems i

00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:11,359
might go slightly over time i think

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,880
but not that much so i could work on

00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,839
group fun time as i mentioned

00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,440
actually work on core but depending on

00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:18,880
the amount of money you would ask each

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,760
year and it still doesn't have to be

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,200
about like 10

00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,599
20 euros i don't know you could even

00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,520
hire a small team so i can actually have

00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,119
the luxury of going on vacation and not

00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,079
have to worry about my module for a

00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,240
change

00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,560
um i could have people to bounce ideas

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,280
off of so that i don't do stupid stuff

00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,359
or vice versa or you know just have

00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,040
someone to collaborate with

00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,800
i currently have some people that i've

00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,880
contacted who want to help me work on

00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,400
group and og at the same time and

00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,920
merge those modules into something

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,560
awesome for the future

00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,640
but they too have constraints with how

00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,920
much time they can spend

00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:56,960
and this will fix that and

00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,640
the drupal association is currently i

00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,560
assume like any other business bleeding

00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,640
money thanks to kovitz but with the

00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,240
recent drama regarding the memberships

00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,839
and voting and everything it was kind of

00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,320
obvious that they need money

00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:10,320
so if they were to facilitate this on

00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:12,640
the drupal.org website

00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,320
and just like any app store take a small

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,960
percentage of whatever revenue this

00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,440
might

00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,000
generate then that would also be a new

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,040
you know stream

00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,520
of revenue for them so that might also

00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,920
be something that they want to consider

00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,280
um in closing though there are some

00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,880
things that we need to keep in mind with

00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:30,960
this idea i just wanted to put that out

00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,800
there to start the discussion

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,920
it's that i still believe everything

00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,800
should be free for scholars and

00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,400
non-profits and

00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,800
in those types of organizations

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,000
education is probably the single most

00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,240
important thing that we

00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,280
as a species have going for us affect

00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,200
that generation

00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,480
to generation to generation we pass on

00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,599
all of our knowledge so we can keep

00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,000
improving it

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,680
amazing we shouldn't tax that

00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,760
non-profits

00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,040
they're usually the ones you know trying

00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:01,119
to feed the poor

00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:03,280
trying to make our world greener etc

00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,160
that shouldn't cost anything but if

00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,480
you're building

00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,560
a half a million dollar website and

00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,200
generating tens of thousands of euros a

00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,440
year

00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:13,280
uh or more with that website and you

00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,160
know maybe paying 10 euros a year isn't

00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,920
that much

00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,440
i don't know it's probably a rounding

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:21,599
error in your yearly reports

00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,200
licensing and gpl is tough so perhaps we

00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,320
need something like sponsorships i don't

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,160
know

00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,359
i haven't worked out the exact details

00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,960
but this is something i really want to

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,680
talk about this week with other people

00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,520
maybe even a drupal association

00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,839
um and some lucky few being paid full

00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,839
time does not allow for growth

00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:40,400
meaning that if for some reason after

00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,839
this talk open social went hey man

00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,160
i didn't know you were struggling this

00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:46,000
hard to keep you know everything working

00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:48,960
how about we hire you and you work on it

00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,839
full time yeah that's awesome

00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,440
but that fixes it for me there are still

00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,400
other maintainers out there who are

00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,480
struggling who

00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,920
want to work on core but they don't have

00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,119
the resources because at the end of the

00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,720
day they still need to pay their

00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,440
mortgage and everything

00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,960
so that would be a band-aid fix it still

00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:06,800
doesn't fix the problem that new

00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,760
maintainers won't be coming through the

00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,200
ranks

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,720
because it's so daunting for them so

00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,400
that's not really a fix so we need

00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,319
something more sustainable for even

00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,440
people with smaller modules who might

00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:22,560
someday make it into a large module

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,480
and then finally in closing whatever i

00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,400
just said about funding and everything

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,000
do not let that stop you from developing

00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,920
large modules

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,280
it's still hugely beneficial to the

00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:34,400
community it's still

00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,319
very satisfying to be a maintainer

00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,079
um especially if you're part of a team i

00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:41,520
can imagine it being a lot easier

00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:42,640
on you so these are issues that i'm

00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,880
facing now

00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,880
that maybe other maintainers are facing

00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:49,200
but by the time you've

00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,880
made it so far to the point where i am

00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:53,839
it might have been fixed already

00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:55,359
so please don't let this stop you if if

00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:57,920
you want to discuss this further

00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:59,760
as a maintainer as a user as a drupal

00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,440
association as whatever

00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:03,040
please reach out to me during the rest

00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,359
of this week

00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,520
i've cleared my whole schedule i can

00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:09,359
talk about this all week if you want

00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,720
but i feel that there is a need for the

00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:13,520
drupal association

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,119
and the community as a whole to start um

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,920
figuring out how to

00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,760
sponsor these maintainers so that drupal

00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,040
core may flourish as well because it's

00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,640
usually a bottom-ups type of situation

00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,400
i don't think there's much room left for

00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:29,359
questions um

00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,359
but let's see mathias are there any like

00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:34,720
really important questions that you

00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:37,119
you saw that you um want to put forward

00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,319
we don't have any we have some

00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,440
discussions about

00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:44,800
um github sponsorships in

00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:46,000
the chat going on but no requests for

00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,480
the moment

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,160
okay so um there are two questions that

00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,839
i want to put forward in the

00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,920
poll section so matthias if you would

00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:56,079
like to open them up right now

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,680
um one is about how you experience this

00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,960
session because this was my very first

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,119
session

00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:06,160
where i don't present facts but feelings

00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:09,119
okay a dangerous statement nowadays um

00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:11,200
and i really wonder how it went um

00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:13,040
because this is new territory to me

00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,560
and secondly uh one question about the

00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,480
section at the end like do you think

00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:18,000
it's a good idea to start asking money

00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,720
to certain people who are using the

00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,119
software

00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:22,560
do you think it's a bad idea i really

00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,400
want to pick your brain

00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,599
on this and see what you know the

00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,920
audience thinks

00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:29,119
um so please before you leave take like

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,520
one minute to just

00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,400
click two answers for like one for each

00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,359
question

00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,640
that might give me a better insight and

00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,240
other than that i'd say

00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,480
you know thanks for being present thanks

00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:43,520
for listening i can't see you right now

00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,800
because of this whole mess but it will

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,400
get better one day and i'm looking

00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,599
forward to see you all in person again

00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,319
maybe next year

00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,880
we'll see so i'm gonna stop my share

00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,640
right now

00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,319
and um yeah it's really weird to present

00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,800
this way so i hope it went down well

00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:00,880
i have no way to get feedback so um this

00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:04,319
is a bit awkward

00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:08,880
so yeah see you all in chats

00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:08,880
