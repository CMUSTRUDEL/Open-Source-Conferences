00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,440
hello everyone

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,720
my name is valerie falconer gibson i

00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,920
work as a senior

00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,000
software developer at finalists and i've

00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,119
been working with drupal for

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,679
14 years well

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,599
been to several drupalcons since then

00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,280
and the last one was in

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,719
amsterdam which happens to be my

00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,280
hometown also and

00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,480
i also have good memories of prague and

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,079
vienna

00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:43,200
but this is the first time that i'm

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,200
allowed to talk on a drupalcom

00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,280
and of course i would like to thank my

00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,280
employer for giving me the

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,480
space and time to speak here

00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:59,520
so i have to switch

00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:03,039
some windows

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:06,640
yes so

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,640
um what is this about

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:12,159
[Music]

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,280
well searching it is one of the most

00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,400
interesting developments

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,759
in recent years and we i think we live

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,479
in a huge complex

00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,960
society where we are overwhelmed with

00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,520
information on a daily basis

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,159
and despite all efforts the more

00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,720
information

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,960
that comes our way the more difficult it

00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,720
uh the more difficult it becomes to find

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,040
what we are looking for

00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:37,360
so this is this talk is also about

00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,439
searching a search for the possibilities

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,799
and hopefully we will gain more insight

00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,360
in to them

00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,360
afterwards

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,759
well um

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,479
wait next slide yes

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,520
um of course this is going about

00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,360
elasticsearch

00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,079
and solar but there is a much more

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,920
available

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,159
these days um so i thought it

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,960
would be nice to make to have a quick

00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,560
look at

00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,789
what else is on the market and according

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,560
to

00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:15,760
[Music]

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,920
slants.co which is a

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,200
community driven review platform where

00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,520
they give accurate

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,239
accurate reviews on a huge number of

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,680
subjects

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,640
and they're all ordered in clear

00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,319
category so it's a very nice

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:34,239
site to go and i i picked

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:37,280
some random alternatives

00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,239
and they had these

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,239
recommendations

00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:48,560
first of all amber i'm not sure how you

00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,440
pronounce it but they had three positive

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,599
reviews and

00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,879
zero negative uh i'll see typo over

00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,239
there too

00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:01,440
um it's a very uh clear

00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:04,720
and uh yeah neat uh

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:09,680
search engine if you ask me so i'm

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:14,000
opening it here now so if you see it

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,800
they have a nice uh clear view

00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,200
you can also it's it's all for free you

00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,319
can

00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,319
get a live demo

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,400
and then of course it's not i just

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,840
checked it

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,840
but i can't reach it

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,319
well that's always uh that's murphy's

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,360
law of course

00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:41,040
um but if you want to check it out

00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,280
you should really do it i think i'm

00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,000
going to check it by myself

00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,640
maybe in in deep in some other time

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,560
because it's

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,480
uh it looks it looks very good and you

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,400
have a lot of options

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:57,599
oh sorry but the demo doesn't work

00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,640
um so for uh so far for amber

00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,640
then you all we also have algolia

00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,640
they have nine positive reviews and one

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,360
negative

00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,480
if you go there this is actually uh they

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,760
have a pricing

00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:13,200
[Music]

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:14,400
table so you can have it for free but

00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,519
then you're limited

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,560
to a lot of things

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,720
um but it also looks very uh

00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,440
uh yeah how do you say it very neat and

00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,479
it's worth while trying uh trying it

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,080
maybe if you

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:35,120
have time or interested

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,800
that's uh angolia and then we also have

00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,520
eloquent

00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,199
object relational mapping and they have

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:45,280
two positive reviews and three

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:49,600
negative and this is actually uh level

00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:52,960
uh related um so if you go there

00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:56,479
uh there is a lot of documentation

00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:00,320
for this um uh

00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:03,280
so i checked some uh

00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,479
uh recommendations for it uh the pros

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,160
are for example

00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,400
they have very good documentation

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,199
someone says it's well it's hard to find

00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,680
the level

00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,680
the laravels docs and api documentations

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,680
are very good

00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,520
um they have a very large community

00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,840
sometimes your issue can be hard to find

00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,720
but

00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,080
certainty it was already answered before

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,000
well and the cons are

00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,960
too much magic methods debug hell

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,680
low performance eloquent tries to do too

00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,720
much magic

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,520
it gets slower than some concurrence and

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,199
no own data mapping you gotta install

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,120
plugins to be able to match your local

00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,759
models or you can use mutators that

00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,759
results in very ugly model classes so

00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,400
well um and there are there are actually

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,639
a lot

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,759
more alternatives but i thought let's

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,120
keep it to those

00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,680
three and now um let's go further with

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,720
some

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:59,600
brief history of elasticsearch

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,680
well elasticsearch actually all happened

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,199
with the recipe app

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,840
um because actually it was

00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,960
created by shay bannon who was looking

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,280
for a job

00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,680
while his wife was attending a cooking

00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,600
school at le cordon bleu

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,840
and in his spare time he started

00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:21,840
building a search engine

00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,840
for her growing list of recipes

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,000
well the precursor of elasticsearch was

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,360
called compass

00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,600
he opened sourced elasticsearch created

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,800
an elasticsearch irc channel and waited

00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,880
for uses to appear

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,840
and then the response was very

00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,720
impressive

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,960
users took to it naturally and easily

00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,639
and adoption went

00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,400
through the roof the community started

00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,479
to form and people noticed

00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:51,919
namely steven steven schwermann

00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:55,360
dutch person yuri bones and simon

00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:58,400
wilnoa and this is a

00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,400
picture of them

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:05,440
and uh well they're very happy because

00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,120
look very happy because it's a such a

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,160
success

00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:12,479
um well uh the thing is in uh

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,639
it happened to be that in 2012 there

00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,520
were also two other open source projects

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,319
going on

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,639
and they were called logstash and kibana

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,240
and

00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,840
that's the visualizing part of

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,919
elasticsearch so

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:26,639
then it turned into a elastic search

00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:30,720
logs and kibana stack and

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:33,280
that is called the elk stack

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,639
well in 2016 they bundled their

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,080
commercial plugins

00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,720
they called it shield marvel and watcher

00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,840
and they called

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,520
they bundled it into one set which is

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,240
called x-pac

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,800
and this is actually a commercial uh

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,319
pack

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,319
or plug-in set you can

00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,400
you can you can buy it consisted of

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:59,360
features like security monitoring and

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:03,520
alerting for their core products

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,840
well and after this huge success in 2018

00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,680
elastic went to the new york stack

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,360
exchange

00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,360
so i wonder why this picture is taken

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,160
but maybe

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,720
after that so how to install

00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,080
elasticsearch in drupal

00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,120
um you should use the elastic search

00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:27,840
connector this is the

00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,840
the control control module for that

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,919
um it

00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,479
happens i've still got some errors when

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,800
trying to

00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,640
install this for a drupal 9 so

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,839
just have to figure out what was going

00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:47,519
wrong uh for that

00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,839
uh but then if you installed it

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,279
uh or first installed alexa source

00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,680
itself it looks like

00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,720
this in your localhost so that's all

00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,440
very easy

00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,920
very quick and you should just download

00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,560
the

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:03,279
the code and follow the instructions

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:06,839
install instructions

00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,800
and then what you get well also you have

00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,800
to uh

00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,080
apart from elasticsearch if you want to

00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,080
visualize it you can

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,560
install kibana which is the visualizing

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,080
part

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:25,279
and that's well there you see it

00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,760
um kibana is very uh very overwhelming

00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,880
there's

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,560
it's it looks very slick and and uh well

00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,399
let me see if i can

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,399
show you something wait

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,560
uh that's over here

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,839
yes

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:58,640
uh well this is uh the the kibana part

00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,399
and as as you can see uh there you have

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,839
a dashboard over there and you can

00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,160
customize it

00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:10,000
um for your own needs or

00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:12,880
that your projects uh um

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,839
there are a lot of options you can add

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,320
filters

00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,880
uh well so you can mainly uh do whatever

00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:23,519
you want

00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:26,640
there is so much this is the logs parts

00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:30,000
uh well it's overview

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:33,040
um so you should really try out and see

00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,760
uh if it if it fits your needs for me it

00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,959
was

00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,000
kind of overwhelming i'm uh because i'm

00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,120
more used to

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,920
the solar part actually which we'll

00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,279
discuss

00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,279
after this um but it's

00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,399
as you can see it's it's it looks very

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,399
nice and clean

00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:55,120
and also nice fonts and

00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,920
nice images so and this is really

00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,880
worthwhile

00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:04,160
trying um

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:06,340
well if you go further

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,839
then we have

00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:11,360
[Music]

00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,839
a brief history of solar something

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,880
i hope you see using the logo but this

00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,880
is logo of solar

00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,320
well this was uh actually created by

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,360
yonex sealy

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,120
in 2004 at cnet networks

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,000
as an in-house project to add search

00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,680
capability for the company website

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,440
in january 2006 cnets

00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,519
decided to openly publish the source

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,120
code by donating it to the apache super

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,040
foundation

00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:43,360
and like any new apache project it

00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,760
entered an incubation period with

00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,959
which helped solve organizational legal

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,959
and financial issues

00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,600
well in january 2007 solar

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,839
graduated from incubation status into a

00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,240
standalone top-level project

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,240
and it grew steadily with accumulated

00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,519
features thereby attracting users

00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,000
contributors and

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,839
commenters although quite new as a

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,240
public project it powered several high

00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,959
traffic websites

00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:19,040
um in september 2008 solar

00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:21,120
1.3 was released including district

00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,880
distributed search capabilities and

00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,240
performance enhancements among

00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,519
many others then in january uh

00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:32,800
2009 jonathan along with grant

00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,440
ingersoll and eric hatcher joined

00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,959
lucid works it was the first company

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,399
providing commercial support and

00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,560
training for apache solar

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,800
search technologies and since then

00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,240
support offerings around

00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,240
solar have been abundant

00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,880
in 2009 release of solar

00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,200
1.4 came out this version introduced

00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,079
enhancement in indexing searching and

00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,079
faceting

00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,920
along with many other improvements such

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:03,600
as rich document processing

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,680
for for example pdf word html

00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,880
and search results clustering based on

00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,880
carat 2 and

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,880
also improved database integration

00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,560
then in march 2010 the lucene

00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,560
and solar projects merged this was also

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,680
actually the time that

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,680
that elasticsearch

00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:31,680
was really

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,240
brought to next level and solar became

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,200
the scene

00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,720
sub projects as elasticsearch is too

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,639
several downloads continued but the

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,639
products were now jointly developed by a

00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,199
single set of committers

00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,800
in 2011 the solar version number scheme

00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,440
was changed in order to match that of

00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,240
the scene

00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,360
and after solar 1.4 the next release of

00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,720
solar was labeled

00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:58,000
3.1 um then

00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:01,040
in october 2012 solar 4 came

00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,240
in 2015 solar 5 and

00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,880
in april 16 solar 6 and

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,760
well now these days we're on here on the

00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:10,959
solar

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,399
8. um and this one was released

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,519
including many bug fish

00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,839
fixes and component updates um

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,199
solar nodes can now listen and serve how

00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:23,440
to debate

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:27,519
http 2 requests and um

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,519
well what does it look like

00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:32,320
[Music]

00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:34,240
well this is uh if you um

00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,639
if you have downloaded you can just

00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:39,760
download the code uh

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:46,079
you have to pick the right java

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:46,079
version and if i'm going to

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,480
it's it's uh it comes with an all within

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,920
a built-in

00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:58,240
jetty server so that's nice

00:14:53,920 --> 00:15:01,920
very easy to install and you can uh

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,399
create multiple chorus so uh for example

00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,639
here

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:09,519
we have the my um example core

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,639
um what i find very nice about this is

00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,480
that

00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:15,199
you have a good uh a graphical user

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,399
interface

00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:21,440
it's it's it's not as

00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:24,560
well in my opinion not as slick or

00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,680
neat as the elasticsearch

00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,440
look and feel but i've somehow for me

00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,800
it's very uh

00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,240
clear what what's what what the meaning

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:40,000
is of it all

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:43,600
right yeah still have five minutes um

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,600
so you can execute queries from here

00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,600
um if you only want to uh

00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:57,199
want to see several lists you can

00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:00,560
put it in here you can well

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:04,800
also a very important thing is you can

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:08,880
do analyzes so you um for example

00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,880
you want to see what's happening if you

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:14,320
well let's have an engram text field

00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,940
what's what's happening if you

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:20,469
fill in a words like

00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:20,469
[Music]

00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:25,600
qualcomm what's happening with it

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,120
well this is how it's being queried you

00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,560
can also

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:36,079
see if you put this in the index uh

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:41,279
field a good analysis so this is very uh

00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:44,560
valuable in my opinion um

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:48,800
so uh picking uh solar

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,880
is uh for it for installing for me

00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,639
installing it was much more easier than

00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,600
elasticsearch

00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,759
um because it's it's just one thing you

00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,160
have to do and unless you have to

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,480
install the the different parts if you

00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:05,760
want some more

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:09,760
more plug-ins or more functionality

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,480
um but i have a few questions actually

00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,679
for you

00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,039
and i'm not sure if i'm going to see it

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,039
on that

00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:24,799
on the good browser um

00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:24,799
and i hope you can just maybe you can

00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,840
send your answers in the chat and then

00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,220
we can discuss

00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,640
that um

00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:38,080
[Music]

00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:40,799
so uh um what is it

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,960
are have you been using solar much more

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,679
or more elastic search or haven't you

00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:47,200
used none of them yet and what what were

00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,360
your

00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,520
considerations why did you choose one or

00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:55,200
why did you choose the other or

00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:58,960
what are you still thinking about

00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:02,240
i'm going to see if i can see your

00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,240
answers somewhere

00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:20,080
not yet you see it no

00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,080
i'm going to ask my colleague ah

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,360
i'm using both always use solar

00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,880
customers start to move towards solicit

00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,000
search so they're still considered

00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,240
defaults

00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,360
but we felt module is still not very

00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,320
stable

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:39,280
okay um and

00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,280
yes and what uh

00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,880
yes um

00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,799
we use almost exclusively solar we're

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,720
having one project

00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,559
but many sites are depending on ends of

00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:55,600
life cellular versus yes

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,559
so um and what

00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,880
is uh what's what experience did you

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:04,720
have for example edwardo when

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,720
it was not very stable

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:13,280
can you tell me that

00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,480
excellence excerpt mostly started with

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,480
solar but as

00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,799
is way easier to set up personalized

00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,640
especially when i don't use search api

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:24,400
custom integration yes

00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,320
that is true yes uh for simple sites

00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,120
solar for more complex requirements for

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,880
search

00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:34,240
elasticsearch ah

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,720
there's only one minute left um

00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,400
and so i see that there are there are a

00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,360
lot of different uh

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,960
uh opinions why you should you want to

00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,360
choose one or the other

00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,840
i tried soda a few years ago and found

00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,240
it the right pain to install and use

00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,440
i found elasticsearch far easier so have

00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,840
used it since

00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,720
yes that's uh it's actually what i heard

00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,240
more often

00:19:54,720 --> 00:20:01,280
that people find solo hard to install

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,960
um so maybe that is something solar

00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,440
could work on because

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,720
i actually find it very easy but somehow

00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,120
this is

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,799
maybe not attractive enough or it's

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,840
maybe the documentation isn't clear

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:15,360
enough

00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:18,159
um um well that could be something uh

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,159
to learn from

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,200
someone else says uh

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
we in ff we prefer to use solar but i'm

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,640
not sure why

00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,360
can you give us your opinion yes well i

00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,559
think

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:35,200
mostly it's because it it's

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,320
it also evolves from something you you

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,159
got used to or

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,360
you you start working at the company and

00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:45,360
they use uh solar or elasticsearch there

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,799
if you're very used to it and um uh

00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,480
you work for a couple of years over

00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,760
there you go to a new company then

00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,039
probably you will

00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:56,400
recommend the thing you already know um

00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:59,280
as it goes with a lot of things

00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,280
so then you start

00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,960
recommending yeah you should really use

00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,720
solar it's so easy let

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,039
i help you and then uh it happens to be

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,600
the

00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:10,640
the main your first choice i think

00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,600
that's also

00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,840
how it went with me um but if you happen

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,039
to

00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,960
uh oh there's one one more question

00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,240
from my colleague do you have any good

00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,440
tips like

00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,520
when should i use a list search or solar

00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,880
what is pros and cons for both of them

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,120
yes well if you want to customize the

00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,600
i think the the elastic search

00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,880
visualization

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:40,000
plug-in kibana is very nice to give more

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,000
insights

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:48,000
for also non-developers

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,919
and uh other persons at your company

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,799
that want to have a quick view

00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,799
and so i think that is very valuable

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,799
and also uh

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,559
so that would be a recommendation for

00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:06,440
elasticsearch

00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:07,919
if you want to do uh uh complex uh

00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,440
[Music]

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:14,480
uh queries yourself as a dev developer

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:18,080
um and then it's and and you ha

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:21,600
you are used to the solar uh

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,120
um the the solar uh graphql using

00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,760
interface then it's probably easier to

00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,200
do that

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:30,400
but yeah it's it's

00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,159
it happens to be what you like more

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,799
yeah and i have to finish now because

00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,720
i'm already uh running out of time

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:40,159
so thank you very much for your

00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,159
