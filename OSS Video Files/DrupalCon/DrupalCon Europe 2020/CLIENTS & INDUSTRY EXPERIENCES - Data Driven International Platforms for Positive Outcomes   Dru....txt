00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,560
hi everyone

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,560
and welcome to this next session

00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,840
uh here i'm presenting data driven

00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,920
platforms

00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,840
for positive outcomes so we're looking

00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,199
at the love matters platforms and

00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:31,599
a data lake i'm alex a drupal developer

00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,800
and tech lead here at rnw media

00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:37,360
my goal here today is to reveal how

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,800
we at r w media can guide different

00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,680
communities through a data driven

00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,600
strategy

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,800
for content delivery and positive

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,719
outcomes

00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,440
so to not only deliver better content

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,840
and insights but ensure information

00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,120
gets to those who need it especially in

00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,520
a time in their life where they

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,079
where it can make a huge difference to

00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,280
their outcomes

00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,480
so we're we are rnw media an ngo based

00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,800
in the netherlands

00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,920
building digital communities for social

00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,439
change

00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,200
we want to contribute to a world where

00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,520
young people in restrictive settings

00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,360
can confidently claim their rights

00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,280
assume their place in society and shape

00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,960
a better future

00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,560
we aim our platforms at the youth in

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,439
these emerging digital communities

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,240
and we do this as we see it as a way

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,040
you know of really making sustainable

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,680
change

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,880
um by you know doing it for for the

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,560
youth of a country that's going to grow

00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,560
up and make a change

00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,079
the platforms highlighted today are love

00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,280
matters a pleasure

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:39,360
positive approach to sr hr so sexual

00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,000
health and reproductive health

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,520
so it comprises of seven platform hubs

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,840
in seven countries

00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,280
in english french mandarin spanish and

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,799
hindi

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,399
and we do this through a complementary

00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,200
open source stack and at the center of

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,200
it is dribble

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,719
so this is what the map of the platform

00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,399
looks like

00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,280
and where they're located in mexico

00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,880
nigeria the democratic republic of congo

00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,640
kenya egypt india and china

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,080
each of these platform locations you see

00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,840
on the map has of course their own

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,680
community that they serve

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,200
but um some of the facts about health

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,000
and safety are universal

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,560
and but the the stories and the regions

00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,840
of course

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,360
in which they they are vastly different

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,360
so uh we have many communities here

00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,400
they've also built up a discussion board

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,440
and a forum on

00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,360
drupal 7 and that also serves as a

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,440
massive archive of

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:33,440
data you know about all these topics

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,120
so for each of these sites in these

00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,120
communities there's a

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,120
accompanying discussion board forum

00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,519
comments comments on articles

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,200
their facebook pages twitter accounts

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,280
you know youtube channels

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,480
instagram accounts whatsapp groups and

00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,080
so on

00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,879
and with all these data sources to

00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,120
monitor it became just too numerous

00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,400
and too complex to manage and we have to

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,720
keep track of it in

00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,760
you know in a reliable way so we needed

00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,760
a solution

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,360
we needed a way to consolidate uh

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,680
normalize and get some sanity and

00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,120
structure to all these data sets

00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,879
before we could actually go about making

00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,720
sense of it and then learning from it

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,560
and looking at all the signals um

00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,959
let alone being able to you know deliver

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,080
some change with it so as an ngo we uh

00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,480
we have a theory of change

00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,360
a model and an approach to affecting

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,040
change but

00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,879
how can we possibly manage it when the

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,519
data sets just kept growing at such

00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,319
a rapid pace so the heart of this

00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,280
strategy we use drupal taxonomy

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,360
aka pillars and so we have a vocabulary

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,280
of topics and content we could translate

00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,599
into the language for the region

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,319
so the same concepts and topics but uh

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,159
adapted

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:46,080
and localized so when these tags are

00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,799
used across different platforms they're

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,360
traceable

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,120
back to a known reference point and we

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,040
had this defined by our theory of change

00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,280
and our content strategist and our

00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,439
goal was then to positively influence

00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,599
behavior societal norms and education

00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:01,519
about health

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:04,879
and we needed to measure the impact that

00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,879
we sought to deliver

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,560
so now clearly sort of defining our

00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,879
goals and setting up a network

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,080
of content creators across the different

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,920
regions

00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,200
they have a common point to work from

00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,199
but also

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,440
flexibility to adapt the content to meet

00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,600
the needs of the readers and also

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,600
always mapping back to a source of truth

00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,280
the the original taxonomy that we

00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,360
came up with it's not static it can grow

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,120
and then change and include new items

00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,040
but it's done deliberately

00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,600
and researchers were eager to understand

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,160
what worked and what didn't work

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,880
as content created as an author so how

00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,080
do we get those

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,199
answers to them so

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,600
um yeah in the tech team we zoomed out

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,520
at the

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,960
technology stack to work out what the

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,960
gaps were you know we published in

00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,720
drupal uh we share and engage in all the

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,040
different various platforms and

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,000
we were reporting on this in power bi as

00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,919
a prototype

00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
but there were still gaps like how could

00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:01,759
we automatically get all this social

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,880
data each day

00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,199
and make sense of it so we could

00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,080
actually get some insights so the data

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,120
engineering

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,840
was the missing piece of the puzzle so

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,199
we looked at uh adding apache airflow uh

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,840
google bigquery and

00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,039
metabase to fill in the gaps and i'll

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,199
explain

00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,840
how all these uh different technology

00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,000
stacks would work together as a cohesive

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,759
system

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,680
so this is really the the nuts and bolts

00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,000
of it how we put it all together

00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,680
um each of the stages here helped us

00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,160
build on the previous step

00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,320
we have all the apis including the json

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,600
endpoints from the drupal sites

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,840
that allow us to gain stats uh per day

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,720
on comments on articles uh what's

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,280
published

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,639
uh the whatsapp api twitter api

00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,720
instagram

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,639
the comments the likes the reactions the

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,160
youtube subscribers the reporting the

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:54,639
facebook graph and

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,759
comments and reactions and shares these

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,039
json

00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,560
payloads that we we fetch with apache

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,639
airflow

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,840
and gcp it's called cloud composer but

00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:08,639
it's a airflow up in the cloud

00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,120
fetch these all and store them as a you

00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,759
know raw

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,360
storage files so all the payloads have

00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,080
to land somewhere and so we

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,639
saw them for further processing this

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,440
also

00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,960
uh works as a way to backtrack so that

00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,479
if we ever want to work out how we

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,319
got to where we got to with a

00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,080
calculation we can always

00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,479
uh do that by starting again from the

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,080
from the raw data

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,840
so once we have this within storage we

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,800
then use airflow again to pick up the

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,840
raw files and

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,280
load them into some bigquery staging

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,919
tables

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,199
the staging tables um then go from flat

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,479
files to

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,319
you know actually taking shape in a

00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,039
database so then it's ready for querying

00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,960
and transforming and manipulating

00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,560
so we still use the taxonomy developed

00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,919
by the content strategist

00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,280
at the start um but we you know we use

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,919
that as a lookup table in

00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,319
in bigquery and we could then prepare

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,160
the data for use down the line

00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:03,520
knowing what the state the files were in

00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,280
when we first got them

00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,039
and to what they needed to be so they

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,280
could be consumed again by

00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,800
our end users and actually you know gain

00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,639
some insights

00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,039
so airflow handles that again for us

00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,240
and pushed us into taking the the data

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,400
from all these platforms

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,360
um you know back into staging tables

00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,000
and then making them ready to uh for use

00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,400
through business intelligence tables

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,919
um airflow you know handled the whole

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,520
thing for us and so

00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,960
once we're happy with the results and we

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,520
can trust the data sets

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,160
we connect power bi and metabase to the

00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,720
business

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,319
intelligence data sets um this is all

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,840
read only and a safe playground for

00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,360
those wanting to understand the content

00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,599
flow and the results

00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,199
the regional teams will then get access

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,360
to and see the results of their work

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,360
through the various platforms

00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,120
power bi had a more fixed uh set of

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,280
parameters for us and for the authors

00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,080
who were focused on content and targets

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,199
while we use metabase in other teams

00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,440
which is a bit more open

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,680
and allowed researchers to really dive

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:09,280
in and discover new insights

00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,680
and build more custom dashboards

00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,360
so to complete the circle we then have

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,560
the insights from you know all the

00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,400
reporting layers here

00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,160
which then helps inform the content

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,560
creators again so they can adjust

00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,599
what they want to do how they want to

00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,319
craft their

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,599
stories um their content knowing what

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,479
worked and what didn't work

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,680
and it really helped empower them and

00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,120
all the contributors to

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,080
to that platform so before i was

00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,080
mentioning

00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,839
apache airflow and this is what one of

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,880
the

00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,560
dags looks like or the pipelines

00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,240
it did all the heavy lifting for us you

00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,959
know fetching data from drupal and all

00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,800
the other

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,720
sources so the the data engineering that

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,080
engineering that went into this has

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,080
taken hundreds of hours of

00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,519
manually collecting the data we now

00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,959
don't have to do that we don't have to

00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,560
download spreadsheets or anything like

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,080
that we're really happy

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,279
um you know with a team with digital

00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,399
power here in the netherlands that

00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,760
helped us

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:08,399
work on this the data engineering piece

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,080
so to complete the data driven cycle

00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,000
that we needed to create

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,920
the benefits of using airflow also

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,680
allowed us to backfill any of the data

00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,959
as long as the api has had it available

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,720
for us so

00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,160
we can define a date in the past from

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,959
where we needed the data from the

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,800
platform

00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,399
and if i would just save the gap and run

00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,000
nightly cycles

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,800
for each of those missing days and

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,160
populate our data set so if we catch up

00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,080
this is really good being able to find

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,240
out that we could do this

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,320
and craft different pipelines to gather

00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,200
different kinds of metrics

00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,680
so in the tree view on the left you can

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,920
see

00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,279
the different stages of the pipeline and

00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:46,240
retrieving the followers for the love

00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,640
matters africa platform on instagram

00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,600
picking up the store json response from

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,600
the

00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,640
from storage inserting into a state

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,720
staging table

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,320
uh kicking off another job that would

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,360
then do the processing on this

00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,800
on the table um all the way through to

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,120
successful completion where it would

00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,079
then um you know destroy the staging

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,279
table

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:10,320
ready to start again the next day so

00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:12,079
yeah that's how we we're using that to

00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,680
move it along

00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,440
um so yeah now we're able to get some

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,640
insights

00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,120
having these curated data sets um

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,839
it was you know analysts were then able

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,640
to really

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,320
craft uh bespoke dashboards to serve

00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,440
their needs on the team

00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,519
uh the team then have their own

00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,640
way or manage to steer their own content

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,480
and their own

00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,160
delivery of a platform and a message and

00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,920
goals

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,680
and we believe it's a really core part

00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,640
of truly being sustainable like

00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,839
letting them be in charge of their own

00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,519
data and story

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,600
um but they need the tools to be able to

00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:51,279
do it and

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,880
so yeah the results are really 345 odd

00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,480
data pipelines that are running every

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,200
night fetching all these different

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,600
endpoints

00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,519
loading them up and we wouldn't

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,959
obviously have access to this data not

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,079
be able to make sense of it

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,760
but uh the the taxonomic pillars that we

00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,200
started with really helped define

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,880
you know the structure in the model so

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,360
that we could work out a common

00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,079
common point to join on so now we can

00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,120
really

00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:17,120
make sense of all the data sets um we

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,360
could look a little bit deeper into it

00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,120
uh we could look at the the consequences

00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,519
of employing different strategies and

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,399
that

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,920
goes beyond you know just an am a b test

00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,120
or any kind of google analytics

00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,800
insights that we're getting before so

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,560
messages and stories behave differently

00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,240
on different platforms um

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,160
and some communities favor some

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,680
technologies compared to others

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,320
and now that we can see that we can

00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,320
actually appropriate the strategy

00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,240
uh just to suit you know the needs of

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,480
the teams

00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,160
so having it all within reach of those

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,920
who need it and not just relying on

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,160
manual processing we can get to answers

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,240
about topics much faster

00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,079
uh adapt and react to the messages as it

00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,760
propagates across the platforms

00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,519
and most importantly discern and

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,560
evaluate you know are we actually having

00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,200
an impact

00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,800
what's the nature of the impact um how

00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,399
the demographic is shifting in each

00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,839
community

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,279
although there are lots of other tools

00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,040
out there that could help us and

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:12,639
commercial tools and off-the-shelf tools

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,399
um we found them too costly and not

00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,200
customizable to really suit the needs

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,600
that we

00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,440
we had for the different regions so

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,480
being able to define what we needed

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,480
and when put us really in charge of

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,079
our platforms and not be holding to

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,120
other services

00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:31,120
um and yeah the the management of the

00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,320
tools as well so we we own the tools and

00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,440
the technology

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,639
um and yeah most of it or almost it's

00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,639
all open source as well

00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,880
so you know we're still subject to the

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,200
api changes from the various platforms

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,160
but

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,519
this we can at least plan for and

00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,720
incorporate it into our development

00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,160
cycle

00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,120
and now we have an evidence-based

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:54,079
approach to our community platform goals

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,360
you know which is fantastic so again the

00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,959
the benefits are

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,120
you know we are creating more impact by

00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,920
improving the strategies based on fresh

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,920
insights

00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,680
uh we're able to gain new and different

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,399
insights by connecting different data

00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,040
sets

00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,639
we're cutting costs by no longer having

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,079
to manually export reports from

00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,160
different sources

00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,279
and we're also building knowledge and

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,720
skills on the data

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,920
and providing easy access to analysis

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,240
tools as well

00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:21,839
we're also more adaptive and responsive

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,600
to real-time changes

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,279
we can easily provide donor-specific

00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,399
reports and

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,480
we can use the data lake as a

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,920
fundraising opportunity for

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,440
technical partnerships that we might

00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,959
want to embark on as well so we have a

00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,560
solid foundation

00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,279
for you know data driven and data

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,279
science projects

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,240
so yeah to recap the the journey you

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,160
know we started with a hierarchical

00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,920
taxonomy for different areas topics

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,959
facts articles clinics

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,560
stories subjects um we map all the

00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,760
content and the tags across all the

00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:55,600
platforms

00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:56,399
um and you know us uh the the teams in

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,480
the region to

00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,639
you know to use their version of all of

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,560
these tags as well

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,639
it had a translation or that it was

00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:07,040
always back to um you know

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,760
central central point this started in

00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,720
drupal

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,000
um we replicated this out to bigquery as

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,000
a as a lookup table

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,720
and we gathered all these signals from

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,320
all the interactions of all the articles

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,120
that came back to us as a constant flow

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,120
of api calls fetched by airflow

00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,040
so now we have a unified model and one

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,440
topic in china can have a known

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,240
uh equivalency in nigeria that we can

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,720
research on

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,680
we can then start to not just map out

00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,040
trends

00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:36,639
within a community but also look at how

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,120
it differs across different communities

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,639
so more insights leads to more questions

00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,959
and then we can iterate knowing we're

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,880
actually asking the right questions and

00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,800
able to trust the data that we we get

00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,560
back

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,639
so here we have uh love matters china

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,560
dashboard which was a bespoke one built

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,079
in metabase

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,160
now here we didn't have access to all of

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,920
the data cars that the

00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,360
you know chinese team was using but

00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,399
we're also able to upload them

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,480
into uh bigquery uh doing so

00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,680
still adds you know value you know for

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,120
the teams because they still have one

00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,720
place that they can go to even though we

00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,480
might be getting the data from

00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,000
you know different sources so it's

00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,560
really allowed us to

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,480
uh you know unify a way that we can get

00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,920
access to what all the different teams

00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,519
are doing even if they're all coming

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,079
from different data sources so that's

00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,600
been

00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:25,839
really really valuable for us

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,880
so yeah now what um okay i guess it's

00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:28,480
connecting more

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,320
more sources to the data lake you know

00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,279
if something has an api we can we can

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,560
buy into it

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,399
and if it doesn't we can at least have

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,519
the ability to upload the results from

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,800
offline surveys and in-person surveys

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,160
and any other ad hoc data sets we can

00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,240
kick off initiatives such as

00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,320
gamification

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,759
and gather data as a project goes rather

00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,639
than just trying to

00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,240
you know account for it after the fact

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,160
we can analyze referrals to health

00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,680
clinics based on articles discovered and

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,600
shared on the platforms

00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,240
uh we can spot trends and reactions that

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,959
come up with plans to enhance mitigate

00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,560
or adapt a content strategy

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,399
another benefit of doing like this we

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,680
can craft specific reporting for

00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,040
different audiences

00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,279
you know will this be used for

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,800
communications for technical

00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,160
consideration academic

00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,000
uh editorial or other readers

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,560
can we apply machine learning to these

00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,360
data sets as well for positive outcomes

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,880
concepts such as social listening um

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,120
natural language processing and

00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:28,320
sentiment analysis

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,040
so you can yeah really use your

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,839
imagination see this platform is

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,800
you know a way to enable new ideas a

00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:38,800
place where we can

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,000
grow new ideas and test it out um

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,680
you know and but seeing that we have

00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,279
such a powerful tool in our fingertips

00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,320
we always need to be careful how it's

00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,759
used so we have to

00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,639
you know comply with regulatory

00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,040
requirements uh gdpr any other rules

00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,720
that

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,880
you know affect us in any of the regions

00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,480
where we are so internally we have a

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,079
data safety checklist

00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,000
that we can document and track the steps

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,519
that lead to us collecting data from any

00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,839
of these data points

00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,519
a data catalog that can track and look

00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,360
at the changes of all the data assets

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,720
within the data lake so we know what we

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,280
have

00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,240
um you know we can control who has

00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,880
access to

00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,480
all the different data sets the policies

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,919
it's encrypted when it's in transit and

00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,280
when it's in rest

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,360
and we don't store any personally

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,760
identifiable information and we have a

00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:23,919
known life cycle and the reason why we

00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,199
you know behind why we collect uh what

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,559
we do and why

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,400
we want to ensure high standards of

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,200
ownership for the data and its ethical

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,799
use for social good as well so we have a

00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,360
duty of care not only to the readers and

00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,200
the

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,120
users of the platform but the authors as

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,120
well so you know some of these people

00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,799
are writing in more restricted settings

00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,120
and their security is of course

00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,120
important for us um while we're here you

00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,960
know engineering is in a safer setting

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,160
so we're always mindful of that

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,720
as well yeah so hopefully i'll be able

00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,400
to show you

00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,760
just a brief overview of how a blended

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,559
team

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,039
in the netherlands and worldwide can

00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,720
assist

00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,960
through an adaptive model readers and

00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,559
users of platforms in various countries

00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,559
how they can be empowered

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,240
to make choices about their health and

00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:07,360
life outcomes the whole team is really

00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,200
proud of the work and

00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,880
we hope this platform can empower more

00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:12,559
communities around the world and

00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,080
you know it all started with some drupal

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,440
sites and we really um you know happy

00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,160
that that's still at the core of what we

00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,720
do

00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,559
um i'm happy to take any questions i've

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,360
only got a couple of minutes but um yeah

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,640
i hope it was

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:29,840
interesting and an informative session

00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,840
for you guys

00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,120
okay do you have something like an

00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,880
identifier over all data sources to

00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,679
stitch data together or is it more about

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,440
having

00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,520
the data in parallel as shown in the

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,520
dashboard um

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:54,559
you know we you know that's quite a

00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,919
broad question um yeah we do have some

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,240
some common points we know where the

00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,840
platforms have come from and we have

00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,320
like i said these taxonomies anything

00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,559
that's been

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,400
shared on the network uh we you know the

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,440
tags that it's been shared with

00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,760
um so it's really up to

00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,200
um you know some kind of creative sequel

00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,480
that you can work out different ways of

00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,799
joining the data

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,520
um so yeah that's that's a tough one i

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,600
can try and

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,559
get back to you on that career to give

00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:25,840
you a little bit more information

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,840
um any other chats or questions

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,360
recent

00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:39,919
okay cool well um yeah thanks for coming

00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:41,679
along and appreciate your feedback

00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,440
and any other questions you might have

00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,880
i'm popping through and i'll be

00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,360
um you know happy to go a little bit

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:51,039
deeper on it i'd like to

00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:54,000
