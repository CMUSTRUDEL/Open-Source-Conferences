Title: MAKERS & BUILDERS - The Evolving Charts Ecosystem   DrupalCon Europe 2020
Publication date: 2021-01-21
Playlist: DrupalCon Europe 2020
Description: 
	The Evolving Charts Ecosystem In our experience, users are increasingly seeking solutions for analyzing and visualizing data on the web. While the Charts module makes it easy for site builders to create fully-featured charts, users often want more features than those available out-of-the-box.

[Music]

00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,920
so

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,760
welcome everyone to the evolving charts

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,439
ecosystem

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,519
presentation and i am daniel catherine

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,599
i'm a technical advisor and drupal

00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,320
portfolio manager at jon snow

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,840
incorporated and i'm also the charts

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,840
module maintainer

00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:38,559
yeah i am nia cartoni i'm an analyst at

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,960
the university of guelph and i also work

00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,600
with

00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,320
uh with danielle on some various

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,399
projects

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,399
which includes chart the chart module

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,760
so the ecosystem concept came about in

00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,039
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,640
as a issue on drupal.org

00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,000
and basically the idea is that

00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,039
maintainers can edit their project pages

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and assign their module ecosystem

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,360
when their module is primarily intended

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,400
to

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,720
enhance another module on drupal.org

00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,320
and you can find which modules are part

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,640
of an ecosystem by

00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,240
adding slash ecosystem at the end of a

00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,360
drupal.org project url

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,840
so for example drupal.org project

00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,840
charts slash ecosystem

00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,159
so for this presentation we're expanding

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,640
the definition of ecosystem a little bit

00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,600
as an organizing principle on drupal.org

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,960
we love

00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,640
how the eco system concept works but for

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,280
us we think it's also important to

00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,680
include

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,040
the modules that charts interfaces with

00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,000
or enhances

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,680
such as commerce layout builder views

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,600
web form

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,000
and we also think it's important to

00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,520
include third party charting providers

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
that actually generate the charts

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,719
so why are we talking about this today

00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,960
well

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,799
charts is for dataviz but dataviz is a

00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,879
whole field of study

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,560
and we could never have the charts

00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,640
module

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,360
by itself handling all the different use

00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,040
cases that people might have

00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,800
the charts module is built to be

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,200
extended it has

00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,800
five charting libraries that are

00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,599
incorporated as sub-modules

00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,640
and you can create your own charting

00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:31,840
library sub-module for charts

00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,920
we also wanted to make sure that

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,760
you know users of the charts modules can

00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,480
find other modules that will help

00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,879
them with their different use cases and

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,680
we

00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,440
also wanted to encourage contribution to

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,720
the charts ecosystem as well as other

00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,720
ecosystems on drupal

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,400
now that we've introduced the concept a

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,959
little bit we wanted to run through some

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,360
demos

00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,040
where we show how different modules can

00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,280
enhance and contribute to the charts

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,120
module

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,239
so for the first one we've categorized

00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,040
this as modules for manipulating data

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,400
and we're including in this demo of use

00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,879
cumulative field

00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,239
view simple math field and views fields

00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,760
on off

00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,840
and so to start this up i on my demo

00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,599
site i created a content type called

00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,959
training data

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,159
and i added some fields to that content

00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,239
type

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,360
two numeric fields one for the number of

00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,080
attendees and

00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,879
the number of coaches and then a list

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,840
field for

00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,239
the location of the training event and

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,480
then

00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,720
i created a few nodes of that content

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,720
type

00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,120
so we have a little pre-recorded video

00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,200
of this

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,080
and i'll just talk you through what's

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,280
happening so to start off with

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,280
i'm going to create a view

00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:58,239
and this views is often the way that i

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,959
use the charts module

00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,640
in this case the view is going to i'm

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,080
going to call it

00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,840
the training data demo for

00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:14,400
drupalcon europe and this will be

00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,760
of content of the type training data

00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,759
and in this case i'm going to create a

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,079
page

00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,280
i recommend with charts that you start

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:26,479
off with an unformatted list of fields

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,960
because the charts display needs a data

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,120
field

00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,919
which won't usually be available when

00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,680
you first create your review

00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,880
and with this one i didn't need a pager

00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,880
because there's only four nodes

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,560
so the first thing i'm going to do is

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,720
i'm going to add the fields from my

00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,160
content type training data

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,160
there were three of them that are

00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,880
important attendees coaches

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,880
and location

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,000
one thing i always recommend for charts

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,600
is you create a label for the fields

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,600
that you're going to plot

00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,000
so that that label can be used in your

00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,680
charts legend

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,400
so that was for attendees this one is

00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,400
for coaches

00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,759
and then location and when i was

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,680
creating the demo

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,080
i hesitated on this one a bit i decided

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:16,320
to exclude it from display

00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,400
and then i'm going to rearrange the

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,440
fields

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:24,240
so that location is before title

00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,240
and then in the title field i'm going to

00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,280
add the location

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:31,199
on to the end of the title using the

00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:34,720
replacement patterns

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,600
so i'm just grabbing the twig token

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,720
and then rewriting the results here so

00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,440
it's title

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,440
followed by the location in parentheses

00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,039
and when i preview this you can see

00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,160
training event four for example took

00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,680
place in europe

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,759
had 56 attendees and two coaches

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,160
so now i can change my display to a

00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,800
chart

00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,280
and i decided to use high charts for

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,400
this

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,639
and align display the label field is

00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,000
your x-axis label

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,600
and then this table

00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,479
shows you which fields you can select

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,759
for your y-axis

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,000
in this case i just want to show

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,479
attendees to start off with

00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,600
then i'm going to add some configuration

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,840
so i want to include a chart title

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,880
this is actually part of the the

00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,240
javascript

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:34,000
chart that's generated and

00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:37,280
um so i

00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,680
place my legend and then i'm also adding

00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,440
labels for the x and y axes

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,840
so as soon as i apply this and then

00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,199
scroll down to preview

00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,880
you can see a chart's already been

00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,520
created but i'm noticing that

00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,919
europe and canada and u.s those

00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,599
locations are on the horizontal axis

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:58,720
it means i selected the wrong label

00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,560
field so i'm switching it to title

00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,840
and now when i preview it this is what i

00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,840
was expecting

00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,680
so now we're going to get into the other

00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,400
modules so the first thing is i'm going

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,440
to add

00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,919
a simple math field this

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,800
field coming from the view simple math

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,910
field module

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,000
allows you to

00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:21,039
[Music]

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,240
create formulas within your view and in

00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,199
this case what i'm going to do

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,639
is i'm going to take the value of the

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,840
coaches field

00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,000
divide it by the value of the attendees

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,639
field

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,639
and multiply it by 100 to get a percent

00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,520
and then i realized i wanted to put a

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,520
label on this so

00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:46,319
i'm just going to call it percent

00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,400
once you've added a field then you still

00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,479
need to go back to your chart settings

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:58,400
and then add that field to your chart

00:07:52,479 --> 00:08:01,280
so just picking a color for that now

00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,160
and after i apply it's available down

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,960
below

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,160
so you can see there's the percent there

00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,879
and then the number

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,879
in the green line

00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:15,120
so that was view simple math field now

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,680
i'm going to add views cumulative field

00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,360
so with this field it allows you to

00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,639
select a field that you want

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:24,720
a cumulative value

00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,000
to be generated for so in this case i

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,800
want the number of attendees

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,919
to be shown over time so if i have four

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,000
events

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:34,159
by the fourth event i want to see what

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,240
the total number is

00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,640
and again i have to add this field into

00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,479
the charts

00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,800
so that one i'm going to create as a

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,800
purple

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,519
line and so now when i scroll down you

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,920
can see

00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,360
each event has about 50 participants so

00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,360
all together it's around 200

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,560
and so the next thing i'm going to do is

00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:02,080
i'm going to include a views field

00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,760
on off field um which

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,760
it took me a while to remember what i

00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,480
was doing here but this

00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:14,399
is a views field handler that

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,399
works like an exposed filter

00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,760
so you'll see this how it works in a

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:21,680
second but i'm adding the field

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,200
and then the fields there you can select

00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,360
which fields you want

00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,360
the view to display

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:33,519
and down below you can also see

00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,760
the exposed selection field type so you

00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,560
can make it check boxes radios single or

00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,560
multi-select

00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,200
this one i'm not adding to the chart

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,720
and ajax is helpful for it i think now

00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,200
you can see up in the exposed filter

00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,600
section that field shows up

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:55,200
and if i click just show attendees then

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,360
it only shows the attendees the other

00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,519
two lines disappear

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,440
and if i select others they show up as

00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,920
well

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,959
so now i'm going to actually add an

00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,440
exposed filter

00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,000
for the location field which was a list

00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,000
type field

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,920
and so i'm exposing it

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,320
and applying so now in the exposed

00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,640
filters section we have

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,120
these field on off and the location if i

00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,040
filter it for europe and apply

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,079
it goes down to the two events that were

00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,079
both created in europe

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,680
so that's the demo for that one and i'm

00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,360
going to turn it over to nia

00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:40,480
to demo the

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,480
integration with commerce

00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,519
so um at this point uh on this one i

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,920
actually started

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:54,800
using uh the module api

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,320
to render the integration with drupal

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,560
commerce and then i

00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,760
quite realized that uh most of the

00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,680
default repo

00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,360
drupal commerce reports are actually

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,640
using views

00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:09,360
where i went and directly created the

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:12,959
views attachment

00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:15,440
instead of using uh the

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,480
the code which actually really make it

00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,320
easier

00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,920
and then so like if you you check the

00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,360
settings i created the

00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,279
column using the google chart library

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,560
and then choose the one field which was

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,480
the number of butchers which

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,079
was already like something we most of

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,560
these fields come default when you

00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,360
install

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,480
drupal commerce reports so if you have

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,000
orders

00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,480
you will just have to add this

00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
attachment with the same settings as the

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,920
normal page and attach it to page

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,440
and for example you can also select to

00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,839
inherit all the

00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,720
uh filters which going to be applied to

00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,760
that

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,880
to that view

00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:59,360
then from here if you view again

00:11:54,880 --> 00:12:02,560
for example this the cells it also comes

00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,279
i choose to go with the daily uh daily

00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,720
cells

00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:09,760
which had some few data and it was also

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,519
the same approach where again

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:16,639
i went with views created in a church

00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,880
daily attachment

00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,839
and then this also there was a existing

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,279
data i didn't

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,639
change anything and like at some point i

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,880
say yeah let me just change

00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:33,040
maybe the chart uh chart type settings

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,040
which was like i choose this calculator

00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,519
and i didn't i left most of these

00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,920
settings to be default

00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,240
and it's created like uh the starter

00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,240
chart

00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:53,839
and then after this i made sure that it

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,839
was attracted to daily

00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:10,720
shirts and from there you can

00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,440
see that uh it's just this probably so

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,000
like i think

00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,839
if we can say one of the main thing the

00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,560
main good thing with charts

00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,560
it has many good points you which make

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,800
it easier to use and to integrate it

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,959
with your even your existing data

00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,040
without you having to create for example

00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,160
like as the previous uh

00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,639
uh demo by daniel where you had to

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,680
create

00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,600
the uh the content type which is good if

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,279
you have some particular use case

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,519
but with this case we just demonstrate

00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:43,680
that with even drupal commerce

00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,720
you can just add it as to your ecosystem

00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,279
of modules

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,079
and it's gonna work out of the box

00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:53,360
without you writing any code

00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:57,600
i'm gonna pass it back to dany

00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:00,240
thanks nia the next demo that we have

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:02,160
i described it as modules for research

00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,880
and this one includes the web form

00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,000
module

00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:08,959
webform views module and layout builder

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,760
so to start this one off i created a web

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,199
form

00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:15,120
that i call drupalcon europe demo survey

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,720
it only has two different questions one

00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,160
is to rate the session

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,079
and then another one is would you

00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:22,480
recommend this session it's a yes or no

00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,480
question

00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,800
and another video for you

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:34,000
so with this one i um i have a

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,079
content type that uses layout builder

00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,839
and it's set up so that

00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,519
every individual node can have its own

00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,639
layout

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:46,399
and so what i did here was

00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,399
i just went in and i added a block

00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,839
search for web form

00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:57,199
added it was

00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:02,000
a little bit confused for a second

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:04,800
and figured out then that i needed to um

00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,920
it was that the web form field here was

00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,600
an autocomplete

00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,079
so as soon as i figured that out this

00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,079
was easy

00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,480
selected the drupalcon europe demo

00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,680
survey that i created

00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,680
and added the block

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,240
so you can see that previewed there then

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:27,440
i decided to add a section of

00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:31,040
two columns

00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:33,759
and once i added this section then

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,600
i added a view that i created so i

00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,680
created

00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,759
a demo survey data view with two

00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,240
displays and so i'm adding the first

00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,240
display

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,279
which is a pie chart of the ratings

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,000
provided by

00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,800
the attendees and then i have a second

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
one that i created

00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:59,120
that is whether or not users or

00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:04,639
attendees recommended the

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:04,639
presentation so saving my layout

00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,040
and you can see i've just very quickly

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,600
created

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,560
a sort of dashboard so you see the

00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,480
ratings and

00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,839
recommendations there and then if i

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,800
actually complete the form

00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,560
again so you can see that four star

00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,560
rating is 40 percent

00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:28,079
below and when i submit this form

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,079
and then return back to the page

00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,839
the data are refreshed and you can see

00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,240
now instead of 40

00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,560
it's 50 gave the presentation a

00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,079
four-star rating

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,399
so as you can see that was extremely

00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,160
easy and i'm sure you can think of lots

00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:51,839
of different use cases

00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,839
for something like that

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,839
okay um

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,680
yeah so you've seen the presentation now

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,440
and

00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,079
you may be thinking well how can i join

00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,000
the charts ecosystem

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,000
one way is that if you are a module

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,039
maintainer you can add your module

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,520
project to the chart's ecosystem or you

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,600
can

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,640
create a ticket so that the maintainer

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,760
of the module

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,199
adds charts as a as the ecosystem for

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,919
that module

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,199
you can also support charts ecosystem

00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,360
modules especially

00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,360
documentation some of the ones that we

00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,039
listed would be great if someone wrote

00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,360
up some documentation about how this

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:36,000
integration can happen

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,400
and it's also great if you have the

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
skills to contribute to some of the open

00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,080
source charting libraries that the

00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,840
charts module uses

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,840
such as chart.js billboard.js and c3.js

00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,160
and then we've provided some links so

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,679
there's a link to the charts ecosystem

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,600
on drupal.org

00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,360
there's an open collective that supports

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,640
development of the charts ecosystem

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,039
modules

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,760
and then the three open source

00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,679
third-party

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,200
charting libraries i mentioned the

00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,520
github links are there

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:10,000
and if you're interested in charts

00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,919
there's a mid camp 2020 presentation

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,160
on creating charts without having to do

00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:17,280
any coding

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,880
so thank you for your interest

00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,280
and we're happy to take questions at

00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,280
this point

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:32,559
okay thank you very much daniel and

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,360
uh nia um we do have one question from

00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:36,400
micah

00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,360
um is there a concept to handle security

00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,400
coverage

00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,720
for third party libraries

00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,240
via composer and presumably that's using

00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,640
composer to

00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,640
pull them in uh i'm not quite sure

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:55,520
yeah that's a great question um

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:58,320
we are trying to stay on top of updates

00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,120
for um when you know when there are

00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,480
updates to

00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:05,039
any of those um it would be great

00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,600
we don't really have a great mechanism

00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,880
for

00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,880
um keeping those up to date

00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:14,799
the charts module itself recommends

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,760
specific versions

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,600
but you can use composer to update the

00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,679
libraries that you use for charts at any

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,559
point

00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,360
we also recommend that if you see any

00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:29,280
security issues for those that you

00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,799
create a security ticket for it and then

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,960
we would issue a

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,559
drupal security update for the charts

00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,559
module

00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:40,480
i would actually suggest if if you're

00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,840
if you want some ideas of what's

00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,039
possible at least i

00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:50,080
i can't say good practice or not but

00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:52,720
i think it's good um the web 4 module

00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,919
does quite a lot in that regard uh

00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:57,200
including

00:19:53,919 --> 00:20:01,039
a drush command that automatically

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:04,880
um spits out the relevant

00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:08,720
uh things to add to a composer.json

00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:12,159
um uh to to to add your charts in

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,400
so your libraries in so have a look at

00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:17,440
web form basically

00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,440
