00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,840
and i have a curiosity to share with you

00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,000
i'm a coffee lover and i have more than

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,560
three ways to make coffee at home

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,040
and in this coffee situation it really

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,119
was a support for me

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,759
and hello i'm ashley hazel i'm head of

00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,960
digital technology for hogarth worldwide

00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,400
and conversely to

00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,320
lara i only have the one way to make

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,320
coffee at home but i don't drink coffee

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,520
anyway

00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,360
back over to you lara so i'm gonna

00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,159
initially take you through the

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,880
background and the contest about nasa

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,960
waters

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,799
and the drupal masterization program

00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,960
that we set in place

00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,479
and then i will hand over to ashley that

00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,799
will take you through the plus

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:55,360
we took to release the solution the

00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:57,520
personalization engine

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,680
so as you can see in the screen we

00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,079
branded the naswell wireless web program

00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,680
as

00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,640
gaia and the program emerged to provide

00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,439
a structure

00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,119
to meet nestle standards and optimize

00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,160
website releases

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,200
we support 52 water brands in 41

00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,440
countries

00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,599
and there are mainly local business

00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,160
where 44

00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,800
of media investments is online so they

00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,920
need

00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,480
a stable platform and mature

00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,920
what we were aimed to do was be time

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,800
saving cost efficient

00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,440
and provide the technical structure for

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,160
that to

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,319
set and define a central governance team

00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,720
based in swell waters global

00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,000
and we have the mindset and we work in

00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,319
one team approach

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,080
so we have a single agency doing

00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,280
development and technical support that

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:50,800
is schoolgirls agency that is

00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:53,440
co-presenting today here with me

00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,879
on top of the central governments we

00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,319
take

00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:01,680
the approach of a masterization so for

00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:04,959
provide a technical high quality without

00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:06,000
walking flexibility we have a master

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,040
code base

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,680
for nasa aware's websites and that means

00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,680
that

00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,159
all branding websites share one code

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,599
base and same technical perform that is

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,760
rupaul

00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,920
on top of the master code base we also

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,640
follow a component approach

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,040
and for that we create a unique space

00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,440
for

00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,360
designers and creative agencies what we

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,599
call a library or a component repository

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,680
we also brand it that is called eribor

00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,519
it has a lot of

00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,360
beautiful message behind it that i will

00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,799
not export today but we can do it in

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,159
another session

00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:45,360
um and really it was a key success

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,640
because we provide guidance to agencies

00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,440
creative agencies

00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,000
um in the initial phase of the projects

00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,439
so

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,760
if they need any support on wireframe

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,760
production they can always come here

00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,920
and see the specifications to produce

00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,599
the wireframes

00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,400
this was also a tool to promote the

00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,360
mobile development

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,760
so what do we think that was the

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,280
benefits of having this program

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,959
launched on a network wireless

00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,959
environment was

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,519
in fact a benefit for the business

00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,560
because for now we already released 65

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,199
websites

00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,680
and we achieve a quite mature platform

00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,840
based

00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,960
on the approach that we review

00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,919
masterization

00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,800
component approach and also drupal based

00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:35,199
content management solution

00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,520
and that make us face new challenges

00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,479
and uh revise the approach and the ways

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,800
of working so

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,520
from an initial top-down approach to a

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,880
more bottom

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,120
up and including other

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,800
teams journals internals on the decision

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,000
making process

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,360
so the way that we found to

00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,560
uh include all these cross knowledges

00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,919
on the decision making process was

00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:04,960
learn listen

00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:08,000
and learn so we work with the brands and

00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:08,000
understood the needs

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,120
we collect and map so we identified the

00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,600
solutions that were able to

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,320
um answer to that need that in this case

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,880
was

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,280
uh the personalization engine and the

00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,440
need was more related to personalization

00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,600
user experience engagement on site

00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,039
and we engage and transform working with

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,360
internal teams in nasa

00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,320
and also sternal agencies as hoover of

00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,039
course

00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,800
in order to deliver the solution so

00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,160
actually now i will leave the stage for

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,160
you to take us through the path

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,080
sorry we have to have someone that's

00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,600
from you right thank you very much lara

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,160
okay so we all know personalization is a

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,560
journey

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,680
um but it's not always clear that

00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,560
personalization is

00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,400
only as good as your data we find it

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,479
best to describe this journey in the

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:06,400
form of a maturity matrix

00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:09,360
uh in the in the walk phase we have the

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,880
easily accessible data sources so things

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,319
like your geographic location

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,639
what type of device the user is coming

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,160
from and also things we can track like

00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,560
campaign urls or visitor frequency

00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,319
moving into the run phase we begin to

00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,960
apply some logic to that data that we

00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,400
have already

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,080
so we know that someone's been on the

00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,960
site before but what pages have they

00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,280
been to

00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,840
and in what order have they visited them

00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,720
and such like

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,160
and the last phase of the matrix fly

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,039
where we begin to interact

00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:41,919
with external data sources such as crm

00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,919
and mail systems

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,560
why does any of this matter well studies

00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,160
have shown that 75

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,360
of customers will engage better and

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,000
convert better

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,199
if you're recognizing them by name or

00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,599
showing that you know something about

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,800
their

00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,319
purchasing history and showing them

00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,319
relevant content around that

00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,160
so before you start a journey you need

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,880
to understand the landscape

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,440
and through gaia's innovation work

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,919
stream

00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,520
we participate in product committees and

00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,080
ideation sessions

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,360
where brands and markets were showing

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,360
the same need

00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:23,520
personalization but personalization

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,919
that worked with what they already had

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,400
with existing site architecture

00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,160
that could be fast to market and scale

00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,280
whilst being flexible enough to

00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,479
work with the local crm maturity because

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,880
personalization is

00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,759
only as good as your data and

00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,360
importantly

00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,560
something that was familiar and easy to

00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,280
use something with a familiar ui

00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,879
as has already described the gaia

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,120
masterization program

00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,280
is component based and by components

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,199
we're really referring to paragraphs

00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,479
so when you begin to look at the drupal

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,280
ecosystem around

00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,160
personalization what we find is that

00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,800
there was

00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,720
uh smart content blocks a system for

00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,919
managing blocks but not for paragraphs

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,520
which seems to be

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,879
very much the space that most sites are

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,400
in at this time obviously there's a bit

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,360
of an evolution to blocks with layout

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,879
builder

00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,840
but we were looking for for something

00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,840
that would work with paragraphs

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:20,319
we also speak to nestle's uh

00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,080
global marketing sales and sorry

00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:25,680
marketing sales and e-business

00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,720
drupal program called women web web cms

00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:31,599
policies uh webcms who are

00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,399
a really uh broad team with a much

00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:35,120
broader

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,519
customer base and customer need and they

00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,880
had

00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,399
also been looking at this in fact they

00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,479
were the ones that drew our attention to

00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,839
smart content

00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,760
when we start engaging with them around

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,880
this topic but

00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,640
what was really interesting to

00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:47,920
understand is that they were also

00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,680
looking for

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,040
an entry level solution and they were

00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,480
looking at a number of ways of getting

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,920
there whether you would build something

00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,320
from scratch or repurpose something that

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,920
was already in the market

00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,040
so with all of this information all of

00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,399
this feed in from the different

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,160
stakeholders

00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,920
we were able to develop a feature list

00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:09,120
and backlog that would ultimately become

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,519
smart content paragraphs which

00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,000
is what we're here to talk to you about

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,000
today

00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:22,160
as we went through that discovery phase

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,600
we did do some initial concepts as we

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,760
were doing those ideations

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,360
and here on the left you can see um a

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,720
segmentation system we identified very

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,000
early on that we were looking for a

00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,640
reusable

00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,839
segmentation system not something that

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,120
you managed on a variation by variation

00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,320
level and then on the right

00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:43,519
we have the original concepts for

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,920
our smart content paragraph this being

00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,760
a paragraph wrapper that would allow you

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,040
to work with existing paragraphs

00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,440
but also connect the the interaction

00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,120
between

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,800
segments and and the paragraphs

00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,920
themselves

00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,680
so this was the ideation and uh

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,920
this is what we ended up with we have

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,640
smart content segments that was already

00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,360
existing

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,480
as part of this smart content ecosystem

00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,560
and rather fortunately

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,000
very similar to what we had in our

00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,800
ideation creation

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,920
and we have the almost final smart

00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,440
paragraph

00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,360
uh paragraph shown there with

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,120
which you'll know has a default option

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,320
and then variation options

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,560
you will see through this presentation

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,640
at certain points that we have um

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,000
pe variation and that is because this

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,720
was originally called personalization

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,200
engine

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,480
before we converted smart paragraphs so

00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,000
what you see here is that we have

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,680
a default section for what will be shown

00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,160
by no by default

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,040
and then the ability to add variations

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,160
and

00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:46,160
to add content to those variations

00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,800
what does all this look like in practice

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,160
well let's take an extremely quick run

00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,880
through of what it does look like in

00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,880
practice

00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,480
as we go through uh smart content

00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,240
paragraphs demo this looks like a video

00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,560
but actually i work really fast and this

00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,079
is

00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,000
totally live honest so here we have your

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,959
generic journey you come to a homepage

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,560
we have

00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,560
banners about all the flavors that are

00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,680
available on perrier

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,200
the users are visiting something like

00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,560
the peach flavor when they return to the

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,760
homepage they're still seeing those

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,560
generic banners

00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,240
that relate to uh all of the flavors

00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,839
available

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,480
with personalization enabled we'd be

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:22,800
looking to have a slightly adapted

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,000
variation uh sorry experience where here

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,360
we go to the peach flavor

00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,480
and returning to the homepage we're

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,480
going to deep dive into uh

00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,519
content that is more related to that

00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,800
flavor that the

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,600
the user's visited to do this

00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,480
you install our modules you go to con

00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,480
structure sorry

00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,920
and to smart segments where you're able

00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,880
to manage your segments segments are

00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,640
super simple

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,800
you give them a name and you add some

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,160
conditions as you can see here there's

00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,279
some default conditions that fit into

00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,560
that run phase

00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,720
but the really interesting ones actually

00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,440
are segment and group you're able to use

00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,519
segments you've created before as rules

00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,800
in your new segment or to group seg

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,320
rules together to create a really really

00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,519
dynamic systems

00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,560
very simply for the example we're

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,320
showing we're going to look at if

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,320
someone has visited a page in this case

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,800
the peach flavor

00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,760
using autocomplete and there we have our

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,120
segment created

00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:16,880
in just a couple of clicks now to use it

00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,880
we go to content and we have

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,920
a demo landing page here so if we edit

00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,480
that page and add the smart content

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,760
component pe from the original one there

00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,360
and the first thing we have to do

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,880
is to add that default content the

00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,320
default experience we want someone to

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,040
have when they come to the page

00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,079
so as per the examples we've just seen

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,360
generic

00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,720
hero banner with content around all the

00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,480
flavors

00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,560
the next step then is to tie in our

00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,720
segmentation to start using those rules

00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,920
so under the variations field set we're

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,240
able to select

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,760
from one of the segments that's

00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,320
available in this case our peach flavor

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,320
one

00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,000
and begin to add reactions and reactions

00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,279
are the content that you want to show

00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,519
when that segment is matched um you can

00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:02,399
add as many as you want you can add none

00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,079
you can add maybe something that is a

00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,200
product listing or just completely

00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,920
change up your content

00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,720
in this case we're adding the same hero

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,920
banner

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,360
but with peach flavor specific content

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,519
there is the option also to add multiple

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,279
variations and if the user

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,800
matches more than one it will use the

00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,160
waiting system in drupal to

00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,720
figure out which one to show it will

00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,279
only show one reaction

00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,800
so here we are we are on that uh landing

00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,519
page demo as you can see from the url

00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,560
and we have the default content and when

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,920
we go to our

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,600
peach page and browse back to our

00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,880
landing page demo

00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:41,760
we should fingers crossed see our

00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,839
peach content look at that an on the fly

00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:46,839
demo that totally wasn't videoed earlier

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:48,240
that worked just really nicely um

00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,839
awesome

00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:55,680
so with all that in mind we come back

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,279
to our matrix and what we can see there

00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,959
from those options that are available in

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,000
smart content segments

00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:04,639
by default is that we answer all of the

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,320
walk phase in fact we just just make it

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,519
into the run phase slightly i suppose

00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,120
you could say we make it into

00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,440
a slow jog um

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,519
if your site has user login though

00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,680
you're able to extend this very easily

00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,920
to really accelerate yourself into that

00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,120
runs phase

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,240
even further and then of course if your

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,399
your site has reached that level of

00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,040
maturity where you have crm

00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,760
then with crm it's very simple to write

00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,279
plugins

00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:37,519
to connect that data into smart segments

00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:39,600
and you're able at that point to really

00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,639
blossom and be as personalized as

00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,880
possible

00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,000
and really begin to collect data that

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,279
powers you moving

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,399
to a future system such as

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,320
aqueous aqueous lift which i think is

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,920
now acquired personalization

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,040
these are not new concepts if you've

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,880
looked at any of those commercial

00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,680
options before you'll see matrices like

00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,920
this

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,519
this isn't something we've invented here

00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,600
but you can see that smart content

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:07,360
answers the need for this

00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,360
to get you up and running really quickly

00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,279
awesome and back to you lara so

00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,760
where are we where you can find us this

00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:18,160
is uh what we think a relevant

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,000
topic as well to cover today if you have

00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,320
interesting to know more

00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,120
so we are available for all nest

00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,000
labyrinths to reuse the component or the

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,560
smart paragraph

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,480
has actually took us through um so the

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,600
image that you can see in the screen

00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,880
is really related to the nestle global

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,000
repository of

00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,839
components um and aside from that

00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,399
of course we are able to reach on

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:46,000
petrie.com is the demo that you saw

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,399
of 57k visitors per month

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,279
and actually i believe we are somewhere

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,519
else

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,720
also in the word of mouth of our brand

00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,240
managers

00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,240
hi everyone kristy here from nestle

00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,399
waters north america and i couldn't be

00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,519
more excited about our personalization

00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,279
engine

00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,040
personalization is important in media

00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,279
but it's just as important when you get

00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,120
the consumer to your brand website

00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:09,759
with the personalization engine we can

00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,759
now set rules and determine what content

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,480
is shown to which consumers

00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:16,320
it's really important to one further

00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,399
personalization of the consumer journey

00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,519
but also provide a meaningful connection

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,519
to the brand

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,560
it also will hopefully help conversion

00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,560
rates

00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,160
there you go folks uh three presenters

00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,320
for the price of two

00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,240
uh but also probably more interestingly

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,720
i guess to many of our audience is that

00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,000
this is

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:37,120
also since may available on drupal.org

00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,720
currently with 128 websites using it but

00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,720
obviously we would love to see more and

00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,600
we'd love to see your feedback

00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,920
which takes us swiftly on to moving up

00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,360
the

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,680
maturity matrix here we

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,680
have already successfully built the mvp

00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,839
we're in that workspace

00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,279
we're now entering into the next phase

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,519
of planned activity where we

00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:01,279
are looking at more plugins to move

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:04,079
further into that run and fly space

00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,720
we have a backlog for early 2021 which

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,079
we will

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,760
complete and we will continue to

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,160
contribute back to drupal.org

00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,439
not only for smart content paragraphs

00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,520
but as you can see from the screenshot

00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,199
here for other modules in the ecosystem

00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,240
that need to be patched and developed

00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:21,600
to help advance this

00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:24,079
but what we really need is uh

00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,439
for you guys to contribute so please

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,319
search out the module

00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,280
go and give it a try put issues into the

00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,440
issue queue

00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,880
tell us features you think are needed or

00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,280
go and write those plugins

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:38,240
for the segmentation system and help

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:41,280
advance it as well

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,679
and with that i guess it

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,320
is a thank you from us i know it's been

00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,400
very quick

00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,360
a very small time frame to explain a

00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,240
very big

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,600
program in and looking at the poll that

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,760
thank you all of you that

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,160
answered that we actually have a very

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,080
large tech audience

00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,640
this was i guess aimed more at a

00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,360
business audience so hopefully you found

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,880
it interesting

00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:08,880
anyway anything you'd like to add there

00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:12,080
lara no i'm seeing that we are receiving

00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,559
some questions so i believe we can we

00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:16,640
can

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:18,480
bring up some of them and try to respond

00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,480
at least in the time frame that we have

00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,360
the ones that we are not able to respond

00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,760
we can connect

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,200
after and actually we can also i will

00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,400
require your support

00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,440
in some of them so um we have one

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,840
question there is

00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,640
are there are there any issues with the

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,200
caching or

00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,480
translation can you support me on this

00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,320
one actually

00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,559
yes absolutely so in terms of caching

00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,320
because of the way the content is loaded

00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:47,120
to the page there is performance

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,640
degradation if you use it too much we're

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,320
looking to re-engineer this actually to

00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,600
use ajax but right now

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,080
all of the content is delivered to the

00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,400
page and it's using javascript to

00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,200
do the detection and to swap out the

00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,880
content

00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,559
so there is no caching issues whatsoever

00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,720
um and i see there was questions also

00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,919
around cdn and varnish and whatnot

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,919
all of these things are running in front

00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,520
of the nestle stack and there

00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,840
we've seen no issues in that space so

00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,840
far

00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,720
i also see a question here about how

00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,559
does smart content affect

00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,480
seo so far we haven't seen

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,320
any significant impact because that

00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,760
default content is well it's rendered

00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,760
and cached at the first pass

00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,240
so your seo is based off your default

00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,520
content and then enhanced as i said with

00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,000
javascript

00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,880
as you move forward another question

00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,360
that i'm seeing

00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,919
here and is from nick how does it work

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,039
with the

00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,440
layout builder so yes layout builder a

00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,480
very

00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,400
uh interesting topic at this time

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,400
being paragraphs smart content

00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,120
paragraphs it doesn't work with layout

00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,520
builder

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,200
however smart content that core module

00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,600
of the smart content ecosystem that

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,760
we've

00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,679
uh looked to extend is originally

00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,720
designed for blocks and so that should

00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,880
work with layout builder

00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,400
very well it's not something we've tried

00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,360
and certainly smart segments works with

00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,360
smart blocks as well

00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:09,679
so i would think hopefully very well

00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,039
and we have here one that i believe you

00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,919
already mentioned the

00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,000
seo part but i think it's also a little

00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,960
bit more deep because it's from sarah

00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,960
pizarro

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,080
how does the smart content segmentation

00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,679
effect seo

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,799
and do they count as hiding content

00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,240
so as hidden content no it doesn't count

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,400
as hidden content

00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,320
um could we talk a bit about the

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,640
segmentation since we have

00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,320
a few minutes um actually i believe

00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,120
we'll cover in the demo but

00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,559
could you recap that part so we have all

00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,760
of five seconds before i think someone's

00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,760
going to shout at us but the

00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:47,760
segmentation um is really a list of

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,960
rules and it is that smart paragraph or

00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,440
smart blocks if you're using layout

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,640
builder

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,280
that handles display uh off your content

00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,280
um and that whilst it is all shown we've

00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,640
not seen any detrimental impact to seo

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,240
at all and as i say

00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,000
default content is what your seo should

00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,240
be seeing and you should bypass

00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,200
caching with the javascript uh doing

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,559
that swap out

00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,320
for you okay thank you actually i

00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,480
believe we are running out of time

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,919
perina i don't know if you want to

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,280
introduce yeah yeah thank you very much

00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,280
ashley and nara for

00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:24,320
such an interesting presentation um

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,720
so yeah we're gonna um

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,840
start with the second session for this

00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,039
um

00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:34,320
time slot uh so i'm gonna welcome a

00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,919
pratik and a catcher um

00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,840
we will drop off thank you very much

00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,559
thank you very much everyone for your

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,720
