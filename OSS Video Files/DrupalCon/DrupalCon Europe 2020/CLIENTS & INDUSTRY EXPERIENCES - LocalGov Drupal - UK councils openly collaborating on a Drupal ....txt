openly collaborating on a drupal

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:40,160
distribution with public funding

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,040
um there are a couple of polls in the in

00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,440
in the session

um so if you if you can fill those in

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,320
that'd be great just to get a bit of an

00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,239
idea of the audience what type of work

00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,960
you do and what role you perform in in

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,320
your work

00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,719
i'll share the results of that as they

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,440
as they come in through the session um

00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,879
and yeah let's get going um a little

00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,760
background or sort of overview of the

00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,960
session we're going to just do

00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,280
introductions in a second

00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,320
uh look at why it's happening look at

00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,680
how it started

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,280
a little bit around the discovery and

00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,080
alpha phases that have been going on

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,360
this year

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,119
have a look at what the distribution

00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,760
offers now and where we're going next

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,799
year

00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,960
a few examples of local gov in the wild

00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,040
already in use and then hopefully how

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,880
you can help and get involved

00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,040
um the slides are available in the

00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,240
session there's some links in in

00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,720
in the discussion and uh bitly local gov

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,799

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,000
intros i'm finn lewis i

00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,079
am a technical director and drupal

00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,320
developer at agile collective

00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:42,320
based in oxford the uk i've been working

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,000
with drupal since 2006

00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,000
and i've been coming to dupucon since

00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,560
paris 2009 which seems like a

00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,240
terribly long time ago now um this is

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,640
quite weird having a duplicate remotely

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,880
but

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,159
i really did enjoy yesterday so um so

00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,360
yeah looking forward to the rest of it

00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,880
um

00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,640
uh i've always had a passion for open

00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,399
source technologies specifically in the

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,119
in the public sector and non-profit

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,640
sectors

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,799
uh but also for collaboration and

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,439
cooperativism um agile collective is a

00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,520
co-owned

00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,200
worker co-op so all the people who work

00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,800
at agile collective own it as well so

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,400
this spirit of collaboration is is

00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,640
strong with us and um

00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,640
and it's been great to work with uh with

00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,480
councils in the uk to collaborate and

00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,000
bring some of our learning to that um

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,160
i'm phil lewis on drupal.org

00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,280
and uh finn lewis on twitter feel free

00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,879
to get in touch

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,840
uh at any time um so local gov dreamful

00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,680
what is it

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,440
it's the drupal distribution for uk

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,519
councils um for anyone who doesn't know

00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,200
a dreamful distribution is a packaged

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,959
um set of drupal with with uh code and

00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,120
out of the box uh configuration to do a

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,200
particular a particular task

00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,560
um in this case its aim is to share

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,879
drupal code uh and

00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,920
also collaborate on best practice uh for

00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:49,360
for uk councils

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,519
specifically for publishing website

00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,760
content we're not looking at any other

00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,800
complexities just yet um just for the

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,599
the public facing

00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,560
websites um so yeah out of the box the

00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,840
council can install

00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,319
uh which council's developers can

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,959
install uh localgov do for distribution

00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,200
and it provides a bunch of content types

00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,120
um it provides the default theme

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,599
it provides a bunch of paragraph types

00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,800
and some admin and ux improvements

00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,319
so that's just a high level kind of

00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,680
overview of what it does we're going to

00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,640
more detail

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,920
throughout the presentation um so why

00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,920
why has it happened where does it come

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,720
from uh why now

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,200
so i think it all started with brighton

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,280
hove

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,120
city council really um brighton hove is

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,040
a council on the south coast of

00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:35,760
of the uk in 2017-18 they developed

00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,799
um a drupal 8 website um they worked

00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,120
with

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,319
clear left who's a strategy organization

00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,519
on user research and information

00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,080
architecture to really

00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,840
use evidence-based uh design patterns

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,080
they worked with miguel and alec moogle

00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,799
on drupal architecture uh to really just

00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,400
you know

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,920
um build it in the right way from a

00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,480
drupal perspective and they developed a

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,159
really good

00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,720
duplicate website um this chap is also

00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,400
partially to to blame or or responsible

00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,959
uh will callahan delivery manager at

00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,720
croydon

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,400
council uh feel free to get in touch

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,120
with him on email or at willgov on

00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,519
twitter

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,560
um he previously worked at brighton

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,480
hover city council

00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,680
uh whilst this uh the drupal 8

00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,760
development was was

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,200
was in flight but before that he was at

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,239
the government digital service

00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,680
in in the uk of uk uh helping to

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,479
establish best practices and digital

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,160
services

00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,160
across across the uk government so he

00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,040
had a lot of uh great experience to

00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,479
bring to the

00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,240
move to the table at brighton hove um

00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,759
as mentioned he's now at croydon city

00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,000
council um

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,320
you may remember uh drupal con london

00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,479
was actually in croydon in 2012 i think

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,520
um so uh you know a few years later

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,199
coyden actually

00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,800
jumped on the drupal wagon which is

00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,759
great um and yeah

00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,960
in in in 2017-18 according council um

00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,040
asked will to help them

00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,639
build a duplicate site his experience at

00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,840
brighton obviously led him to say

00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,240
let's not do this again let's not

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,919
reinvent wheels and uh to cut a long

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,680
story short between

00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,199
negotiations and liaison between

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,400
brighton and hove and coyden

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,840
managed to broker an agreement where

00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,280
they started collaborating and

00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,680
essentially croydon shared all of the

00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,199
code

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,960
and all of the learning from brighton

00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,080
hove and built their website in much

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:10,240
less time

00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,680
so sharing code but also sharing the

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,039
experience and the learning

00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,960
and the decisions around information

00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,440
architecture and and other other

00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,800
other stuff so um about four months to

00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,400
get to initial release for croydon

00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,000
compared to about 12 months for

00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,199
brighton so the code sharing and the

00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,880
experience sharing really worked for the

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,120
two councils

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,080
um so if it can work for two councils

00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,120
what about the rest of them there's

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,919
quite a few councils in the uk 408 i

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,840
think

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,960
um and council websites are not that

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,440
different um

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,720
this is an example of of six of the same

00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,720
pages from from different council

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,479
websites the council tax page

00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,639
uh council tax in the uk is the tax you

00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,960
pay to your local council or

00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,400
um to uh for things like policing and

00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,280
rubbish collection and you know local

00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,639
taxes

00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,400
and you can see they're all very similar

00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,360
um for good reason they they should be

00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,360
they're providing the same kind of

00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,360
services the same kind of information to

00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,560
to their residents um in fact should

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,240
they be different at all

00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,680
there's maybe an argument that they

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,479
don't need to be different

00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:05,120
um so there's obviously a potential to

00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,360
to

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,120
to scale out and collaborate collaborate

00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,600
this um collaborate on

00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,360
on website production um the business

00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,080
case is is the other side you know what

00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,280
about the money

00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,639
um so so according definitely save time

00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,199
and money on their build

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,080
um they you know a third of the time uh

00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,840
in which

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,759
developer time and people time you know

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,240
definitely cost savings there

00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,440
um saving money on license fees uh if

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,039
you're using a proprietary system

00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,720
obviously using an open source system is

00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,560
gonna save money but also even if you

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,000
are already using drupal

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,680
there are other systems that councils

00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
use such as directories and

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,199
and other other publishing systems which

00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,360
drupal can actually

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,960
remove the need for so license fee

00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,560
savings there

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,319
collaboration on new features is another

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,080
clear clear win

00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,680
um we've already seen it with brighton

00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,919
and hove and croydon where

00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,199
they had their sites but uh i think

00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:56,720
brighton was

00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,919
developing a new directories feature and

00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,960
coyden could just take that feature and

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,000
use it because they were on the same

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,080
code base

00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,120
um not having to to to redevelop the

00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,199
same thing

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,319
um but the last point though is it's

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,280
perhaps slightly more interesting better

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,960
content and

00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,199
more accessible content really leading

00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,199
to uh to a better experience for

00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,960
for end users and therefore a reduction

00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,080
in calls a reduction in emails a

00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,199
reduction in people trying to find

00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,120
information that they can find

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,120
themselves if the content's written well

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,319
and if it's presented accessibly and if

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,000
it's you know presented in

00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,000
a logical and structured information

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,599
architecture this idea of channel shift

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,840
moving people away from

00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,720
phones and emails which take humans to

00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,880
respond to

00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,400
and into self-service um uh getting

00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,400
information

00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,000
um so lots of lots of sort of potential

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,080
for the for the business case there

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,360
in the early days this was um very much

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:44,720
an estimate

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:48,400
um without any any hard evidence um

00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,360
but uh yeah about 3 million pounds 3.3

00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,000
million euros

00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,280
based on 10 councils sharing um and

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,639
doing the same thing that croydon and

00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,400
brighton did

00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,840
so this is you know early a lot more

00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,560
fact last year probably that we were

00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,160
looking at

00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:03,919
that kind of figure um not instantial

00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,520
so so then where did it go from there

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,520
how did we start

00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,240
well the ministry of housing communities

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:13,280
and local government or mhclg for short

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,160
uh is a central government uh department

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:18,319
or ministry established in 2006

00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,759
and more recently in 2018 they

00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,960
established the local digital

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,960
declaration which

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,319
you can read on that on that link it's

00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,000
an interesting document if you like this

00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,800
kind of thing

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,680
and really it's a call to arms for for

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,399
public sector

00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,839
organizations to uh to you know to start

00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,279
doing digital better to promote best

00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,000
practice across the

00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,599
across the local government sector to um

00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,159
to really start a culture shift and a

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:42,640
technology

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,680
shift for the better based on lots of

00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,040
the learnings that

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,440
came out of the government digital

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,080
service um over the last 10 years

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,959
um if you scroll down that that document

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,360
that page

00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:55,279
you'll see it's very much a a commitment

00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,800
from the leaders and the politicians and

00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,200
the people who run the

00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,600
the councils in the local government um

00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,920
to to to sign up to this and and commit

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,560
to

00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,920
you know to reusing existing user

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,360
research these are just three key points

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,760
i've pulled out actually

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,640
reuse existing user research and common

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,760
components

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,760
rather than creating your own um to

00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,120
look for opportunities for reuse and

00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,279
collaboration with others

00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,040
so not just working in isolation but

00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,279
actually trying to collaborate across

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,080
organizations and perhaps most

00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,720
excitingly from

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,399
my perspective is you must operate

00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,440
according to the technology code of

00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,560
practice

00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,480
which links through to a central

00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,839
government gds government digital

00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,480
service again

00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,040
document the technology code of practice

00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,000
a 12

00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,600
point guide to doing digital well

00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,880
basically doing doing digital projects

00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,600
and programs well

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,160
um a lot of it's quite obvious and

00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,000
probably

00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,680
sensible to people like us but for

00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,560
public sector it's great to have this

00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,160
sort of enshrined point one being uh

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,600
defining the user needs

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,279
point two being making things accessible

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,720
and inclusive which these days is a

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,560
legal requirement anyway and

00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,959
rightly so but point three being you

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,040
know be open source and use open source

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,800
so there's really a commitment here to

00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,200
to do it in the right way but also

00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,880
to do it openly to share to build on the

00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,360
on on the building blocks of open source

00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,079
and to

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,279
republish it back out as open source and

00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,800
this commitment has already been signed

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,920
by 240

00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,360
um councils and uk local authorities and

00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,079
public sector organizations

00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,519
that's over half of the councils i think

00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:29,760
based on 408

00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:31,760
councils in the uk um so this is a great

00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,360
baseline for for a budding default

00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,920
distribution to come into and

00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,680
and and you know uh tap into this um

00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,079
this this movement this this

00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,440
evolution of pressure towards uh working

00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,760
in the open

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,959
um the next the local digital fund is is

00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,120
the next part of the puzzle that fell

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,200
into place

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,720
off the back of this declaration the

00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,959
mhclg

00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,000
put the local digital fund together over

00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,240
the last two years

00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,360
to commit up to seven and a half million

00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,120
pounds

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,200
for digital skills training but also for

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,720
collaborative projects

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,320
such as this and you can see perhaps

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,640
where this is going

00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,079
so the discovery phase was started in

00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,920
january and

00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,200
julie was funded by the ministry of

00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,440
housing communities and local government

00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,519
so thank you mhclg for

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,640
for supporting the project um it really

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,959
did help to uh

00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,880
help to kick-start it um i'll talk a

00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:24,320
little bit about what happened there

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,000
um yeah january to march uh 2020. we

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,200
looked at four main questions uh

00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,200
at that point um firstly is the code and

00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,600
configuration shareable um so

00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,880
did the work that had been provided by

00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,279
croydon and brighton that they were

00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,040
sharing

00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,959
is that work actually shareable you know

00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,800
out to other other organizations and

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,720
and how much work do we need to do to to

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,079
refactor it

00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,320
can we find a governance model for a

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,760
collaboration so

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,360
two councils collaborating is one thing

00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,519
but what about four 10

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,120
20 50 100 how can we actually have a

00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,320
governance model around collaborating

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,760
uh you know on a on a shared product um

00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,839
is there a real user need will other

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,680
councils join or is this just unique to

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,959
brighton and croydon uh really need to

00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,000
to get to the bottom of that

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,360
um through further user research and uh

00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,279
is there a business case

00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,560
can we make this sustainable is there

00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,120
you know enough of a business case that

00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,800
we can

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,320
find ways to to keep this going long

00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,560
term which of course is is

00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,120
critical for any open source project and

00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:22,160
especially a drupal distribution

00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,760
so we put together a a team

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:29,839
um led by will callahan at croydon

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,959
including um dxw uh dxw's urt errol on

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,839
product management and

00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,680
john waterworth on research uh we had a

00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,320
lawyer an ip and licensing

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,000
uh open source expert andrew katz um one

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,920
of the uk's uh leading

00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,040
open source licensing experts from

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,800
moorcroft

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,240
um i led on the technical side from

00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,079
agile collective with aaron on the

00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,079
governance side looking at the

00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:52,160
uh you know the the the governance of

00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,160
decision-making processes and how we can

00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,839
how can grow that sally on the design

00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,560
front and stephen leading on the on the

00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,440
drupal

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,480
uh duplin code auditing front um we had

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,160
lots of other people as well

00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,920
um we had developers from different

00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,959
councils including brighton and hove

00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,920
croydon

00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,040
uh oxford uh and product managers uh

00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,160
from oxford and

00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,440
uh somebody else bracknell forest um and

00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,639
in the early days we met him

00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,480
in person you know this seems like a

00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,160
terribly long time ago now but we could

00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,200
get together in in a room

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,920
uh you know sharing ideas sharing

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:24,800
uh sharing germs and viruses and those

00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,079
kind of things um

00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,079
and it was a lot of fun we had lots of

00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,760
ideas lots of challenges lots of lots of

00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,320
resistance at first to the idea of

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,120
actually

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,480
making it fully open source and gpl um

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,000
luckily through

00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,959
you know liaison with andrew katz and

00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,240
looking at all of the options of

00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,399
different licensing models

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,440
gpl came out on top for obvious reasons

00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,720
to us but uh

00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,279
it was important to go through that

00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,880
process um

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,720
in essence we kind of came up with the

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,600
answers yes yes yes and yes we could do

00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,639
all of these things and there was

00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,760
definitely a

00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,399
a a business case around it um and

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,199
perhaps

00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,480
the interesting points of the discovery

00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:00,839
phase were three interesting documents

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,720
essentially came out of it

00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,240
um uh and this really kind of helped to

00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,800
form the foundation of

00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,040
of of the next phase the first one is a

00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,279
memorandum of understanding and mou

00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,199
um and in our research around other uh

00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,320
similar collaborations of organizations

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,920
on open source projects

00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,279
they all had quite a lightweight

00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,480
document which really described the

00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,040
purpose the values

00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,880
uh the ip uh liability this this sort of

00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,800
stuff but also what commitments people

00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,880
needed to make and how you join and

00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,800
leave the group and what that means

00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,160
um this document went down really well

00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,079
we didn't think it would but all the

00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,680
councils that read it um loved it and

00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,279
were very happy to sign up to it

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,240
similarly to the local digital

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,760
declaration you know they're kind of

00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,480
keen to just put their name to it and

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,800
actually say yes

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,920
we're going to be part of this um and

00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,839
this links off to two other

00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,199
documents one around technical

00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,000
governance the technical group

00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:49,680
governance and the other around product

00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,959
so the technical group governance

00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,040
again we did a bunch of research on

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,959
other open source projects

00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,480
um and actually largely the node

00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,959
foundation's governance model

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,959
really uh seemed to be a good fit for

00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,240
this so we pretty much lifted the no no

00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,480
just found you know contribution

00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,199
guidelines augmented it to our own needs

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,639
and uh

00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,079
that's up there on github for anyone to

00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,760
have a look at but really just you know

00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:12,079
talks about coding standards about being

00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,199
becoming a committer around branching

00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,440
accessibility

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,560
etc these these sort of things which are

00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,839
probably uh

00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:21,360
fairly um fairly obvious to us as

00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,639
do for developers but really good again

00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,600
just to get an enshrined at the

00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,560
beginning

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,360
um and then the product governance group

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
is another

00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,040
another side you know another

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:33,440
interesting document this in this case

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,399
looking at you know again assumptions

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,720
definitions

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,720
uh but also about communications and how

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,480
decision making processes can work and

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,839
scale out

00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,120
obviously if you've got two councils

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,320
it's relatively straightforward as soon

00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,279
as you've got you know a few then

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,639
different people may have different

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,000
prioritizations and how to

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,279
how to actually facilitate those kind of

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,639
decision making processes in a

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,839
collaborative way

00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,360
a lot of our experience in the

00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,160
cooperative sector and cooperative

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,320
decision making

00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,199
helped to inform uh you know this

00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,440
alongside um

00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,639
experience that from dsw had on on

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,920
product management and how

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,680
multiple product managers coming

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,440
together can liaise so

00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:07,440
again these documents really did form

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,279
the foundation of the of the output of

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,839
the discovery phase and gave us uh

00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,399
gave us a sort of um ability to move on

00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,279
from there

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,600
a solid foundation um many hats many

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,040
hats were worn um i've wore many hats at

00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,880
different points at some point this

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,399
was snapped on i don't know where the

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,720
hat came from or why i was wearing it

00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,560
but this rapidly became a bit of a theme

00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,320
of the discovery phase and

00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,560
i'm reliably informed that all discovery

00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,839
phases or all digital phases need need a

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,800
mission patch and this became our

00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,959
mission patch

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,399
which julie made it as stickers onto

00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:39,680
people's laptops and

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:42,000
uh coffee pots and and the like

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,759
so so that that really sealed the

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,040
success of the discovery phase

00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:50,240
and led to an alpha phase um

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:52,560
so so the successful that successfulness

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,199
the success of the discovery phase led

00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,199
to the mhclg giving us some more money

00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,880
uh for the alpha phase which was really

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,880
to start putting the wheels in

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,120
you know in motion and start refactoring

00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,799
code this ran from april to september

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,079
2020 including

00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:10,720
um a team from agile collective um

00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,919
and research from dxw as well as

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,360
developers and product managers as

00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,000
mentioned from corydon brighton

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,919
bracknell

00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,039
and and then london councils who came on

00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,400
board at that point

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,480
so we had a bigger team you know about

00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,720
eight developers four product managers

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,839
a researcher um and by this point we

00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,600
were fully into lockdown

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:27,039
we're very remote lots of online

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,079
meetings which i'm sure everyone's

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,400
familiar with

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,880
um and uh yeah joined by developers from

00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,520
microserve as well on bracknell's behalf

00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,200
and uh you know lots of meetings lots of

00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,080
sprints lots of retrospectives lots of

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,600
reflection

00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,080
lots of iteration lots of learning how

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:45,360
to work together in a wider team

00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,280
uh lots of wales cat popping in

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,400
various points to to the calls stop in

00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,880
she's called you can uh

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,400
he's got his own hashtag on twitter um

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,760
so yeah that led to uh

00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,919
that led to the mission patch for the

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,919
alpha phase um which featured

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,679
uh will's black cats stabbing and other

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,480
black cats and was very much around

00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,840
growing together we

00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,440
did grow a lot during that phase of

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,039
development uh both in terms of code but

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,600
also in terms of the size of

00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,679
of the group and with stoppages help we

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,400
uh we continue to grow or perhaps even

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,120
despite

00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,000
despite stoppage so enough about the the

00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,679
phases

00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,400
what does it do right now what have we

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,679
got i mean it's still early days but um

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,080
on a fresh install there are

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,280
about 25 modules i think which are all

00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,720
on github

00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,960
um but it really boils down to about

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,240
seven main content types

00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,760
the reason why there's so many modules

00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,799
is just uh trying to keep the

00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,880
dependencies

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,480
um as separated as possible so that

00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,440
potentially you know accounts can just

00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,840
come and just install

00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,960
guide pages or just install um you know

00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,039
an alert banner

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,240
if they want to keeping it keeping it

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,480
modular

00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,440
um i'll just run through the content

00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,200
types briefly

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,039
um service pages are the bulk of the

00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,200
content of websites essentially

00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,480
a service in council language is is is

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,720
something like council tax

00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,160
collection or rubbish collection or

00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,600
special educational needs these are all

00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,799
kind of service areas

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,679
under which they have an awful lot of

00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,280
content um so the the structure that was

00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:06,640
developed early in the early days was

00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,360
this kind of three level structure

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,120
landing page

00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,880
sub landing page and then the content

00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,320
page which essentially is a basic page

00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,200
to your eye

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,000
um just run through those briefly the

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,559
service page

00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,919
just links really um just a sort of

00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,000
landing page of links

00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,679
presented in you know in a curated way

00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,520
by content designers so they can really

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,640
prioritize the most popular links of a

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,679
particular service

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,760
uh importantly no images usually and you

00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,919
know minimal distractions

00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,960
um service sub landing pages similarly

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:37,200
just links

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,880
um keeping it minimal and finally down

00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,320
to service pages

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,080
again very simple but this is where the

00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,080
main bulk of the content is and

00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,600
as as far as i understand like 80 to 90

00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,520
percent of content is is in these

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,000
service pages for most councils

00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,160
um so keeping it really clear keeping it

00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,400
typography clear keeping it accessible

00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:55,679
again minimizing images or other calls

00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,640
just you know calls to action

00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,400
distractions

00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,000
other than what serves the actual user

00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,799
need for this page in this case

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,640
you know as somebody who's got a bin

00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:06,240
that's full i want to report a misspin

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,679
collection what do i do who do i contact

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,799
what do i need to consider just

00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:12,720
the targeted information

00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,480
another way of looking at this um this

00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,200
structure is useful this is from the

00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,200
the kensington and chelsea council

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,679
website

00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,960
and they've got the same information

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,720
architecture but they look at it more as

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,240
a hub and spoke module rather than as a

00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,799
hierarchical model so it's useful just

00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,200
to

00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,720
to look at this this diagram um where

00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,559
you've got your homepage in the middle

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,679
you've got your landing pages then in

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,679
the next ring and then you've got your

00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,799
sub landing pages outside and finally

00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,840
the little black

00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:41,039
um rectangles are the content pages the

00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,559
service pages

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,080
um and this just really illustrates that

00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,679
all the content is out there

00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,360
and the landing pages are just links

00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,960
through to that content

00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,559
um in this case we've also got topics

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,720
around the outside taxonomy terms to

00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,960
allow horizontal referencing between

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,559
related content uh in that way too which

00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,600
local government also

00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:01,200
also follows um the reason why the

00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,200
borough of kensington and chelsea's

00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,440
website structure is so similar

00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,799
is i think because they well first of

00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,320
all but maybe

00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,400
it's just an obvious user need but also

00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,000
they did work with the same agency clear

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:17,039
left on on developing their

00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,960
information architecture so moving on um

00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,880
step by step pages these are also

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,840
service content pages essentially

00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:25,280
um but uh a number of related pages

00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,480
which are designed to be consumed in a

00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,159
specific order

00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,480
so you know you start at the beginning

00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,360
and go through step by step as the name

00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,840
uh may suggest this is also following

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,960
another

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,400
gov dot uk gds design pattern uh so

00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,080
coming from you know user research and

00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,880
evidence-based design patterns have been

00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,360
tested

00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,000
and and tried um and we don't you know

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,120
again this

00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,200
just comes out of the box you can

00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:50,559
install it uh lots of councils

00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,480
like these types of pages guide pages

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,760
kind of similar to step by step pages uh

00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,480
a bunch of pages that are related

00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,080
together

00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,240
uh but the order is less important in

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,000
this case um so like bulky waste

00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,280
collections part of a number of pages

00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,400
that you might just want to

00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,080
skip through to find the bit of

00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,280
information you want rather than consume

00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,120
them in order

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,720
um still they have an accessible next

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,000
and previous buttons just to

00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,440
assist people if they got to the bottom

00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,280
of the page go to the next page in this

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,559
section

00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,679
alert banners so this is something

00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,080
slightly different from the information

00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,880
architecture really um

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,720
the optional alert banner shows a

00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,919
site-wide notice might be an emergency

00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,919
alert like stay at home we're in

00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,159
lockdown level three 3

00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,520
or you know the death of a notable

00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,320
person or some such

00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,039
so councils need to be able to um need

00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,679
to be able to

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,200
to to yeah post alerts from time to time

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,760
um user can hide the banner once they've

00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,440
seen it

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,200
you know fairly standard standard

00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,640
behavior but importantly this this is a

00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,000
module that has no dependencies on

00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,720
anything else so it can be installed on

00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,760
any council's

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,679
drupal site or indeed any drupal site um

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,840
trying to keep that keep that modularity

00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:55,440
and dependency

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:57,120
chain uh low produce dependencies

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,440
um events events is relatively

00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,960
straightforward simple content type with

00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:02,960
the date recur field so you have

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,120
recurring dates um

00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,480
and a listing unfortunately at the

00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,080
moment date recur doesn't work with

00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,400
search api so it's just

00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,679
a view with exposed filters relatively

00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,799
straightforward but this seems to be

00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:15,679
working for councils for

00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:16,400
for now um so if anyone can help us get

00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,559
date recur

00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,760
field working with um search api that

00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,880
would be great

00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:24,240
um directories here's where it starts to

00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,240
get a little bit more interesting

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,240
um so directories are search api driven

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,679
lists of content

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,159
some of them with locations so they can

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,240
be displayed on a map so things like

00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,440
schools or parks or libraries of a

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,520
particular area

00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,120
uh with with with facets so you can you

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,600
know full text searching and facets you

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,760
can

00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,880
filter down on on the uh the particular

00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,520
types of categories

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,960
uh importantly here the the facets are

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,240
all content driven rather than

00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,320
configuration

00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,159
so we've done some extension and some

00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,640
custom well some development to

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:57,919
extend the facets and and have facets as

00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,880
content entities so that content

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,240
managers

00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,760
don't need any kind of configuration

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,120
deployment to create new directories

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,039
with new types of facets

00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,320
and new specific facets they can have

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,760
the full flexibility of that within

00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,600
their their control

00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,880
um something that lots of councils are

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,720
already

00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,159
enjoying um subsites is perhaps another

00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,320
another of the kind of

00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,480
key areas of councils they have an awful

00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,240
lot of subsites and microsites um and

00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,919
the hope is that uh with subsides

00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,039
functionality they can reduce the number

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,440
of microsites

00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,159
subsites are as they might sound like

00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,080
you know a

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:31,279
sort of smaller section of the site with

00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,440
its own navigation

00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,320
um often used for promotional content

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,039
things like

00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,840
uh time-bound campaigns or in this case

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,360
um you know

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,039
marriage and civil partnership something

00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,559
where they're trying to promote

00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,400
the the facilities that the council has

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,840
because it maybe brings some money in

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,600
so in this case we're starting to use

00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,640
images manual images and

00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,880
uh and and more flexible um

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,720
paragraph components for cause traction

00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,360
uh for text for images for

00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,320
for you know videos potentially even um

00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,000
and

00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,679
and a bit of layout coming in here as

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,360
well so layout paragraphs

00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:08,480
is uh is yeah just a screenshot of that

00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:10,799
um allowing the content designer to

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,159
add columns and rows and actually adjust

00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,960
the layout of within their content

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,679
section

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,080
so that's something that that counselors

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,080
yeah uh

00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,159
really do need um you know if they are

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,360
to try and reduce the number of

00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:26,559
microsites they have on different

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,799
systems um

00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,640
a brief bit about the admin theme at the

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,440
moment we're using claro admin theme

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,640
which is great

00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,400
it's key and accessible content

00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,840
designers are really loving it i've just

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,279
found out about the gene admin theme

00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,720
which looks even better so

00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:40,960
i'm sure we'll be looking at that in due

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,159
course and we've also done a bit of

00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,880
customization to

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,400
help content editors um manage the

00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,240
information architecture a bit with

00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,159
some entity reference helpers and other

00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,760
things in there but really

00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,480
that's an area of focus for the next

00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,400
year um

00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,400
so the theme the local gov theme the

00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,240
theme structure briefly on this i won't

00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,760
twirl too long but it does come with the

00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,880
theme out of the box called local golf

00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,480
theme it's really focusing on

00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,600
accessibility and you know sensible

00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,039
defaults and

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:12,240
uh you know quick and easily extended um

00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:12,799
but uh it does have a sort of dependency

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,200
chain

00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,400
on uh local gov skeleton theme so we've

00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,480
kind of sandwiched in a

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,640
a base theme there so that other people

00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,039
can theme sub theme off the skeleton and

00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,279
still

00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,159
incorporate some of the benefits uh that

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,320
we've developed on

00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,840
a theme level within the system without

00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,880
necessarily using the

00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,000
uh the local gov theme um a number of

00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,320
things have gone in there which i'll

00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,159
mention in a bit

00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:38,640
so local government wild how we doing

00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,840
for time okay so yeah

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,440
local government is already out there in

00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,720
the wild lots of councils are already

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,320
using local gov drupal

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,520
which is great for a budding drupal

00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,799
distribution that didn't exist at the

00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,520
beginning of the year

00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,960
um croydon and brighton um are

00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:53,120
backporting their sites onto the local

00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,400
gov code base croydon might be launching

00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,039
before the end of this session actually

00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,760
on there so

00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,559
rather look in a bit um lamberth have

00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,000
already launched

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,240
maybe seventy percent of their site on

00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
local gov due for which is fantastic

00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,840
uh bracknell or inactive development as

00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,559
our westminster and kensington and

00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,080
chelsea

00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,320
london councils who launched some beta

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,480
sites um or beta pages

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,360
uh and cambria and northern forester are

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,919
actively

00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,039
uh pursuing it as well so lots of great

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,320
news from councils and i think this is

00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,880
one of the strengths of the distribution

00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
is that

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,760
it's coming from the users it's coming

00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,720
from the councils themselves and they're

00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,720
behind it

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,760
and they're they're pushing it and using

00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,200
it and

00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,399
so it's got a great a great chance of

00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,520
succeeding um a few example pages

00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,559
um council tax landing page on the

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,880
lambeth site

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:38,640
uh implementing their own custom theme

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,440
in this case quite a simple

00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,360
um you know simple tiled links into into

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,600
the council attacks section

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,480
um a deeper page in lambeth again very

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,440
clear

00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,880
simple calls to action and typography um

00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:53,039
just serving the user need

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,480
no no bells whistles or images or

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:58,399
distractions

00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,760
there um web forms yeah this is where

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,039
it got a little bit interesting on

00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,480
lambeth because they definitely needed

00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,240
some web forms which didn't come out of

00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,000
the box with local gov drupal

00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,440
and so we did a bunch of work around

00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,039
improving the web form

00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,200
um styling and behavior uh to follow

00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,399
best practice from again gov uk design

00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,799
patterns and

00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,520
and researched uh design patterns there

00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,320
things like

00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,840
changing the uh the way the option and

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:23,760
required fields work

00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,679
such that it's actually seems to be

00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,360
better practice to

00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,960
assume all fields are required unless

00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,559
they say optional next to them rather

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,760
than having a little red star that

00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:34,080
often people don't understand what it

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,760
means um and changing the way that

00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:38,000
they're handling work so that you can

00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,960
very very clearly see where the error is

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,880
and uh

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,120
and fix your your errors for required

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,480
fields all that work went back up into

00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,399
the local gov skeleton

00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,200
theme so that it can be consumed by

00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:51,039
either the default theme or other themes

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,440
creating council again just an example

00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:55,360
of a different different look and feel

00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,880
around the step-by-step this time seven

00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,159
easy steps to get married or form a

00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,840
civil partnership

00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,360
again very clear content different font

00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,520
different styling but but you know

00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,440
the same same kind of uh accessibility

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,279
uh considerations

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,399
so business case just a bit on the

00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,320
business case you know kind of like

00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,480
taking this forward because um

00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,600
mhclg are investing money and they want

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,960
to see that this is actually going to

00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,760
save money for people

00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,120
um a quick look at the kind of market i

00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
guess if you like the drupal is the

00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,919
second

00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,440
second most um popular cms for uk

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,279
councils still

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:27,200
uh has been for a while second to jadu

00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:30,000
which is a proprietary cms

00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,960
comes in there at 66 councils using

00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,600
drupal

00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,799
based on our research which is uh colin

00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,880
stenning from bracknell

00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,399
forest council does updates this every

00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,679
six months or so

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:43,039
largely manually um so props to colin um

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,799
if you split it up by street four seven

00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,399
and eight you can see that um two seven

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,080
is still the fourth most popular cms for

00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,000
uk councils with 37

00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,200
councils and 24 councils already on

00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,799
drupal 8.

00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,840
so there's still there's a great market

00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:55,360
there you know just for people who are

00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,720
using drupal

00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,799
to start using local graphical and

00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,559
collaborating but also obviously for

00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,799
people who are not using drupal to

00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,240
to to come on into into the uh the

00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:06,559
drupal gang

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,440
um so the business case for

00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,000
collaboration

00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:11,520
just briefly reduce costs on license

00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
fees reduce costs on

00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,640
microsites you know dev hosting and

00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,399
support

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,919
if you've got between 10 and 20

00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,960
microsites i think you know often

00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:21,200
councils seem to have

00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,720
if we can bring those into a centralized

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,720
distribution then that

00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,840
that saves a lot of money um and channel

00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,760
shift i've already mentioned you know

00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:29,440
reducing calls and emails

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,039
but there are other perhaps non you know

00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,600
less tangible benefits you know new

00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,200
features

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,880
by other councils imagine if we've got

00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,000
10 20 councils working together each one

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,559
of them producing a new feature

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,720
each year that can be shared uh shared

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,039
research and information on on you know

00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,480
uh what's best practice what what do you

00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,279
know user testing what actually works

00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,640
for people in the

00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:50,640
rapidly evolving um digital landscape

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,399
and knowledge transfer transfer and

00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,000
staff up skill

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:55,600
um we've already seen this happening

00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,799
massively within the councils that are

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,440
working you know actually

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,039
working together people learn lots a lot

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,279
faster

00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,360
so just briefly some figures you know

00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:06,480
eight councils will be using drupal by

00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,240
april 21

00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,600
we think the total savings and estimate

00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,880
over five years is looking at three

00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,559
point seven to five point two million

00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,159
pounds which is four point one to five

00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:18,320
point eight million euros in

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:20,080
real money um if we scale that up to

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,080
all the councils currently using drupal

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,760
60 odd councils then over five years

00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,279
that's looking like you know 28 to 40

00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,880
million pounds which is starting to look

00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:29,919
like some quite serious

00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,919
serious money um

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,399
obviously if you scale that up to all

00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,840
343 english local authorities

00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,600
um that's looking at hundreds of

00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:40,240
millions of pounds which you know

00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,360
is optimistic um you know that all of

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,640
them will use it but actually quite

00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,080
conservative in terms of the estimates

00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,000
we're making

00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,440
there's also a moral case which um you

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
know not just a financial case but you

00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,519
know

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,440
public money should be spent on public

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,640
code and i was delighted to find the

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,320
blog posts on dries's website um

00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,240
specifically on that public money public

00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,600
code um you know

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,880
this is public money there is no reason

00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,240
why we shouldn't be spending it on code

00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,840
that other people can use this

00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,159
it makes sense it's it's the right thing

00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,720
to do but also this helps potentially

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,600
us sustain governments and public sector

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:12,000
sustain

00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,960
uh open source uh projects like this

00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,200
unlike drupal

00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,159
um and all the open source we build on

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,519
so

00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,919
it's the right thing to do we should do

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:23,039
it a couple of quotes

00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,039
croydon chief executive um said whoever

00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:28,080
came up with this idea is a genius

00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,600
which um i think you know it goes to it

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,200
goes to will callahan uh

00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,720
in my mind but then he points out that

00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,080
actually it's brighton and croydon all

00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,840
the collaborations there you know

00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,880
alec and miguel and ali rigby and people

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,440
who actually made the collaboration

00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,440
happen

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,880
in the first place really facilitated

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,159
this this this phase

00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,279
but actually if you look back further

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:44,559
than actually drupal in the drupal

00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,159
community as well it's you know

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,840
it's about collaboration and open source

00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,880
and i think that's that's come in really

00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,519
strong

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,799
um neil williams from croydon council

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,440
formerly at the government digital

00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,880
service

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,880
said sharing website code between

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,120
councils helps all of us to go faster

00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:00,480
spend less and deliver better outcomes

00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:02,080
for residents

00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,399
now that last bit is really fundamental

00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,440
for me it delivers better outcomes for

00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:07,120
residents and that

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,640
is key you know if we can just make

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,159
people's lives a little bit better

00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,760
then that would be great you know if

00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,399
they can find the information they want

00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,080
then that saves time and saves faffing

00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:18,240
around on the council's website

00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,200
which nobody really wants to do so where

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,279
next where are we going

00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,640
next year 2021 we're looking at

00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,039
accessibility in a big way

00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:26,480
trying to get rid of pdfs by html

00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,960
documents and

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,159
other accessibility issues looking at

00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,840
web forms

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,000
uh improving the accessibility of web

00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,880
forms possibly integrating with other

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
crms and

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,399
case management systems there's

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,080
definitely a big potential there

00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,000
but also subsides and microsites you

00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,080
know keeping the uh keeping the

00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,519
uh increasing the flexibility there

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,760
potentially even looking at headless

00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,919
versions of microsites to try and

00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,200
um create a world in which they don't

00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,320
need to actually have separate sites at

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,679
all they can still manage all the

00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,120
content in one site and

00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,200
still have it branded separately if that

00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,320
is what they they want to do

00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,760
um also long-term sustainability this is

00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,919
something that's key you know if we do

00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,360
get funding for a beta phase next year

00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,200
then we really need to be looking at the

00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,599
legal entity is there some kind of

00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,800
investment model from councils or public

00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,159
funding streams how do we actually make

00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
the sustainable to keep it going and

00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,079
keep it

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:18,399
uh you know as it grows um

00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,359
so brief summary we're running short on

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,399
time

00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:24,079
um there's 418 councils oh that's wrong

00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,240
408 i think it should be

00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,839
66 using drupal and eight using local

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,960
gov drupal we want to see all those

00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,000
figures change to

00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,720
hopefully all be the same um one day

00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,159
um and i guess just key takeaways you

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,919
know uk

00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,839
councils and public sector are agreeing

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:42,800
to collaborate and work in the open

00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:44,000
um public money public code this is an

00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,440
agreement

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,040
we can make it happen more hopefully

00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,720
through projects like this

00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,760
the business case is hard to ignore

00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,879
there are some serious savings and

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,320
benefits there

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:54,000
uh but perhaps again more importantly

00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,280
from my perspective this does have the

00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,800
potential to improve the lives of

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,320
millions of citizens even if just a

00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,760
little bit even if they can just find

00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,720
out how to get their bins

00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,839
uh you know collected sooner or later

00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,280
issue

00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,200
so please come and join us we do need

00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,560
everyone's help um there's already a lot

00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,720
of people involved on github

00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,000
um we've got docs on localgover.org

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,720
we've got a youtube channel

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,240
with some tutorials um and just a quick

00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,560
word on the dots actually the doc site

00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,119
is

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:20,720
is their localgovduple.org we invite

00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,119
people to go and read it and

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,680
uh you know comment on it and improve it

00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:26,880
but it's not just about getting started

00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,240
and about configuring about theme

00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,040
there's also a lot of other information

00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,880
there we're trying to

00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:33,119
starting to build uh knowledge sharing

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,040
around testing and accessibility

00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,560
uh and stuff that's not necessarily just

00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,200
about the local graph drupal but also

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,359
about

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,880
um you know doing things better together

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,400
so um so yeah

00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,160
and have a thing how might this work for

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,560
you how might this work in your country

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,560
or or do you your local authorities or

00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,359
maybe not even in that sector maybe in

00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,640
non-profit sectors or other lessons that

00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,000
you can learn from this collaboration

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,200
that you can take and

00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,280
take it out they'd love to have those

00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,000
conversations so

00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,480
lots of links check them all out um

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,680
you've

00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,119
got access to the slides um if you want

00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,440
to get in touch with

00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,720
willgov willgov on twitter to discuss

00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,000
the product group

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,119
they meet every two weeks and if you

00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,560
want to get in touch with me at finn

00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,400
lewis

00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,680
and lots of credits to lots of people

00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,520
too many to name

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:19,359
but a big shout out to agile collective

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,560
for um sponsoring a lot of my time over

00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,240
the last few months and a lot of other

00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:27,359
people from agile collective um

00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:29,200
to help make this happen um yeah and

00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:31,200
of course join us for contributions on

00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,119
friday if you haven't sprinted before

00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,320
do come along first time contra workshop

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,240
it's a lot of fun

00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,560
uh get involved and uh hopefully we'll

00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,880
have a a a table to do some local gov do

00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,160
for

00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,480
a contribution too so i think that's

00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,599
it um have we got time for some

00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,000
questions i think we do

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:49,520
i would say we do and there's a lot of

00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,280
them so i'll try and put some of them

00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,720
together

00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,560
thank you um starting off at the um

00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:58,160
beginning there was um definite

00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,119
questions about the governance and how

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,079
things are being ordered

00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,839
organized julia asked i'm interested in

00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,720
the governance model how do you organize

00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,359
collaboration

00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:09,040
and nick had asked how many developers

00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:11,680
are working on the code base

00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,800
um how does the team approach um

00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,920
knowledge sharing

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,480
and i think that's actually quite

00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,800
interesting because it's not just the

00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,599
team because there are actually several

00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,000
different com organized companies drupal

00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,240
shops

00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,280
and councils all working on the same

00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,400
code base

00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,160
um and also deciding the direction

00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,280
yeah so so briefly on that first of all

00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
the first thing how do we decide the

00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,800
direction so

00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,560
there is a product group that meets um

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,560
every two weeks

00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,400
of product managers from different

00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,000
councils um early on that's just four

00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,200
councils now it's growing out

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,640
and they really look at different

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,480
features that they might be wanting and

00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,280
start to try and prioritize the the

00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,359
requirements

00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,960
um often one of them's got an idea and

00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,240
already half developed it and said hello

00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,200
we've done this in 347 should we do it

00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,119
this way can we

00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,960
do it you know can we get this into

00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,359
development or they've done some designs

00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,920
and mock-ups and and wireframes

00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:03,359
uh and usually counselors are just like

00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,480
yeah that's great i want that as well or

00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,160
they offer some other

00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,079
perspective and between them to decide

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:10,960
on what the kind of direction is

00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,079
um that then gets hopefully put into a

00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:13,440
development sprint where the technical

00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:15,839
group can take that on and

00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,480
come back and and ask questions around

00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:17,839
you know

00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,599
why whether it's going to be done in a

00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:22,880
certain way or not

00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:24,480
um that's the the idea uh at the moment

00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,839
people have been quite busy

00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,040
launching their own websites on it and

00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:28,400
so haven't had a huge amount of time to

00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,920
develop new features

00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,119
um and that i guess comes into the

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,760
second question how do developers

00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,200
um how does that side of it work you

00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,119
know there are developers from croydon

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,040
from brighton but also from

00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,320
microserve and zoocher and agile

00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:45,520
collective and

00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,599
um champion i.t and so there's lots of

00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,599
developers who work with councils

00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,640
and developers who work at councils who

00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,280
have all potentially have

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,079
a bit of time to to commit to to working

00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,240
together

00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,920
um and we're very much trying to embody

00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,960
that sort of peer review so if we're

00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,760
developing or

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,520
doing you know new features or fixing uh

00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,839
changing things uh issuing pull requests

00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,119
that

00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,960
somebody from another organization

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,320
reviews so that we've got that sharing

00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,320
of knowledge

00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,640
um so i hope that goes to some extent to

00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:15,200
answer that question

00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:17,119
okay um there's also it's a lot of

00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,400
project project managers and owners and

00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,160
people working in public sector but

00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,359
there is the inevitable lots of drupal

00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:24,480
developers

00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:26,839
um mark um conroy um

00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,839
asked um i'd like to know about

00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:32,240
taxonomies for example for local count

00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:34,079
local council services i've built

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,960
websites for a number of local councils

00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:37,839
in ireland

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,720
and found that each of them has similar

00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:41,359
and different

00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,880
different services or similar services

00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,920
with different names was there any

00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,040
consensus

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:50,480
on all councils using the same taxonomy

00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,320
absolutely i mean uh actually

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,760
well naming things i have aside on

00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,359
challenges a bit later on which i

00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,720
didn't have time to do but um one of the

00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:58,400
technical challenges is naming things

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:00,400
but also that comes into

00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,760
uh yeah taxonomies of course um i mean

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,560
even just calling things services is

00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,480
quite

00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,839
weird and uh you know council attacks

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,960
seems to be relatively consistent but

00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,680
for example

00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,119
uh i don't know marriage and and you

00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,240
know

00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,839
they call it different things in

00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,119
different places special educational

00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:16,720
needs is called different things

00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:18,720
um at the moment no i don't think there

00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,000
is a consistent taxonomy across the

00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:25,839
the land but there is a project again

00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,400
sponsored by the mhclg um to

00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:30,640
uh i'm trying to remember to basically

00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,640
define ontologies or taxonomies

00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,839
around council services and the things

00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,760
that they do provide

00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,520
i believe do you remember anything more

00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:40,000
about that

00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,960
uh not the specifics no um i was

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,680
actually thinking

00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,560
quite a lot of it but while there is the

00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:46,800
idea of

00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:48,480
um bringing the taxonomies together lots

00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,119
of the content designers actually want

00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,160
to

00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:54,880
move away so we even had to build in

00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,160
a system so that for the categories on

00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,920
the directories

00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:03,359
it could be completely managed content

00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:07,280
rather than um organized and agreed even

00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:10,400
within the system indeed yeah so

00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,760
so yeah yeah you're right we have shied

00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,520
away from defining any

00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,440
out of the box taxonomies for that

00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,960
reason um but again that'd be

00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,440
interesting to explore in the future

00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,560
um if they can agree on certain certain

00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,920
consistency within

00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:24,160
you know within a country would make

00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,599
sense so if you move from one

00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,240
council to another then things are still

00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:31,280
called the same thing

00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:34,160
okay um mark also said to

00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,760
talk to them anatech about repeating

00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,079
events and search api

00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,520
so i think we want to have that

00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,000
conversation very quickly

00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,280
definitely thank you there's some

00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,570
difficult questions

00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,960
um

00:41:45,570 --> 00:41:49,200
[Music]

00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,319
this web form came up twice one of them

00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:53,680
is the web forms and

00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:54,319
gdpr i don't know any considerations on

00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,640
how to

00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:58,400
handle sensible information that users

00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:00,480
might post in web forms

00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,000
another one about web forms which is are

00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,240
you planning to share the development

00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,240
work on web forms i'm interested in

00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:09,839
dealing with the same issues working

00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,520
for a university that one's easier yes

00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,760
all the dev work on that is on the local

00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,400
gov skeleton theme i believe

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,440
yep yeah and it's all based on the gds

00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,280
best practices

00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:21,920
so you can have a look at that on github

00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:25,119
github.com localgov34

00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:27,839
localgov underscore skeleton

00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,200
um on the other question just around

00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:30,000
data storage we're not really looking at

00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:32,160
any of that at the moment

00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,839
as a project um initially that was just

00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,040
a feedback form which doesn't capture

00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:38,000
any

00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,760
uh you know sensitive data obviously the

00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,720
content designers at

00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,079
lambeth in that case can create forms

00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,599
asking whatever they want um and what

00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,720
they choose to do with that that data is

00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,800
kind of up to them and obviously they

00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:50,720
need to be gdpr aware and not ask

00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,319
questions and uh not collect data that

00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,359
they don't need um

00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,119
next year we're maybe looking at

00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,520
integrating web form in a bigger way so

00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,920
that

00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,880
would be you know um interesting you

00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,560
know

00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,960
things to consider around around privacy

00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:04,480
definitely there's a there's a there's a

00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,599
whole group of us looking at privacy in

00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,640
the slack channel around local

00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:10,560
government pool

00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:13,280
um yeah okay and then

00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:15,119
another one was did you integrate the

00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,839
digital processes like booking

00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,480
notice appointment into drupal itself or

00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,920
guide

00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:24,240
you to type in data into another

00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,440
workflow engine or so

00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,319
which i think well lambeth

00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,800
yeah i mean so there's there's there's

00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:34,319
nothing

00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:37,520
there yet um uh

00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:38,640
yeah so we're not we're not uh

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,800
basically it's just publishing web

00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:42,640
content any any uh other kind of

00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,839
interactions applications or other stuff

00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,200
goes off to other systems at the moment

00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:46,640
but there's definitely a scope there to

00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,599
look at how web form and other

00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,000
integrations could

00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:51,359
could serve that need and you know start

00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,040
to move away from proprietary systems

00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:57,280
onto drupal-based

00:43:53,040 --> 00:44:00,000
drupal-based systems and or yeah

00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,599
so far there hasn't been any common back

00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,240
ends like even

00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:06,160
the geo coding everyone's using a

00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:09,200
different back end

00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,319
the people who lambeth's um booking

00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,599
system for

00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:15,280
um cemeteries or um funerals

00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,800
is different from the others so there

00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,880
hasn't been a common one so it's been

00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,359
very much making things pluggable

00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:23,119
um and just allow people to plug in a

00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:26,079
different geocoding backend

00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,680
or yeah it would be web form plugins i

00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:30,800
think

00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,800
we're almost finished

00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,319
okay we've got about 30 seconds thank
