00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,520
all right

00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,640
hi everyone i can see there's

00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,680
around 60 of you already um

00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,599
in the session welcome uh i'm gabor

00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,119
hoichi and i'm going to talk about the

00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,519
drupal 10 initiative

00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,000
so when i gave the title of this session

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,520
is the drupal 10 initiative here we go

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,280
and when i gave the title uh still felt

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,399
like this is going to be like

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,600
let's start the drupal 10 initiative but

00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,440
i think as you will see

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,440
there's a bunch of things that we

00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,559
already accomplished

00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:52,480
so we are well on our way now

00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:55,920
um i put a poll in the sidebar so

00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,359
if you'd like to go and express which

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,760
drupal version are you primarily using

00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,039
that would be interesting i see the

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,240
majority so far

00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,960
69 are using drupal 8.

00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,799
uh so i guess i will have some good

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,880
information for you

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,119
and also some of you are using triple

00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,560
seven and even pre-drupal seven so

00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,520
that's exciting all right so let's get

00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,320
started here

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,479
i am uh gabar hoichi i work for aquia

00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,240
uh at the drupal acceleration team

00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,400
that's what it's called right now and

00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,880
i'm an initiative coordinator for drupal

00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,640
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,119
which means that i help do these

00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,840
communication things organize meetings

00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:42,079
try to unblock issues organize tasks

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,920
etc and uh i'm not the

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,159
primary person doing all the work so

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,920
there's a lot of people working on

00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,240
exciting things for drupal 10 and i'm

00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,399
trying to help communicate and unblock

00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,280
the initiative i was also an english

00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:57,840
coordinator for drupal 9

00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,640
so if that went successful then i've had

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,880
my little

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,200
share in that as well i'm a drupal

00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,240
contributor since 2003

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,719
which is quite a while at 17 years and

00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,959
i'm a

00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,160
drupal core committer for the past 13

00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,319
years um

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,400
i started on being a core committer and

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,800
release manager for drupal 6.

00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,560
it was a lot of fun and i'm a product

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,680
manager now for drupal core and you can

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,280
find me on twitter as

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,760
gabor hoichi our topic today

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,319
is drupal 10 uh which is planned to be

00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,400
released

00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:34,840
in 2022 uh as soon as

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:36,160
in 17 months so that sounds a bit scary

00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,440
maybe

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,720
it's very soon i mean most of you are on

00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,519
drupal 8 and

00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,680
very few of you are in drupal 9 and

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,280
we're already talking about drupal 10

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,400
um and that's that's how it is i'm gonna

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,680
talk about how

00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,920
that came about next

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,040
so the our potential drupal 10 release

00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,319
dates are

00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,080
the planned release date is june 2022

00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,319
uh there's a fallback release date in

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,239
august 2022 and a final fallback in

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,879
december 2022

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,080
uh drupal 9 was basically the same we

00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,080
had an ideal date

00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,760
in june and then a fall back in august

00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,920
and our fall back in december

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,040
we made our ideal release date in june

00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,959
so we managed to do

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:24,720
that um uh and on june 3rd

00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:28,159
but um these are the same fallbacks for

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,319
drupal 10 um hopefully we'll

00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,840
make the earliest release date but it's

00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,280
not a disaster if we don't make the

00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,440
earliest release date

00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,480
how do we arrive on these release dates

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,599
so

00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,799
for those of you on drupal 8 uh you are

00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,080
using symphony 3

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,239
in drupal 8 and symphony 3

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,599
all the versions of symphony 3 will be

00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,200
end of life

00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,360
in november 2021 so drupal 8 will

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,200
be end of life at the end of next year

00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,319
november 2021

00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,760
so because um that's yeah

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,040
symphony 3.4 lts as sergio mentions in

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,040
chat so

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,720
because uh symphony is not going to be

00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,200
supported any symphony 3

00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,360
is not going to be supported anymore uh

00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,959
we needed to release a version of drupal

00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,079
that runs on a later version of

00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,680
symphony in our case symphony four and

00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,160
symphony 3 to symphony 4

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,919
is a major backwards compatibility break

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,320
so we need to make a new major version

00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,240
of drupal as a result so basically

00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,759
this meant that we stopped drupal 8

00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,400
security and bug fix support when

00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:34,080
symphony 3 stops their support

00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:36,560
and so we start releasing we we um

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,000
we release a long-term version support

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,280
of drupal 9 that lasts

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,520
as long as possible so 8.9 was released

00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,639
and gets long-term support until

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,639
symphony

00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,800
gets long-term support and we need to

00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,800
release a new major version earlier

00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,800
so you have time to update to drupal 9.

00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,600
so 71 percent of you

00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,639
who are on drupal 8 uh have still plenty

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,479
of time

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,160
uh one more year basically to update to

00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,560
drupal 9.

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,479
so we released drupal 9.0 and we keep

00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,960
releasing new features in 919293 etc

00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,240
and then comes our next major event or a

00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,840
next major event of one of our

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:16,000
dependencies symphony 4

00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,320
end of life uh at the end of uh 2023

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,680
and c canadore for end of life is

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,560
actually also

00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,000
at the end of 2023 so two of our major

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,639
dependencies are coming

00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,320
at their end of lives then and we made

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,240
the similar calculation

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,919
you need to get off of those things by

00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,800
the end of 2023

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,520
so consequently we need to end drupal 9

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,840
security

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,520
and buffering support and the end of

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,840
2023 and then we need to release a new

00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,800
major version of drupal drupal 10

00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,639
hopefully sooner than that ideally

00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,600
middle of 2022

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,520
so we can work out all of the problems

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,680
in drupal 10 and give you plenty of time

00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,080
to plan with the update

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,360
to budget for the update and to make the

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,360
update happen

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,360
and then these drupal 10 versions are

00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,600
projections so i don't know exactly how

00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,440
long drupal 10 is going to last

00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,880
uh it's going to be a discussion point

00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,400
later in this session

00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,080
but basically drupal 10 security and

00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,880
buffering support would start when we

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,160
released

00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:17,680
10.0 so this is the timeline

00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,960
this is why we plan to release drupal 10

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,840
the middle of 2022 or sometime later in

00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,840
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:31,120
and then um kovid happened

00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:33,600
and even though we planned to and drupal

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,919
7 security and buffing support earlier

00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,240
we've extended that as well to the end

00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,160
of 2022

00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,240
and then vendor extended support will

00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,280
still be provided to drupal 7

00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,400
beyond that so for the

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,840
17 percent of you on drupal 7. drupal 7

00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,160
is still

00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,880
alive it still receives updates and bug

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,080
fixes

00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:59,120
and uh still has

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:02,000
just got a new release out recently

00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,199
so uh drupal 7 is going to be supported

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,639
until the end of 2022 so a very

00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,039
interesting uh thing that you can see

00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,520
here

00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,520
is drupal 7 will be separated longer

00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,639
than drupal 8

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:18,800
uh and drupal 7 support will overlap

00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,919
with drupal 10 support

00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,240
so if you're on drupal 7 um

00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,120
i wouldn't necessarily suggest you to do

00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,000
so but it

00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,360
will be possible to uh to move from

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,720
drupal 7 to drupal 10 directly um

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:38,160
if that's the only way you can make it

00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,680
so um yeah so that's our timeline

00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,440
it's interesting i wouldn't have

00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:45,599
expected this timeline to

00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,560
to uh to form a couple years back i must

00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,560
say

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,840
so this is our timeline and that's when

00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,120
you can expect triple

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,840
10. so the next question

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,360
is is that still too soon uh that we're

00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,120
going to release

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,720
drupal 10 too soon because okay these

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,360
are the rules these are the

00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,199
external factors that sort of force us

00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,199
to release drupal 10 now

00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,240
but is it is it still is it too soon

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,720
anyway

00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,360
and i don't think it's too soon why it's

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,319
because

00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,400
uh the drupal 7 to drupal 8 upgrade path

00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,879
or migration rather

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,639
is not easy it's definitely not easy but

00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:23,520
we learned a lot from that process

00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,120
and we built a lot of tools to make this

00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,240
update easier

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,319
so first of all matt glaminet centauro

00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,840
worked on the php standdrupal

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,200
integration

00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:37,360
which helps us find uses of deprecated

00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,120
apis in your drupal 8 code so you can

00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,039
update it to drupal 9.

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,719
he built a common line tool on top of

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,360
this called drupal check

00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,440
and then we at acquia built a ui and the

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,760
drush integrated system on top of that

00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,080
called

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,160
update status that also integrates a

00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,640
bunch of other tools and gives you a

00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,839
much

00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,959
more whole picture of your drupal

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,880
readiness

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,560
so we have this automated tool that

00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,600
tells you about the readiness of your

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,680
environment

00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,360
tells you about which projects you're

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,360
not using and should remove which

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,880
projects have ready updates on drupal or

00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,279
that you can update to

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,720
which projects have issues on drupal.org

00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,560
that you should work with instead of

00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,720
trying to locally fix them

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,560
etc so it helps you collaborate with

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,440
maintainers on drupal.org update your

00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,200
projects

00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,720
tells you about overall status of your

00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,040
projects on your site

00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,000
so it's a it's a tool that you can use

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,000
on your drupal 8

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,040
site for the 71 percent of you using

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,279
drupal 8

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,800
uh you install this tool on your site

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,680
you can use it from the ui or the

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,600
command line

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,680
and it helps you move on to drupal 9

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,880
gradually

00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,120
and yeah and makes it much easier than

00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,120
before

00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,720
so this is provides you with a bunch of

00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,080
suggestions on next step and what you

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,320
should do

00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,279
and then um pronavix built a tool that

00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,600
was picked up

00:09:53,279 --> 00:10:00,560
by by a palantir

00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,320
uh called drupal rector which automates

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,079
fixes to your custom code into

00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:06,480
drupal.org code

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,800
so when the when update status tells you

00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,399
to fix this code it also tells you when

00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,279
automations are available for those

00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,680
fixes

00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,560
and then you can use automated fixing to

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,920
fix the

00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,000
fixed source code for drupal 9

00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,120
compatibility so that's why drupal

00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,040
rector comes in and we built a bot on

00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,480
top of this on drupal.org called the

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,399
project update bot

00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,720
that submits issues to projects with

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,880
patches from drupal rector

00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,880
that fixes the project's source code for

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,720
drupal 9 compatibility

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,320
so it's not only that we provided tools

00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,000
for your sites we've also provided

00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,480
automated tools and

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,320
and the bot for drupal.org projects to

00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,640
keep projects up to date

00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,440
so i believe that this current current

00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,320
setup

00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,320
provides a lot better a lot better

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:51,600
process support for updating from eight

00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,519
to nine

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,880
and we'll continue to use these tools

00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,000
and enhance these tools

00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,079
in the drupal 9-10 process to make the

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,600
make this update even easier than drupal

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:05,360
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,640
um and we hope to um hope to

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,680
use the whatever we learned from these

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,640
tools to further

00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,640
improve the process

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,440
so these are the tools and the current

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,600
status

00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,480
uh based on the results from these tools

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,800
so we are running

00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,079
uh upgrade status on all of drupal.org

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,040
country projects

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,880
every week on drupal.org the drupal

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,680
association is funding that and running

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,920
that

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,320
and we take that data and we created a

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,399
visualization on dev.com

00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,240
that visualizes it in various ways this

00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,160
is one of the visualizations

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,079
so these are the segments of contributed

00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,519
projects if you look at the top

00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:47,120
1000 drupal.org projects 95 of them are

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,600
drupal 9 compatible

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,959
half a year after drupal 9 is released

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,680
um so that's much

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,600
way better than it was for aaa

00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,360
compatibility

00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,040
but if you look at all of the projects

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,279
you can see you can see that

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,079
almost half of the all of the projects

00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,079
are drupal 9 compatible at this point

00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,600
and we did various campaigns and

00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,720
encourage maintainers

00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,560
to get them up to speed

00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,399
and this is an area i think where we

00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,360
need to think about solutions for the

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,399
future

00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,399
for eight to nine and nine to ten

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,240
if you look at dries's blog post

00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,360
recently about who sponsors drupal

00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,560
development

00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,079
is this very interesting tidbit about

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,639
how many projects are being worked on

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,320
each year and this is a quote from the

00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,360
post in total the drupal community

00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,800
worked on

00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,800
4 195 different projects this year

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,880
which sounds like a lot of projects but

00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,000
if you look at the list of projects

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,920
there's nine thousand projects so if in

00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,519
a given year the drupal community only

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,760
works on less than half of the

00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,120
nine thousand nine thousand projects

00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,000
that means that the other half of the

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,920
projects are

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,360
basically done and there and they're

00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,440
just sitting there and they are ready

00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,320
and people can use them

00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,040
but they are not being moved forward so

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,360
um

00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,360
if we are posting the project update but

00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,560
is posting them these patches to fix

00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,560
their issues

00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,120
oftentimes it's just one line fixed to

00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,200
the info yaml file most of the time

00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,440
uh if nobody's there to commit them and

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,480
to make the releases that's a problem

00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,920
so we need to figure out what how to

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,240
advance the ownership and the

00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,480
maintainership of half of the projects

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,399
that are not touched in a year

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,480
to make these transitions easier in the

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,399
future i think we need a way for

00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,760
projects to explicitly declare that they

00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,040
are compatible

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:37,200
so we can't really avoid the explicit

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,360
like the process of somebody testing it

00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,800
and making sure that it actually works

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,680
we can just blindly say that it works um

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,360
but there is a workaround module and the

00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,279
name escapes me exactly i think it's

00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,199
called drupal

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,440
8 backwards compatibility or something

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,600
along these lines that skips the info

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,279
file check and allows you to install

00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,279
those projects as well

00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,800
but i think practically it's still

00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,160
better to

00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,000
um to to have a human to test it out or

00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,000
to have a maintainer that says okay

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,600
i put in the stamp of approval on this

00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,839
project and say that

00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,880
that it's actually ready for triple

00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,880
knight

00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,079
and the maintainers initiative has a

00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,720
proposal to have

00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:20,639
group maintainership for projects that

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,639
are not changed so often

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,480
and then they could make these um

00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,720
relatively small changes to this project

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,240
so that's an interesting direction that

00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,800
we should discuss but we need to figure

00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,800
out some kind of solution for this

00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,880
either way because even if there's only

00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,639
a small change required

00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:38,480
that somebody needs to make that small

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,519
change that said

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,560
i think because the drupal 9 will be a

00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,360
much shorter

00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,120
lift than it was the number of changes

00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,959
that we can make in drupal 9 will be

00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,000
consequently fewer

00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,480
so i think by the rules of time

00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,519
and available time to make changes i

00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,639
think there's going to be less

00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:59,360
difference between 9 to 10 than it was

00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,680
from

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,240
8 to 9 but this is a crystal ball

00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,560
prediction we'll see how it goes

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,560
um and the other thing that i mentioned

00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,320
is we will still provide drupal 7 core

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,120
migrations to drupal 10.

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,399
um the drupal 7 migrations to drupal 9

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,240
are currently in core

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,920
for core things we haven't made this um

00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,560
definite decision whether we're going to

00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,519
remove drupal 7 migrations from drupal

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,959
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,800
if we are going to remove them it's

00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:28,399
going to be a last-minute removal so it

00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,279
will still be available in a country

00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,040
project

00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,600
so you could still use that to migrate

00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,279
to drupal 10.

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,519
but that's an interesting dynamic

00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,399
resulting from the changes to

00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,560
support timelines so let's talk about

00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,759
how we are building drupal 10

00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,560
and if you've experienced how drupal 9

00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,440
was built

00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,000
um drupal 10 is built similar similarly

00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,639
within

00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
drupal 9 so we are not having a separate

00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,320
drupal 10 branch that we

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,120
are going happy changing everything but

00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,959
we are doing the changes in drupal 9.

00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,800
and what does that mean is that all the

00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,480
things that we put into drupal 9 will be

00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,240
part of drupal 10.

00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,720
so the initiatives that dries announced

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,920
at drupalcon global the new front-end

00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,480
theme oliveiro

00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,120
has got released as an experimental

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:18,160
theme

00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:20,720
in 9.1 uh just last week i think yeah

00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,600
it's hopefully going to go stable and be

00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,480
part of

00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,079
as a stable new theme in drupal 10 and

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,240
then drupal 10 the only thing that

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,959
drupal 10 would do is to remove bar tick

00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,720
or

00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,800
to not make braddock anymore the default

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:36,560
scene likely is going to remove bartek

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:39,680
if all of the box

00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,480
um initiative which consists of making

00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,560
claro's table the new admin theme

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,040
and it would mean that that the seven

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,120
admin theme is deprecated in drupal 9

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:50,079
and the 7 admin theme would be removed

00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,360
in drupal 10

00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:55,120
ideally uh and the other goals of easy

00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,880
out of the box is to make media layouts

00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,639
first class citizens

00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,480
so when you when you install drupal

00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,600
standard then it would enable media and

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:03,199
layout builder

00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,640
and it would use layout builder for

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,400
standard pages and

00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:12,000
would use media for standard media

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,679
so that's sort of

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,679
making those first-class citizens like

00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,679
views when your front pages of you and

00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,760
your note admin page is of you

00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,039
now media and layouts would be similarly

00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,199
first class citizens

00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,319
um in drupal and people would start

00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,319
building out with them

00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,160
there's a decoupled menus initiative

00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,520
automated updates so all of the results

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,400
from these initiatives

00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:34,080
will be part of drupal 9 gradually and

00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,200
then they will all together be part of

00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,039
drupal 10.

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,799
and the things that they are replacing

00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,520
in case of the new front-end theme

00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,400
and claro they would be removed from

00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,559
double 10

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,080
so you would not see bardic and 7th

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,400
theme in drupal 10 anymore

00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,240
that's the plan uh but their

00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,080
replacements are being added gradually

00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,360
in drupal 9 so we can work out the

00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:55,840
problems with them

00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,679
we can see their adoption we can improve

00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,400
them uh even before drupal 10 is

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,480
released so you get all of those uh all

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,280
of those values already in drupal 9

00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,000
gradually

00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,000
every six months without the need to

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,160
wait for drupal 10.

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
and then the drupal 10 initiative is all

00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,960
about the boring things

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,760
about the platform itself if you want to

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,960
follow the

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:24,000
ma the highest level issue for

00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:27,679
drupal 10 this is the issue 3118143

00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,280
is the release drupal 10 in 2022 issue

00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:32,000
and that has chilled

00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,799
children issues for system requirements

00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,360
and

00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,799
how we update dependencies etc etc we're

00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,440
going to walk through the major things

00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,760
here

00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,600
but it's basically about about changes

00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,360
that we need to make to the platform

00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,200
it's not primarily about features that

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,520
we are building some of these changes

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,679
will result in features and improvements

00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,120
uh may result in performance

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,320
improvements may result in a bunch of

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,120
other benefits

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,679
but that's not the primary goal of the

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,600
drupal 10 initiative

00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,039
so the first thing of the drupal 10

00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,400
initiative that we already delivered in

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:06,640
drupal 91

00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:09,039
is php support uh it was a wild ride i

00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,120
i should say uh we updated all of drupal

00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,559
core and worked heavily with

00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,280
dependencies to make

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,840
their php compatible releases available

00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,080
and we

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,080
made it last minute pretty much with the

00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,520
laminas dependencies releasing a couple

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,919
days before

00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:26,400
we decided to make a new rc release of

00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:29,520
drupal 911 so we can incorporate that

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,440
as well so uh it's php8 support is

00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,679
included in 9.1

00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,360
this pertains to drupal core so

00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,679
contributed projects

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,880
if they are incompatible with php some

00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,640
of them maybe

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,720
then they need to release updates as

00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,000
well but they may just as well be

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,919
uh compatible with php 8. uh the

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,280
actual change that we're going to make

00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,360
in drupal 10

00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,880
so this support of php we already

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,799
delivered in drupal 9.

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,200
the actual change that we plan to make

00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:01,360
in drupal 10 is to require drupal

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:04,559
uh to require php 8 for drupal 10.

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,679
and that's because shortly after drupal

00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,360
10 is released

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:11,600
php7 will go unsupported by the php team

00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,520
so we'll need to move on from php 7

00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,320
because the php team will not support it

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,640
anymore

00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,039
so we plan to raise it to at least php

00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,080
8.0 based on the adoption we'll see if

00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,640
it's possible to raise it even higher

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,480
so basically the changes that we make at

00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,440
the top i list the things that we do in

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,360
drupal 9

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,000
and at the bottom the final thing that

00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,000
we will only do in drupal 10.

00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,200
the next step is composer two we

00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
delivered this uh

00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,720
even backward to eight point nine so you

00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,960
can use it in

00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,000
and eight you can use it in nine uh nine

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,000
one et cetera

00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,120
uh here we updated the core composer

00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,120
plugins um

00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,640
and the packages drupal.org endpoint and

00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,120
a bunch of other things

00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,880
you can go back and watch the initiative

00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,640
leads keynote for details

00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,919
and the eventual thing that we may

00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,799
change in drupal 10

00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,559
is remove compressor one support if you

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,720
look at the composer 2 announcement it

00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,320
says that composer 1 is now more or less

00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:09,039
end of life so it's a similar question

00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:11,120
of uh whether there's a problem there

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:13,760
composer is a developer tool

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:15,120
so it may be less of a problem because

00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,480
you're not running it live on your

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,600
production environment

00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,440
but it could still cause problems if we

00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,039
support end of life tools and they they

00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,320
could cause problems

00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:28,799
for our users oops

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,960
that's not the slide i'm going to so

00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:33,360
symphony 5 is the next

00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,360
interesting question so we released

00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,960
theoretic support for symphony 5

00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,200
0 in 91 theoretic meaning that you can

00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,600
you cannot explicitly update to symphony

00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,600
5 because of other

00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,799
other conditions but we updated all of

00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,480
our apis

00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,960
we have a testing issue where we update

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:55,360
to symphony 5 and we prove that it works

00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:58,559
we did not allow that in our composer

00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:01,039
composer requirements

00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:02,880
because of the way that we don't have

00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:04,320
minimum maximum dependency version

00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,919
testing

00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,120
uh we are testing with symphony 5.2 that

00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,760
was released recently

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,360
there is some interesting for us

00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,360
backwards and compatible changes in

00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,640
symphony 5.2

00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,320
uh primarily the services are now made

00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,240
private by default but we need them be

00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,600
public by default and

00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,080
um we have i think constraint plug-ins

00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,000
that we

00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,200
are using as if they were symphony

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,400
plug-ins but they are not actually

00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,120
symphony plug-ins

00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,520
so there's a few things that is in our

00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,280
use of symphony uh incompatible in

00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,200
symphony 5.2

00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,360
so we are trying to fix those up so we

00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,799
could be theoretically symphony 5.2

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,960
compatible

00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,600
but basically what we are doing here is

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:52,080
we are following the changes in symphony

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:54,720
and then uh and then fixing our own apis

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,600
in a backwards compatible way as much as

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,320
we can to be

00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,600
compatible with symphony five releases

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,520
the reason we are doing this

00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,240
is because triple time will need to

00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,080
depend on at least symphony 5.4

00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,520
and as i mentioned earlier the 0.4

00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,679
releases of symphony are

00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,880
long-term support releases that means

00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,760
that we get longer

00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,520
support for them unfortunately other

00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,720
minor releases of symphony are not

00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,280
long-term support

00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,840
they're only supported for six months

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,640
while

00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,159
we are supporting r minor releases for

00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,640
12 months

00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,679
so that's why we use symphony 4 4 and

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,240
drupal 9

00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,840
and we hope to update the symphony 5 4

00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,440
in drupal 10.

00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,000
um we are also hoping that we may be

00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,720
able to

00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,679
update to symphony 6. it's going to be

00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,559
released

00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,880
in november 2021 we don't really know

00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,840
what's going to be in there

00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,720
and symphony 6 will not have a long term

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,440
support release

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,960
by the time drupal 10 is released so

00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,320
symphony 6 will only get

00:23:52,960 --> 00:24:00,080
six months increments of support

00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,760
uh the way we we attempt to solve this

00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,600
is we negotiated with the symphony

00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,080
security team and we got two of the

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,480
drupal

00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,600
core committers to be in the symphony

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,400
security team

00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,440
and they are able to release security

00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,159
fixes

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,120
for drupal specific problems and symfony

00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:18,240
releases that are

00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,720
otherwise not supported anymore so

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,159
that is possible to have symphony

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,840
releases for

00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,480
otherwise unsupported symphony minor

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,679
versions for the sake of drupal

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,840
drupal's longer support timeline so if

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,440
we can update to symphony six if the api

00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,039
changes in 76 allow

00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,880
us to update drupal 9 enough to be 76

00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:39,919
compatible and then adopt symphony 6 and

00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,039
drupal 10

00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:45,360
then we can use this um the this option

00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:48,799
that we negotiated with the symfony team

00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,640
to update to symphony six so we could

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,320
possibly update to symphony six or even

00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,000
symphony six one which was

00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:56,880
which is also going to be available by

00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,039
the time drupal 10 is released

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,000
this would allow drupal 10 to have a

00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,760
longer time span

00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,279
because symphony 6 0.4 at the end

00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:07,279
is going to have a longer support

00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:10,000
timeline um

00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:12,080
so we'll see how that goes we don't know

00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:15,279
what's going to go into symphony 6 yet

00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:18,720
entirely we are at symphony five two now

00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:21,840
so uh we'll see how that goes

00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:23,360
next up now it's gonna now as

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,200
uh we're gonna see all the front-end

00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,240
stuff um a lot of

00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,640
the front-end stuff so there's jquery ui

00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,600
which has been mostly abandoned it's uh

00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,799
it's listed as an

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,400
emeritus project by the maintainers uh

00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:38,720
we removed many of the components

00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,480
already in drupal 9.0 we still have some

00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,679
components dialog out to complete drop

00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,919
button etc

00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,880
while still working on to remove um they

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:49,279
are being worked on on that issue

00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,039
and ultimately our goal with drupal 10

00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,679
is to remove all of jquery ui

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:55,600
and be done with jquery ui for good the

00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,000
problem with jquery ui is it's not being

00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,960
worked

00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,880
on but jquery itself is being worked on

00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,840
and there may be an incompatible jquery

00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,240
release

00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,440
uh that would not allow us to adopt a

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,600
new jquery release

00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,200
because we use jquery ui and that could

00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,960
cause a lot of problems for us in the

00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,039
future

00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,039
there's also just better solutions for

00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,559
things than the jquery ui components

00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,320
that we have and it's

00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:20,559
it's an emeritus project it's end of

00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:23,760
life uh jquery itself

00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:26,159
is not end of life um it didn't change

00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,120
our our use of jquery didn't change much

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,880
in drupal 9

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,240
but we are working on replacements for

00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,200
its components um

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,279
either way for other reasons um so we're

00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,240
working on jquery once replacement which

00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:38,720
is very close

00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,400
with our own jquery library and going to

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,000
work on ajax handling even handling and

00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,520
other things and that's the issue to

00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
follow for that

00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,120
and we think that the ideal scenario

00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,679
here is to remove

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,320
jquery from drupal 10 as well there are

00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:56,480
more dependencies that depend on jquery

00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:58,960
itself whoops still not that slide

00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,240
uh our backbone js implementation is

00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,039
kind of intertwined with

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,039
our jquery implementation backbone is

00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:08,480
used as a model view

00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:10,559
system for various things in core tours

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,240
toolbar quick edit contextual links

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:15,120
editor configuration

00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,360
so it's a model view and model view

00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,279
implementation behind the scenes

00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:21,200
uh we haven't changed it in drupal 9 as

00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,279
much as i believe but we

00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,320
hope to remove it again so we have

00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,480
prototypes

00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,679
for replacements either as vanilla js

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,640
implementation

00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,440
and as a vue js implementation in that

00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:34,080
issue

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,960
you're welcome to discuss it there uh

00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,799
again our

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,799
expectation is it's going to be removed

00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:41,919
and replaced with another solution

00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,919
backbone.js itself hasn't had um much

00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,240
activity in the past two years

00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,320
so it's again a thing that the time has

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,960
moved on from where we are

00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,360
in terms of this front-end tool there's

00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,559
also jquery joyride which is used for

00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,399
our tour uh so when there's like pop-up

00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,919
windows on the screen that tells you

00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,000
which part of the screen is used for

00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:05,200
what we haven't changed much

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,919
in this uh in drupal 9. we there's a

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,640
prototype

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,679
update for it using shepard.js which is

00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,520
based on

00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,039
proper js that we already adopted

00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:15,360
previously

00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:17,440
in drupal core so you can look at that

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,360
issue and again the expectation is

00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,640
jquery it will likely be removed in

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,080
drupal 10 entirely

00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,720
is there a lot of things that i'm

00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,440
listing and only very few people working

00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,840
on them so

00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:32,320
if we are to get these expectations

00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,679
um happen that we need more of you to be

00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,240
involved

00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,200
uh the big elephant in the room is sick

00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,360
editor

00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,520
five so ck editor for as i said is end

00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:46,000
of life at the end of 2023

00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,960
um so we need to move on from seeking to

00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,720
do four

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,279
and seek editor five is very similar

00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,679
now security four to sequential five is

00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,120
a very very similar change to drupal 7

00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,640
to drupal 8.

00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:02,880
um it has the same name

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,919
but otherwise it's an entirely different

00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,360
editor

00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,760
so it has a new object model uh that

00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,240
that

00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,000
models all the input that you use it's

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:14,240
great because you can do collaborative

00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
editing there's as there's a server

00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,240
component behind it you can do google

00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,880
docs time collaborative editing

00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,919
um their plugin system is different it

00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,200
depends on

00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:27,760
building your your secretary build with

00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,480
node.js locally and then pushing it up

00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:32,720
and the configuration of how our input

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,279
formats are happening would be

00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,279
possibly different and the data might

00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,360
need to be migrated from security 4 to

00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,399
security 5 or we need to make up a

00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,360
forgiving

00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,000
version of circular 5 for your old

00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,360
inputs

00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,120
because randomly pasted word input

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,039
will not necessarily work with this new

00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,320
object model anymore

00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:55,840
so it's a whole area of things that we

00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,320
need to work on

00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,320
uh the good news is that the ck editor

00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,600
team that company behind seek editor is

00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,440
ck source

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:05,840
they are very interested to work with us

00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,679
on this they've been on a buff

00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:09,520
earlier yesterday discussing this and

00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,159
we've had meetings with them before

00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,840
they have customers themselves on ck204

00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,520
that need to move on to five and have

00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,600
very similar problems

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,159
uh in our case we need to build a whole

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,960
tool on top of secure five so we our

00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:25,360
problems are a little bit more general

00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,080
it's not it's not specific sites where

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:32,880
you know the exact markup used etc

00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:35,520
but um but there's a a lot of overlap

00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,000
of the needs of the ck editor company

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,559
and

00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,880
the drupal community in general uh but

00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,840
this needs a lot more work

00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,440
there's a prototype module uh built on

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,120
that issue two nine six

00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,480
nine no two nine six six eight six four

00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,399
and there's a slack channel that we

00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,600
recently created the security five

00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,679
on drupal.select.com and that's where

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,919
you can join in this process

00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,240
um but we are still figuring out how to

00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,399
do exactly some of the the harder parts

00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,640
of this like how to do media previews

00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:07,840
how how does input format configuration

00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,720
interact with

00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:12,799
how the security module is configured

00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,840
how is the plugins going to be loaded

00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:18,320
cq editor 5 team itself is figuring out

00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,039
how they can use plug-in composition

00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,720
with

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:25,039
webpack dlls i believe um so yeah

00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,240
it's an exciting area where it's a lot

00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,080
of moving parts

00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,919
and we still need to figure this out but

00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:32,799
the goal here is to put

00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,760
security 5 support in drupal 9 ahead of

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,000
dribble 10

00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,960
and we can work out the problem areas

00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,799
and fix it up

00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,240
and drupal 10 is going to remove

00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:43,120
security 4

00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,240
and come with um cigarette five

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,799
exclusively

00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,480
we would still make security 4 available

00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,519
as a country project for people who need

00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,760
that but

00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:56,880
uh move to sick editor 5. encore

00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:59,760
so that's uh seek editor uh

00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,080
and the other very interesting area

00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,000
where

00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,600
we are still exploring and discussing a

00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,159
starter kit

00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,320
uh which we haven't made any moves on

00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,080
towards in drupal 9.

00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,320
it would change the paradigm of theming

00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,279
and responsibility of drupal themers

00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,200
i've been

00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,960
on the buff about this earlier today and

00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:19,519
john alvin

00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,679
made a very good remark about this is

00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,760
basically right now

00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,320
drupal core has a responsibility to

00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,200
provide you with a stable base theme

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,679
that you uh have runtime inheritance

00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,320
from

00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,240
in your theme and drupal core has this

00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,120
responsibility to not break that theme

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,720
at all

00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,320
but that also means that drupal core

00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,320
cannot fix the bugs in that theme and

00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,159
cannot improve that based theme

00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,840
so we need to wait for the next major

00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:45,440
version of drupal to make any breaking

00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,320
changes and make any fixes

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,919
that would require breaking changes and

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,679
the starter kit theme would move that

00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,159
responsibility over

00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,760
to the site owner so now what you would

00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,039
do is drupal would provide you with the

00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,720
starter kit theme

00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,559
and you would create a fork of that for

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:03,200
your site and use that

00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,120
and the fork of that the fork for your

00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,600
site would be stable because you

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,360
made a copy and it's yours and drupal

00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,240
car would be able to fix bugs and

00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,679
improve

00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,799
core markup we would need to provide

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,519
some tooling for

00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:19,360
to help you apply fixes when you make

00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:22,799
fixes to the base themes

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:24,880
to the start kit theme but but you

00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,799
would not necessarily require you would

00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,000
not necessarily be required to adopt

00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:31,200
those changes

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,120
uh in your themes so this is this is

00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,399
uh still under discussion we just had a

00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,720
buff about this

00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:37,840
basically discussing the concept and the

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,519
problem space

00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,679
this time we also had a similar

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,440
discussion at drupalcon global we don't

00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,760
have people working on this yet

00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,480
so this is an area would be really nice

00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,559
to

00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:52,880
get people jump in and work

00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,799
so drupal 10 will hopefully include a

00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,519
stark theme and tools

00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,720
to work with this better uh it's hard to

00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,840
say at this point whether

00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,600
that's gonna actually happen or not and

00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,120
finally we're also looking at removing

00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,159
features

00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,399
yes um so we removed some features in

00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,800
drupal 9. i don't know if you've noticed

00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,399
but we removed the simple test project

00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,599
and we removed the place block

00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:20,560
uh project as well from drupal core um

00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,520
and we plan to remove more things so

00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,760
currently we are

00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,520
discussing to have a better official way

00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,119
to deprecate modules

00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,119
and that's there's an issue for that and

00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,879
explicitly to remove the aggregator

00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,800
module from drupal core

00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,480
which is funny because greece and the

00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,240
jerusalem was just mentioning how

00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,000
futuristic trooper was

00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:39,679
to include the aggregator module back in

00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,800
the day and now we're saying we're going

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,599
to remove it

00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,159
um yeah it doesn't have a maintainer

00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,639
it's

00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,919
not used much and it uses a third-party

00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:50,720
library

00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:52,720
which has a release process that's

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,359
incompatible and is problematic for us

00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,320
to

00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,680
work with uh and it's not an ecosystem

00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,680
of projects that the

00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,760
country depends on that we would need to

00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,480
work with like views or layer builder or

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,119
other

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,920
general purpose things it's a more of a

00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:09,440
one-off

00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,440
feature so we are current we

00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:13,599
have been just actively discussing it

00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,960
this week in the core commuter team to

00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:20,160
remove that and this the um

00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,160
consensus seems to be um

00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,040
that we're gonna remove it and we're

00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:29,760
gonna possibly remove more of these

00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:33,200
less used single purpose maintainer less

00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,599
modules from drupal core so that's

00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,720
that discussion is on the last issue one

00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:41,119
three one five eight

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:44,000
six six nine and

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:45,760
yeah um so may remove more single so we

00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,480
may remove more single purpose modules

00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,480
we are not

00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,920
not planning to remove general

00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,640
subsystems as of

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,280
now there may be other drupal api

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,280
changes

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,040
uh that's not really the scope of the

00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,200
drupal 10 initiative

00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,200
um so that's a thing that just happens

00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,440
on the way uh to drupal 10.

00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,560
um once again the scope of the drupal 10

00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,520
initiative

00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,280
is to do these platform updates to keep

00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,760
drupal up to date secure

00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,839
have dependencies that are that are

00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:16,160
still supported and relevant

00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,880
and uh make the process of moving to

00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,720
drupal 10

00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,920
as seamless as possible that's the scope

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,520
of the drupal 10

00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,079
initiative so if there are drupal api

00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,880
changes our scope is to make those api

00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,560
changes as

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:29,280
seamless and as easy to adapt as

00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:32,320
possible our scope is not to make a lot

00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,560
of api changes that's not the scope

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,839
all right so the question is how long do

00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,160
we have and we are

00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:39,520
close to having taking me taking the

00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,920
questions by the way

00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,640
so the final question is how long do we

00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,560
have

00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,760
so we hope to do backwards compatible

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,880
changes in drupal 9

00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,599
up to 9.3 which alpha deadline is

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:55,440
october 25 2021 less than

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:59,280
one year from now okay

00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:02,240
so we want to um add calendar five

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,720
last less than one year from now we want

00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,200
to

00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,040
uh swap out jquery why we want to swap

00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,000
out like one js we want to swap out

00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,760
joyride

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,839
we want to do all of these things we

00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,440
want to provide starter kit theme

00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:17,520
uh in less than one year okay

00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,480
that's a lot of stuff for less than one

00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,079
year

00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,800
the reason we want to do this less than

00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,880
one year is because we don't want to do

00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,920
any disruptive changes that people need

00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,839
to adopt

00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,119
in the last half year we want to keep

00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:31,839
less half here

00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:34,839
before drupal 10's release for people to

00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:37,680
have time to adapt to these new changes

00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:40,880
so after um after

00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,200
nine three alpha deadline we oh we open

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,960
a nine four bench in the ten branch and

00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,960
then we make all of the destructive

00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,200
changes on the ten branch like removing

00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,560
security four removing jquery

00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,400
et cetera et cetera all of these

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,760
disruptive changes removing the modules

00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,200
that we wanted to remove

00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,160
that's only going to happen on the tem

00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,520
branch all of the preparations for that

00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:02,160
going to happen on the nine branch

00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,320
before so the introduction of the new

00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,440
security interaction of the replacements

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:08,800
for the jquery

00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,880
the joyride etc etc that's all going to

00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,400
happen on the nine branch as much as

00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:18,400
we can make happen right so

00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:20,800
yeah so that's how drupal 10 comes

00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:22,560
together and if you want to help create

00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,119
drupal 10 we have meetings every other

00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,119
monday

00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,240
at drupal 10 readiness channel on drupal

00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,040
slack

00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,000
the next one is planned for december

00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:32,079
21st

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,680
the last one was this monday we have a

00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,040
dedicated security five

00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:37,200
channel because that's one of the

00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,560
biggest front ends on and that's to

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,119
crack i guess

00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,960
and uh there's contribution tomorrow um

00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:44,560
that you're welcome to join on

00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,440
all of these things or most of these

00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:51,040
things and this is the part where

00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,400
i'm gonna take your questions so let's

00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,520
see

00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,680
um so mike asks if we should call it

00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:00,400
drupal x

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,400
uh i don't know marketing i don't know i

00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,440
don't think we

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,079
i don't know um if that's better or

00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,280
worse

00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:12,400
um may or may not be confusing though

00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:16,480
alejandro also says we should call it x

00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:18,960
uh yeah i don't know um

00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,240
it doesn't change the process it may

00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:23,839
change how we market it

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:27,119
at the end um

00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:28,640
uh ill show asks how about drupal 11

00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:32,079
over time

00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,640
um so yeah um so

00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:36,079
depending on so the only thing that we

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,200
know so far

00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:42,240
is based on whether we can

00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:45,040
we can adopt symphony 5 or 6 the

00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:47,119
potential lifetime of drupal 10

00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:48,880
will be set based on that and all the

00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,720
other dependencies that we have

00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:53,200
there may be other dependencies that are

00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:56,079
end of life much sooner and even if we

00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:58,720
adopt symphony 6 we will not be able to

00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,079
uh have a longer term drupal 10 lifetime

00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,320
i don't know

00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,000
uh but the only thing that we see so far

00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,040
at least i see so far

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,800
is if we can adopt symphony 6

00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:10,160
then that could lengthen our timeline

00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,920
for drupal 10

00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,800
and then we need to look at our other

00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:17,440
dependencies other major dependencies

00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,200
uh what's going to happen there a new

00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,800
development around the php unit

00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,599
dependency that kept

00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:28,319
causing us update problems in the past

00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,720
is that they started um having longer

00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:32,480
term support for pa uh old php versions

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,839
in php unit versions

00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:38,240
so i will not need to update php unit as

00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,359
aggressively as we did before that's

00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,359
useful for us that's

00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:43,839
it's been a lot of work for us to uh to

00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:47,440
keep adopting new php unit versions

00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:50,640
uh that was an area where where we

00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,400
we first saw problems earlier we'll see

00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,000
if there's any other dependencies that's

00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:58,319
going to cause us more

00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,640
work uh so ravi shankar

00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:02,160
asks uh drupal is getting updated so

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,079
fast without leaving space for the

00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,760
current versions why

00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,079
please explain um yeah so the reason we

00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,160
keep

00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:12,560
updating is because drupal decided to

00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:14,240
not write our own code entirely anymore

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,880
drupal decided that

00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,359
having drupal as our own code base means

00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,480
that

00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:22,880
that anybody who wants to use drupal or

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,319
develop for drupal needs to learn all of

00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,839
drupal or at least the

00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,319
parts of drupal that they want to

00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:30,480
develop with and with drupal 8 we

00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,760
decided that's a problem and it's better

00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:34,400
if we depend if we

00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,280
write drupal 8 on top of other

00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,319
well-proven

00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,880
systems and we adopt systems from the

00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:43,680
php community that have been evolved

00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,119
recently modern systems like composer

00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:47,119
and phpunit

00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,400
instead of writing our own testing

00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:51,599
system and our own

00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,839
packages package management etc and

00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:55,359
um so that's a benefit because we don't

00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:56,560
need to write all of that code in our

00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:57,760
own we don't need to maintain all that

00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,720
code on our own

00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,640
the the drawback there is that those

00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,200
tools keep evolving and we need to

00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,800
keep moving forward with them so the

00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,040
best we can do here

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,960
is what we did with the drupal 8-9

00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,720
process is to build tools

00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,880
and to build processes for our own

00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,000
changes to make them as seamless as

00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,359
possible

00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,880
that's why we built the project that

00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:20,400
they bought that's how you build upgrade

00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:23,040
status

00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,920
to to help this transition be as smooth

00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,160
as possible for our users

00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:29,680
and to give plenty of time between these

00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,280
versions when we define

00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,680
what the next version is going to be and

00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:36,000
when you are sort of forced to update to

00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:39,520
that version if you want to keeping on

00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,000
on drupal um to to

00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,040
to adopt that so that's why that's what

00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,440
we do

00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,520
to ease that transition but we are in

00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,359
this process now where php

00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:52,000
itself is releasing new versions much

00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:54,160
faster now than they did before

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:56,000
and the whole php ecosystem is moving in

00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,400
a much faster pace than

00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,280
it did previously and that's how that's

00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,280
how it is right now

00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:06,560
um so mosh weitzman says that i think

00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,319
drupal 10 readiness would be a more

00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:10,079
clear name otherwise it sounds like new

00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,839
features are in scope

00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,920
yes so the official name for the

00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:17,280
initiative is drupal 10 readiness yeah

00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,319
um i don't know if that was actually my

00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,560
i think that was my

00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,560
uh

00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,119
yeah just even the title of my slides

00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:26,640
were not that okay

00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:29,440
yeah so the official name for the

00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,280
initiative is drupal 10 readiness yes

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,040
uh and the name for the select channel

00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:35,599
is dribbling readiness

00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,599
um it's not the tripleton initiative

00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:40,079
that was misleading sorry

00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,960
um yeah so all of the things that we are

00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:43,280
building features

00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,960
are not part of the drupal 10 initiative

00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,119
they are built into drupal 9

00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,160
and they are drupal 9 initiatives if you

00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,000
ask me

00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:54,400
um and the drupal 10 initiative itself

00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,839
is about the platform

00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,440
but that doesn't mean that all of those

00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:00,079
things will not be part of

00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,079
drupal 10.

00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:08,079
[Music]

00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:10,400
um

00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,920
yeah so michael moritz asks maybe i have

00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,520
missed it but it seems this time around

00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,960
there are no great front-end framework

00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,520
discussions anymore

00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,000
is the conclusion uh by the way of some

00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,240
uh

00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,319
menu initiative to keep out of it and

00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,960
support whatever comes along one that in

00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,920
our

00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:27,760
in the long term mean no progress in the

00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,800
admin ui for example that's a great

00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:32,079
question

00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:34,160
um so there is still discussion

00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,440
on on what would be great for the back

00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:39,200
end as i

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:41,760
hinted on it the backbone

00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,640
replacement discussion includes a sample

00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,880
implementation

00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,960
for vanilla gs which is pure js it's

00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:50,960
just javascript

00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:53,920
and one in one prototype implementation

00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,200
using vujs which is a front-end

00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,760
framework

00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:00,240
but that discussion is still ongoing um

00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,839
so we don't really know

00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:04,319
i don't really have a definite answer to

00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:06,079
this whether we gonna have this

00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,200
front-end framework discussion again or

00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,800
we have this front-end framework

00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,440
discussion as part of

00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,480
some replacement um or as part of a

00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,599
larger

00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,359
uh planning hall uh the uh the decoupled

00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,440
menus initiative is not

00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:21,760
not focusing on one specific framework

00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,720
definitely because drupal

00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,800
because the front end of drupal needs to

00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,319
support whatever framework the sites are

00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:31,440
being built

00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:33,040
the back end of drupal that is a is

00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,960
somewhat of a different question

00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:41,040
um because uh having pluggable

00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:44,079
uh yeah having that be pluggable

00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,200
uh is a lot of possibly a lot of extra

00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,839
work

00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:50,079
unless there's there's various alternate

00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:53,440
implementations that are

00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:56,800
great enough for that all right

00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,400
i think i'm out of time at least on my
