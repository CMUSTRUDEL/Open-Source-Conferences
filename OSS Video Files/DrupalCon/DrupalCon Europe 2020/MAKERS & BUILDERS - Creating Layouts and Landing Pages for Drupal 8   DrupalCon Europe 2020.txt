Title: MAKERS & BUILDERS - Creating Layouts and Landing Pages for Drupal 8   DrupalCon Europe 2020
Publication date: 2021-01-13
Playlist: DrupalCon Europe 2020
Description: 
	Landing pages come in all shapes and sizes. We get a lot of site designs that are not built with Drupal (or any content management system) in mind and they usually involve a large number of diverse landing pages. Sometimes, the design assumes that each landing page will be lovingly hand-crafted and individually styled.

00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,079
sharing

00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,360
what i know so i've been doing drupal

00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,399
for many years

00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,079
worn many hats um as a front-end

00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,960

00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,000
now i usually work with clients and i'm

00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,320
more on the ux

00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,039
and content strategy side which is

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,640
really fun

00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,800
um and so now that's sort of the

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,719
perspective that i'm bringing

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,280

dot ca

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,840
i'm also on the drupal slack as

00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:08,880

or on twitter so feel free to reach out

00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,960
so what i really want to focus on today

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,080
when we're talking about

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,280
building um landing pages in drupal

00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,040
and providing more flexibility with

00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,799
how content looks and really creating

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,759
this kind of flexible content i want to

00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:29,040
focus on a little bit on content editors

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,960
and the content editor

00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,799
experience and the reason i think that

00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,079
that's important

00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,840
is that you know we build websites

00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,159
for a living we're kind of technical

00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,159
people most of us here um

00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,280
but there's lots of people out there who

00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,119
are relying on

00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,399
to make a website successful besides

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,640
that right you have

00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:50,000
um you have designers who are doing

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,680
branding you have

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,680
content experts who are actually coming

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,000
up with the content and marketers who

00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,960
are creating this more catchy content

00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,520
um and we need to we need to also build

00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,399
tools for them we need to enable them

00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:05,920
otherwise um what we're building is kind

00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,119
of going to fall flat

00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,640
so if if your website is successful when

00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,080
you launch it on day one that's great

00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,120
but you also need to

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,760
build um build tools for the people who

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,800
are gonna

00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,800
take that and run with it

00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,200
so that comes down to the question of

00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,319
like what what kind of tools do these

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,840
content editors

00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,520
want like what do they need to be

00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,800
successful like what

00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,680
what are we actually building um so

00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,599
these days when we're looking at new new

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,160
websites or we're looking at a refresh

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,920
project

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,280
and we're looking at what did you know

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,760
what are the designs like

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,800
um you know for the past few years

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,680
actually

00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,400
most designs that i that come across my

00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,720
desk

00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,640
have some elements that look kind of

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,760
like this they're kind of like

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,120
a page that's a combination of things

00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:59,280
they're really um trying to to sell a

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,239
product or sell an idea

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,400
um and they're combining content that's

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,000
more traditional content with

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,640
more marketing content more visuals more

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,120
uh videos that play within the content

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,159
um

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,040
they tend to be more of a conglomeration

00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,879
of things and

00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,080
sometimes we call these magazine style

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:23,200
pages or landing pages

00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,200
and they tend to be more flexible um

00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,120
and content editors they see these

00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,799
designs too right and when i see these

00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,239
designs i might think oh yeah i could

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,000
build that out of

00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,400
some blocks and that would be easy to

00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,840
build um but the content editor might be

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,840
thinking something else right they might

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,080
be thinking oh i could create

00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,120
100 of these pages they could all look

00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,319
different

00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,440
um and so we have some assumptions

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,360
here when we're when we are um

00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,040
when we're building and and the editors

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,439
have assumptions

00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,360
too um so we see this again and again

00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,319
with pages that are really visual

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,439
and can uh display kind of a combination

00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,920
of content

00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,560
um and you know you might be expected to

00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,799
build

00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,480
many of these pages that all have kind

00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,680
of variations

00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:11,760
um so a landing page or a home page

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,319
might be an example or kind of a topic

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:16,160
page might be another example um but

00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,600
you're going to see these pages

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,320
of course arising and so then the

00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,479
question is

00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,240
for these more flexible pages that don't

00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,040
really fall into the category of

00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,880
traditional content

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,160
how do we actually put these together

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,960
and i

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,240
i make a distinction um and maybe it's

00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,320
just a made up one

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,560
um but i make a distinction between page

00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,840
building and layout building

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,680
when i think of page building as being

00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,120
the idea that

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,120
you can provide a tool that allows the

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,040
user to define their own content for

00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,360
certain set of pages

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,199
and they can construct those pages out

00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,160
of different components

00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,199
and then layout building is more like

00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,320
well

00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,360
what's what's the layout of of uh

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,440
more standardized content supposed to be

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,800
so i'm sure many of you have already

00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,919
tried the layout builder

00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,520
which is in drupal 8 drupal 9 as well

00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,880
um and you've probably tried it and

00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,080
maybe you've tried it

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,520
for using for you've tried to use it to

00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,440
create a layout for

00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,039
a standard type of content like you say

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,240
my articles are always going to look

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,560
like this

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,520
my recipes are always going to look like

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,000
that

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,600
um and that that's like pre-defining the

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,320
layout the layout of those types of

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,720
pages

00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,880
but page building is more like i'm going

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,520
to choose the layout and the content

00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,160
i'm gonna start from scratch with both

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,479
and then

00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,759
come up with an idea for what my page

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,000
looks like

00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:49,600
and of course this provides a lot more

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,039
flexibility which can be a good thing

00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,919
and a bad thing

00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,800
okay so to get into the more specifics

00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,800
of this

00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,800
so when i think of like creating a

00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,199
layout and using

00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,160
layout builder going in looking at my

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,080
content type

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,919
i have a recipe content type what do i

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,319
want this to look like i can drag and

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,400
drop drop the different elements of that

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:15,759
content type around on the page so i

00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:18,319
think of this as being layout building

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,479
and uh page building is more like okay

00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,479
i'm starting from a blank slate

00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:26,240
i'm going to select a set of

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,560
blocks that are going to appear on this

00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,840
page and then i'm going to drop

00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,280
the content in and i'm going to decide

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,319
what the content is and i'm also going

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,880
to decide

00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,880
how those content elements fit together

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:47,600
and there's different tools for

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,280
the page building part so if you want

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,759
somebody to be able to construct this

00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,160
kind of

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,680
layout with whatever content they want

00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,520
you have different options

00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,919
but i think the most important thing to

00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,280
keep in mind is that you're designing

00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,560
a tool so you're not just building a set

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,400
of pages

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,160
because drupal is much more flexible

00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,639
than that you're actually creating the

00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,560
tool

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,000
that other people hopefully you're not

00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,120
the only one adding content to your

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,319
website

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:18,000
um that other people can also use

00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:20,720
to build pages and create more content

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,360
um and whatever approach you take

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,039
whatever

00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,199
whatever you do the truth is you are

00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,440
designing a tool so the decisions you

00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:31,360
make have to be kind of

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:35,120
tailored to that so i have a couple

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,039
examples of um of

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,039
landing pages that we can look at

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,160
together and we can kind of think about

00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:42,639
how

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,080
complex these are and what tool we would

00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,240
use for the job

00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,680
um and so at this point i'm thinking

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,639
about the flexibility required and the

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,120
how complex the layout is so i have a

00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,319
little

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,720
very very short video so what like don't

00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,879
close

00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,879
don't blink because you have to watch

00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,960
the video

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,840
uh whoops it didn't didn't play okay

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,840
let's try that again

00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:14,960
i would like this to play there we go

00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,840
um so here we're gonna see

00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,199
um like scrolling down a page how

00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,919
complex

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:27,520
is this page we would see like um

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:30,000
we would see content appearing

00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:43,039
in a set of content components one after

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:43,039
the next and let me try again

00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,800
okay i'm gonna move on so

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,600
uh in the landing page i was showing

00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,000
there was like a banner at the top

00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:02,640
um and then there might have been

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,920
another content component underneath

00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,640
um that maybe showed a call to action

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,080
maybe a news a set of news items

00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,519
underneath that

00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,640
um and i would call it a simple

00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,839
layout because each element is kind of

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,920
self-contained

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:22,320
so there's no two elements sitting next

00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,240
to each other so the yellow blocks here

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,000
these each i would call a content

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,959
component and it could be

00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,760
any of these examples i named like a

00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,080
list

00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,040
it could be a a video it could be an

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,720
image it could be

00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,959
a call to action it could be a simple

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,600
button and it can have its own

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,839
internal layout like for example if you

00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,440
have a list of blog posts maybe those

00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,440
blog posts appear

00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,720
three in three columns you know each

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,040
next to each other

00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,800
but that is in itself just one content

00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,600
component that you can move around the

00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,839
page

00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,600
so that would be like a relatively

00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,360
simple page where you don't actually

00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,480
have to have elements sitting next to

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,360
each other

00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,200
um and so i would say that this is like

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,000
a kind of two dimensional like you can

00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,920
move things up

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
and down and you can select what things

00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,560
they are

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,240
um and now i have a more fancy one and

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,279
we'll see if this video works

00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,200
this is for a landing page um that has a

00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:20,800
little bit more going on

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,720
so there are more components

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,240
sitting next to each other so i'm not

00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,800
going to wait for the video

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,279
um you can just trust me so if you go to

00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,680
many

00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,959
many landing pages out there that you

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,880
see designs for

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,399
you'll see that there are elements

00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,519
sitting next to each other so maybe you

00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,760
have a news list

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,880
sitting next to an events list that's

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,440
pretty common

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,880
or maybe you have three call outs for

00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,600
different

00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,959
different things or three kind of uh

00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,880
almost

00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,480
advertisements or calls to action

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,360
sitting next to each other in three

00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,800
columns

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,800
and so you're mixing and matching

00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,760
components you're able to move things up

00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,680
and down the page

00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,800
but you're also allowed you're also able

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,880
to pick a layout

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,160
in which you'll place these components

00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,720
and i would call this more like a

00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,480
three-dimensional like a more complex

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:11,600
um landing page

00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:15,519
um and so if i just had to be

00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:17,920
really uh if i if i just had to pick

00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,800
like what's the simplest technology for

00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,279
each one

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,320
i might say well for the for the first

00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,560
example

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,360
for the two-dimensional one i could i

00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,680
could do this

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,360
with paragraphs and so many of you have

00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,600
used paragraphs one of the most

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,440
popular modules for drupal right and

00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,640
paragraphs allows you to add different

00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,959
components

00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,959
and you can drag them up and down

00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,680
because you can change the order

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,839
so i can with paragraphs add a banner

00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,519
paragraph a call to action paragraph and

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,920
a newslisting paragraph

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,040
and then i can switch the order as i

00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,839
want on the page

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,240
so i get a good amount of flexibility

00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,160
but

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,839
paragraphs does not have a good tool for

00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,839
placing things next to each other in a

00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,839
land it's not meant for that

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,959
it can be engineered to do that but it's

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,519
not like

00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:05,360
what the tool was designed to do whereas

00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,880
the layout builder provides a lot more

00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,360
flexibility

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,800
and it's designed to handle layouts and

00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,720
so you can very easily

00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:20,240
create this type of landing page with

00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:20,240
also layout complexity and flexibility

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,560
but i don't think that that's the only

00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,480
measure that we should use

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,240
to pick between one and the other like

00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,480
oh if it's really simple we can use

00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,880
paragraphs if it's really complex and

00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,120
well really complex if it has layout

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,320
um aspects to it let's use layout

00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:42,160
builder i don't think that that's

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,600
quite right and and so i want to take a

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,279
step back and think about things

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,160
maybe more from the content editor

00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,399
perspective so last year or

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,200
what earlier this year i had a chance to

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,920
do some usability testing

00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,560
of the layout builder and of paragraphs

00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,360
and

00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,320
the purpose of the test was just to see

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,279
given a

00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,480
very simple layout given a very simple

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,880
landing page

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,720
standalone landing page if we give

00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,200
people the layout builder and we give

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,279
people paragraphs

00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,800
which one of them is easier for them to

00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:17,360
use which one of them do they like

00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,480
more um just like how do they respond

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,440
what are their impressions

00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,519
and we gave these to content editors um

00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,480
now the content editors did

00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,120
already know drupal um but they didn't

00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,800
know these

00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,120
these tools and they already

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,720
um had some experience like working with

00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,760
content so they had a little bit of

00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,839
background these weren't brand new users

00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:42,000
and the other kind of caveat is that we

00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,839
also

00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,519
did some configuration in advance we

00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,480
didn't just give people drupal out of

00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,560
the box and say

00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,000
build a landing page we did configure

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,320
the layout builder

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,279
we configured paragraphs and what we did

00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,839
is we set up

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,760
um for layout builder we set up some

00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,480
block types for paragraphs we set up

00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,880
some paragraph

00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,399
types just to allow the user to create

00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,279
some simple components

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,560
on the page so that they could actually

00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,199
do the task

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:12,560
um without doing configuration they all

00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:15,279
they had to do was add content

00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:18,320
so we had kind of a process we we took

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:22,000
this seriously we recruited some users

00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,680
um our use cases were uh just

00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,199
page building so we didn't do the whole

00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:29,519
like layout building

00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:31,440
part um we did uh

00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,720
create a whole script so that users

00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,399
would know exactly what

00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:38,079
to do and we recorded the results and

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,680
did a bit of a write up and i can share

00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,199
that with you at the end like a more

00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,079
detailed

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:46,720
analysis of what all these users were

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:51,920
thinking and feeling

00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,920
um and so the

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,240
study i mean we were trying to get them

00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,680
to build a page that looked like this so

00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,320
if you're looking at the screen now you

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,000
see

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,600
there's like a big banner at the top

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,079
with a with a

00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:06,320
call to action button and some text and

00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:10,320
these things are in different columns

00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,000
um and so you know you could interpret

00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,920
this as having a layout because there's

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,399
an image on one side and text on the

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,639
other

00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,760
or you could interpret it as having just

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,959
one piece of content

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,680
after the other so either approach would

00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,279
work

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,560
in this case so when we showed people

00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:30,079
the layout builder

00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,320
the first impressions um well people

00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,000
were a little bit intimidated at first

00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,959
and part of the reason

00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,199
is that we didn't we we customized the

00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,160
interface to add some block type so that

00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,720
they could build

00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,519
the pieces of the page but we didn't

00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,000
customize

00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,959
the layout builder to like remove

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,959
options or

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,279
or simplify it because we just wanted to

00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:53,360
see how people would interact with it

00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,040
um and people were overwhelmed by the

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,880
amount of

00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,440
options that they have just the quantity

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:01,920
of of links when you go to

00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,759
create content and people were also not

00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,959
surprisingly confused by the labeling

00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,600
like ads section

00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,480
ad block these kind of term terminology

00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,759
you know even if

00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,040
you know drupal and you know what a

00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:15,360
block is you don't necessarily associate

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,199
adding a block with putting a piece of

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,040
content into a layout

00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,800
so it was a little bit confusing at

00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,120
first just the

00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:25,279
the terminology and i would say that

00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,480
this is a terminology that speaks

00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:31,920
more to site builders uh

00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:33,920
than to content editors so the language

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,839
of content editors if you use a tool

00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,079
like

00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:42,000
um you know

00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:44,160
wordpress or craft cms or um

00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,120
like these these types of platforms they

00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:47,519
talk more about

00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,839
adding content and they use more content

00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,920
authoring

00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:53,279
terms so yeah the first question where

00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,079
do i create content

00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,199
but pretty soon you know you click the

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,199
options and you

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,320
figure it out these content editors were

00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,000
able to

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:07,280
do the task and um they were able to go

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:10,319
in and add a block and figure out

00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:13,919
what to what to put

00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:15,839
on the page based on the content uh the

00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,720
block types that we gave them

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,919
um editing the page was again a little

00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,160
bit of a challenge because

00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,600
again the terminology is for more for

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,039
site builders so

00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,919
using the the link configured to edit a

00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,360
block was not

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,120
necessarily intuitive um and then we

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,000
compared it to paragraphs

00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:38,000
so with the layout builder users did

00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,080
have to click

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,679
many times really to just place one

00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:44,240
block on the page

00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,760
so if if your job is a content editor

00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,440
and you're fast because some content

00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,440
editors are fast

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,600
they want to just get the content in as

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,760
soon as possible and layout builder did

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,679
require a bunch of clicks whereas

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,559
paragraphs although you do have to add

00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,919
the paragraphs

00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,240
once you've added them you just have

00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,600
this huge form and everything

00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,600
everything's there all the fields are

00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,000
there you see everything at once

00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,600
and you can put everything in so a big

00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,679
form might be intimidating

00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,720
but again content editors who are used

00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,840
to using

00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:15,360
drupal and building complex content um

00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,400
they're willing to

00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,520
to use a form that's that's long and so

00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:24,799
they um they did find

00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,320
this interface like faster to use i

00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:30,480
would say

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:33,280
um that being said um

00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,640
a lot of them pointed out that for a

00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,200
very long page

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,000
and some landing pages are incredibly

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,039
long

00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,360
probably too long that the

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,160
paragraphs option was would make it

00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,320
harder to

00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,000
locate what you're trying to edit um

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,679
it's a bit disorienting

00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,480
um definitely for people who aren't

00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:55,679
familiar with it it's going to be a

00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,000
a bit of a learning curve um and then we

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,760
did

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,360
we couldn't help ourselves we had to

00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,640
also compare

00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,320
the other two options in drupal to

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,480
gutenberg because

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,360
everyone's talking about gutenberg like

00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,919
why doesn't drupal just have gutenberg

00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,480
and so we wanted to see how this would

00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,679
line up

00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,919
so given the same you know the same task

00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,600
go and build this landing page how did

00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,919
people find

00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,799
the gutenberg interface and what we

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,799
found is that people

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,799
really liked it at first so the first

00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,919
impression was very positive

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:32,080
i think it's more uh it's more welcoming

00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,440
it's immediately speaking to content

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,799
editors it's speaking the

00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,400
the language um right away you see the

00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,080
components that you want to add

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,240
and there's even instructions right

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,480
there like add title

00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,919
write something it's it's pretty

00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,799
friendly

00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:51,120
um but that said as soon as some

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:54,160
complexity was added like oh

00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:57,200
now we want to make

00:19:54,160 --> 00:20:00,640
this text that we added into a title

00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,880
or let's change the styling a little bit

00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,760
or let's even move things up and down on

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,200
the page

00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,960
these types of tasks just like modifying

00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,559
what you're writing because the

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,000
interface tries to be so

00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:16,960
simple it hides some of these features

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,760
and it's like you know it's like the

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,000
classic

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,679
um apple approach of like let's just

00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,120
have one button

00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,440
and then that one button is supposed to

00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,480
do everything uh the interface really

00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,080
relies on

00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,720
this simplicity so uh we found that it

00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,720
was

00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:35,280
great for first impressions great for

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,880
like inviting the user to add content

00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:42,480
but actually not that intuitive for more

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,400
kind of complexity or necessarily

00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,919
figuring out what all the options are

00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,600
because everything wasn't really just

00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,080
apparent um

00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,960
and then really content editors do

00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,440
understand

00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,720
the importance of standardization and

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,080
they were asking

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,840
you know what does this do does this

00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,360
create html

00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,120
and they were concerned as well about

00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,960
the fact that this doesn't seem as much

00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,000
like structured content as the drupal

00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,840
tools

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,039
um and so on on a more technical note i

00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,480
would say that

00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,320
while gutenberg feels like a similar

00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,880
interface of page building

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,440
it doesn't give you the same results of

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,919
having

00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,200
structured content that then you can use

00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,159
um

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,960
really like in a drupal way and i would

00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:27,120
say

00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,880
layout builder allowing you to create

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,200
these content blocks

00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,320
uh probably does the best job of that

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,799
paragraphs

00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,480
also gives you some flexibility although

00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,320
there's a bit of an annoyance of the

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,360
relationship between paragraphs and

00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:43,919
and your notes other content um

00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,080
um but gutenberg certainly doesn't give

00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:49,679
you the same amount of

00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,679
uh control over your content

00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,039
um oh and then the last note about

00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,919
gutenberg is it does look great on the

00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,600
back end

00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,360
but when you publish your content it

00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,159
doesn't actually look the same as in the

00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,640
editor

00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,720
and authors did find this confusing the

00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:07,280
other two interfaces like

00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,760
paragraphs um nobody expects that the

00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,200
pair

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,880
that the front end of the site is going

00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,559
to look like this you know that you're

00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,400
on an editing page

00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,080
um and so that was sort of a bit of a

00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,200
letdown with with gutenberg

00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,919
that the front end didn't look the same

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,919
as the back end

00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,720
so a few just general takeaways i would

00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,600
say keep in mind the content editor

00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,720
perspective

00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,080
um you want to think about the content

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,120
editor workflow

00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,679
like what how do authors create content

00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,760
on

00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:39,360
in on your website like is it that

00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,440
they're actually authoring the content

00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,400
in drupal are they copying pasting from

00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,960
somewhere else

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,039
how do they decide what layout to use

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,640
are their instructions

00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:52,000
getting a sense of that workflow can

00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:52,000
help you pick a better tool

00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,000
editors like layout oriented editing

00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,600
like they do like the

00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,280
layout builder they like the idea that

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,880
they can drag and drop things around the

00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,679
page and pick a layout

00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:05,520
but they don't want limitless options uh

00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,799
the most options is not necessarily the

00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,280
best things

00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,080
so you'll notice now when you use layout

00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:13,520
builder

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,400
um well i maybe you'll notice because

00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,360
i'm telling you

00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,159
but there are really great modules that

00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,400
will rest

00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:22,000
restrict the options and i would suggest

00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,080
using them because

00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,440
the extra flexibility is actually just

00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,280
like with permissions you know if you

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,400
give somebody all the permissions it's

00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,679
harder to use same thing with with the

00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,280
layout builder

00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,039
the layout builder is more complex

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,960
because it's more flexible so

00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,240
content editors get that they're willing

00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,039
to learn if

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,799
they can get more out of a tool and

00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,480
paragraphs is really

00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,480
quite similar to standard content

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,840
editing so

00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,360
there's going to be less of a learning

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,360
curve there if you have people who

00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,000
already know drupal

00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:56,159
people don't know drupal i think you you

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,440
won't get so much out of that

00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:02,640
um so if you are

00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,640
building a website and you're

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,480
picking one of these options just some

00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,720
general guidelines like

00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,600
don't add too many block and paragraph

00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,679
types

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:16,559
um i have seen websites now that have

00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,520
42 paragraph types and i think that's

00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,520
too many

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,880
i think it's safe to say kind of like

00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,279
with content types

00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,799
an overload of options maybe there it

00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,480
means that there's something wrong with

00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:32,320
the logic so try to limit that

00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:36,000
um having a lot of

00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,919
um of duplicated content

00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,600
is not good either like it's easy when

00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,480
you start to create landing pages to

00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,559
just

00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,240
duplicate the same little content

00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:46,720
components all over the place

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,240
it's a great idea to start using um

00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,480
reference fields

00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,159
and to structure your content well this

00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,559
is still important

00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,320
even though you're creating a flexible

00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:59,120
content model

00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:01,200
um and with that said i would also

00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,039
encourage you to continue to use content

00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,679
types that are more standardized and

00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,600
structured

00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:09,919
for a content that permits that so

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,760
if you have a thousand products on your

00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,720
site i don't recommend using this kind

00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,360
of flexible

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,640
page building model for all of those try

00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:21,200
to keep your content consistent

00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,720
the the number of options you give for

00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,919
editors so if you're using layout

00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,480
builder

00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,039
there are three modules i recommend

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,360
using

00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,279
there's layout builder restrictions

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,880
there's the layout builder ux

00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,120
module and you can also try layout

00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,039
builder modal and i know there's new

00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,279
modules every day it seems for layout

00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:43,760
builders so check out the list

00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:46,000
on on drupal.org and you can also

00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,760
uh try to avoid using site builder

00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,720
terminology and this is hard because

00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,799
there's already

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,000
a lot of terminology just built into the

00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:55,120
interface

00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,080
um but recognize that that's there try

00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:59,039
to have more

00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,960
user-friendly terminology for your names

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,440
of things like block types or paragraph

00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,080
types

00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,520
and just um recognize that words like

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,720
configure are not

00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,799
friendly um

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,960
and finally content editors love the

00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,760
media library

00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,320
so definitely when you're demoing this

00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,440
to them

00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:22,400
show them that use that tool like

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,279
they love being able to reuse media in

00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,960
general so

00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:28,080
just just keep that in mind okay so i

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,080
guess this is the part where i'm

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,279
supposed to tell you which one

00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:35,200
to pick which option to pick should you

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,760
use layout builder for your

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,640
new website or should you use paragraphs

00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,080
um

00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,400
i think that uh both options

00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,840
you know both options maybe still have a

00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,080
place

00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,400
personally i love the idea of using

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,799
layout builder because it's the new tool

00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,679
it's obviously you know built into

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,840
drupal

00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,600
it's got all this flexibility so you can

00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,400
do everything with it but you can also

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,240
restrict

00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:02,320
so it seems just like if i had to pick

00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:04,080
one like i would go with layout builder

00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,120
but that being said there are many

00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,760
reasons to use paragraphs

00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,480
it is going to be faster for people to

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,720
add content especially if they know

00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,320
drupal and they just boom boom boom want

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,080
to get some content in and there's no

00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,480
layout

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,880
that you mean no elements side by side

00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:25,039
um there's no reason not to continue

00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,640
using paragraphs for

00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:31,679
many use cases um

00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,600
i would say the pros like it it

00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,200
it can give you less flexibility right

00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,840
because you're not introducing this

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,200
extra

00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,159
layout variable into your pages and that

00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,440
can often be

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,679
really good um

00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,679
it's it's not designed though to manage

00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,840
layouts so if you are trying to manage

00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,559
layouts with paragraphs i would tell you

00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,000
maybe maybe this is the time to switch

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,720
to light builder

00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,679
and um it can make it hard using

00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,200
paragraphs to visualize the end product

00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:03,760
with the layout builder you are going to

00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,440
see a little bit more what your content

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,679
is going to look like in the back end

00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,240
and that can really help especially for

00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:13,360
content editors who are more

00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:16,559
visual thinkers and

00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,000
that that tends to be a lot of us so i

00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,679
would say it would provide like a more

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,720
pleasing user experience

00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:24,880
overall once you learn the tool

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,320
and then i would also keep in mind some

00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,600
really important

00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:31,760
details so all everything i've been

00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,880
talking about today is like

00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:38,000
what drupal 10 years ago or 20 or

00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,000
20 years ago was not really designed for

00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,679
so the paragraphs and layout builder

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,600
like the way that i'm talking about

00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,960
using these tools for page building

00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:49,600
this is not really like structured

00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,200
content structured content types

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,720
and so that means that if you just

00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,960
blindly start making

00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,880
really flexible landing pages you might

00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,440
be throwing away a lot of the benefits

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,399
that you get from structured content

00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,240
so things like accessibility and seo are

00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,200
really important for these types of

00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,000
pages

00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,720
and if not more important because these

00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,679
are maybe

00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:13,200
the most engaging pages of your website

00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,159
so it's really important

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,679
to maintain a semantic and structured

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,720
content as much as possible

00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:23,520
so that means for these types of pages

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,760
make sure that you have metadata that

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:28,480
you have the fields to map

00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,880
to the metadata that you need for the

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,840
page

00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:33,279
make sure that the page has a title that

00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,559
you can actually use

00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:39,279
as an h1 make sure that

00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:41,360
every page you know has a description

00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:44,799
that's going to show up in your

00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,480
google searches right um

00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,919
and make sure that the ordering of

00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,080
headings is

00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:52,320
actually logical and that the markup

00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,679
really aligns to what the content is

00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,600
so that's key for both your

00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,960
accessibility practice

00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,960
and um and good seo

00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:02,000
and then the other main caveat that i

00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,760
would just

00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,480
point out is that um if

00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,399
like many of us you have websites now

00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,919
that are built using paragraphs

00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,679
going out and switching to layout

00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,600
builder tomorrow

00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:18,799
it requires a lot of work especially if

00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:22,480
you have many many landing pages already

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,880
so i suggest doing a proper analysis of

00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,279
this

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,440
actually look at what you have think

00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:30,960
about the work to retrain people

00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,960
and migrate everything over um migrating

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,520
to layout builder

00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,960
is a heart still a hard problem so we're

00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,640
doing this now

00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:43,200
with some projects drupal 7 to drupal 9

00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,080
adopting layout builder and doing

00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,360
migration

00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,720
work and that's tricky work so take that

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,159
into account when you're making your

00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:53,039
choice it's not just about

00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,440
the ideal tool it's about how you get

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,120
there

00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:00,320
and how you adapt the people and the

00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,320
and the content and everything

00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:04,080
uh and finally there's lots of great

00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,600
resources out there so

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:11,039
i have on the evolving web blog

00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:13,200
there is this kind of um

00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,360
overview of what i've talked about today

00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,480
there's also some results of that

00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:20,799
usability study we did um

00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,679
and then lots of great modules that i

00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:27,360
recommend trying out for layout builder

00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:30,399
and lastly here um georgia tech

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,799
is a university in the states and

00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,559
they're using layout builder and they

00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:35,279
have great documentation for their

00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,039
editors

00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,840
and i just recommend checking it out as

00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:42,240
like a great example of what you can

00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,880
use to explain to your content editors

00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,559
how

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,000
layout builder works and all the choices

00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,640
available i think they did a great

00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:51,440
job so i like linking to them and giving

00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,960
them a bit of a shout out

00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,640
um and finally there is lots of

00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,000
stuff to learn about drupal so if you're

00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,919
new to drupal i

00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,200
do run a training program as part of

00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:04,000
evolving web

00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,880
if you're curious about that um you can

00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,279
find out more

00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,960
evolving web dot c training and we have

00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,559
lots of kind of

00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,039
blended learning coming up in the new

00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:15,120
year so online but

00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,720
keeping it fun it's not like six hours

00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:19,840
on zoom so

00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,640
check that out um and now i hope we have

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,880
time

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,320
for questions and i hope you have

00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:28,720
questions

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:33,200
or comments um or your own opinions

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:34,720
so i'm just going to stop sharing

00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,640
which hopefully is okay that i stopped

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,399
sharing and i'm going to go

00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:43,600
over to the questions on

00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,559
the platform oops hi and thank you very

00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,080
much suzanne

00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:51,519
um great talk there

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:54,559
um so we've got a few questions uh which

00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,080
uh generally

00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,159
about layout builder rather than

00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,200
paragraphs

00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,760
several people pointing towards the link

00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,120
module

00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,919
layout paragraphs um

00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:10,720
would you would you care to comment on

00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:13,919
that or have you not experienced that

00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:17,120
oh yes so

00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:19,360
that's a great module uh uh

00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,919
i have i have tried it out although we

00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,679
have not yet used it on a project

00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:27,200
um and i think it just

00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,799
speaks to the fact that people love

00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,320
paragraphs they're using it and then

00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,279
they want the flexibility of layout

00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,480
builder

00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:36,880
uh so i think you know so this

00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:38,799
this makes your choice even harder you

00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,320
get a module that fills in the gap

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:43,679
between the two

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:46,080
um i i do think that

00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:46,880
using layout builder makes sense because

00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,320
it's in core

00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,760
and it's just but i i can understand why

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,200
people are using modules like this

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,200
because that first layout builder does

00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,640
seem really hard to use

00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,440
um and so and if like i mentioned with

00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,679
the

00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,320
cost of changing ownership like if you

00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,480
can simply drop in a module rather than

00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,519
switch all the content over to a new

00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:10,079
content structure

00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,879
that's definitely a better that's the

00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:15,520
choice i would

00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:18,399
take thank you um

00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,679
so katarina is asking what should be the

00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,879
criteria

00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:25,440
to select the available tools in wysiwyg

00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:27,040
in your opinion yeah i think if you're

00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,879
starting from

00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,639
if you're starting from scratch like if

00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:33,599
you're building a

00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,639
new set of pages and you don't have that

00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,919
concern

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,720
um i would look at the design itself

00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:41,679
and what types of options you want to

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,119
provide

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,480
so the first thing i would look at would

00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:45,919
be the what kind of the little

00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,960
assessment i tried to do

00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,919
showing the videos that didn't work um i

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,760
would look at

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:53,520
the complexity of the landing pages

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,280
themselves so

00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,560
are there actually um

00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,240
[Music]

00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,079
are there is there actually a layout

00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:02,800
component to what you're trying to build

00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,520
are there two components that sit next

00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,240
to each other

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,800
in a two column or a three column layout

00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,920
um

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,720
and if not then you could simply use

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,440
paragraphs

00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,680
and that might be a more easy option for

00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,920
your team because maybe you've used

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,880
paragraphs before and you don't

00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,079
anticipate

00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,599
having this added complexity

00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,599
so i would say in that case if you've

00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,800
used paragraphs before the layout's

00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,240
really simple

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,960
and then i would go with that tool you

00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,800
know it's

00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,240
probably going to be easier for you to

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,920
adopt it um

00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,359
but if you anticipate that you might

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,160
have

00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:42,160
you know you might want more flexibility

00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,160
now or down the road

00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,599
um then i would go with layout builder

00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,280
because it's going to give you all those

00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,680
options

00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,800
which which kind of nicely uh segues

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,280
into tim's

00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:54,560
question uh do you use layout builder

00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,520
and paragraphs together

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,880
on one site or just choose one or the

00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:02,640
other

00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:05,839
of course you could do that yeah

00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,200
so people also use paragraphs for other

00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:10,320
things than just

00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:13,040
building landing pages um

00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:13,680
so i'll give you an example so i'm uh

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:16,400
i'm

00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,040
working on a project right now where

00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,680
there

00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,040
are there's already a ton of content

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,720
that exists it's like

00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:28,720
900 websites let alone 900 pages right

00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:32,320
and there's all this content called um

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:33,920
uh statistics i think so like you know

00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,680
you know you've seen these things before

00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,800
they try to look like infographics but

00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,920
on a web page

00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,880
and it's like oh we have 10 000 students

00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,760
and we have

00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,359
800 buildings and like there's these

00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,400
graphics and they have like a big text

00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:49,599
and a little text

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,000
so each of those you know if i was

00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:51,599
trying

00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,680
and the site we're rebuilding it we're

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:56,160
using layout builder

00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,880
so there is a temptation to say oh well

00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,240
let's have

00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,560
a block type called statistics and then

00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,079
each one of those individual metrics

00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:05,920
could be a paragraph so we could have

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,359
paragraphs within blocks

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,880
within our layout um builder and i think

00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,800
that like

00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,240
maybe structurally like that's what

00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,160
parrot that's that that's what

00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:19,200
paragraphs is kind of

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,880
for like it's like a field almost like a

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,320
old fashioned we would have used field

00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,440
collections right

00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,359
um but i think at some point you're

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,440
making your content too complex and

00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:32,240
maybe you could just have six fields

00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:34,320
like one for each of like okay you can

00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:35,839
have three metrics and each one can have

00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,520
the big text and the little text and

00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,800
let's just call it six fields and keep

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:41,440
it really simple

00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,000
so i would say like if you're tempted to

00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,760
use

00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,200
paragraphs and layer builder together in

00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,079
this way of like nested

00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:50,079
content within content you might be over

00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,160
engineering your content a little bit so

00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,720
take a step back and think about it

00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:56,160
and there might be other options that

00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:59,920
are more

00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:02,560
robust like having a special

00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,160
field type or something that could

00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,839
simplify your content model because

00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:08,240
paragraphs they are another kind of

00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:10,720
entity like you're adding

00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,680
you're adding a lot to your database if

00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,880
you start to use

00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:17,599
paragraphs within other things

00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,359
um i think i think maybe the next

00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,680
question i'll go with is leslie's

00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,800
um are the differences between the two

00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,000
in terms of

00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:29,200
content moderation and revisioning um

00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,680
and also maybe um this there's another

00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,880
question

00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,920
which is about translations and

00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:39,200
languages um so you know when when the

00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,760
context gets a bit more complicated

00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,119
yeah this is such a great question so

00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,160
the answer is

00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:48,640
you know as

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:49,280
like yes you they can handle revisions

00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,839
and yes

00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,280
they do support multiple languages but

00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:56,480
especially with the languages

00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:59,119
as soon as it gets complicated um

00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,119
you know the options are more limited so

00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,520
in both cases

00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,040
you have limitations on how you can do

00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:08,160
translation

00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:11,200
um and so we

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:13,680
found that well i'm in quebec so

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,119
content always will not always but off

00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:16,240
most often has to be in english and

00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,920
french

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:21,680
and most organizations

00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,119
decide okay we're going to create

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,359
content in english

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,400
and then translate it to french or the

00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:28,480
other way around

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,520
so most organizations have like a

00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,480
language preference

00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,359
and that workflow is going one way or

00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,680
the other

00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,640
and so that's that's a relief because

00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:39,280
that's sort of

00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,320
what you have to do with these types of

00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,920
pages like

00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,630
you build in one language you do your

00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:45,200
translation and then

00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:48,000
[Music]

00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,440
if you want to make updates to the page

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,480
that you would do it in the original

00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,320
language first

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,680
and that kind of workflow does make it a

00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,720
little easier

00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:59,040
um because with paragraphs for example

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,040
you have to if you wanted to add a new

00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,800
paragraph to the page or delete a

00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,000
paragraph you'd do that in the original

00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,319
language

00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,000
first and then you would update the

00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:10,640
translation

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,240
um for layout builder so leo builder

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,359
does allow you to have

00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:17,040
um like tran

00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:19,040
well translated pages and that you can

00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:22,079
translate the content on the pages

00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,599
and you can translate the um well of

00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,160
course any content that's

00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,599
dynamic is going to appear in the

00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,760
correct language if you have all your

00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:31,839
filtering and everything set up

00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,160
but um you can't have as much

00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:35,200
flexibility like oh i want my french

00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,280
page to be

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,800
different in these ways and i want to

00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,000
structure it differently like you don't

00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,560
have as many

00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:44,240
options in that case like i want my

00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,520
french page to order the content

00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,280
differently or something

00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,640
so i'd say you're you're limited in your

00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,280
options and you have to keep that in

00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,240
mind

00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:55,839
when you're show when you're kind of

00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:58,000
making promises to the content editors

00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,880
so i think i think um we'll we'll draw

00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,920
it to a close

00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:04,800
um probably uh maybe one more

00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,319
uh with ashley's question do you think

00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,359
it's better to design

00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:12,560
for those who are used to the current

00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:14,480
you know possibly painful experience or

00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,839
design for new users

00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:21,119
uh who aren't used to seeing it that's a

00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:25,280
really great question i would say

00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:28,480
um i would say i would design for if

00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:32,240
i would design for the new users uh

00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:36,160
if i had to pick because the users

00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:39,280
um well that and that being said

00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,560
then you leave time for the onboarding

00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:43,280
like you have to get people excited

00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,119
about it

00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,599
and so maybe that means that you

00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:50,880
actually ask them

00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:53,440
uh you can do user testing and people

00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,400
love it that you're asking their opinion

00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,119
so

00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,520
you know maybe just try to design for

00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:00,400
the new users but don't forget about the

00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,240
users who

00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,680
have their tool and like they like how

00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,000
things work you know try

00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,800
to to give them some chance to give

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,560
input

00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,240
and also consider that they might have

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:12,240
really important input about how you

00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:15,359
design the new thing like

00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,680
um like what paragraphs or what a story

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:19,280
what

00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:21,599
what block types are needed right let's

00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,359
ask those users because they are the

00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,640
ones that deal with the content

00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:26,560
then they're going to feel like they

00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,280
have a say and

00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:31,839
that's going to be helpful in getting

00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:35,040
them on board

00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:37,119
okay so we've got two minutes left and

00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:42,280
three questions

00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:46,000
um i'll i'll just um i'll let you choose

00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:48,480
um okay well i like the first one

00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,280
how would you educate users to not put

00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,560
everything

00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,960
into one body wizzy wig body um

00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,839
yeah people who are used to busy wig

00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:58,880
they might just want to keep using that

00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:00,800
forever

00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,359
i would show them how much better their

00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,680
content can look

00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:07,760
how much more consistent and i would

00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:09,440
make some documentation to show real

00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:12,319
examples from your site

00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,720
so i have like a really simple google

00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,920
drive

00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,079
even for my own like evolving web.ca

00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:18,480
like i have that for myself just to see

00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,839
like

00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,760
what are all the options and what do

00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:24,960
they look like um

00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:28,720
so that that would be my advice there

00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,800
um and then

00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,640
the the second one about seo i really

00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,079
like this question

00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:38,720
uh that paragraphs is

00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:41,760
giving you trouble i think that there

00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:43,440
you should have the flexibility to do

00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,040
whatever you want with your seo with

00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,480
paragraphs because you have templates

00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:49,359
for everything you can have templates

00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:52,400
for your fields and

00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:55,760
you maybe can't rely on seo modules

00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,880
because you don't have oh maybe what

00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,359
you're talking about is

00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,960
the um fact that if you're using

00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,839
paragraphs and you can put anything on

00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,520
the page

00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,040
then you don't have a consistent field

00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:07,440
for like the title of the page

00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,040
the summary of the page or the um you

00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,599
know what image is supposed to show up

00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,720
on your

00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,800
linkedin post right so you may have to

00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:16,560
add some dedicated fields just for that

00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,680
outside of your paragraphs

00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,520
yeah yeah i think that's it um

00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,800
meta tag module is definitely worth

00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:26,160
looking at

00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,319
if that's what you're into um

00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,160
i think i think we've only got a few

00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:32,960
seconds left so i'll say

00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,599
thank you very much suzanne uh great

00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,800
talk

00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:37,839
and um i hope you have a good uh a good

00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:39,440
rest of the day

00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:42,880
thanks ruth thank you everyone for

00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,880
