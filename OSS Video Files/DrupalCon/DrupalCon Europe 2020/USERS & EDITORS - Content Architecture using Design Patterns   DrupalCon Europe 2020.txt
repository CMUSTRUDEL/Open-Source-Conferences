[Music]

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,599
welcome

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,600
everybody to content architecture using

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:20,960
design patterns

00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,279
my name is adam joran

00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,640
and i'm going to start off by telling

00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:29,279
you just a little bit about myself

00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,640
that's me i'm american but i live in

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,520
brussels belgium

00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,000
a long long time ago i studied music and

00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,719
opera

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,600
colonel university uh i've been making

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,879
websites

00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,559
doing everything from design

00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:46,000
to database schemas pretty much since

00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,640
1998.

00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,760
i'm a senior front-end developer at 1x

00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,160
internet

00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,800
and one thing you probably did not know

00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,879
about me

00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,160
is few years ago i earned a black belt

00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,800
in kung fu

00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,760
and those are my email and twitter

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,199
handle

00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,400
adam duran tenor and

00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,960
let's go ahead and get started first a

00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,640
little bit

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,720
about one x internet we are a full

00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,799
service digital agency

00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:20,159
uh and a leader in drupal solutions

00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,439
um most of our solutions are in

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,680
factorable that's why

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,360
we're here but we do just about

00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,000
everything design systems react

00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,479
development

00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,119
strategy marketing hosting and

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,520
maintenance

00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:36,240
um and we are a both an excellent team

00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,960
but also an international team um we

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,720
have

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,240
offices all over europe as far south as

00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,720
conille spain

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,759
up in reykjavik and our headquarters are

00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,759
in frankfurt

00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:52,240
so as i said in my abstract for the

00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,439
session

00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,680
creating a solid content architecture in

00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,040
drupal is difficult because there are so

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,759
many possible ways

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,320
to model your content maybe you're here

00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,840
because you felt like that before

00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,080
you felt like this content types fields

00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,679
taxonomies

00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,800
like how is the developer experience

00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,480
what's it like for you the editors

00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,080
it's overwhelming there's there are too

00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,440
many options so

00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,239
we're here to try to create some

00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,280
organization and maybe together we can

00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,239
find a few answers

00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,720
because there's no ultimate answer this

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,840
is

00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,480
42. um hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,599
reference

00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,640
for you fellow uh douglas adams

00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,200
fans out there anyway moving along let's

00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,720
get started

00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,120
so i'm gonna quickly go through

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,920
the two principal parts of the title of

00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,680
the session

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,280
content architecture using design

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,519
patterns so what is content

00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,760
architecture content architecture excuse

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,680
me and

00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,040
what are design patterns and we're going

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,239
to go through each of those in turn and

00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,200
then we're going to talk about how to

00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,239
use them

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,599
how they influence each other and

00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,319
their complex relationships

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,159
so this was a great quote i found

00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,480
content architecture is a holistic

00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,400
approach to organizing content systems

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,280
which considers not only content but

00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,080
also people processes and technology

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,599
so our technology in this case is drupal

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,799
so let's take a closer look at what

00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:29,440
makes up the other three

00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:32,480
the content the people and the processes

00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,840
so the content what is the content that

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,040
is getting input

00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,519
well lots of types you have your content

00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,400
types

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,159
could be pages or news articles

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,080
paragraphs

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,200
accordions or carousels or calls to

00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,120
action

00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,879
custom entities these are um

00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,159
usually associated content but they

00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,799
don't need their own

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,760
uh specific routing or they don't need

00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,959
uh

00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,959
specific um

00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,799
sorry they don't they don't need to

00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,560
function exactly like

00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,560
they're how do i say this they get

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,400
attached to other entities

00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,239
this might be the address of a company

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,560
or a contact person

00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,879
um you can have custom blocks which are

00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,040
very common menus or breadcrumbs or your

00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,440
copyright in the footer

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,959
taxonomies categories or tags and your

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,440
different types of media

00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,400
these are all different types of content

00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,880
that you put in through the admin ui

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,840
i think that's where but we have to

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,000
figure out how it's going to get

00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,960
organized we'll get to that

00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,520
so and who is inputting the content well

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,320
that's

00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,600
you all that's uh largely whoever is

00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,479
watching the session

00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,040
could be editors managers site builders

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,160
um

00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:49,840
site owners but it's probably

00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,360
possibly and probably you how does the

00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,479
content

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,800
go in lots of different ways well

00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,680
there's really two different ways it's

00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,880
either get in

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,520
migrated in or someone's entering it

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,400
it's entities and entities it's

00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,120
paragraphs and

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,840
content types and you're uploading the

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,479
media files

00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,280
and attaching your custom entities and

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,320
and more paragraphs and paragraphs

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:22,479
inside of paragraphs it just it goes on

00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:24,800
forever and now we're gonna talk to

00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,720
the part which i'm mostly involved with

00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,639
how does content

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,240
get output because you can come out as

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,160
paragraph types as a hero image or

00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,840
carousel you have stuff coming out

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,720
of your ck editors text your calls to

00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,039
action

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,560
so many like what are all the design

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,360
patterns the patterns you're used to

00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,400
seeing

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,400
visually they can be

00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,160
they can be anything right you think

00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,680
about you also

00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,240
have your menus and um your your mobile

00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,600
menu

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,360
and what's going to come out on the

00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,880
footer in your sharing links like this

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,039
is all stuff that has to

00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,160
go in and it all has to come out but

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,919
what thing you see

00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,639
more and more often and it's so many

00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,880
different

00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:10,639
types and varieties and flavors there's

00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,080
these cards and teasers and there might

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,680
be a vertical these are

00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,280
horizontalities here with a picture on

00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,440
the left and the picture on the right

00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,639
and maybe it has a date and maybe it has

00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:21,600
a blurb and there's a

00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:23,600
button or a link maybe probably a title

00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,880
is the whole thing linked is part of it

00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,080
linked

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,360
it just it goes on also like entities

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,160
it's really so many possibilities and

00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,759
this

00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,680
is what's so confusing there's so many

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,600
ways to get data in there are so many

00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,639
ways to get data out

00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,680
and how are we really going to make

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:46,720
sense of this all so

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,840
let's talk more about when we're getting

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,840
the data out

00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,880
design patterns so according to

00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,599
wikipedia

00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,400
a design pattern is a reusable form of a

00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:03,759
solution to a design problem

00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,319
okay trying to relay some information

00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,840
from your website to the user probably

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,560
to cause have them cause some

00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,960
take an action um in line with your

00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,280
business goals

00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,680
so here's a couple of great quotes

00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:21,680
on the web we think of patterns as

00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,000
reusable interface components this is

00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,000
quote by ethan marcotte who is the

00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,199
originator of the concept of responsive

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,520
design

00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,680
and yeah so we have we're going to take

00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,280
a look at

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:38,319
these patterns as reusable that's such a

00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,840
use of reusability is such a key

00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:46,160
um tenet of uh

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,160
of um of web design

00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,840
and here's another great quote by brad

00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,560
frost who is the creator of pattern lab

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,120
pattern lab is a tool we front enders

00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:56,879
use

00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:00,160
to prototype and

00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:01,280
organize our patterns and then can also

00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,000
actually be used

00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,280
to output them uh we'll see that later

00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,479
but here's the quote

00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,319
atomic design is not a linear process

00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,080
but rather a mental model to help us

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,400
think of our user interfaces as

00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,199
both a cohesive whole and a collection

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,280
of parts at the same time

00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:24,800
now atomic design is

00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:28,160
one way to organize our design patterns

00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,240
and it helps us keep them organized

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,719
hierarchically

00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,440
and you can see how they live as

00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,479
individuals

00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,399
and also how they function in a larger

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,839
ecosystem so let's go over

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,120
in a little more detail some of the

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:48,800
principles of atomic design

00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:50,480
so as brad frost said it's a methodology

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,360
for creating design systems and you can

00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,480
see

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,399
over here we go from protons to atoms to

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,640
molecules to organisms

00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,519
it takes its cue from biology and

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,040
chemistry

00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:07,120
and then it goes off into its own uh

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:10,480
tangent templates and pages so

00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,600
how does this relate

00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,560
to what we are talking about in design

00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,360
patterns

00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,360
let's have a look

00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:24,399
aha here are some atoms we have an image

00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,880
atom here's a title atom here's a button

00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,200
atom

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,560
and together they come together and now

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,200
we have a card

00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,200
molecule

00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,440
and some of how we're putting

00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,200
these atoms together into molecules and

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,920
molecules into organisms

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,800
etc there are some principles that we

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:48,839
have to

00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:52,640
uh keep hold of

00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:56,640
and because they help us

00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,640
uh keep the they help us keep the

00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,680
the components and design patterns

00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:04,000
reusable

00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,760
and encapsulated and um

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,079
because these are just generally good

00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,200
principles of software design and

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:13,440
under the hood this is all software also

00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,800
but it also applies to just the design

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,200
process in general

00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,640
so these principles i'm going to go over

00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,800
three of them

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,839
keep it super simple there's another way

00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,040
to say it

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,600
but i thought this way it was a little

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,600
more polite the idea here is

00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,519
when possible you want fewer content

00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:35,200
types

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:38,160
uh design patterns fewer view modes

00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,160
if you get too complicated in too many

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,440
variations

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:47,120
the the complexity grows

00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,600
um exponentially and it can

00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,440
it makes it difficult to to make

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,200
editorial decisions like do i want this

00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,399
teaser or that teaser

00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:59,519
um but it also

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,079
it makes your projects quickly more

00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,920
expensive

00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:07,440
and we don't want that keep dry

00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:10,160
dry stands for don't repeat yourself

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,640
every pattern should be represented once

00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,200
every

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,760
visual pattern should be represented

00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,000
once

00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,600
as we're going to see there sometimes

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
different ways

00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,120
to get different types of content into

00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,519
the same

00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,640
pattern and that is ideal because if you

00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,800
have

00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,680
three sets of code that all look the

00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,399
same way to the user

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,920
then when you have to like change a

00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:35,440
color you've got to change it in three

00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,120
different places and we don't want that

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,519
we every piece of code

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,279
should be represented only once and

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,640
lastly

00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:46,320
uh i'm kind of partial to this one this

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:50,079
is the pareto principle

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:53,440
also known as the 80 20 rule um

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:57,360
you probably have all heard of this um

00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:00,079
but just to read uh some little bit

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,600
the relationship of myself to this

00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,959
praetor principle is that it was my

00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,560
grandfather who was a management

00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:07,760
consultant joseph joran

00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:11,360
and he developed this concept of the

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:14,480
80 20 rule um and

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,160
it it uh so i'm a little proud there um

00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,519
in computer science where it's relevant

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,000
to us

00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:21,040
uh microsoft for example noticed that

00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,399
fixing the top

00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:27,519
20 of the most reported bugs fixed 80

00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:30,399
of the related errors um

00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,760
someone else a famous uh computer

00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,160
scientist said

00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,360
his name was lowell arthur he said 20 of

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,639
the code has 80

00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,880
of the errors so

00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,639
you could also say that eighty percent

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,040
of your of your website can be written

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,279
in twenty percent of the allocated time

00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,680
or the hardest twenty percent of the

00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,959
code takes eighty percent of the time

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,160
um and the the point here is more

00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,519
complexity

00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:01,200
gets causes like that

00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:03,760
20 extra you want is gonna take 80

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,480
of your project time and so you want to

00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:08,800
again

00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:12,800
keep it super simple this is so

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:15,519
just uh as you think of your own

00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:18,839
projects and your own websites

00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,000
begin to consider where things got a

00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,839
little

00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,399
the scope got a little out of control

00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:27,760
and where maybe there are opportunities

00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:30,560
to um to begin

00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,320
to to look for opportunities to scale

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,440
things back

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,399
so now we're going to talk about

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,800
patterns we take this little mock-up

00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,880
right here

00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,399
what are some patterns you see now i

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,959
want you in a normal

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,079
session i'd ask people to shout them out

00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,440
um

00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,120
rather than use a poll because i think

00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:54,560
that's confusing

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:56,800
in this particular case um oh i do have

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:58,320
a poll though

00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,639
joffrey should we do the poll now is it

00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,120
like a little

00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,920
oh it's already on great okay we'll read

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,560
the results uh

00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,760
closer to the end cool anyway so here

00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:10,959
take a piece of paper

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:13,600
or in a in a somewhere

00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:14,399
on a google doc or whatever take a

00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,600
minute

00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:22,639
and i want you to write down

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:22,639
the patterns you see individual patterns

00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,839
give you guys like 30 seconds

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,839
um

00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:01,680
ten more seconds you weren't expecting a

00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,680
pop quiz were you

00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:18,880
alrighty so

00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:18,880
you guys can compare your list to mine

00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:26,480
we have layout that's its own

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,040
pattern it's the header layout it's what

00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,920
causes this to stay at the left and this

00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,920
the state of the right

00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,160
that's one pattern the layout the logo

00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,880
is is a pattern

00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:41,519
maybe it's got a link on it here's our

00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,240
our primary menu

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,360
you could even say i didn't uh highlight

00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,639
them but you could even say the links

00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,639
are their own pattern

00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,759
could be and here's an active link so

00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,800
it's a variant

00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,800
of the basic link

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,240
we have our hero image

00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,560
almost looks like tatooine except

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:03,120
there's only one sun

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,720
we have a text block maybe from ck

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:09,120
editor

00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:12,399
section title we have a grid

00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,279
and in the grid is three cards two

00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,160
and three and we have two different

00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,399
types of cards

00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,839
one with an image and a title one with

00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,040
no image title

00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,639
date and a button so maybe these

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,959
don't link and maybe the whole card is

00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,959
linked

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,000
who knows anyway hope you guys did well

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,800
on the little quiz

00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,320
but it's important to when we look at

00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:39,440
designs to begin to see

00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:42,560
what the patterns are and which ones are

00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,800
reusable we're going to focus on cards

00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,000
because as i mentioned earlier cards are

00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:51,279
ubiquitous cards are everywhere

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:53,920
and there's not just cards cards teasers

00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,079
tiles it doesn't matter anything you

00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,880
plop into a grid

00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,079
uh and there's so many so many types of

00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:03,680
them

00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:05,600
and when you have

00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,480
sometimes you'll get a design where

00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:11,600
there's these smaller variations

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:14,079
um either visually

00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,439
which have implications for both the

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,480
editorial experience

00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,839
and for the back end um but sometimes we

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,400
can get

00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:27,600
the different sources from the back end

00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,640
all output into the same pattern and

00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,000
we're going to look at both of these

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,919
actually in the opposite order

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,120
so let's go to that so here

00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,919
we're gonna start with some examples

00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,760
this is a grid from our 1x internet demo

00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,520
site

00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:49,039
this is a grid with three cards

00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:51,600
right they kind of look the same

00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,559
right image image image title title

00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,400
title

00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:59,200
text oh got a date and some sort of tag

00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,080
okay uh and then here's our body tag

00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,840
spider text

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,400
and they both have these links the

00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,200
bottom all right so

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,919
this is different over here but aside

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,360
from that they all look the same

00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:17,520
cool moving on here

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:20,640
is another set of cards

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,919
but these cards are not

00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:26,160
all the same we're going to do

00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,520
we take a look at some of these

00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,559
different cards

00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,440
specifically um sorry i'm just going to

00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,919
go back

00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,760
we're going to look at this one and this

00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:38,960
one

00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:40,559
and this one

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,160
and they all come out looking pretty

00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,039
much the same right image and you got

00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,320
some padding here

00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,880
title some text blank the other one had

00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,840
the

00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,880
date but let's we're going to look like

00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,080
we're going to pretend we're front end

00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,240
developers

00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,720
and we're going to look at the source

00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,440
assuming uh we have twig debug turned on

00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,520
and we're gonna look

00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,520
at the twig debug code

00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,120
so this is for this one this card over

00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,559
here this

00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,760
we can tell we can tell

00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:14,799
from this twig debug code

00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,080
which template drupal is going to use to

00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:19,520
render that

00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:23,120
okay so here there are four

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:26,799
possible templates and this x

00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,880
and the fact that i made it bold denotes

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,880
which template is being used and we can

00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,400
learn a lot from the title of

00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:37,440
the template node page teaser

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,080
so this is content type page and view

00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,240
mode

00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,520
teaser we're going to talk a little more

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,280
about what

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:48,320
view mode really means in a second um

00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,760
so okay so nodepageteaser.html.twig well

00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,880
let's go look at

00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,440
what that looks like what that template

00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:58,559
actually looks like

00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,160
okay so

00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:02,240
this might look like gobbledygook to you

00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,280
all let's let's talk about what's

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,679
happening here

00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,120
this is uh tweet code it's saying we're

00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,400
going to

00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,600
look for this pattern

00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:16,480
called card link in pattern lab

00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,720
uh and the reason it's called card link

00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,559
is because the entire card is linked

00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,720
some sometimes you have just a title or

00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,559
just the image linked or just the button

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,280
in our cards in one x internet very

00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,919
often people expect the entire card to

00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,919
be linked

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:35,120
um so that's what this pattern does

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:39,520
and it has these fields we're passing

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,960
to it so i i this is a little technical

00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,120
and maybe a little bit in the weeds but

00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,799
just so you all understand

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:49,360
what there's a reason why this is all

00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:51,200
important as we compare everything so

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,720
card has image this is just whether or

00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,840
not this is populated

00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,440
if it's empty if it's empty then or if

00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,799
it's not empty this is true so card

00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,600
image has true

00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:04,480
or it doesn't the text this is the body

00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:07,760
text coming from this field

00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:11,200
url are you

00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:15,840
our link text card and label

00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:17,919
for nodes or really entities in

00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,840
when you pat in the template you get

00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,600
this and you get this you don't have to

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,080
do anything special to get access to the

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,320
url

00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,200
or the title and then here's our twig

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:29,200
block with

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:31,840
the image okay

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,840
so

00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,600
we're going to come back to some more of

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,679
this markup

00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,440
between markup in a second for the other

00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,559
two and they're going to be a little bit

00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,159
different and we're going to look for

00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:45,200
those differences okay

00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,919
so first here is

00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,480
the next card this was the one with the

00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,760
date

00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:55,440
and the category and we can see

00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:58,159
oh this tweet debug tells us

00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,320
this was now we know why it's different

00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,799
it's from the news content type

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,679
it's still a teaser view mode but this

00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:06,559
is the news

00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,600
content type ah-ha so that's a little

00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,720
bit different

00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:12,640
well let's go take a look at that under

00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:16,159
the hood

00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:18,960
okay so some similarities here

00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,840
still using the card link pattern from

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,679
pattern lab

00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:27,039
same component same

00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:30,880
this is the same same same same

00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:34,799
same huh aha of course we have to pass

00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:38,159
in this value for metadata

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,600
and it it was it was put together up

00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,000
here in the template

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,200
not that important how but it's what

00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,240
contains the date

00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,679
and the category and we're passing it so

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,200
that

00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,320
we can assume card link conditionally

00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:55,360
renders

00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:58,640
metadata when it's populated

00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:01,679
so when it's

00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:05,200
not there it's missing here

00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:08,559
missing here and when it's populated

00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:10,720
it renders but we use the same component

00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,760
same design pattern that's super that's

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,039
efficient that's

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:19,039
not repeating yourself all right

00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:22,559
let's go to that third card and

00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:25,200
aha this is a lot less

00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,159
twig debug code and there's no

00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,520
suggestions

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,600
oh there's just this one right here

00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:34,880
right this teaser entity.html.twig

00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,520
well that's because this card comes from

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:41,120
a custom entity and not a node

00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,360
a custom entity and with no

00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,600
view mode but the default view mode so

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,000
we don't get the template suggestions

00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,400
we're just told which templates to use

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:55,360
and we're going to look at that template

00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:59,520
and well this looks mostly the same

00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:02,559
right still got card link cool and

00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:05,039
oh this is interesting the field name

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,520
for the image is different

00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:09,200
okay if you don't believe me we can go

00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,240
back really quick

00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,240
field preview image

00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,400
this is developer choice okay fine but

00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:19,120
it's different

00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,559
but it's not a no this is when they

00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,720
created this entity

00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:24,000
they added fields they decided to call

00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,600
it field image

00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,799
fine card url is

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,360
not just plain url it's got this whole

00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,880
other thing because again it's not a

00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:38,000
node it doesn't have any

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:38,559
native routing it doesn't have so we

00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,279
have to

00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:43,520
add specifically a link field

00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,400
additionally we have to add specifically

00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,880
a title field because it doesn't get

00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,760
that

00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,320
label variable other than that it's the

00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,240
same

00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,559
still using the same pattern

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,720
again efficiency and not repeating

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,600
ourselves

00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,240
so let's take a quick look at the actual

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,200
card link

00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,919
template it is very truncated because

00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,320
it's not

00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:12,559
the exact markup is not that important

00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,159
what's important is that we had three

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,679
different drupal templates

00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,200
two different content type teasers in

00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:20,000
the custody and custom

00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,279
entity teaser and all three have the

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,919
same design pattern and

00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,919
got rendered through this same

00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,919
template

00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,279
now here's a total different three set

00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,039
of cards

00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,880
and this is just to demonstrate even

00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:40,080
more variety as possible

00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:43,919
you can have a full image you can have a

00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:46,799
half image or no image

00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,720
but and you can have different color

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,240
schemes this button's red this one's

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,840
green

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,600
you can have the type like

00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,600
types of content this has a list this

00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:00,799
has

00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:02,159
you know but they're still cards

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,159
they're still what do they have in

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,720
common the style

00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:07,760
and placement of this category or

00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,000
descriptor

00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,279
is there the placement of the button and

00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,520
the side of the button

00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,960
that's the same the titles even though

00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,320
they're in different places

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,440
and positioned differently the style is

00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:23,039
identical

00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,039
so there you can

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,640
create as much variety within your cards

00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:29,919
as you want

00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,919
but there is gonna

00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,360
be a cost and we're gonna talk about

00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:35,440
that cost uh

00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,159
for both you and your developers in a

00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,520
minute but the point is here that it

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,720
that i'm trying to drive

00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,360
home is you can have same pattern

00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,159
with many variations you can have a

00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,840
single

00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,159
design pattern that can be the visual

00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,279
source of truth for several different

00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,200
types of content

00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,960
it's just like with these gummy bears no

00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,120
matter what color or flavor

00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,159
you inject into them they're still going

00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,960
to be shaped

00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,960
like bears

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:09,120
alrighty moving on

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,039
so we've seen how multiple entities can

00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,640
be channeled into a single pattern

00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,799
now we're going to see how a single

00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:16,000
piece of content can be directed into

00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,760
multiple patterns

00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,679
and i'm doing a time check i have 18

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:25,840
minutes so i better not talk too slow

00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:29,679
all right moving on so here we have two

00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,159
card type teasers they're fairly similar

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,000
the one on the left has some padding you

00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,279
see this little padding around the

00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,919
content right um

00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:42,880
it has a body text and this one doesn't

00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:44,320
and here as you can see well this has

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,320
there's no real padding there's no

00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:49,679
padding left right it's in line

00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,600
it's flush right so this is that's

00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:53,039
that's very much a distinction this has

00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,159
spacing around the content

00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:59,039
this doesn't okay

00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:02,000
here all this is white background this

00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:03,120
doesn't have a change in background um

00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,640
and this one has

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,039
over here on the right has my body text

00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,440
so they're different patterns

00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,960
but what's interesting to notice okay

00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,480
they're sufficiently similar that they

00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,600
could even be coded into the same

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,520
component

00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,679
your front ender would just need a

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,279
simple condition to know when to render

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,760
one or the other

00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:24,399
and my point here is no matter how

00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,559
visually similar or visually different

00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:32,080
cards get you still need some way

00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:34,480
the the the component

00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,279
has to know the pattern how do you say

00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,399
it

00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:40,240
you have to have some way that you're

00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,880
passing the information of which

00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,760
pattern to use and there's really a

00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:49,600
million ways to do this in drupal

00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:53,600
but i believe that the most optimal way

00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,720
is the way i'm going to show you now so

00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,799
we're going to talk about view modes

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,279
what is the view mode by view mode i

00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,640
mean

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:03,600
what gets configured for a given

00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,600
content type under the manage display

00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,559
tab here's the default

00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,279
here's our highlight for um highlighting

00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,799
input for

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:16,159
search results and here's our teaser

00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:18,640
news teaser

00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,679
and i think as we if you recall as i

00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,760
demonstrated earlier

00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:23,360
each of these will get every one of

00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,559
these will get its own

00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:29,600
template so this will get node dash dash

00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:31,919
news dash teaser

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,919
right

00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,320
and here it is this was our node dash

00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,000
dash

00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,679
news dash teaser right so now we know

00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,320
the file name really starts to make

00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,679
sense and here i've put in

00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,760
it's a different card but this is the

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,880
one that we're talking about this is our

00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,880
normal teaser let's say

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,440
so now what if we wanted to have a way

00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:01,840
the the best way to output that

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:04,240
other one is to have another view mode

00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,480
this one we're calling special teaser

00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,679
and it's going to get

00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:12,320
a template with this name

00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,520
node news special teaser you can see

00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:16,960
it's still the card link

00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:19,360
and ah this is it this is the key

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,279
card variant this we're gonna pass this

00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,559
into the pattern

00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,399
doesn't matter this is not to be special

00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,760
this is just what i made up

00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:31,840
but we're by passing in this

00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:34,799
parameter now card link can say

00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,360
oh well if you're this parameter i can

00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:40,399
style you like this

00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,440
that's how it knows

00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:46,080
and so in it we now so

00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,960
to get just a different type of teaser

00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,799
visually

00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,080
whether it's a similar one like this is

00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:53,600
to the other one or

00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:56,080
or incredibly different you need a new

00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,080
view mode

00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:04,159
now these view modes are configurable

00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:05,440
here this is the one for uh

00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,679
actually this is the one for the custom

00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,600
entity this is a little

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,760
bit different no sorry this is

00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:16,080
i should just read this this is

00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:19,519
paragraph this is the our page reference

00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:21,600
so this would have been that um

00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,640
page teaser the in that first set we

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,679
looked at

00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:30,480
here's its paragraph manage display

00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:33,120
rendered as teaser the next one

00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,799
ah here's a view we have some the recent

00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,480
content this we also showed

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,279
uh way earlier and in your view you can

00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,880
choose

00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:45,919
the format that you want your

00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,279
uh that you want the notes to come out

00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:51,120
as

00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,120
and we can choose teaser special teaser

00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:58,960
so whether these view modes that you add

00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,840
they can get exposed in the admin ui

00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,840
either here

00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:08,559
or here and you could even uh

00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,240
in a paragraph it could show up as a

00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:13,679
paragraph field it could get exposed if

00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:16,559
you had a very uh good developer

00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,519
and that is so the whole point i'm

00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,960
trying to make

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:23,200
and is that

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,320
what the patterns are what the designs

00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,880
look like

00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:31,519
can help inform how the content goes in

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,799
and this karen mcgrane who was uh has

00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,240
written some books with

00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:37,200
uh ethan marcotte who i mentioned

00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,880
earlier pattern libraries can inform not

00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:41,039
just the front-end styles

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,960
on the website but actually inform the

00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:46,000
way that the content creators

00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,159
you and the owners of the site you

00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,640
manage and maintain the substance of the

00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,679
website

00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,399
they really knowing how the content

00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:58,720
comes out

00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,720
helps you plan how you're putting it in

00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,600
and that's because designers and

00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,600
developers

00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,120
we need to be part of the process and

00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:11,039
content architecture

00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,399
you we need the designers to give visual

00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,880
variety but without

00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:16,880
excess and we need the developers to

00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:19,600
implement but also to ask

00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,880
could there be a simpler way to do this

00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,320
could there be

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,039
have less variety for the sake of not

00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,760
getting into that whole 80 20 thing and

00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,080
spiraling

00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,080
into

00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:34,000
like millions of patterns and view modes

00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:37,360
and

00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,880
just becoming unmanageable and then even

00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,480
a content editor would be like well i

00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,840
don't know which one i'm supposed to use

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,080
it gets very

00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:46,000
hard to manage after a while because

00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,440
every variation that is represented

00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,600
visually in the design

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:53,840
must also be represented somewhere in

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,840
code or configuration

00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:01,679
so this is the thing

00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:04,880
content architecture is a team effort

00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:08,079
and this is my advice to you all

00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:10,159
come together in your teams and i mean

00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,200
everybody

00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,639
the the the the strategist the the the

00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,280
information architect

00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:18,839
the project manager the designers the

00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,639
front-end developers the back-end

00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:22,240
developers

00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,919
discuss the content model and the

00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:28,000
designs reconcile differences

00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,760
consider the technical consequences of

00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,040
too many design variants

00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,079
or a complicated content model and to do

00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,200
this before

00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,520
any code is written it takes time but

00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:43,359
not nearly as much as having to rebuild

00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,359
or redesign something mid project

00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,359
thank you that i think is the end of the

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,879
session

00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:55,440
and now um i think i'm

00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:59,040
opening up for questions joffee

00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,400
yes we have one what do you suggest as a

00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,480
component library

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,599
or component management right now we are

00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:08,160
using kss for that purpose

00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,119
so um i don't have any experience with

00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,160
kss

00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,040
um i have a lot of experience with

00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:16,079
pattern lab

00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:17,040
um i used to do sessions on pattern lab

00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,040
integration

00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:25,200
uh uh with drupal

00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:28,079
pattern lab is a great tool um

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,680
it's what's nice about it is that it can

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:31,839
use the twig templating language

00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,800
and drupal uses the tweak templating

00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,240
language

00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,800
so it seemed like a natural fit

00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:42,000
if what you're doing is only drupal um

00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:45,119
that is probably the best way to go

00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,880
however if you are dealing with like

00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:52,560
true design systems where you your

00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:56,320
patterns have to be consumed by not just

00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:59,359
drupal for example you have

00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,839
also a react app and also

00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,560
like uh some sort of decoupled front end

00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,400
for a

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,240
online shop and that's written in i

00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,760
don't know view

00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,920
then then pattern lab doesn't do it

00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,320
patently gives you twig and nothing else

00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,960
storybook is probably a better choice

00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,440
for that

00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,640
um we started doing some stuff in web

00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,880
components

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:24,880
which can get consumed by drupal by

00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:28,720
vue by react so it just depends

00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:32,000
um on on on what sort of uh

00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,400
larger like ecosystem you you're trying

00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,400
to support

00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,760
the next one is from nikola in your

00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:42,240
examples you have used template

00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,839
suggestions with the content type inside

00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,160
is this the best practice you would

00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:48,160
recommend or is it better to start with

00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,680
a more generic suggestion without the

00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,560
content type in it

00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,720
and then adjust things only when

00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,200
specificities

00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,599
occur for example is it better to fix a

00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:02,240
pattern to a given view mode

00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,240
ah that is a great great question um

00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,280
so

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,400
you know that is a great question so

00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:12,079
when you leave things generic and they

00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,160
make them specific later

00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:15,920
it's not unlike what we front enders do

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,400
with css where we

00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,680
used to do where you let things cascade

00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,839
down like you set

00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,119
your font color and it affects

00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:25,119
everything except

00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,240
oh here's my links and i want my links

00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,560
to be red not blue

00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,079
but it's really after if you get that's

00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,720
fine if you have a simple site

00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:36,880
but if you start having you know three

00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:39,280
four five content types and

00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,880
more than two view modes no one

00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,720
remembers

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,400
which is the default and which is the

00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,680
exception and yes

00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,800
twig debug can tell you but it

00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,119
trust me it can get complicated fast i

00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,960
believe

00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,520
what i think is a better best practice

00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,800
is to okay

00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:04,800
i sorry let me as a caveat

00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:07,839
i deleted a few of the actual twig debug

00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,880
uh the the template suggestions

00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:13,680
which were either node id specific

00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,560
or some other specific because it is

00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,240
possible to get

00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:21,359
too specific i think that

00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:24,640
for it's easier especially when you're

00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:28,079
using a tool like pattern lab

00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,079
or or any kind of um

00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,040
pattern library it's easier on a per

00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,680
content type

00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,800
per view mode basis to tell it use this

00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,160
pattern

00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:43,520
and that's just enough specificity to

00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:46,240
not have a million templates uh

00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:48,000
and to catch enough under one umbrella

00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:52,079
not umbrella to catch enough in one

00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,800
basket to send to one pattern

00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:57,359
and then have fallbacks for example

00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,560
let's say you have a node type

00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,560
you're building a site and you have a

00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,560
node type you know you're going to

00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,839
get its own landing page template later

00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,160
but you haven't gotten there yet so

00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:10,480
maybe you leave the default one to just

00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,160
still output the fields and give them a

00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,920
little space between each one

00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:19,200
so that your out of the box

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:21,680
node doesn't look horrible to whoever

00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,400
happens to come look at it does that

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,400
answer the question

00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,079
hopefully hopefully it's hard again ah

00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:30,240
virtual

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,839
it's hard to get the feedback other

00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:35,520
another question

00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:37,520
uh mark is asking one issue i have here

00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,960
is the use of so many entity type

00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:42,160
templates such as

00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,640
node news teaser html twig and node

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,079
event

00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,800
teaser html tweak etc i'd much prefer

00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,520
just node

00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,480
to use a teaser html tweak and put some

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,520
if statements

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,839
in it instead i hope it was clear the

00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:57,440
way

00:39:53,839 --> 00:40:00,640
um yeah you

00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,960
that also works

00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,960
um

00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:10,480
it depends on the if statements um as

00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:14,079
long as you're not

00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:15,200
really mucking around too much with the

00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:17,599
date it can

00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:19,440
there can be not that this will happen

00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,319
um

00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,480
the caching issues that uh if you start

00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,200
doing too much if you're just doing

00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,200
logic to say

00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,720
if this showed this and if not that show

00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:32,880
that that's fine

00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:34,720
um i also think that if my pattern lab

00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,960
templates have too many if this then

00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:41,200
else that or i have trouble keeping

00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,440
track of i feel like those patterns can

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,680
also get too complicated this way

00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,800
each pattern whether it's the droops or

00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,800
each template whether it's the drupal

00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,280
template or the pattern lab template

00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,359
they have like i don't know they don't

00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,920
usually have more than

00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,640
you know 100 lines and sometimes i've

00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,160
seen

00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,680
i've seen card templates that have more

00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,359
than 100 lines of code and

00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,880
i stopped knowing what i'm looking at

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:04,560
after a while so it's

00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,560
it's a personal choice i think using

00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:10,720
just no teaser works

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,079
um and but i do think there could

00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,839
theoretically come a point where you

00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,920
would get too much complexity

00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,960
and you would want to break it up uh

00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,200
into different ones

00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,839
it just it just that's almost a matter

00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,839
of personal preference

00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,040
seems like you have no more questions

00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,560
and three minutes

00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,960
left okay do you want to announce the

results yes announce the poll results

00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,440
okay so we

00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,560
answer some questions about similarly

00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,760
stuff that i talked about today

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:31,040
that's at 4 15 this afternoon

00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:33,440

send your resume over to jobs at 1x

00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,599
internet.a

we've done questions and please don't

00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,319
forget to

00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,680
do the survey and we still have three

00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:48,640
minutes so

00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,800
let's do the poll results please so the

00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,560
poll was about what people love most

00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:56,480
about the virtual drupalcon

00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:58,640
and with 26 unlimited coffee breaks is

00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:01,760
number one

00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:05,040
then with 21 no travel costs

00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,280
the third is uh with 18 i can watch the

00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,079
dress note from my couch

00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,520
and i can work at the same time and no

00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,079
line for the bathroom

00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:14,800
or the bottom of the list with 70

00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:16,640
percent

00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:18,079
all right well it's still fairly close

00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,240
that's still fairly close across the

00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,640
board

00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,760
cool well then we'll finish two minutes

00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:26,560
early i want to say

00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,760
um i wish i had some sense of like

00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:31,119
feeling the room

00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:32,480
um it's hard doing this like

00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,480
not knowing who else is out there and

00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,920
seeing your faces but thank you all

00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,160
uh for coming i hope you learned

00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,599
something um i learned a ton putting

00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,359
this together

00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:44,880
so thank you all for your time and i

00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,880
