Description: 
	Join us for a visual journey through a magical development workflow powered by Terminus Build Tools. We start with the maestro of Composer installing the powerhouse that is Drupal 9.1. GitHub is then used to make a pull request which turns to a test suite leveraging Continuous Integration to do visual regression, behavioral, and static code testing. Finally we deploy the code to the Pantheon WebOps platform for production use!
