00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,279
so welcome everybody to our

00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,359
session one of the first session at the

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,080
drupalcon 2020.

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,199
i'm really excited to give you some

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,720
insights

00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,240
about the magazine approach for

00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,400
storytelling

00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,279
i also want to tell you that we prepared

00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,320
a poll

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:35,120
in which we invite you to participate

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,040
and we try to handle the questions at

00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:38,879
the end of the session

00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,640
we will also stay a bit longer so that

00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:45,039
we can handle all the questions

00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,200
so feel free to ask questions as well

00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,320
first of all i would like to introduce

00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,320
the speakers first

00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,239
good morning everyone my name is inna

00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,440
wittmer i work as a

00:00:54,239 --> 00:01:00,239
application engineer at unik in zurich

00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,440
for two years now and in the last two

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,320
years i was part of

00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,519
different group projects and i will give

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,600
you some insight

00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,080
about the taxonomy approach we choose

00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,000
for this project

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,880
thank you very much yina my name is roy

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,960
fuckenberger i've been working for unic

00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,240
now for approximately 12 years in

00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,320
different areas

00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,360
and my part is to give some insights

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,400
about

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,159
the business part of the project and how

00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,159
the business case was being set up

00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,680
so what will you learn today as we said

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,240
in our session statement there are

00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,159
actually

00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,960
three things you should take with you

00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,600
today one of it is

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,119
the advantages of the magazine approach

00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,520
that you know all of them

00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,360
then of course how taxonomies can make a

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,880
difference in segmentation and filtering

00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,840
that's something we will see

00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,560
in enos presentation and of course more

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,960
about how

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,000
taxonomies can help with seo

00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,000
improvements as well

00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,719
so maybe to give you some background

00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,560
about the case itself

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,799
the schweitz of life magazine claims to

00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,360
be the leader in the subject of swiss

00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,239
meat so

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,920
it's important that it's really about

00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,959
the swiss meat itself

00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,440
and it's about preparing handling

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,480
and taking care of all the things around

00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,440
it so it's not

00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,480
pretty much about recipes it's really

00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,000
about whole ecosystem as we can see

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,840
in the second claim so about

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
strengthening appreciation trust and

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,040
sympathy and of course about

00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,080
the local production and it was actually

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,239
being set up

00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,200
with the story storytelling approach

00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,360
around it

00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,760
to introduce all these points here

00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,920
so what were the project goals one of

00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,280
the main goals was certainly to create a

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,480
central hub with

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,640
valuable content historically

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,560
the platform was grown with on and

00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,640
offline content so

00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,680
they had offline magazines for example

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,920
knife and fork

00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,879
and the idea was really to create the

00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,239
central hub

00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:09,360
including all these offline and online

00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,000
topics but also create the feeling

00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,120
that you have once um guiding through

00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,319
the sessions

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,400
and through the platforms online and the

00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,159
second point of course was creating a

00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,400
better content mediation

00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,680
um to try to give the right groups the

00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,080
right access

00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,959
to their needs and the third point which

00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,360
was uh

00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,159
highly important and crucial for us was

00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,599
that we

00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:37,360
needed to have a system being set up

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:40,799
to constantly learn and to development

00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:45,120
and sorry and to develop and improve

00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,120
the learnings based on analytics data

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,680
so um i want to quickly give an

00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,159
introduction

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,599
of the magazine approach based on one of

00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,360
the stories

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:58,400
the burger story so what you can see

00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,959
here

00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,319
is the front end of the page itself um

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,439
you have these different

00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,360
navigation types and high up here you

00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,400
can see that you can drop in right into

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,560
the stories

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,319
and all these stories contain of

00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,640
different elements

00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,160
which should guide the user from content

00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,680
to content and help

00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,240
to make this even better so um here the

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,560
story is called the perfect burger

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,880
it was important to have a human being

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,600
right in the middle of the story itself

00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,720
so it's really valuable and trust

00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,639
fully if somebody can actually

00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,880
explain why this is important

00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,320
from from from a person that is also

00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,479
well known in this case

00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,680
it's a chef from a very well-known

00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,120
restaurant

00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:51,120
and he gives some tips throughout the

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,120
story here for example he tells about

00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,240
what kind of meat you should take for

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,639
example and

00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,400
how you shall prepare it in order to

00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,199
really make this a

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,400
nice burger but also how to mint it for

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,400
example this can be

00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,080
important and then there are so many

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,360
more

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:13,120
important knowledge topics for

00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,240
also on how to uh freeze or how to um

00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,240
cool down the meat but also on how to

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,639
make it done afterwards and these are

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,199
all tiny little links in bed in the

00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,840
story

00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,680
that help guiding through the session

00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,160
then of course you can go

00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,160
to the way of doing it these are videos

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,759
that show how to do it so not just

00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,080
recipes

00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,440
with an explanation really a video on

00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,639
how you can see this

00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,440
as well and there are also

00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,520
recipes of course related we can see the

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,639
taxonomies here um which ina will

00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:48,560
um coming to later on and one of the

00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,720
most important point here is that

00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,160
at the end of each story you always will

00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,520
find a new

00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,280
referral link so that you don't drop out

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,240
of the page so that you can really go to

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,039
the next story

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,520
go to the next recipe and try to learn

00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,160
something

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,840
out of it with this i would like to hand

00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,840
over to you inna

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,319
thank you roy so first i would like to

00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:25,360
give you a short overview

00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,360
what the focus of the project setup was

00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,319
and one important requirement of the

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,720
project was to provide the editor a nice

00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,319
editorial experience that allows him to

00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,919
easily edit content

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:42,560
and to create new stories we implemented

00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:45,120
this project with drupal 8

00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,960
and we are using claro with the gym

00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,599
backhand theme

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,199
to give the editor a lot of flexibility

00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,599
to create new content

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,680
with different layouts and paragraphs we

00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:02,639
are using the paragraphs module

00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:05,440
with the entity reference layout module

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,000
as you saw before in the burger story

00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,080
the key element in this project was to

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
be able to enrich the story

00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,919
with elements that link the user to

00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,039
other content that could be

00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:20,000
interesting for him for this reason

00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,599
we are using a taxonomy approach to be

00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,840
able to build

00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,000
the relationship between the different

00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,160
contents

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,080
these taxonomies need to be set by the

00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:34,880
editor for each new

00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,880
content like a new recipe or a new story

00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,720
an element where you can see very well

00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,000
how these taxonomies can be used

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,960
is the content navigation element

00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,639
the content navigation element is a

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,120
group of elements

00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,680
that are related to each other through

00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,120
one

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,120
or more taxonomies

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,639
there are different layouts how this

00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,800
element looks like

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,280
and also the number of elements can be

00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,280
different

00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:15,520
we will now go into the backend and

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,520
create a new content navigation element

00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,240
and first you can add a title and then

00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,240
choose the layout

00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,280
and afterwards you see all the different

00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,919
taxonomies that exist on the platform

00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,800
like what type of content it is or what

00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,599
animal this content is about

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,560
and we now choose that we want to see

00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,919
recipes

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:44,399
for beef and when we save this element

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,519
you can see here the preview with five

00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,880
elements

00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,040
that are recipes for beef

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,399
we can now edit the element again and

00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,000
choose some more

00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:58,720
taxonomies for example we only want

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,560
simple recipes so we can choose here

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,240
difficulty simple

00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,320
and we can now see that there are

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:09,839
different elements here only

00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,839
simple recipes

00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,839
another example where this taxonomy

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,360
approach is very useful

00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,440
is the recipe search on the recipe

00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,680
search is not only a text search where

00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,760
you can search for a recipe name

00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:30,720
or ingredients it also allows the user

00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:34,399
to use the taxonomies as facets

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,399
to feel total search result

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,480
and like that the user can narrow down

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,279
the search result

00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,880
by using multiple filters like the

00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:46,320
preparation time

00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,320
or the difficulty level

00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:54,560
these were just um two examples how we

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:57,279
use taxonomies

00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:01,360
the taxonomy approach also has a big

00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:04,160
impact on the seo performance

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,880
with drupal we have out of the box for

00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:10,560
each term a detail page that then will

00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:12,880
get indexed by the search engines

00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,680
and on the term page you can see all the

00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,320
content

00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,360
that is referenced to this specific term

00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,440
here in this

00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,320
example for beef and also you can see

00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,959
the amount

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:29,600
of content that exists on the website

00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,880
we also implemented data pages for

00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,839
multiple terms

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,680
so you can combine two terms like here

00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,160
for lamb and beef

00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,440
and then you only get the contents that

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:46,160
are referenced to both

00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:47,600
of these terms

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,600
so thanks very much gina for this

00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,839
explanations and to show us the

00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,440
prototype and to go through it

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,440
so what are takeaways now we hope

00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,959
that you saw how the magazine approach

00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,720
helps to combine the claim and the

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,200
appearance but also

00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,160
the reading and searching habits of the

00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,399
internet

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,399
then of course the second point is that

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,040
you saw how taxonomies can make a

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,680
difference

00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:13,360
for segmentation and filtering as we saw

00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,560
it on the navigation module

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,760
for example as well and last but not

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,600
least we also have

00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,200
some points about the structure that can

00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,240
be used in the back end

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,959
and the points we saw from eno with the

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,079
seo

00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:31,279
improvements for example to clean urls

00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:34,240
that are being generated

00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,720
so with this we would like to hand over

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,920
to the

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:42,880
question and answer session now feel

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:45,519
free to drop some questions

00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,560
first question from sarah where do you

00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,040
define

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,959
to which taxonomy belongs a certain

00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,040
recipe that's maybe a question you can

00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:56,160
answer you know

00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:59,600
yes so this is a task for the editor

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,480
so he needs if he creates a new recipe

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,160
he

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,000
needs to define all these different

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,480
taxonomies like what

00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,440
animal their recipes are all about what

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,120
the preparation time is so this

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,120
needs to be done all manually

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,839
so i'll check this question any more

00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,760
questions

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,240
i can also see from the polls that

00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,639
approximately 50 percent of the people

00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,600
never use the approach so it will also

00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,240
be

00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,279
interesting to see whether they learned

00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,880
something or whether they have some

00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,160
follow-up questions concerning this

00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,600
there is one from

00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:40,800
antonella do you use a combination of

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:44,160
tags in the url and if so what module or

00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,160
functionality do you use

00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,800
it's also some for you you know

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:58,240
um no we don't use this

00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,200
specific module for this um

00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,920
only this um detail page where we use

00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,160
multiple

00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,440
terms this was a constant implementation

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,680
that we did

00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,160
but like the term detail page with the

00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,639
url that's just um

00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,639
default

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,120
thanks very much for the explanation and

00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,440
thank you for the question antonella

00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,800
the next question comes from tarsus

00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,399
cutler storytelling is

00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,320
quite interesting approach can you

00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,600
please explain the thinking behind it a

00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,240
bit

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,519
of course we can tell you a bit more

00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,160
about this

00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,839
the idea is actually to have a story in

00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,920
the center because

00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,120
usually human beings are more interested

00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,600
in stories

00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,240
and what you can do is you can really

00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,560
pack up

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,399
all the important points within the

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,560
story for example

00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,000
coming back to the meat store you can

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,320
also let people know for

00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,120
example where this meat piece is coming

00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,480
from

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,040
how it has been grown and

00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,880
show some stories about for example how

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,959
the animals grew up

00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,240
that's actually the story that you

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,399
really try

00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,440
to have a story surrounded by everything

00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,920
you want to show

00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,959
and let the people know by giving them

00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,720
access

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,199
with certain teasers so that they can

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,000
really stay on the story itself so

00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,560
that's actually

00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,199
the idea behind this i hope this answers

00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,680
your question

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,680
tosses

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,839
do we have any more questions

00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,000
there's one more coming in did you have

00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,560
to convert content from an

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,040
old site or offline content to fit the

00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,199
storytelling approach

00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,560
that's a good question and i would give

00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,560
the first round to you you know

00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:48,240
no we didn't have to migrate any content

00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:50,399
so it was created new by the editors

00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,560
but i think some content is based on a

00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,760
magazine

00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,600
that our client has before so they

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,480
kind of transferred that into this

00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,480
digital form

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,160
yeah i don't know where if you have some

00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,519
more yeah no that's

00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,279
absolutely correct what you're saying

00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,000
it's a um they had i mean

00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,000
from all these like magazines they had

00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,360
existing content but of course they had

00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,079
to convert it first to make it fit um

00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,040
it was also one of the biggest part was

00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,760
also to um

00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,399
to create the taxonomies and map them

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,320
because we set up the taxonomies first

00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,079
and tried to map them to all the stories

00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,759
so that was certainly point

00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:35,040
they had to do then of course fitting um

00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:38,480
the whole story to make it um

00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,000
accessible online and usually

00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,839
the the way you read the magazine

00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,440
offline is really different to

00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,199
the way you read it online so they had

00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,120
to adapt the styles as well a little bit

00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,399
so that was actually quite a bit of work

00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,920
for them as well

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,880
to make the offline content fit into the

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,399
new platform

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:58,959
but also to amend bit the existing

00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,639
of course platform what they had also

00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:04,480
make

00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,480
topics more searchable for example

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,519
thanks very much for the question from

00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,639
you paul

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,639
any more questions

00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,160
so wait another 30 seconds

00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,399
there's one more coming in have they

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,800
added more taxonomies

00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,800
since releasing the sides that's also a

00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,199
good question which i would hand over to

00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,920
you ina

00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,360
yeah i think then the taxonomies were

00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,320
the part that we had

00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,519
the most discussions during the project

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,160
and of course there were

00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:57,199
like some new taxonomies that we now

00:16:54,160 --> 00:17:01,199
added and some old ones that we now

00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:03,839
um removed but yeah i think it's

00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,720
it took a lot of turns to get to the

00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,160
final

00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,160
taxonomy definition

00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,839
i think from a business perspective it

00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,079
was also interesting that some

00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:17,039
of the taxonomies are really independent

00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:20,160
for each other for example

00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,799
the recipes on on how how critical or

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,959
how much

00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,839
how to say know how you need to have to

00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,959
to make one

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,880
but then you also have related topics um

00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,360
where the taxonomies somehow belong

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,200
together and it was uh that was really a

00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,280
hard part in the architecture approach

00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,200
to figure out what fits the best

00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,360
for user perspective at the end of the

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,360
day

00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,919
i hope we could answer this question

00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:47,360
then i would flag this one as well

00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,760
and ask for new questions another one is

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,440
coming

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,320
did the new taxonomies change the

00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,320
architecture

00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
um not really we just had to

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,000
extend the already existing elements
