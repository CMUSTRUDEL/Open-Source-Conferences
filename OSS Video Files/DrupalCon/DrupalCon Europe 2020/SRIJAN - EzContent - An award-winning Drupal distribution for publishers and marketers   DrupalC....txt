what is easy content about and why

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,960
we have positioned it as a solution

00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:13,520
for mid-size to large-size companies

00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:15,840
especially media companies and also all

00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,520
kinds of b2c companies

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,520
what are the market trends that we are

00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,360
seeing and specifically what are the

00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,280
issues being faced especially on the

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,680
editorial side

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,320
and how does easy content help

00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,360
easy content is a ready to use

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,840
customizable

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,640
content management platform built on

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,560
open source

00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,960
drupal of course it's designed to equip

00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,079
brand websites with what we say is an

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,280
editorial

00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:47,840
experience point of view so that

00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,200
the experience that is being delivered

00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,360
by the brand websites

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,119
is being powered not only by the

00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,159
front-end technologies

00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,240
but also by the editorial flexibility

00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,520
that editors are able to bring into the

00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,719
back end

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:07,360
now uh one of the constraints of

00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:10,160
most distributions on drupal is that

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,360
uh if they offer a lot of flexibility on

00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,800
the front end

00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,040
like in this decoupled architecture

00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,080
uh then the back end control by the

00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,000
editorial

00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,239
teams gets limited and on the

00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,360
other hand enhanced back-end editorial

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,239
control

00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,080
can end up limiting the kind of rich

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,239
engaging experiences that can be built

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,879
on the front end

00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,160
excuse me easy content is actually

00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,959
comprising

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,959
combining these options for enhanced

00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,000
editorial efficiency along with

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,920
engaging user experience and we'll try

00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,160
to cover in this presentation how that

00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,760
happens

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,080
look at what's happening in the market

00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,160
first so

00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,239
there are a lot of different choices

00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,519
available before the consumer

00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,239
of brands of media of content

00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,280
there's a lot of different choices

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,519
available

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,599
firstly the whole aspect of

00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,480
multi-channel content

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,120
which is feeding in into diverse

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,879
audiences across the globe across

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,040
demographics with evolving tests

00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,239
an audience which is used to real-time

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,000
news and views coming

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:26,879
at them very fast pace which in which

00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,799
kind of makes it very essential to be

00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,720
able for brand website to churn out

00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,599
content at a fast pace

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,680
but coupled with accuracy of content

00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,599
coupled with relevance of contents and

00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,760
fact checking as we call it

00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,280
the content has to be contextual or

00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,480
relevant as i said

00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,599
it has to be easy to consume it has to

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,519
be timely

00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:48,640
for example today if i want breaking

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,640
news i must

00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:55,680
get relevant rich contextual content

00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:58,640
descriptive content on it that is what

00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,000
will make my brand website stand out if

00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,159
i'm getting the same content

00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,680
on a breaking news which every other

00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,760
website is presenting

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,360
uh then there's no differentiation so

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,400
these are the challenges that

00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,439
you know brands are faced with today uh

00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,000
then coupled with that what what backs

00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,959
it up is

00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,519
in terms of efficiency the editorial

00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,400
process

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,560
processes and preferences in terms of

00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,000
what kind of rich experiences provided

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,280
on the front end

00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,280
uh you know how technologically advanced

00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,360
the solution is in terms of

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,199
delivering content distributing content

00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,639
across different devices and channels

00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,120
and platforms

00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,680
and how easy is it to reuse the

00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,160
technology in terms of modernization

00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,240
in terms of scalability index in terms

00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,320
of architectural choices

00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,919
so this is what we look at and some of

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,720
the elements that come out of this

00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,919
is being able to deliver very rich

00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,680
content authoring

00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,360
across different content different kind

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,680
of content formats

00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,919
uh of course a very strong editorial

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,720
workflow approval process that goes for

00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,160
any

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,080
state of the art cms today uh structured

00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,759
content being able to provide structured

00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,960
content across multiple

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,320
layouts and the ease of doing previews

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,039
one of the things which happened with

00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,400
previews is if you got different

00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,280
uh different front ends on different

00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,240
technologies

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,880
to cater to different multi-channel you

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,240
know

00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,479
options then what happens is preview

00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,639
often doesn't run as effectively or

00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,639
sometimes it is not possible to

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,240
run preview so that is another challenge

00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:39,759
which editorial teams have to overcome

00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,280
in terms of experiences responsiveness

00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,880
or the landing pages that has become

00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,360
something standard now

00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,560
uh ai powered content generation is

00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,120
becoming more and more

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,120
now and that is something we looked at

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,440
very closely when we looked at what

00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,120
aspects to take care of as far as market

00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,360
trends are concerned

00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,720
uh of course social media integration

00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,280
mobile first

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,319
design centralized platform for faster

00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,319
launches

00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,520
and scalable content delivery these all

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,520
go hand in hand

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,280
so these are some of the aspects that we

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,080
considered when we looked at what does

00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,280
the market

00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:18,000
look at from a modern open source

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,000
drupal distribution cms in today's

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,840
scenario

00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:26,800
uh some of the issues faced by

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:29,199
editors you know is in terms of being

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,199
able to add and upload and edit content

00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,759
and being able to preview it across

00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,960
different channels effectively right

00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,919
being able to

00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,600
deliver content generation across any

00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,880
device or platform

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,880
uh how easy it is to embed videos for

00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,160
example on product pages or the landing

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,039
pages

00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,639
uh landing pages built with drag and

00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,759
drop components that's become

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:56,080
a very standard uh requirement

00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,280
standard but critical requirement layout

00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,639
builder

00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,120
uh content workflows with flexible ui

00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,240
is easy handling of images being able to

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,199
find in

00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,160
the pages uh that flow of work between

00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,240
the editorial

00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,599
uh processes should go around very

00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,240
smoothly

00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,479
content versioning being able to select

00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,479
suitable content versions

00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,240
and being able to control and monitor

00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,240
how those versions are being modified

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,560
down the line

00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,560
and being able to publish multiple

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,759
content types in terms of images or

00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:33,280
videos or audio or carousels or text

00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:37,199
or pictures whatever they may be

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,280
in different layouts uh how do

00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,120
companies benefit from ease of content

00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,039
when looking at all these

00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,280
market trends and looking at the issues

00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:48,479
that editors face

00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:50,800
uh some of these

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,919
overall enterprise level benefits that

00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,879
we see

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,639
is in terms of how quickly we are able

00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,599
to get the product to market

00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,680

learning

00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,440
engine into it being able to take

00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,440
real-time seo scores and suggestions

00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,280
media management and it is a cloud

00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,960
native api first

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:32,080
platform uh

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,320
how does it actually empower the brand

00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,519
teams for the editorial teams

00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:41,360
uh so the entire content offering

00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:43,360
is done via a very rich set of features

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,040
which have been put together and brought

00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,000
together and not all this

00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:50,800
this entire set of features is seen with

00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,560
most vms or decoupled architectures

00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,480
what you see is what you get layout

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,160
builder paragraph

00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,519
drag and drop components and of course

00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,880
the aiml

00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:03,040
piece over there being able to support

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,160
multiple content channels with decoupled

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,240
front ends

00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,760
along with the ability to preview and

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,000
schedule and publish content

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,440
editorial workflows artificial

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,399
intelligence and machine learning i

00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,800
mentioned that

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,480
the editors actually have a full control

00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,000
on how they work with control and

00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,360
layouts

00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,480
and in addition this system comes with

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,080
the options to have different channels

00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,680
on the front ends powered by

00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:35,120
technologies like angular like react

00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:38,800
or like gatsby so you can have a choice

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:41,120
of of front-ends backed by a

00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,240
very strong capability on the editorial

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,360
backend part

00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,360
to deliver the content

00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:52,240
uh as i said it's avail is

00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,279
it's a cms designed to support editors

00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,880
and marketers

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:59,200
across a range of industries

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,560
uh wherever there is a lot of public

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,959
publishing needed

00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,079
in order to cater to you know fast

00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,560
consumed content

00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,640
over the brand websites fast consume

00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,640
contents in different formats

00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,320
uh you know changing very rapidly and

00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,240
the website need to be scalable of

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,959
course so all kinds of

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,079
industries such as media sites news and

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,200
publication

00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,880
portals travel management companies

00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,440
travel portals of travel management

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,480
companies or airlines for that matter

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,480
brand websites or marketing websites

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,480
for most other industries for example

00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:35,519
farmer or consumer

00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,120
pharma industries have a lot of brand

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,920
websites for different

00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,519
products so do consumer industries like

00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,480
nestle for that matter or pharma

00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,920
industries like bayer or like novartis

00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:50,240
and for e-commerce as well and for

00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,120
most website use cases except for those

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,399
which are not

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,279
purely website related so that's

00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,800
how it it applies to most businesses in

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,200
these sectors

00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,480
and most businesses looking for an open

00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,120
source distribution

00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,399
uh which largely means drupal in today's

00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,640
day and age

00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:12,000
uh you know have a very good choice as

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,480
far as easy content is concerned

00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,240
uh just to sum up the features and

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,839
benefits once more

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,800
uh there is a lot of large community

00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,120
available

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,240
which can be leveraged for rich content

00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,160
creation

00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,760
different kinds of contributed modules

00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,560
have been leveraged for it to

00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,920
enable different kind of curated content

00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,000
types

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,519
it is very easy to publish content with

00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,920
the landing

00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,839
page builder feature and with the

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,000
component based dragon drops layout

00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,160
functionality

00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,760
you can choose between coupled decoupled

00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,360
or headless architecture

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,360
you can have the front-end technology

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,600
based on your context in the channel

00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,360
in terms of your multi-channel scenario

00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,279
as i said it could be angular

00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,760
or it could be react or it could be

00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,880
gatsby and we are constantly

00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,880
looking to evolve this framework

00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,519
it's a decoupled framework yet it comes

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,920
with an enhanced preview capability

00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,320
and then the ai enabled content

00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,920
generation in image stacking so editors

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,600
can actually

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,399
tag content right and tag tag images as

00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,399
well

00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,880
and make the content available for

00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,480
classification based on the ai enabled

00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,160
content generation which is a great

00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,440
saving in terms of

00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,200
uh how tank how much time they take and

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,320
how much flexibility they have

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,320
to build in these changes

00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,399
this is not a just a product which is

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:41,920
just there as a product it is

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:45,360
it is a working proven product

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:48,720
uh we have recently uh

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,279
delivered it uh you know with a large

00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,000
media cop with the large media

00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,800
broadcasting

00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,360
company called mediacorp in singapore uh

00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,079
singa

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,800
mediacorp is austin's actually largest

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,519
tv

00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,839
news broadcaster and we are delivering

00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,320
it

00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,000
uh you know we are modernizing eight

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,440
different websites

00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,680
of media cop from drupal 7

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,360
and a few other cms platform there was

00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,560
there were there were four different cms

00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,519
platforms

00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,560
all being brought on to drupal 8 and

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,639
using easy content as the architectural

00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,880
solution

00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,000
now that's a very large implementation

00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,200
going on

00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,320
uh siegen has earlier delivered

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,680
a drupal 8 revamp

00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,079
for crane communications uh which was

00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,839
not

00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,240
built on easy content because easy

00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,800
content didn't exist at that time

00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,600
but especially everything that we have

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,279
done for queen

00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,880
communications and we have presented

00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,760
clean communications

00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,480
in earlier drupal cons and in acquia

00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,880
engage and it

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,560
actually won't acquire engage award

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:57,600
everything that we have done in

00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,920
grain communications is what led to uh

00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,600
the

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,839
development and launch of easy content

00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,639
we are working with other consumer

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:07,839
companies

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,720
uh we are recently signing on with

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,079
nestle nestle's own distribution

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,639
litenest

00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,600
is very similar to how easy content

00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,240
works

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,120
and in fact uh we we were chosen by

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,279
nestle

00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,720
because they could see uh you know that

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,880
easy content is

00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,000
doing precisely the same kind of things

00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,760
that they have and this

00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,600
that tesla themselves have envisaged

00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,199
with their drupal distribution called

00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:35,920
lightness so so it's a proven platform

00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,639
uh we are engaging with quite a few

00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,519
companies

00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,480
already in terms of delivering it to

00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,880
more such

00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,519
companies in the media or in the

00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,360
consumer or pharma or travel space

00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:50,320
or for that matter other industries

00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:52,880
which may have a similar requirement of

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,079
you know content generation at fast

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,199
speeds and

00:14:54,079 --> 00:15:01,440
to us audiences on a scalable level

00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:03,279
so that's what we look forward to and uh

00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,480
i'll welcome your questions which we

00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,399
look to answer

00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:10,959
uh through this format in due course uh

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,000
time is over so if there is any question

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,199
