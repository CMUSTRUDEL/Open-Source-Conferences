Description: 
	"With developers, marketers, and editors all in the fray, and thanks to the challenges surrounding the coronavirus pandemic this year, a CMS that enables remote collaboration and rich interaction has never been more important. In addition, the expectations on editorial and marketing teams working with content have grown significantly thanks to new demands for digital experiences that go well beyond the normal website.

EzContent can serve all of your team's needs, not just for a website but also for a decoupled front-end application. This intelligent Drupal distribution focuses on publishers and marketersâ€™ needs for a robust off-the-shelf feature suite and innovative elements like content staging, workflows aided by artificial intelligence and machine learning, layout builder with de-coupled front ends, and an API-ready design well-suited for new digital experiences.

The speakers will highlight key reasons (read features) on how EzContent is an absolute choice for publishers and marketers. 

EzContent is also a recipient of the 2020 Acquia Engage Awards. "
