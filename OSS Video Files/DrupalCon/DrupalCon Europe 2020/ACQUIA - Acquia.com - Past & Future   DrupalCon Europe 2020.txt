Description: 
	During this session we will look back on the history of Acquia.com, and discuss the process we went through to re-imagine the new Acquia.com which is planned to be released soon.  We will cover our work with Third & Grove, our content strategy & analysis and how we drink our own champagne. Through the use of Acquia Cloud, Site Studio and Campaign Studio (and other Acquia products) we were able to create a new site that works better for customers, and our content managers and marketers.

through the design and ux phase of

00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,200
what we went through uh for the project

00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,119
i'll cover

00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,320
the build and the content phase in a

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,520
little bit more detail

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,399
kind of just what we were up against how

00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,360
we did it

00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,960
um yeah and any of the products that we

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,680
used from within acquia and then we'll

00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,079
leave it up

00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,880
and open for just some quick questions

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,600
and

00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,239
uh answers for if you have any questions

00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,239
for what did

00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,200
so starting for just our history i'm

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,200
sure everyone knows who

00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,560
aqui is if you've been to a drupalcon

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,760
but aquia

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,879
is almost just about over 13 years old

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,000
founded back in

00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,840
2007 so just in the last one and a half

00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,920
years we've acquired

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,680
uh three companies modic cohesion and

00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,519
agile one to really

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,400
help establish ourselves as a leader in

00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,280
the digital experience platform uh

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,519
world so with this growth we've had just

00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,920
an

00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,519
increased need for agility and speed

00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,720
within our organization to do more than

00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,160
we've done

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,800
ever before and the websites had to kind

00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,200
of adapt

00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,000
to that so as we've kind of matured

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,319
along the way

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,200
like our our north star where we need to

00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,400
be and

00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,200
um what we need to achieve is has

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,879
changed

00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,239
and the need for consistency and the

00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,840
strategic vision

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,319
and how we market ourselves and our

00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,200
products um is more important than ever

00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,400
as we've

00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,680
evolved um so yeah so we've started down

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,480
this path on

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,239
an evolution um and it was time to

00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,760
rebuild and refactor

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:20,239
the overall user experience for the

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,040
company and where we are today and in

00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,159
the future

00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,760
so this is what we're doing

00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:29,760
um so to kind of do that we've assembled

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,680
basically what we felt was the best team

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,840
for speed and agility

00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,640
and we selected third grove as our

00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,480
main partner agency to do this work in

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,519
helping evolve our web strategy

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,519
and the strategic design in ux that any

00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,400
good project needs to

00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,840
really make things better and help help

00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,920
position our brand in the best way

00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,159
possible

00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,120
along with third and growth we partnered

00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,920
with

00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,680
a small shop called mythic digital who's

00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,239
been supporting web operations team

00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,599
within aqua for a number of years now

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,239
they have extensive knowledge of our

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,159
existing site and just an overall

00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,760
historical background that you don't get

00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,680
with bringing in new staff

00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,280
partners so they kind of know our

00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,439
processes know our people

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,040
know our business really well so they're

00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,519
really really quick in just

00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,040
leading the overall development effort

00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,199
and then we decided to do this

00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,479
development build in-house

00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,080
so working with mythic digital the

00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,280
marketing web operations team was

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,479
primarily responsible

00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,240
for helping build the new site

00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,560
and helping architect it and partnering

00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,639
with other areas

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,639
within aqua to get the site built

00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,000
some of our objectives for the project

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,759
so we broke them mostly down into two

00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,400
different categories brain objectives

00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,320
and technical objectives

00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,680
so working with third and growth we hope

00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,600
to

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,880
evolve and push our brain standards

00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,000
forward we already had a pretty

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,720
established brand

00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,120
strategy so we wanted to improve the

00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,880
discoverability site-wide of the content

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,880
that we offer that explains our products

00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,520
and services so since we were so focused

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,120
on

00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,479
drupal and hosting before adding all

00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,759
these new products we really had to kind

00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,840
of evolve that

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,440
and push that forward and we wanted to

00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,479
just enhance the overall design of the

00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,280
site equal

00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,720
just a better digital experience for

00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:23,199
what we offer and what we

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,320
hope that our clients and customers also

00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,800
offer

00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,919
and then from a technical objective the

00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,520
site was

00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,199
built a couple the original site was

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,360
built a couple years ago so we wanted to

00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,720
really impre implement that new design

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,560
rework our content model improve overall

00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,320
site performance accessibility

00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,000
and we really wanted to just become the

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,960
ultimate awkward case study

00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,840
for what we pitched to our customers and

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,120
really show off

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,600
our products um so that covers kind of

00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,199
just a background history of the project

00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,880
and now um justin's going to talk a

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,680
little bit about the designing ux phase

00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,240
awesome thanks matt so when i found out

00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,800
that we

00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,759
won the redesign effort with aquia i was

00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,520
filled with two

00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,840
i felt like two emotions immediately and

00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:09,520
simultaneously one was gratitude we've

00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,039
we're partners since the beginning of

00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,319
third and grove with aquia

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,600
um you know they've been a really

00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,479
important part of they've been super

00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,160
supportive of us

00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,080
and even before third and grove drupal

00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,880
has largely been how i've made a living

00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,639
as an adult

00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,160
so it's just had a huge impact on my

00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,840
life and so um

00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,280
for the opportunity to you know help the

00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,160
organization that's been so supportive

00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,680
of us was just

00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,360
an awesome moment professionally and i

00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,880
just was so thankful that they were

00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,400
willing to sort of work with us in that

00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,560
way the second

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,240
feeling i felt at the same time was

00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,680
complete terror because this is the one

00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,600
project you can't up

00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,720
is redesigning acquia.com our most

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,960
important partner so

00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,720
we had to get this right um and we were

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,199
really excited to dive in but certainly

00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,360
there was

00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,120
um there was a lot riding on on

00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,759
collaborating with aqua on this

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,039
um luckily we had a great team with matt

00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,639
and kirsten and the whole marketing team

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,720
over at awkward and we i think the uh

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,759
the outcome is is really really great so

00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,039
as matt said i want to just talk a

00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,080
little bit about the creative process

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,000
that we went through so

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,919
you know the first thing that we look at

00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,280
are the personas or the kinds of people

00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,960
that visit a website

00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,479
and try to understand those different

00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,479
groups um and

00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,840
uh and understand their perspectives and

00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,520
what they need from the experience and

00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,880
so acquia has a lot of personas there's

00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,880
prospective customers

00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,919
uh there's existing customers there's

00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,599
partners there's

00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,440
employees potential employees people who

00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,520
want to work at acquia press

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,960
analysts investors there's a lot of

00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,960
different folks

00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:29,039
and so we do a number of things like

00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:32,000
competitive analysis

00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,280
looking at analytics data um but really

00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,479
an important crucial part

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,919
is the stakeholder interview and um matt

00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,160
you can go to the next slide and so

00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,680
for the uh stakeholder interviews this

00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,639
is what they actually look like

00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,479
it's having conversations with people

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,440
now these conversations obviously had to

00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,120
be over zoom

00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,400
um and they were individual but we

00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,919
talked to lots of different folks so on

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,680
this screen our executives you probably

00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,120
recognize from the aqua team

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,479
as well as some awkward customers who

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,360
really have a good perspective on the

00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,199
product from

00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,879
the customer side using it at their own

00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,960
organizations and so we

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,879
we organized a series of these um

00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,160
one-on-one chats with a variety of

00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,879
different stakeholders internal and

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,400
external

00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,080
and that coupled with all the other

00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,120
analysis that we did really gives us a

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,199
good sense of how

00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,800
different perspectives view the brand

00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,759
where the value is and what the

00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,759
what the essence is

00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,360
so you know there are a lot of different

00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,280
folks who interact with acquia but what

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,960
we found is whether you're a cto or a

00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,159
director of marketing or

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,399
um somebody who might want to you know

00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,800
work at aqua it really sort of boiled

00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,200
down

00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,800
in essence into these three things

00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,240
everyone really sort of shared these

00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,080
common sentiments and

00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,680
and they were universal um you know they

00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,959
wanted to trust acquia as a brand they

00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,920
wanted to feel understood and they

00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,360
wanted to feel

00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,040
like they had a strong partner in what

00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,399
they were trying to do and what they

00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,560
were trying to accomplish

00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,920
um and this is really the perspective we

00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,959
try to take on an effort like this

00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,640
there's this idea of

00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,240
of breaking a problem down into first

00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,440
principles so really sort of fundamental

00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,399
components of what

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,680
um of what a uh you know in essence of a

00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,480
problem or a challenge or sort of a

00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,080
thing is

00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,000
and so for us this was a way to get

00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,600
really down to that core essence and

00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,959
and then once we got to that point then

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,519
we could move forward in terms of what

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,640
the

00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,480
actual design looked like so for for us

00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,320
it was really about three pillars

00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,160
um and these were the three biggest

00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,839
strength areas that we felt were major

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,519
differentiators for acquia a really

00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,760
strong collection of products

00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,200
an awesome community driven by the open

00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,040
source community of drupal

00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,640
and then best-in-class exceptional

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,240
customer support and so these three

00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,880
pillars are what we took into

00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:37,440
into that design phase so we don't want

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,839
to uh show all the designs because we

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,040
want

00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,399
that to be visible when the site

00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,360
launches but i wanted to show a couple

00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,720
of things

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,440
um and so uh yeah perfect so

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,120
i wanted to show sort of three areas um

00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,959
that really exemplify

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,040
these three pillars the first one on

00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,160
product so this was this x-ray feature

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,080
that we

00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,240
developed and the idea here is that

00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,320
somebody browsing the aqueous site

00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,000
can sort of on any page go and sort of

00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,360
look under the hood and sort of see what

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,240
aquia products power

00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,079
that particular um page on the site uh

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,480
it could be a personalization could be

00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,839
um site studio uh whatever it might be a

00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,519
collection of products that really power

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,079
that digital experience and the ideas

00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,680
as a as a prospective person to the aqua

00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,360
platform can actually see like here's

00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,519
something live and then here are the

00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,040
pieces of the aqua dxp that i can use to

00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,600
make that experience really compelling

00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,120
so

00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,240
i'm giving sort of prospects and ability

00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,160
to really like look under the hood and

00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,560
see and see how things work

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,079
the second piece was all about community

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,079
and so this is a

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,440
major differentiator for aquia and the

00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,440
drupal ecosystem

00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,880
um the community um you know it's long

00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,320
been said come for the code stay for the

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,399
community and so that is really

00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,320
exemplified by aqui and so we wanted to

00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,160
bake that into the visual experience and

00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,079
so we really doubled down on on

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,040
community happy customers social proof

00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,120
really just showing

00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,480
the active diverse community that makes

00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,519
up folks that power

00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,360
um use and leverage aqua every day

00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,959
and then the third pillar of the design

00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,480
that we wanted to show was you know

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,079
customer service and so this was more

00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,640
around you know guide don't tell and so

00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,240
from a

00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,680
marketing website perspective this is

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,440
more you know helping the user get to

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,120
the information that they need and so

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,800
uh one of the things that we did is sort

00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,480
of a self-guided questionnaire choose

00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,480
your own adventure kind of flow

00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,040
in terms of learning a little bit more

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,480
about a potential prospect or visitor to

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,680
the site and then steering them towards

00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,000
the best um

00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,399
possible information and experience um

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,399
from there

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,880
and i think that's what we want to do so

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,079
matt i'll give it back to you

00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,240
all right awesome so

00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,680
once we kind of got through our design

00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,920
and ux phase we

00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,959
started entering the build and content

00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,160
phase

00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,560
so what we want to really kind of talk

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,720
about

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,839
is how we kind of approach that and one

00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,880
of the things that i

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,399
i do on most projects is trying to run

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,600
as many tasks in parallel

00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:55,040
so while we had a lot of ux design work

00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,000
happening towards kind of the end of

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,880
that process we

00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,680
made sure that we could really start on

00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,839
a lot more of the

00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,440
the technical tasks so in order to do

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,320
that the most important thing

00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:07,040
is to lay a good foundation so making

00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,639
sure your

00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,320
infrastructure is kind of set and

00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,120
understood making sure your build

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,399
process

00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,079
and your um

00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,000
all the tools that you need to be to

00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:23,040
make sure that developers are productive

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,200
and really fast is really important

00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,160
and then developing an overall content

00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,440
plan

00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,360
for what you're going to do especially

00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,079
with drupal sites so making sure you

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:33,680
if you're using either site studio or

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,760
layout builder or if you're doing just

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,399
like structured content like just making

00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,320
sure that

00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,240
all that stuff is defined ahead of time

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,760
before your developers are

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,600
ready to kind of hit the ground running

00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,959
and you can run that in parallel with a

00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,160
lot of other

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:51,360
tasks and then keep the back head

00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:53,839
the back end ahead of the front end so

00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,959
for what we do with developing like our

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:58,079
structured content

00:12:54,959 --> 00:13:00,800
or our components for site studio

00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,079
we always keep our backend developer

00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,160
busy first

00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,160
so they're creating new components

00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,720
making new content types building

00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,440
a lot of that stuff up front and then

00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,360
layering in

00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,560
the front end on top of that so that

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,480
gives you a little bit more time in

00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,279
parallel for designs to finish up too

00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,360
while you're

00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,519
starting some of this back end work if

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,000
you know what your content model is

00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:24,240
and then it can just one person stays

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,360
ahead of front end like all the time

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,320
and is getting work done along the way

00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,880
and then four tests along the way so we

00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,600
definitely

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,639
move in more of a agile fashion within

00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,360
aqua

00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,199
and so we're constantly cueing as like

00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:43,440
new stuff comes in

00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:46,560
we'll do unit testing for

00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,760
more functional items of the site

00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,160
and then we just make sure that that

00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,440
kind of always gets done

00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,160
along the way uh and then five uh bring

00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,360
it all together

00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:00,959
so while creative is kind of wrapping up

00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:04,000
um dev is kind of on its way and then

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,959
you kind of fold in the content piece so

00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,279
as you're

00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,959
out generating your new content coming

00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,720
with your new creative

00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,720
that all kind of then flows back in

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,839
together um and you can

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:17,839
hopefully run as much in parallel as

00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,839
possible

00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:24,639
so we started our project back in july

00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,760
with third and grove we went through

00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,079
basically

00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,480
september when we started to get

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,240
creative concepts and delivery

00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,320
that was also when we kind of started a

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,320
lot of our development work so since

00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,240
this was happening in-house

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,440
we partnered with our professional

00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,240
services group to do

00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,560
some day-to-day support work while our

00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,040
our primary team focused on the build

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,880
and so that started in september and

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,639
that was really to

00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,240
set up the initial code base set up the

00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,519
build and the workflow

00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,480
uh set up pipelines for the development

00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,480
workflow

00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,079
we created a new theme we configured

00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,079
like the admin theme

00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,040
and we set up google sso like all that

00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,360
stuff that you can kind of get out of

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,959
the way without having to get into

00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,680
um the nitty gritty theming and

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,120
that kind of stuff and then the for the

00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,120
primary development we went through

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,040
setting up site studio our content types

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,320
our structured content

00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,000
um first so we kind of

00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,000
figured out the easy stuff first for

00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,199
structured content did that

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,800
um and then we've moved into site studio

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,480
and components and really kind of

00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,920
move that along so as i said before

00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,399
we're kind of focusing on

00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,079
and hoping to have things done probably

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,320
uh sometime mid january

00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:41,759
uh we're reaching that kind of final

00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,800
testing content loading

00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,160
creative process and then the content

00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,440
team is busy

00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,440
pulling all that content together

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,000
for our content plan organizing the

00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,279
content so

00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,600
we had an existing site um our and we

00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:02,320
reviewed what we had so we broke things

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,560
down into structured versus unstructured

00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,040
um we found that to be the easiest way

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,680
to kind of split things apart

00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,880
the original site was a big user of

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,000
paragraphs

00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,519
and we took a lot of those um pieces and

00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,279
paragraphs and moved them just to a more

00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,000
structured content model

00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,240
so things like ebooks white papers blog

00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,759
posts press releases and just made it a

00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,120
little bit easier

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:29,519
we then wrote a migration step to

00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,279
convert that stuff from paragraphs to

00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,639
structured content

00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:34,880
and then reducing the amount of

00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,720
unstructured content allows us to focus

00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,959
on the creation of

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,079
new content so we migrated all the old

00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,959
the other

00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:45,680
structured stuff and then we focused on

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:48,480
the unstructured landing pages home page

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,000
things like that um that couldn't really

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,839
be migrated

00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,079
in an easy way and started that work

00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,320
the structured content model since we're

00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,839
coming from a legacy

00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,160
drupal site with paragraphs we

00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:05,360
definitely consolidated

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,439
i think we over 65 percent of the

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,039
existing content types were moved from

00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,400
unstructured paragraphs to their new

00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,000
structured form

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,280
uh so we were dramatically reduced how

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,640
many content types that we have on the

00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,640
site to make it easier for our

00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:20,880
editors

00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,240
and then for unstructured the

00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,839
unstructured plan

00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,240
uh the hardest part of working with the

00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:29,039
unstructured content is the unknown

00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:30,240
so although we had playing mock-ups as

00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,679
creative starts

00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,360
going through them and we start putting

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,440
in content and see how it will flow

00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,200
there's always like the need for more

00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,039
components that show up kind of along

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,400
the way so the nice thing with

00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:41,360
components is you can kind of build them

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,799
piece by piece

00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:44,559
and as you need more you can just add

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,160
them and then just

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,760
evaluating the mock-ups that we got from

00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,679
third and grove

00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,679
you take those and break them down into

00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:55,200
a detailed component model which i have

00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:58,000
shown here that just kind of outlines

00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,440
what you need to build um and then we

00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,160
kind of break it down into responsive

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,400
views too

00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,840
so developers have an idea of like how

00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,840
these components need to interact

00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,280
and then plan your migration so we did

00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:14,960
move everything from paragraphs

00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,120
into consistent structured content

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,720
and then we rebuilt everything else with

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,039
site studio in our component

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,039
system

00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:29,600
so what we also then started to do is we

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,840
used drupal 9 as our our starting point

00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,679
um it's exciting that it's it's out and

00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,400
we've had a really good time working

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,720
with it

00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:43,520
so far since we're migrating an existing

00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:45,760
site over or moving and rebuilding

00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,280
um and we so we had a greenhouse jobs

00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,120
integration module

00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,799
and then we have an external news module

00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,640
and so we kind of reviewed all those for

00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,520
compatibility of drupal 9 and updated

00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,679
them and

00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,559
made sure they were all working but

00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,000
everything else

00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:59,280
as far as module inventory like

00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,320
everything else we needed to build the

00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,799
site was

00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,320
d9 compatible we didn't have any issues

00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,679
with that

00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,120
so we're really excited for everything

00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,120
that triple 9 had to offer

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,320
and then pulling the um the aqua part

00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:18,240
into this

00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:22,720
um we leverage a lot of aqua products

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:25,520
um more as we get them so our primary

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,880
uh products you use for a cloud platform

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,080
um edge protect

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,200
for the cdn and web application firewall

00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,799
and then we have a really streamlined

00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,480
developer workflow with pipelines and

00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:37,120
odes

00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,000
that allow our developers to work within

00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,320
github and

00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,640
really improve our web ops workflow

00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,679
we use site studio for a flexible

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,600
component system

00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,799
for all of our landing pages and product

00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,400
pages and just

00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,559
overall improves the content editor

00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,000
experience for end user or

00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,080
internal users that are updating the

00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,360
site and

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:01,120
then this year we i'm sure you if you've

00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,240
seen the blog post we migrated from

00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,640
marketo to

00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,240
campaign studio and so that's fully

00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,280
integrated with our drupal site

00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,760
for our lead generation forms on the

00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,880
whole

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,000
dxp system and then the customer data

00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,240
platform

00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,480
which we are also rolling out with this

00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,400
launch of the site

00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,240
for a single customer profile info

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:25,520
segmentation for leads

00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:27,520
machine learning and ai for all that

00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,440
and then personalization for

00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:31,679
personalizing key areas of the site

00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,159
it integrates their cdp and campaign

00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:38,320
studio to kind of keep all that data

00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:40,320
flowing together and so we

00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,440
hope that building the new occupy.com it

00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,480
becomes the best

00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:48,240
in class uh case study for aqua

00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:52,000
and drupal to really highlight uh

00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,720
how good the two are together

00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,840
and i think that wraps it up like we're

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,240
just about

00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,000
20 minutes so i wanted to leave enough

00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,640
time if anyone had

00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,679
questions or anything they wanted to

00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,679
know about the project

00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,679
thanks matt um just to remind everyone

00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,120
obviously there's there's the zoom

00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,440
functionality and then there's also the

00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,960
um

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,320
the web platform as well so if you do

00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,760
have questions just please type them

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,880
into the web platform and we'll we'll

00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,320
get to them because i know some of you

00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,840
guys have dialed in by the zoom which is

00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,600
not a problem but um

00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,799
yeah none that have come in so far but i

00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,360
know we've got a couple of couple of

00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,360
moments yet

00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,600
cool i guess while we're waiting for

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,880
that i'll highlight the two sides for

00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,919
contribution opportunities for friday

00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,039
um for mentored contribution first time

00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:41,760
contributor workshop

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:43,200
general contribution i know those are

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,280
always exciting days

00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,280
i've done them before myself so

00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,600
matt what's been the most challenging

00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:55,600
thing so he has just had one question

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,320
take that first yeah no no you you go

00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:03,280
and now i'll i'll get this question

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,400
sorry i've got a lag oh no worries i was

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,679
just asking matt what he thought the

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,120
most challenging thing about the project

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,760
i know i know we're not quite live yet

00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,039
but

00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,960
you know biggest learning moment biggest

00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:14,480
challenge

00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:17,200
yeah i think um for right now it's been

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,440
all the the content work so we're

00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,760
actually creating a lot of content

00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,799
um probably 50 60 pages of content that

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,799
we didn't have before

00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,640
so we're really expanding out our

00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,000
product information our technical

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,919
documentation

00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,039
um on the site so just kind of pulling

00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,360
all that together has really been the

00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:38,400
hardest part

00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:41,120
so far it always it's

00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,400
yeah it's always funny it seems like the

00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,440
the build is easy part

00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,240
sometimes it's getting everything on the

00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,840
page

00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:49,520
yeah totally and i feel like content so

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,360
is an area that's often like

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,640
not emphasized about how much time it's

00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,000
going to take to really sort of get

00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,320
right because it you know content

00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,240
really more closely married to the

00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:00,080
overall like ux and ui than i think a

00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:02,559
lot of people realize going in so

00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,080
yeah and stakeholders so wrangling it

00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:08,240
can take some time

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,919
yeah alex you had a question yes

00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:12,159
thank you so the um yeah the question

00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,559
that's coming is do you or we acquire

00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,000
have long term plans and perspectives uh

00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,240
for the website i assume the question is

00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,240
there

00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,520
um yeah so this is kind of what we're

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,960
considering just

00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:28,000
almost like a first phase of the project

00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:31,039
so we're definitely um

00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,360
we have plans to fold in a lot more

00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:35,679
personalization um really streamlining

00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:38,240
all the product integrations

00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:39,200
through the site we have to really

00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,440
enhance the

00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,200
partner aspect of it which i'm sure

00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,400
interest justin a lot

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,720
um that is stuff that we've kind of

00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,559
we deferred to phase two so the first

00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,000
quarter or two we'll be really busy

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:56,480
um picking that additional stuff up we

00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,640
also hope to kind of roll out this new

00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,640
uh web brand strategy across other

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,640
properties uh so you should see it

00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,120
start to kind of materialize in like

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,679
devdot aqua

00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,120
and other sites throughout the year as

00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:11,520
we start to rebuild those

00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,520
as well

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,360
great thank you matt

00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,799
there are no more that have come in at

00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,080
the moment so if if anyone does have any

00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,520
questions that we can't get to whilst

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,120
we're on this i just encourage everyone

00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,320
um to come to the accurate booth or the

00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,120
virtual booth obviously because we are

00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,240
we're here for

00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:29,600
the next few hours then obviously

00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,200
tomorrow as well so um if there's any

00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:33,200
more questions type them in there but

00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:47,840
if not we can we can take them to the

00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:47,840
booth and have a chat there as well

00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,120
would you do it again matt would you

00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,679
redesign again

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:58,960
um yeah i mean i've been through a

00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,080
number of these in my

00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:05,520
my lifetime so um they're always

00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:08,000
each one's like slightly different um

00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,799
but yeah i would always i would always

00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,159
do it again

00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:13,520
i love building sites so um each one's

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,720
always a little

00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,600
a little different so um i think this

00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,679
one's been

00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:25,039
yeah this one's been i think just

00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:28,000
exciting because it's aqua so

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,640
um building aqueous drupal site is

00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,559
always a

00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,240
an exciting thing um

00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,919
oh yeah yeah definitely a lot of

00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:38,400
attention but that's good

00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,799
yeah yeah cool so it's gonna be really

00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,799
exciting

00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,159
yeah i can't wait to see it live

00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,520
excellent what about you oh go ahead

00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,320
yeah yeah so what about you though what

00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,000
did you think was

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:56,240
uh maybe one of the harder aspects of

00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,080
the work that you had to do well i think

00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,679
that to do great work you need three

00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,159
things you need really smart people

00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,919
you need not quite enough time um and

00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:05,840
you need candid candor

00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,120
and like everyone has to be honest with

00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:09,360
them like with the whole

00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,240
with everybody right like on both sides

00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,919
um and i think

00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,200
just making everybody comfortable that

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,320
that's an important part of the project

00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,279
because that's not something that people

00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,159
like to do

00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,200
um is is really crucial and so um i

00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,840
think we

00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,039
uh we definitely you know focused on

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,559
that and i think it really

00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,159
improved the overall outcome of the

00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:28,799
project um but i you know i don't think

00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:32,640
anyone really enjoys like being blunt

00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:33,760
um but if you if you encourage it then i

00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,559
just think it makes everyone's work

00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,880
better right

00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,080
so definitely so i think that and i

00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,880
think i think overall it went really

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,360
well and

00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,640
um you know we we have a lot of clients

00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,000
and you guys are smart and know what

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,240
you're doing and it was fun to work with

00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:53,840
you

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:53,840
so that's good yeah definitely

00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:04,320
i feel like i should have some like lame

00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,520
jokes ready to go or something you know

00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,000
why did the drupal engineer cross the

00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,360
road or something there's no punch line

00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,320
to that joke but

00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,520
now i wish i had one i know well it's

00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,960
tricky you never know like quite where

00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,640
to like end up

00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,399
like do you leave like like do you like

00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,919
go like right to the end and like

00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:22,399
there's like people have tons of

00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:26,080
questions and then yeah

00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:27,360
you don't need time that's okay um

00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,840
yeah we'll definitely be rolling out

00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:32,640
like a number of webinars and additional

00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,279
blog posts and data for this so i'm sure

00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,000
people will

00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,640
probably get sick of it at some point

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,480
and it was good

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,840
you guys really focused on dog putting

00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,279
everything like you really wanted to use

00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,880
every product and capability that you

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,159
had you know the full suite and that

00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,000
takes you know to make it into the

00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:47,360
project and to deploy all those was

00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
really really really cool you know to

00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,880
focus on that

00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,559
so um and i know you talked about the

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,399
the migration from marketo i think right

00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,480
to uh to campaign studio

00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,080
um so that's that's really awesome like

00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,440
to deploy all of your tools in in

00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,640
production and um

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,960
and then and then talk about that

00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,480
experience is really neat so that um

00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,159
you know you your money where your mouth

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,120
is that's good

00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,120
yeah definitely

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:20,480
