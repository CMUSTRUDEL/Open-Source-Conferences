Playlist: DrupalCon Europe 2020
Description: 
	During this session we will look back on the history of Acquia.com, and discuss the process we went through to re-imagine the new Acquia.com which is planned to be released soon.  We will cover our work with Third & Grove, our content strategy & analysis and how we drink our own champagne. Through the use of Acquia Cloud, Site Studio and Campaign Studio (and other Acquia products) we were able to create a new site that works better for customers, and our content managers and marketers.
