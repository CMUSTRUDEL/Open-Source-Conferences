00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,520
all

00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,600
about the challenges that as a marketer

00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,960
you encounter when you're building

00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,080
customer journeys and also about how

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,560
marketing automation

00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,280
and personalization can help you do a

00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,119
better job

00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,360
with uh that you're already doing with

00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,520
drupal today but most of all it's

00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,159
supposed to be a very practical session

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,320
to um to show you how we're doing it um

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,280
a drop solid and how you can uh how you

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,280
can do it as well

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,479
so um offering every customer the best

00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,320
possible experience

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,600
that's what drives many businesses and

00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,560
marketers today

00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,360
um why is that because that's what your

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,920
customers

00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,439
or members or citizens or students

00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,680
that's what they expect

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,640
um your competitors aren't your

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,720
competitors and

00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,880
your only competitors anymore you are

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,680
competing with the different apps

00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,360
on your user's iphone um that's what

00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,479
people expect in terms of customer

00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,759
experience

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,200
regardless if you're b2b or b2c or even

00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,360
working at an ngo

00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,840
you're marketing to humans who have

00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,520
phones who use apps and who have very

00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,280
high expectations

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,959
so if you would only compare yourself

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,360
with your competitors

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,000
you'll be the fastest snail in the race

00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,080
you still

00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,959
might not make it to the finish line you

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,720
might say well

00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,800
we're just a small company we're not

00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,239
facebook or amazon or spotify we can

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,400
never compete with that type of

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,040
companies but

00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,800
i think size doesn't matter just as we

00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,440
see some small organizations

00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,000
that are swiftly uh pivoting and finding

00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,160
opportunities even in times of crisis

00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,080
at dropsolid we believe that every

00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,720
organization with the right ambition and

00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,239
drive

00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,720
can make a difference with its digital

00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,599
customer experience digital is really an

00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,760
opportunity

00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,959
to be a disrupter in any industry

00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,959
regardless of your size

00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,280
to make it a bit more tangible um i will

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,760
be using today um

00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,720
sophia as a persona and her journey to

00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,360
find a gift for her mom

00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,080
so meet sophia she's 27 she's a

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,599
millennial

00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,840
living in an apartment in the city

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:15,680
center of ghent with her fiance

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:19,120
she's a teacher very creative um

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,920
and she's preparing also for her wedding

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,840
now um today sophia is looking for an

00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,959
original gift to surprise her mom at

00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,400
mother's day so

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,640
she's scrolling through her instagram

00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,080
feed and she comes across um

00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,560
an ad from florista about mother's day

00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,799
gift

00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,000
so she clicks on it and she lands on the

00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,080
florista website

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,239
on the mother's day landing page where

00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,760
you have typically a top 10 gift ids

00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,120
gifts for different moms so a lot of

00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,680
content about mother's day

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,799
but on that page there's also a list of

00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,680
recent blocks

00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,159
of which one is um other label purple

00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,760
rain

00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,280
and this catches her eye since the

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,400
picture um

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,159
shows flowers that her mom really

00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,360
likes so she clicks on the block and

00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:03,200
continues on to the page

00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,959
this is a regular block about flower

00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,400
pieces but sophia

00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,239
gets to see some specific

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,360
personalization about mother's day

00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,760
because she came in

00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,040
via the mother's day ad and we know that

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,720
she cares about that

00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,320
so that convinces her to download the

00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,680
tutorial at the bottom of

00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,560
the blog so she gets

00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,880
a nice email with the download button to

00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,800
um

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,800
to download the tutorial but at that

00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,960
moment a friend calls her about her

00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,320
wedding and yeah she forgets all about

00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,560
the email so yes

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,080
she did a small conversion at first by

00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,400
downloading the tutorial

00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,520
but she did not yet reach the actual

00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,840
goal of ordering

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,960
that gift and with many other things in

00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,880
our minds yeah

00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,120
now we kind of lost her however

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,199
three days later she gets another email

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,240
with more tips to celebrate your mom so

00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,880
we can bring her back

00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,320
and she orders in the end that flower

00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,720
piece

00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,440
and when she now returns to the first

00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,160
website

00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,440
it's personalized with workshops because

00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,039
given her behavior

00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,120
she um she is now uh seen as an

00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,560
explorer on her on her website she's

00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,080
shown interest in creative

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,759
do-it-yourself things

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,800
she looked at workshops she looked at

00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:18,080
tutorials so from that behavior

00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,600
we can extract that she's not really an

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,880
online shopper but she's really

00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,840
exploring um

00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,400
different different things on the

00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,720
website

00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,080
so based with that information we can

00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,479
personalize the homepage

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:33,600
not only for mother's day but for other

00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,360
um for other segments as well

00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,800
and from now on she gets the regular

00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,840
newsletter which is again

00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,960
personalized with workshops um because

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,960
she's an explorer

00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,400
and there's also an item about bridals

00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,400
um

00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,000
by accident in the next in the next

00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,360
newsletter that's just a normal uh

00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,440
campaign that we're doing

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,120
but then yeah she's getting married so

00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,520
she clicks on it and from that moment

00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,479
she's

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,080
also added to the bridal segments so

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,160
with these regular newsletters we can

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,000
stay top of mind at relevant times and

00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,880
bring sophia back to our website by

00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,360
combining

00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,000
personalized messaging and seasonal

00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,600
promotions

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,120
and actions and remember sophia remains

00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,000
the same person over time

00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,759
but her intent changes at first she was

00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,759
looking for a gift for her mom

00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,000
but she's not only a daughter she's also

00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,840
a fiance preparing for

00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,880
for a wedding and she's also a creative

00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,800
teacher so her context is different upon

00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,919
each visit her intent can be different

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,400
upon each visit

00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:32,400
so personalization should be smart to

00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,960
cope with that ever-changing context and

00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,440
not

00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:41,919
keep you in the same segments um forever

00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:45,280
oops um so when you try to build these

00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,720
journeys it can be quite challenging um

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,360
when we're talking to our clients

00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,199
they're often facing the same challenges

00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,120
the first challenge being a lack of

00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,120
insight who is online

00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,960
if you don't know that how on earth can

00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,280
you deliver a personal experience

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,479
a second challenge is about data data

00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,319
not being available

00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,919
where you need it you have disparate

00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,599
systems you have different and

00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,840
constrained data models

00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:11,680
and complex integration product projects

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,360
it's it's like this little guy

00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,440
sometimes you have a lot of data

00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,000
available but you can't reach it

00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,360
it's not actionable or usable where and

00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,720
how you would like to use it

00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,639
and that can be very frustrating

00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,800
and the third challenge is about

00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,000
continuously adding new technology to

00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,360
your existing text

00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,840
text tag it takes time it takes budget

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,120
it's a change and it's often hard to

00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,599
figure out up front

00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,639
how well and how easy that new

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,319
technology will fit

00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,960
in your existing stack in terms of

00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,800
integration compatibility ease of use

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,160
so the more you can rely on your

00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:51,280
existing tech stack

00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,280
the easier it gets to move forward

00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,120
now for all those challenges i will be

00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,199
coming up with some opportunities over

00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,280
the next slides

00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,319
but now i would like to think a bit

00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,560
about how

00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,440
marketing automation and personalization

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,440
can enhance

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:10,240
what you are doing today with drupal

00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,560
first of all do you know who is visiting

00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,720
your drupal websites

00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,960
not which campaigns are doing well not

00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,479
how many visitors you have over the past

00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,960
few months on average but

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,599
do you know who is visiting you right

00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,599
now

00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,080
who is online and what are they looking

00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,759
for who is reading your emails

00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,830
that's key to know when you want to

00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,000
personalize um

00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:32,800
[Music]

00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,240
your messaging and if you know who is

00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,440
engaging with your websites and your

00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,440
digital channels

00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,440
can you take action do you have the

00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,000
tools to offer a personal experience for

00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,919
each visitor

00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,039
so that he or she can find what they're

00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,480
looking for and

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,480
enjoy the time they spend with you

00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,320
both marketing automation and

00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,440
personalization

00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,120
can help you do a better job to create a

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,959
personal experience

00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,720
each in its own they give you more

00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,000
insights in your visitors

00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,240
and they can allow you to take

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,200
one-on-one actions on that but when you

00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,440
combine both

00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,560
tools that's when it gets really

00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,880
interesting

00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,920
the website personalization you can use

00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,399
that to make

00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,000
your website visits better you capture

00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,720
behavioral data on the website

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,720
and you can create segments on that when

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,240
you also provide that information to the

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,560
marketing automation

00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,080
solution you get really a consistent

00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,920
experience across web

00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,360
and also email and maybe other channels

00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,160
you're using there

00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,000
and marketing automation can be used to

00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,680
bring visitors back to your website

00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,240
remember in the case of sophia

00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,000
we kind of lost her along the way

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,920
because she had other things on her mind

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,200
with marketing automation we can bring

00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,200
her back and then with website

00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,399
personalization we can make the website

00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,880
experience better and

00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,519
hopefully increase engagement so it's

00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,880
really

00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,680
when you combine both that you have

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,680
the biggest win

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,920
drop solo experience cloud is built on

00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,440
top of drupal

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,279
so we're using drupal for content

00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,600
management and we're adding

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,399
personalization and marketing automation

00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,399
on top of that

00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,200
now how to get started what i would like

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,360
to show you today

00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,760
is how we are building a personalized

00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,399
home page for sophia so that she sees

00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,000
different content on our second visit

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,360
what i also would like to show you is

00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,240
that we're building a personalized

00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,000
newsletter

00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,480
with different subject line to increase

00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,839
open rates personalized introduction

00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,959
and different content for different

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,279
audiences

00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:38,880
and i would like to show you how we can

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,360
embed such forms in our drupal websites

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,839
and put some automation flows behind it

00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,160
and how easy that really can be

00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,240
now how i will be doing that today with

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,360
drop solid experience cloud which is

00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,760
actually based on

00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,360
open source technology being drupal for

00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,480
content management

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,399
mautic for marketing automation

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,160
and you know me is the underlying

00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,120
customer data platform which we are

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,160
using to build

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:06,560
the segments for personalization

00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,440
the advantage of using a platform like

00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,560
this

00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,360
is over any set of best-of-breed tools

00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,880
is that it's simple it's easy all your

00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,200
content is in one place

00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,120
your content personalization is in

00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,040
drupal you're not using separate tools

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,800
or a separate layer on top of it

00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,800
and also all your customer data is in

00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,079
one place in the customer data platform

00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,800
and you can reuse

00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,000
those segments in drupal and multi for

00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,959
personalization

00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,720
so it's easy it's open it's affordable

00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:36,160
and it's flexible to grow with you

00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,240
over time when you're adding new

00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,800
components

00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,440
to your experience now what is our

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,000
approach

00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,640
for building such journey first of all

00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,480
it's very

00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,720
important to get this insight in your

00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,880
visitors to know who is visiting you

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,240
and with that insight start building

00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,399
segments

00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,760
with the segments you can use them

00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,240
across different channels

00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,000
to do personalization and also very

00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,000
important is that you get insight

00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,839
in your campaign performance for these

00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,680
different segments so that you know what

00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,800
works and what doesn't work and you can

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,839
enhance

00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,839
and you can continuously make

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:15,519
improvements

00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,320
um so this is the the ui in drop solid

00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,600
platform that

00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,839
we've built on top of you know me and

00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,920
what you see here is um

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,560
a set of profiles that are visiting your

00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,880
website a profile being a single visitor

00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,040
a device or a cookie who we can track

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:31,839
across multiple sessions

00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,639
and also across multiple devices once we

00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,800
know him

00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,720
from his email address so these profiles

00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,959
keep getting richer and getting smarter

00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,160
with more data being added upon each

00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:43,920
page view or click that they're doing

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,600
we're also capturing events on each

00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,880
profile um and

00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,399
here the the cool thing is that it goes

00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,800
really really very deep we

00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,959
capture metadata on the pages we capture

00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,440
content that is being selected by his

00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,720
mouse

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,120
uh we captured a copy when that is being

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,440
clicked

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,279
on a button or even in text so the data

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,240
that we're capturing is really rich and

00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,399
very deep

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,360
and that makes it really interesting for

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,360
your segment building

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,720
with all that data the ai behind

00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,519
[Music]

00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,560
is suggesting segments of visitors with

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,399
similar behavior

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,240
engaging with similar content so for

00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,240
example on the drop solid website

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,399
we have visitors who engage with very

00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:28,720
technical content on drupal on technical

00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,880
terms dxp

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,800
but we also have visitors who engage

00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,760
more with marketing content

00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,720
topics about ux and seo reading customer

00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,680
cases

00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,360
so from the content they consume from

00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,320
the type of call to actions they click

00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,160
we can deduct

00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,760
what type of people are visiting us and

00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,519
we can use that information

00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:51,120
to personalize their experience

00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:53,279
and that is exactly what you're doing

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,600
here so you're using this data to build

00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,399
segments but you can also build segments

00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,320
by with simple rules like for example

00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:03,120
the mother's day campaign that we

00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,360
used for sophia we use the utm campaign

00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,720
parameter to build a segment so everyone

00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,120
who enters our website

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,040
from a specific campaign we put them in

00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,720
a segment and not only on the first page

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,360
we can personalize but their entire

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,440
visit

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,199
or even future visits we can still

00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,240
personalize because we know they came

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,839
from that campaign

00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,279
and they are a very specific target

00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,760
group that we targeted with that

00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,760
campaign

00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,000
and then it gets interesting so um once

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,480
you've built your segments and you've

00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,040
you've discovered who is visiting your

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,279
website

00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,399
you can use that in drupal so this is a

00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,480
screenshot

00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,399
from the drupal backend the new layout

00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,760
builder and

00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,079
when you click on any block or button in

00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,639
this

00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,720
case you can define uh in this case for

00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,959
the button uh yeah where it should go to

00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,839
um but you can also define here who

00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:54,079
should see it

00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,440
so in this case only people in the

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,680
explorer segment

00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,199
will see the workshops button and people

00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,519
in the online shopper segment

00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,959
might only also only see the button go

00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,480
to the shop

00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,560
so it's very simple to personalize any

00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,959
type of content any piece of content in

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,360
your drupal website

00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:15,120
and it's also easy to test um because

00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,519
it's sometimes hard to test

00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,480
that you are in all the different uh

00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,040
segments

00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,680
there is a nice browser plugin that we

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,839
have created

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,079
where you can act like being in a

00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,959
segment so you exactly see how the page

00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,800
looks like

00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,800
for people in such a segment

00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,440
magic also gives you a lot of

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,399
information about your visitors and also

00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,320
here

00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,519
you see the segments that you created in

00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,360
your dxp

00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,320
in your cdp so when you personalize your

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,240
emails

00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,240
you can also do the same thing you have

00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,079
a specific type of text

00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,680
and in this case you can build different

00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,519
variation for people

00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,399
in the different segments so you can

00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,240
reuse those segments across your drupal

00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,839
and your emails so that you can bring a

00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,480
consistent message across all the

00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:05,440
different channels

00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,839
in motik you can go very far with

00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,680
building

00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,399
such journeys so you can also do really

00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,839
complex

00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:17,759
personalization examples with campaigns

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,880
um also also form building is really

00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,120
intuitive in matic

00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:23,759
there is a very handy ui that you can

00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,680
build forms add fields add validation

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,800
without any line of code so it's really

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,839
user friendly

00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,320
and adding such a form in drupal is also

00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,920
easy

00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,519
so there is a content block marketing

00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:39,199
automation form that you can add

00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:41,519
and where you can uh very simply select

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,959
one of the forms you just created emotic

00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,560
and embed it in your form

00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,959
editing the form in mautic will

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:50,240
immediately um

00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:52,880
give you um yeah the changes are on live

00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,680
so no coding needed to create your own

00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,680
forms

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,800
use them in your drupal website and do

00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,959
follow up

00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,959
with uh emails and uh and campaigns

00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,079
there there is the form and the last

00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,160
thing um

00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:10,079
i would like to touch is the last part

00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,360
of the of the creation journey it's the

00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,480
campaign performance

00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,160
so when you're doing these

00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,120
personalization campaigns across your

00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,919
different channels

00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,640
you also want to measure whether it

00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:20,400
works what's

00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,000
really the value that you get out of it

00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,559
and by using um

00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,839
the cdp segments as custom dimensions in

00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:28,160
google analytics

00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,919
you can track very easily how your

00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,520
personalization campaigns are doing in

00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,160
google analytics because for each

00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,000
segment

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,160
you can see the conversion rates the

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,240
session duration the pages per session

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,200
and all kinds of metrics and you can see

00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,400
how they

00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:47,120
evaluate when you do specific campaigns

00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:50,480
to those segments

00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,240
so as a conclusion for today um

00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,840
i want to make that building those

00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,799
frictionless customer journeys

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,679
it's important it's challenging it's not

00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,280
easy it takes

00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,440
it takes a lot of work but it is

00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,559
possible by using open source marketing

00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,240
technology

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,559
it's accessible and it's possible

00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,960
regardless of how big your organization

00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,000
is

00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,559
or how much budget you have

00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,840
and working with open partnerships can

00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,840
help you to be more successful

00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,559
so we're a bit short in time here um

00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,640
this is

00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,160
