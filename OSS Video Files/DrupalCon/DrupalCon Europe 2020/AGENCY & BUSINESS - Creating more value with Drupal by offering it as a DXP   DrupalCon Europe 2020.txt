00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,240
all right

00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,960
hello everyone this is dominique from

00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,840
belgium

00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,439
from drop solid and welcome to this

00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,480
session

00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:29,279
how we can create more value with drupal

00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:32,320
by offering it as a dxp rather than as a

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,960
cms and we'll look at the

00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,840
implications for for agencies and and

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,040
also customers

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,879
so quickly about myself

00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,239
started out as a software engineer

00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,280
founded drop solid in

00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,320
in 2013 and then had do a lot of

00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,520
learning about

00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,920
digital marketing so i really got an

00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,480
inter

00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,440
interested in in digital experiences in

00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,559
technology

00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,719
and business strategy behind it

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,120
so in this cms we'll see that actually

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,680
drupal is not enough anymore

00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,439
to just offer it as just a cms

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,080
because the customers want to know their

00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,840
customers and we'll also see the the

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,439
huge benefit you can have

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:20,159
from from offering it as a dxp

00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,439
but first let's look at where we are

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,159
coming from

00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,040
if you look at the digital roadmap most

00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:30,320
companies organizations go through

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,799
uh when going digital they they probably

00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,960
start

00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,840
out with a simple website offering their

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,479
products and

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,960
and services and then they start moving

00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,880
all the way to the right where uh the

00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,119
the holy grail is the one-on-one

00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,520
customer experience so where everyone

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,840
has his personalized experience and

00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,640
finds directly what he's looking for

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,240
at that company in that context but in

00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,600
between there's uh there's a couple of

00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,640
steps

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,040
um like most companies start building

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,119
the

00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,799
their organic search they start to

00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,600
segment build their segments on the

00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,040
website

00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,920
starting to offer solutions for these

00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,440
for these customers building journeys

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:13,120
then we will see that uh

00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,959
they're expanding to more and more

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,879
channels um

00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,200
starting to use rule-based

00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,720
personalization start to use marketing

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,560
automation

00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,959
driving the customers through these

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,000
through these funnels so

00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,040
here you can clearly see that um

00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,480
just using drupal uh for this it's

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,800
it's lacking capabilities

00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,920
now what we want to achieve is that we

00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,959
want to have this

00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,239
this customer and we want to give him uh

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,480
what he wants through

00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:50,319
any channel in any context um

00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,400
so let us see what is that what is that

00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,519
dx speed and what's what's so different

00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,680
about it

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,840
um so most people think it's just a new

00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,200
branding for selling websites

00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,640
but actually um it's like a bigger

00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,319
change as moving from

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:12,879
html css driven websites to cms

00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:15,280
the jump from cms to dxp is is as big

00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,239
and if we look at the difference and the

00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,120
difference is

00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,920
is is that the focus is on the is on the

00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,440
experience

00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,720
and we'll see knowing the customer

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,440
is very crucial to build the experience

00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,920
um we'll be talking about

00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,959
personalization

00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,000
omni-channel analytics

00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,280
and we'll also see that we can we can

00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,159
decrease a lot of

00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:46,080
costs by using all these these extra

00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:49,360
capabilities so

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,480
the dxp if you look at the management

00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,720
system of the

00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,599
the management part of the dxp we will

00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,159
see that that

00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,720
you can immediately recognize a big part

00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,599
of

00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,080
of drupal in there as content management

00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,720
account

00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,840
systems the user systems the permission

00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,640
system

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,040
security administration access control

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,799
collaboration knowledge management

00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,120
and then on the experience side there

00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,680
are some capabilities that that drupal

00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,720
does not have out of the box

00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,320
like it does not allow you to

00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,280
have analytics out of the box or

00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,840
personalization

00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,440
it can integrate with all sorts of tools

00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,759
but it's not

00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:34,800
integrated into a into drupal

00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,680
you have to use proprietary systems to

00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,560
to achieve this and on the other side we

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,759
have things like

00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,880
ai of course there's things that that

00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,680
are possible with

00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,400
uh with drupal um you can run it in the

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,520
clouds

00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,400
with uh services like la kakuya and and

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:55,280
pantheon and and drop solid

00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,680
um it does have the in integration and

00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,600
interoperability

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,199
but it clearly lacks if you look at

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,400
total

00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,600
the ai the analytics the personalization

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:12,240
like all the data related components

00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,240
um it doesn't have that out of the box

00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,880
so knowing this we would say like okay

00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,440
but why

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,000
why would you consider selling or buying

00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,400
a

00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,960
an experience why why would you why

00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:28,720
would you be interested in this

00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:30,639
well if we look at some research around

00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,160
this around customer experience

00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,320
we can see that projects

00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,000
that have an impact on customer

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,120
experience whether it's digital

00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,479
or not like abroad research

00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:47,919
uh suggests that 93 of this

00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,560
has an roi and how are we measuring this

00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,199
like how we're having happier customers

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,639
increase

00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,720
revenue more customer lifetime value

00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,080
but we also see things like reducing

00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,400
cost of service

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,560
uh why is that yeah where you get less

00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,319
telephones you get less emails

00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,080
people are finding what they are needed

00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,199
because the experience is

00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,319
personalized we even see an increased

00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,720
value

00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,759
of the brand because you are perceived

00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,520
as

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,520
an organization that knows its customers

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,440
and then a more macro economic one and

00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,960
i'm really curious to see an update

00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,560
after 2020 how

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,400
how that is has played out uh this year

00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,120
but if you would have invested a hundred

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,240
dollars in a stock fund

00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,360
like like say the smp 500 which is

00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,240
tracking like the general market uh you

00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,759
would have have an

00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,680
150 dollars

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,240
after 16 years but if you would have

00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,240
invested in a stock fund of companies

00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,759
who are heavily investing in customer

00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,080
experience

00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,080
you would have have five times as as

00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,560
much

00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,120
and and i said i'm really curious to see

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,240
this one

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,120
evolve for 2020.

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,000
so this is what we called return on

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,639
experience

00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,919
and return on experience i found some

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,160
other research from

00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:12,080
competing platforms proprietary

00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,800
platforms where drupal has to compete

00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,360
with

00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,440
in the market and which have been

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,639
offering these capabilities for

00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,199
some years already and what we see is

00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,880
uh with these personalization engines

00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,520
that we have more views

00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,000
more time on site we see decreased

00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,720
bounce rates we see higher open rates of

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,360
emails we see higher self-service use

00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,720
usage

00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:38,720
like a hundred two hundred percent uh we

00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,599
see better service

00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,880
so we see some uh some real real impact

00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,039
here uh that is

00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,599
that's having a big impact on the

00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:51,599
business of customers

00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:54,879
um and then obviously an e-commerce has

00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:58,240
higher order values increased revenue

00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,879
less cards abandoned

00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,720
and all these all these things translate

00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,840
in

00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,960
in real real turnover and real

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,160
costa decreases so

00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:15,199
customers are definitely into to hear

00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:18,479
this story and we think that drupal

00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,520
drupal can stay stay behind here

00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:24,720
so drupal has a dxp how

00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,599
how could that work um maybe to to give

00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,919
us a little bit of

00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,039
inspiration i have a i have a little

00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,360
video

00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,039
that uh that explains a little bit the

00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,440
the principle behind

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,440
um

00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,039
how a dxp creates a personalized

00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,200
experience and then we'll go a little

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,560
bit more in detail on how that works

00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,760
in in drupal and other systems that

00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,680
connect with drupal

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,440
so let's watch the drop solid experience

00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,000
cloud enables you to optimize the

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,839
customer

00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
experience resulting in higher

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,360
conversion rates and better customer

00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,080
satisfaction

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,920
let's have a look at how this works we

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,640
have our anonymous surfer

00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,080
searching in google for flowerpeace

00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,640
there we go

00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,080
well look at that the first result she

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,240
gets is florista

00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:16,640
a website with a fully integrated drop

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,600
solid experience cloud

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,640
our still anonymous visitor is browsing

00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,160
the home page

00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,320
she's scanning through the themes of the

00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,880
new collection looking at the featured

00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,040
products

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,160
and taking a closer look at the upcoming

00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,839
workshops

00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,279
while she's doing all that the

00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,920
personalization ai

00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,560
is using his magic by using machine

00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,880
learning

00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,200
the ai identifies different segments of

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,640
visitors and tries to fit our visitor in

00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,560
one of those segments

00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,920
on the florista website there are three

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,399
specific segments

00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,959
there's the b2b prospect the online

00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,120
shopper

00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,120
and the explorer he or she is now

00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,760
looking at the latest inspiration from

00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,519
the blog

00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,120
and is showing an interest in the first

00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,880
article

00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,959
there's a great step-by-step guide on

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,760
how to make your own flower arrangements

00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,640
and there we go the ai has identified

00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:07,360
this visitor

00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,360
as an explorer that's how long it takes

00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,160
our explorer gets to the end of the blog

00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,440
article and fills in a form to receive a

00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,560
free download

00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,160
great now our explorer has a name and we

00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,959
even have her mailing address

00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,399
and consent to start sending newsletters

00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,880
our anonymous visitor

00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,399
isn't that anonymous anymore let's have

00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:28,560
a look at what information we've

00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,079
received

00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,240
so her name is sophia sophia mertens her

00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:37,360
email address is sophia.mertens

00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,600
gmail.com and we know that she's an

00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,279
explorer we even know what she looks

00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,560
like from the picture connected to her

00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,560
google account

00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:46,399
the log shows when she first visited the

00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,320
website and what actions she has

00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:51,360
performed

00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,240
and now the fun part let's put that

00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,399
information

00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,000
to good use the next time sophia visits

00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,320
the flurries the website

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,680
the homepage looks slightly different we

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,240
know she's an explorer

00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,480
not an online shopper or business so the

00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,640
content has changed to reflect that

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,640
the subscription form for the workshops

00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,880
has been put at the top of the page

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,120
just the way sophia likes it as an

00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,240
explorer she's eager to learn and get

00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:18,560
creative herself

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,519
she's not looking to buy a flower piece

00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,440
not at this point at least

00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,360
how great would it be if sophia also

00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,560
received newsletters tailored to her

00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,040
needs

00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,360
oh there's a new email let's see what's

00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,360
in it

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,519
wow workshops tutorials diy packages

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:42,560
exactly what she was looking for now

00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:44,560
that's a great user experience

00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,560
all right so now we all have an idea

00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,560
what a great experience look like

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,680
let's break it down a little bit so we

00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:53,200
got sophia

00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:55,040
this is our persona uh she converted

00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,519
from an instagram channel

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,839
she got activated on the website because

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,720
she wanted to get inspired

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,399
we get we get this conversion then she

00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,440
gets the first email

00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,760
to download we nurture uh

00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,360
we nurture her with uh with relevant

00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,200
content

00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,920
and then when she gets back to to the

00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,839
website and the website reflects what we

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,839
already know about her

00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,440
and if you are sending her emails you

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,760
also take into account

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,440
uh what we already know about her so

00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:27,920
this is just

00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,480
checking out the behavior a customer has

00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,079
and and

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:35,600
start using it in in the cms

00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:40,880
so how is it made um well it's made with

00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:43,200
drupal obviously drupal extended with

00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,959
matic which is a open source marketing

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,000
automation platform

00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:51,040
which allows us to to build this uh

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,399
it's using forms for automation so

00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,680
drupal module

00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,000
called the maltic forms and as you know

00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,839
me

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,399
is the last component it's a customer

00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,639
data platform also open source customer

00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:07,360
data platform is the engine

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:09,839
that allows us to create the segments

00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,760
and send these segments to drupal and

00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,760
matic

00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,399
so if you want to build such an

00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,240
experience what we do is we try to get

00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,839
insight in our visitors

00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,079
now we're going to build these segments

00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:23,839
so here in our example we had the b2b

00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,959
shopper we had the explorer which was

00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:30,240
sofia and we have the online shopper

00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:33,440
and once we have these uh these segments

00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,880
um these tools can

00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,360
can can recognize uh in what segment

00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,839
uh a customer is falling and then you

00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,360
can personalize the content across

00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:48,560
the channels so oh and this is also

00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:50,480
all with first party cookies so you get

00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,959
the cookie consent and then you can

00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,880
start

00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:57,440
tracking these customers

00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,800
now if you look at this then while

00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:02,320
getting in these

00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,639
these profiles so we'll be

00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,399
we'll be using uh this tool to to

00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,480
segment them we'll also be seeing

00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,560
uh all the events that are coming in

00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,639
everything they'll be clicking on

00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,240
and then the the machine learning is

00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,360
able to divide

00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,000
all that content all that captured

00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,639
behavior data it will be able to segment

00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,440
this

00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,000
using a clustering algorithm into

00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,040
different

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,240
groups um and then

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,199
yeah we have we have these segments and

00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,760
these segments

00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:38,160
are usable in uh in drupal then

00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,760
also you can also extend this manually

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,839
for example if you have a

00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:44,160
campaign for mother's day you can also

00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,480
classify

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,279
these segments and make combinations of

00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,320
segments

00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,959
so you can do all sorts of things in in

00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,279
drupal and in matic with this

00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,240
so in drupal if you would be using the

00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,720
the layout builder for example uh

00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,800
it's possible to just say okay if you

00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,560
drag a block on top of it like for the

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,399
workshops you only show it

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:11,920
for the the explorers

00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,240
and yeah then using uh using a little

00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:16,639
browser extension you can you can

00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,320
test these pages how they look for the

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,519
different uh

00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,120
different segments

00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,440
same thing in matic so what you're

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,560
looking at now is

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,959
someone in matic and you will see

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,160
in the profile there's the integration

00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,240
you can do with the

00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,320
explore which gives you the segment

00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:41,120
which allows you to build

00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:44,160
a personalized personalized email

00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,959
which you drag and drop the blocks in

00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,320
the matic

00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:50,800
email builder and you can select

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,399
for which segment you will be building

00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,759
this email

00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:59,279
and this way you can build your uh

00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,759
your your campaigns uh if you want to

00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,120
build

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:06,160
forms where you want to go uh

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,279
into into detail where you uh where you

00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,720
can send

00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:13,040
different different mail chains

00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,839
all you just use the segments and you

00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,519
build your

00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,639
your trees with this and then you just

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,079
drag and drop it

00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:25,920
in in your drupal site

00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:27,680
and it's on the website

00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,440
and then finally there's there's the

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,560
integration with uh with google

00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,160
analytics

00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,040
where you can see that google analytics

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,360
receiving

00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,360
what we call a custom dimension so it's

00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,880
segmenting the data that's already in

00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,120
google analytics

00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,240
and this way you can track all your

00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,480
sessions

00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,720
for all the segments that have been

00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:51,759
built so here you can then see the

00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:55,360
call conversion rate for each segment

00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:57,120
the time on site the pages per session

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,480
and this you can track in time and see

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,959
if you have been

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,839
personalizing your emails and and your

00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:05,760
website

00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:10,400
well is it having any effect on my

00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:12,319
conversion rates now

00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,600
the implications for agencies if you

00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,600
look at this

00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,640
i think it's it's it's pretty big

00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,799
because

00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,480
if you're in an agency and you're

00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:24,079
already selling drupal why not

00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:26,400
sell them an experience

00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,880
you'll get to do more strategy you'll

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,600
get to do far more ux and design because

00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,520
you have to design all these journeys

00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,720
there's also more integration work for

00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:40,240
you so you'll be integrating drupal with

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,880
these platforms and of course there's a

00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,559
there's room to do optimizations once

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,480
you measure you can work with the

00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:50,400
customer and

00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:52,160
go go go go from there so um

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,760
doing that you'll be you'll be a

00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,919
strategic partner

00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,840
and helping customers to to get a

00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,840
competitive advantage

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,120
i think it's definitely definitely

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,400
needed because

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,440
if you look at it like five years ago we

00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,720
at solid we also started out as a drupal

00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,200
shop

00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,320
and being good at drupal was was just

00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,960
just enough but

00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:17,520
right now like all the customers we have

00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,200
now are asking for all these things

00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:24,559
um that's uh that's that's why we

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:27,840
we also do them now um because

00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:30,400
i think if you if you don't

00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,520
you will be facing a lot of competition

00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,080
that is just

00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,039
just offering development cms

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,559
development

00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,360
and it will be really hard to

00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,880
differentiate yourself

00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,880
if you look at the customers i think

00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,080
it's pretty obviously is if you go for

00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,799
an experience

00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,840
and and and also work with content and

00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,600
data

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,160
then yeah you will have more time on

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,200
site more page views

00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,799
higher customer lifetime value

00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,559
all these things you'll have happier

00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,280
customers so

00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,039
definitely worth it and if you look at

00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,720
the implications for developers and

00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,559
marketers here we can see that

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,840
developers and marketers have

00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,000
definitely will be working closer

00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,320
together

00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,640
also developers will will have to focus

00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:17,039
on building experiences

00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,720
and marketers and content managers now

00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,080
will have more control they also have

00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,799
the data component

00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:26,400
to uh to build their experiences to

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:30,480
build their journeys for their customers

00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,799
so how do we how do you become a part of

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,360
this

00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,200
a lot of a lot of these efforts are

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,760
being open sourced

00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,039
so there's the the installer for drupal

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,039
there's the connector with

00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,720
apache you know me there's the mautic

00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,880
so the conclusion of this session

00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,480
cms is not enough anymore the customers

00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,919

00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:35,120
and yeah we believe that if you can

00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,360
move drupal from a cms to a dxp

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:41,360
and it can be done in an open source

00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:43,120
style it's truly open source

00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,600
you can deliver a great return on

00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:48,960
experience

00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,600
