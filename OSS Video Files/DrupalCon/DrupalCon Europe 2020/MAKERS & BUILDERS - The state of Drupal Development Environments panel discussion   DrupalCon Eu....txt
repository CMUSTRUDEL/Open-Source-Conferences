Publication date: 2021-01-13
Playlist: DrupalCon Europe 2020
Description: 
	Last year in Amsterdam we confirmed that everyone had their own favorite Drupal Development Tool. Is the same happening this year? Are we on the way to standardizing on top of something more uniform? https://drupal.kuoni-congress.info/2019/program/abstract/321

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,320
we're live

00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:19,359
hello everybody welcome uh to this panel

00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,240
session about

00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,480
uh local blue development environments

00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,760
in

00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,320
drupal so this is a continuation last

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,760
year

00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,720
in amsterdam we confirmed that everyone

00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,200
can

00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,559
add their own favorite drupal

00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,120
development tool

00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,920
is this this the same happening this

00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,160
year that's

00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,840
a question are we on the way of

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:47,920
standardizing on top of something more

00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:50,800
uniform at triplecon global

00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,079
the discussion went to another level and

00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,120
some numbers were

00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,120
actually revealed

00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,160
this time we will we will have uh

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:05,519

and then i have aurelia navarre

00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,520

part where you can actually put your

00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,680
questions like i see there

00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:18,560
there's some uh questions already there

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,520
let me see it's refreshing uh we will

00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,760

for these questions so go ahead and put

00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,239
your questions meanwhile

00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,200
while this is starting and the panel

00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,319
will start with a couple of minutes per

00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,360
panelist

00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,640
to actually present their own their own

00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,840
thing

00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:41,440
so i start uh with katherine

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,480
hello catherine uh hello ricardo you are

00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,120
you are here uh representing the user so

00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,920
go ahead

00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,560
uh tell us things sure i will tell you

00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,120
things

00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,480
uh i'm katherine i actually don't

00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,680
contribute to any of the projects we're

00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,760
talking about today but

00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,800
i'm here to give you my perspective as a

00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,959
user who has tried a lot of environments

00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,239
and usually just use a homegrown diy

00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,319
native environment

00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,959
um i've also done a few different types

00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,599
of work and i find that my needs change

00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,599
depending on

00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,280
what i'm working on i've built and

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,480
maintained production sites some larger

00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,400
scale than others i've worked on

00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,720
software products i've done some drupal

00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,519
core

00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,200
and contrib module contributions and i

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,480
think the needs are a bit different

00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,720
for each um so what do i use uh i

00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,519
actually used map for many years uh

00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,319
while on a mac

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,000
until i found it too limiting uh i was

00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,440
frustrated with its performance i found

00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,239
its configuration to be a bit of a

00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,440
hurdle

00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,920
um so now i've been using a local diy

00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,959
amp stack for a while now and it works

00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,680
very well for me

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,120
um i always used a native lan lamp

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,000
environment on linux machines when i was

00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,319
using them

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,519
but i i confess i would mostly use facts

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,319
over the years

00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,760
um i've also recently been working with

00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,840
aqueous cloud ide

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,360
which um i really will talk to you a

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,680
little bit more about

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,480
i use it every day now alongside my

00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,159
local setup

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,760
it's great for unifying a team

00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,439
experience i've also been playing with

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,560
lando for the past year but i don't use

00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,319
it regularly

00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,840
uh though i plan to change that i expect

00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,599
that if you ask me in six months i'll

00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,920
tell you i use a combination of window

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,159
and

00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,599
cloud ide maybe i've gotten tired of the

00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,519
craft i don't know

00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,320
um my background is that i ran all the

00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,160
jubilee

00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,079
stuff at linux journal for 12 years and

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,919
for that reason i always wore a few hats

00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,759
one being technical the other being

00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,040
slightly journalistic and generally a

00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,720
diy er

00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,479
in the spirit of the sort of work we did

00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,440
covering open source generally so for

00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,040
that reason

00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,960
i've done a lot of experimenting i've

00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,240
played with most of the projects i think

00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,000
we're talking about today

00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,080
but ultimately settled on what was most

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,680
comfortable and easiest for me

00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,120
uh though they all absolutely have

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,240
strengths um

00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,240
i think we're creatures of habit though

00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,919
and and it can be tough to make a major

00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,720
change to our workflow without

00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,919
oppressing need um i know a lot of

00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,320
people who would never

00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,400
dream of using a native diy install like

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,680
i do and only use vms or containers and

00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,960
i know a lot of people who do excellent

00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,960
work with a homegrown

00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,320
a setup like mine or with mamp for that

00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,160
matter so

00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,759
great awesome thanks for the

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,280
introduction so

00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,720
next um uh i'll pass the word to our

00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,759
alien and you have like

00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,560
two three whatever minutes you like

00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,520
uh just keep it short to actually

00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,919
introduce your

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,560
your own uh your own cloud ide from

00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,560
acquia

00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,639
go ahead yeah thanks ricardo hello

00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,560
everyone my name is willian navarro

00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,919
i'm a product manager at aqua and i'd

00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,120
like to talk to you about a

00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,960
slightly different approach to

00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,639
developing drupal

00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,320
we all know about the constant struggles

00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,800
when it comes to setting up and

00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,400
maintaining local dev environments

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,520
if you're on windows pretty much

00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,199
everything is hard you know in

00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,880
particular working with docker volumes

00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,800
and networking

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,720
if you're in a company where the it

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,560
policy is essentially blocking you from

00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,199
installing any software at all

00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,240
or creating firewall exceptions then

00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,479
things become

00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,240
complicated very quickly and if you're

00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,080
part of those developers willing to get

00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,120
their hands dirty and doing devops all

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,720
the time

00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,759
then it's i think when we need to step

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,280
back because as drupal developers

00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,440
at the end of the day what we care about

00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,199
is to ship new features on time not to

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,639
struggle with our dev environment

00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,120
and this is the main reason why we've

00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,199
created acquia cloud ide

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,759
in a nutshell it's the only web-based

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,400
ide for drupal development

00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,440
it is a fully optimized lamp stack with

00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,880
all the drupal tooling you can think of

00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,479
which comes pre-configured out of the

00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,080
box so you can start developing drupal

00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,720
right away

00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,639
for example xdebug just works you know

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,319
php cut sniffer runs automatically with

00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,759
the drupal snips you need

00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,600
and you can run your drupal functional

00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,199
js tests easily because we've installed

00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,680
and pre-configured the chrome driver for

00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,880
you

00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,960
so you don't have to um really it's just

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,120
a dev environment that is made by

00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,039
drupalists for drupalists

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,400
and it's not only that you know um cloud

00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,639
id is fully um

00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,440
disposable scalable and reproducible so

00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,120
you

00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,960
no longer run into any kind of

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,120
environment disparity at all

00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,880
uh so when you think about it more than

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,479
a decade ago we were all talking about

00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,319
moving our assets to the cloud

00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,240
because we couldn't get bothered with

00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,639
maintaining our servers anymore

00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,759
it's 2020 now and we think it's time for

00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,880
you to consider making the same

00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,039
transition

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,199
it's still your lamp stack and ide but

00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,240
now it's in the cloud

00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,440
okay uh thanks for that that was a

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,560
really

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,919
um good presentation

00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:30,400
uh okay so next um i have uh

00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,120
jeff gerling uh everybody knows jeff

00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,880
gerwin

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,360
go ahead drupal van how are we

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,120
yeah oh and let me mute myself so i

00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,720
don't get an echo on there but

00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,639
um i uh i started working on drupal vm a

00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,479
long long time ago this was before

00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:49,199
docker was even a glint in the eyes of

00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,000
all of us

00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,199
who developed locally or in the cloud

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,759
and

00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,960
i still maintain it i would say that

00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,440
nowadays

00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,000
it's more of a side project i don't

00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,000
actually

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,440
actively use it on a project that i'm

00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,840
working on right now

00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,520
but i do uh still use it for a couple

00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,560
other projects and for some other local

00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:12,000
development but

00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,440
it's kind of like the the i guess you

00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,919
could call it the premiere

00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,280
vagrant and virtualbox-based development

00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,560
environment for drupal

00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,160
because it can do so many different

00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,039
things as you can see on the screen

00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,160
there but

00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:27,120
um i i currently use docker mostly

00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,199
for local development and i deploy into

00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,440
so many different environments that

00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,039
um i gave up on the idea of having my

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,640
local environment exactly match

00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,080
production for everything

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,680
a couple years ago but um but i i get to

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,399
use a lot of these different tools and

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,839
so i've

00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,919
one of the things i've been doing the

00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,720
past few years with chris urban

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,839
who's not on this call uh is try to send

00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,720
out the survey

00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,720
drupal developers to try to see where

00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,839
things are and how things are going for

00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,839
local development

00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,360
um actually we'll we'll see some numbers

00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,120
uh

00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,360
there uh i guess we are probably going

00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,240
to have more surveys uh next year but

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,560
for this year

00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,600
we will have some numbers next on the

00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,000
slide

00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,160
so next is matthias matthias why you

00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,040
why don't you tell us a little bit about

00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,080
drop solid

00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,120
launchpad hello my name is matthias as a

00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,040
requirement

00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,160
i'm the best from architects at drop

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,680
solids and

00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:31,120
we built a tool uh ourselves

00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,920
as in three years ago we tried to solve

00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,720
some issues with

00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,600
our local development stacks from in the

00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,560
company

00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,240
so uh yeah what what is launch but

00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,800
actually it's a docker-based

00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,720
uh local environment so there are no

00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,800
other dependencies it's completely

00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,920
integrated in the dropship platform

00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,399
ecosystem

00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,000
um it's a very it's a very optimum a

00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,600
very uh optimized

00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
docker stack so all the containers are

00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,320
really optimized for speed and for size

00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,760
um you can fully customize it so yes

00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,279
it's just you use the same docker

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:04,640
principles and also

00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:06,240
uh the you can override it based on your

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,920
local setup on the setup for your team

00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,120
on the setup for your os because it's

00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,839
also os optimized

00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,600
it solves some of some of the issues

00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,959
that you encounter on mac os for

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,800
file systems files syncing or the i o

00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,399
button access tries to solve that

00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,320
uh it doesn't solve it completely but it

00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,000
tries to and also it's uh

00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,160
very optimized for debugging and

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,880
profiling so all of all our developers

00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,959
struggle to do that

00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:33,600
to get your php phpstorm and nick debug

00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:36,880
working both on cli it's also for

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,000
the debugging or profiling rush which

00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:43,360
hroff so yeah it's actually an

00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
and very tailored on for the developers

00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,160
in-house

00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,279
so it started as a bad project because

00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,880
for my own

00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:51,200
sanity i had to have something better

00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,640
than uh recreating my own stack and

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,959
solving issues for other developers

00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,279
breaking their stack after

00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,959
they updated some local tooling so yeah

00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:00,959
it's it started

00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,720
out of frustration and uh you know it's

00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:05,360
a full stack of use in house it's

00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,240
a lot of compar feature compatible with

00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,959
uh

00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,519
with data i have more it comes close to

00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,320
data

00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:14,640
we started almost at the same time but

00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,640
when the

00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:28,720
thanks for that uh next uh we have oh

00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,120
lando mike pirro why don't you tell us

00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,000
about

00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,360
lando and uh you know like what's what's

00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,360
on and with the plans on

00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:40,399
on this uh awesome uh tool

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,320
yeah sure thank you ricardo uh thank you

00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,079
to everyone for coming to drupalcon

00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,839
i hope everyone is staying safe in these

00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,320
dark times

00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,079
um my name is mike fiora i'm one of the

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,560
maintainers for orlando

00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,000
lando is a development environment that

00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,800
is also

00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,519
based in docker um and it's its key

00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,480
design

00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:01,839
goal is you have a configuration file

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,279
that you check into your

00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,399
git repository and that file should

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,240
contain

00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,320
basically all the dependencies you need

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,440
to like develop your site test your site

00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,360
deploy your site

00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,959
and you should be able to clone a

00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,360
repository down

00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,000
run lando start and when lando start is

00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,360
done

00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,079
you should have all the things that you

00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,680
need to develop your projects

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,760
that means infrastructure that means

00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,800
tooling that could be connections to

00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:33,040
remote sources uh so like pantheon

00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:36,800
or platform.sh or or or anything really

00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,600
um and uh that should be true regather

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,160
you're on

00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,600
mac or windows or linux or whether

00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,040
you're doing a triple project or a

00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,920
wordpress project or a

00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,000
net project um one of the nice things

00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,560
about lando it's it's free and open

00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,760
source

00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,839
and we're independent uh so we're not

00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,519
attached to any given hosting provider i

00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,040
think that's allowed us to do some

00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,720
interesting things

00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,720
that other that others might not be able

00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,800
to do

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,320
and i think that's one of the big maybe

00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,639
differentiating factors

00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,839
uh for orlando compared to other things

00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,279
that are similar

00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:13,519
is um you know we've got uh we've got

00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,720
close partnerships with platform.net

00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,639
and pantheon and uh amazing we're doing

00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,959
the product and we're

00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,240
currently talking with talking with aqua

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,079
and i think we're going to do an aqua

00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:26,639
integration as well as

00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,920
one for sorry heresy wordpress vip

00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,720
probably super relevant for this

00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,839
audience but

00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,040
possibly relevant um i think that's very

00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,240
exciting one of the very nice things

00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,440
about lando is having these deep

00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,639
integrations with these hosting

00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,240
providers so if

00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,320
you get something you get your local

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,880
development environment but it's not

00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,800
uh built for one specific uh provider

00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,000
it's not on an island it's connected to

00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,639
sort of all the projects that you're

00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,399
working on

00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,920
so to me that's one of the things that

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,839
makes it a little bit different than

00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,800
some of the other environments

00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,920
absolutely absolutely i have tried lando

00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,959
uh several times indeed and

00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:04,320
most of this actually okay so uh

00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,720
next uh olexi uh

00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,240
from dark soul why don't you go ahead

00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,240
and tell us a little bit about it

00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:18,639
is is alexi here i don't think galaxy is

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,639
here

00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,000
maybe dropped

00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:30,399
okay in any case if he comes back

00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:33,920
we will uh we will have him so next

00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:36,480
randy um dida

00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,120
what are the new things what are you

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,839
planning

00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:44,560
what what things are we uh having for us

00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,399
you guys yeah thanks thanks for

00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,600
organizing this ricardo

00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,639
hi everybody i'm randy fay i'm rfa on

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,440
most of the places you know me um

00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,120
and i'm the maintainer of ddub local

00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,040
which is

00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:03,760
another command line based uh docker

00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,560
uh docker orchestrator i guess we can

00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,160
say

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:11,360
um dwev is easy to learn

00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,120
comes up fast you know starting a

00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,920
starting a project is usually like 20

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,120
seconds

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,920
got great fast community support runs

00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,120
the same

00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,680
on every platform it runs on windows mac

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,600
os

00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,000
linux and wsl2 and we'll have it on the

00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,079
apple

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,079
m1 as soon as docker is ready for that

00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,600
um you can run a whole bunch of

00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,560
different projects

00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,720
they can all have different

00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,839
configuration um

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,240
it's one of the big advantages for teams

00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,000
and

00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,959
for and for diverse projects so you can

00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,279
have one project that's still on php 5.6

00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:52,839
and another one that's on php8

00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:56,560
you can have one that's on mariadb

00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:58,079
5.5 and another one that's on mysql 8.0

00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,680
and they can be running at the same time

00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:04,079
with no trouble

00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:06,880
um so it's extensible with many

00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,800
lots of lots of services gets regular

00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,680
maintenance and new features

00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,639
um we're hoping to have more platform

00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,199
integrations

00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,240
and user customizable platform

00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:19,759
integrations

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:22,000
for for hosting providers um in the next

00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,800
next round that's the most ambitious

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,839
goal

00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,720
for the next version of ddev is the

00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,800
ability to

00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,399
for people even to wrap their own

00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,320
integration for their own

00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,720
private hosting environment as well as

00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,519
making it easier to do things like

00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,199
uh like well we want to add platform sh

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:42,880
for example we already do

00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,399
uh pantheon and ddev live so

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,000
i've got a link there in the

00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,000
presentation but you can just

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,440
um search for what's so different about

00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,399
dwb local

00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,079
where i uh wandered on about the things

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,639
that i think are important

00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,759
and uh we invite you to try it out and

00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:00,639
we're there to

00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:05,439
help you along the way in the drupal dev

00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:08,000
channel and lots of other places

00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,199
thank you thank you that was very

00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,039
enlightening

00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:16,400
um so i i want to kick start this

00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,120
our discussion today here um and i have

00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,640
some

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,079
really interesting um uh results from

00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:25,120
the survey that uh

00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:28,640
jeff did um

00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:31,679
and i kind of wanted to share this with

00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,160
with uh uh with you all so i'm curious

00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,160
that

00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:39,679
lando and doxol have both grown

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:42,799
but ddef alone has jumped

00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,000
up four spots in that in that survey

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:47,440
that was done

00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,120
uh while drupal vm the dev desktop

00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:54,960
vagrant and homebrew have all shrinked

00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,880
uh do you want to comment on that jeff

00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,640
yeah it's it's a trend that we've we've

00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,080
seen let me meet myself

00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,559
it's a trend that we've seen the past

00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:05,520
couple years in um

00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:06,640
in general i think a lot of developers

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,480
have been moving

00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,000
from a vm based or a local like building

00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,440
your entire local environment and the

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,760
slide just went away from me

00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,720
there it is um and they've been moving

00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,679
towards something

00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,600
that's docker based like uh lando or

00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,600
just plain docker that's what i'm using

00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,600
right now for my personal site

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,720
um and the reason why a lot of people

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,200
are doing that is because

00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,720
it's easier to share those tools between

00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,200
members of a team

00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,120
and it's easier nowadays to run that on

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,400
windows mac and linux

00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,080
without any real ability issues and

00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,640
virtual machines still do some of that

00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,320
but it's just a little bit the layering

00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,440
and heavyweightness of it is a little

00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,039
higher so

00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,960
um i think that's just a natural

00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,960
progression as the as the doctor-based

00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,559
tools have gotten so much better and so

00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,320
much easier to use

00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,480
um in the communities around them we've

00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,840
grown so much but i think that that's

00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,799
just an interesting thing the other

00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,919
thing is

00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,919
with drupal 8 and 9 now soon

00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,440
in the next couple years drupal 10

00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,520
coming down the pike

00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,720
everything has been moving towards a

00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,480
more structured

00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,400
environment and so you need some of

00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,400
those tools that are built into these

00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,440
other systems like lando and oxel and

00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,240
dev

00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,799
and additionally with your development

00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,559
environment

00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,799
you would want to use a tool that

00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,679
integrates so like a thing like cloud

00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,799
ide

00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,280
or in github code spaces or

00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,480
an ide like phpstorm those have also

00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,880
been growing

00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,960
um it's interesting to see the visual

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,160
studio code i'm guessing partly because

00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,880
of the price

00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,720
has also grown pretty dramatically and

00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,520
some of the older tools like atom and

00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,559
sublime

00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,000
have kind of gone back a little bit in

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,720
terms of usage

00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,520
uh as bs code and phpstorm kind of take

00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,520
over the space

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,520
uh is uh does anyone else want to

00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,760
comment quickly

00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,760
uh on these uh survey results

00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,880
i bet randy has to say something

00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,960
you know you know the one thing that

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,200
i'll uh

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,960
bet what that's really interesting

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,600
that's happening right now maybe even

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,799
kind of since the survey is i see lots

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,159
of people jumping over to windows wsl2

00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:25,200
because doctor is so fantastic there um

00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,360
so mac os has had a stranglehold on

00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,799
developers for forever

00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:33,760
and all of a sudden wsl 2 provides

00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:35,120
both the linux environment the the

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,240
environment where you can do everything

00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,200
you expect

00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,159
and incredible performance and people

00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:43,679
are just

00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,200
going it's a it's a and it relates to

00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,200
one of the questions about

00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,799
docker performance file system

00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,799
performance on mac os

00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:59,039
great awesome uh does anyone else want

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,039
to take a stab at it

00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,640
it's not then i we had exactly

00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,240
some kind of situation that uh randy

00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,840
talked about so a devil horse

00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:12,559
uh due to corona dynamically wrote home

00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,840
so he starts using his his uh his

00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,640
windows computer

00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,080
a powerful machine to start developing

00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,200
he made its work with

00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:24,000
or launchpad he made it work with wsl

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,799
and he didn't open his mac anymore it's

00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,880
just

00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,840
the the performance improvement you have

00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,559
just by being on vs

00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,440
and yeah like randy said that the mac

00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,720
mac os

00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,039
uh i o issues yeah it's still

00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,000
it's still a pain if you want to develop

00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:44,320
on them so

00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:48,000
yeah interesting that is interesting

00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:51,520
okay so um i i wanted to

00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,559
uh go now to

00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,840
q a questions uh so if that's like the

00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,880
question is

00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,880
aleski is here too

00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,280
so let's let's try and go back here to

00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,400
your slide

00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:12,080
let's see there you go

00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:15,120
thank you guys okay yeah yeah go ahead

00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,520
and present this question it's about uh

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,520
dark soul

00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:25,200
yeah thanks um so dark soul

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:27,840
uh dark soul is standard about building

00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,840
less tools to achieve the same

00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,520
flexibility that basically docker

00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,240
compose gives you

00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,799
um this was the main idea behind dark

00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,080
soul

00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:41,360
is that we don't want to invent

00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:44,880
another dialect uh

00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,840
because whatever we would do would be

00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,880
more limited than docker compose is and

00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:52,960
docker compose is a great tool

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,640
so what we tried to build what was the

00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:58,320
main idea behind

00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:01,360
dark soul is to put some

00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:05,600
agreements some conventions

00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,600
behind daca compose to make

00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,720
to make spinning up your local

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,760
environment

00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,400
easier than it is with regular docker

00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,600
compose

00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,520
and also make it cross platform because

00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,240
with docker compose if you have a team

00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,600
that

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,960
uses different operational systems

00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:26,159
obviously they have to

00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,360
change it manually well

00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:33,120
that's the main things that we wanted to

00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:36,240
uh solve with dark soul and uh

00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,280
over the time it evolved

00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,000
and not well it's still cross-platform

00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,360
this is the

00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,480
the main idea that's why uh it works

00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,000
everywhere

00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:51,600
um and uh we have been developing

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,919
different filesync options because

00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,279
we we all know the pain of syncing your

00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:59,840
files with docker and uh

00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:02,559
frankly this is the main hurdle of

00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,240
docker on desktops and docker as a local

00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:08,480
developer development environment

00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:11,840
at all and that's that's why we are

00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,000
um that's why we're developing

00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,039
like keep adding those options and

00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,000
hopefully

00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,360
we will continue adding those as things

00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,640
evolve and hopefully

00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:23,919
we as a community land on some singular

00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,279
option in future but

00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:29,679
that's just not there at the moment

00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:30,640
that's why in dark soul you can have nfs

00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,400
you can have

00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,799
unison which has its drawbacks but

00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,799
works to the extent or you can

00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,679
completely disconnect your

00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,480
uh container file system from from from

00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,960
your host and

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:49,600
in use copying tools like docker copy

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,039
uh okay okay for those who don't for

00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,400
those for those who don't know

00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:55,120
uh one of our main advantage of dark

00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,200
soul is

00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:59,279
cross platform automation that you can

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,080
build use usually people build in dash

00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:03,120
but you can also

00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,320
use php and node and we have a lot of

00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,799
preconfigured projects

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,480
that you can just spin up in a matter of

00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,600
minutes with

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:14,000
with fin project start okay

00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,960
thanks alexi and thanks for being here

00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
with us uh

00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,400
that that is great uh we're now going to

00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,320
jump

00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:24,960
to q a sessions uh if people in the

00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:26,880
in the organization can uh pull pull

00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,039
down the the slide so we can see us

00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,240
all in the in the meeting that would be

00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,360
great uh

00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,720
so i go for the first question which is

00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:40,240
a very very interesting question

00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:43,360
so the question goes by this um is

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,799
some synergy a reduction

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:50,400
between all of the tools represented

00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,400
uh and

00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:57,760
happening right and if not what

00:25:54,080 --> 00:26:00,799
would make that uh uh possible

00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:04,240
or what makes that impossible if we

00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:07,279
uh read uh the other way who wants

00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,720
to ask you learn from each other which

00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,720
is the good part

00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,919
the bad part is no we don't seem to have

00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,760
any synergy

00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:15,520
everybody has their it's like many

00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,400
things everybody has their own

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,840
specialties

00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,840
and integrations and remember that a lot

00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,520
of these tools aren't just drupal tools

00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:27,520
so um they're you know ddef has a

00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,799
specialty in typo three

00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,960
uh lando is working into the wordpress

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:35,039
space more i mean d dev does

00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,400
wordpress as well but you know they have

00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,240
their own specialties and their own

00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,919
hosting integrations and

00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:43,919
so we're not uh we're not doing very

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,919
well at uh consolidating

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,080
yeah i would echo that for sure randy

00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,919
and i have done

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,440
these things like a million times at

00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:52,799
this point i know that him and i don't

00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,159
feel like lando need to have our

00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,159
competitors

00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,600
uh in any sort of way i think it's easy

00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,720
to fall into the trap of thinking that

00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,720
these tools

00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,840
are the same but they're built for

00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,200
different reasons and for different

00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,240
audiences like

00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,960
lando only like 20 of

00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,320
lando users are using it for drupal so

00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,279
drupal is like a small

00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,480
segment of the total amount um but on

00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:17,440
the tool consolidation

00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,960
front uh this is actually happening um

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,159
it's just not with the people who are on

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,799
stage here

00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,559
um you know so i know that i know that

00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,559
ddev has like provided uh

00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,320
itself as a solution for for i think

00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:29,919
typo three for example that they're not

00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:33,919
making their own thing now

00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:34,720
um like lando is uh helped build um uh

00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,159
pantheon's

00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,320
local development dev environment and

00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,159
platforms local dev environment so

00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,440
we don't have two more tools there

00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,960
either so like there is some

00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,080
consolidation that is happening i think

00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,240
it's just not with the people who are on

00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,039
the stage

00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:50,880
i i wanted to pick uh the brain of our

00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:54,080
user here catherine

00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,080
do you think that's happening

00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,440
oh you're muted you're probably

00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,559
immediate

00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,880
that's why uh that's a good question

00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:10,799
is your feeling is that is that really

00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,640
happening as a user

00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,000
i don't as a user i can't say that i

00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,120
perceive

00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,559
that happening um but

00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,320
again it's hard for it's hard for me to

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,120
say viewing it as you know from an

00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,799
outsider

00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,120
perspective i'm not intimately involved

00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:28,240
in the projects themselves so

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:31,840
uh but as a user i can't say that i see

00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,840
any of that happening

00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,799
anyone wants to talk to this quest

00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:41,440
again or just to finish

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,200
i think i think we enrich each other

00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,240
definitely with the ideas

00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:50,080
at the scene i think

00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:52,480
every project has its own um

00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,000
how do you call it raisin i don't know

00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,919
that's how we call it

00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,279
something something very special about

00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,279
the project that

00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:01,679
you love it's like a car right you you

00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:04,159
choose a car because

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,520
technically all cars are the same but

00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,279
that is actually funny

00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:12,240
and uh yeah and and i think synergy

00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:14,600
is making synergy out of them would just

00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,600
produce another project it's like that

00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,520
hkcd comic you remember you have 14

00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,720
standards so we need to invent standard

00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,000
to join them all

00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:27,360
situation you have 15 standards that's

00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,880
yeah it's not going away okay cool

00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,760
uh so jumping to another question

00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,480
and this actually has a jump there and

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,760
it says

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,960
i tried to jump on lando but

00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:44,720
i slowness

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:47,360
on windows 10 what is the best tool

00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:50,320
to actually use on windows 10 without

00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,320
having a vm

00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:58,080
and then it puts like oh i know

00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,760
move to linux well the the answer is use

00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:03,520
wsl2 on windows

00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,360
yeah uh lando you know dwev works great

00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,520
there i think lando works great there

00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:10,799
i'll betcha doxel works great there

00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:14,080
so the answer is use wsl-2 or

00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:14,480
use nfs um i think that all the tools

00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,279
allow

00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,159
nfs the performance of of our regular

00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:23,840
windows

00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:23,840
uh dev with nfs is adequate

00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,919
i would also add that it's it's it's

00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:33,600
very hard with file sharing

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:36,880
it degrades performance greatly and

00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:39,919
that's why like in daxol you can

00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,080
disconnect your your uh use

00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,840
ducks volumes non and disconnect

00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,360
container completely from your file

00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,360
system i'm pretty sure it's

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,360
possible without with other environments

00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,799
and guys can chime in on that

00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:55,360
but one of the setups i would recommend

00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:57,200
for someone who is looking for the top

00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,120
performance with dark soul is

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,880
disconnect that use dark soul volumes

00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,519
none and then use

00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,080
a vs code server you can you can

00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:07,039
actually

00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,320
have vs code in a container and edit

00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:10,399
files directly there

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,080
you'll have maximum performance will be

00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:14,159
like native like

00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,440
but you have complete risk right i mean

00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,159
anything goes wrong and you lose

00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,039
everything

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,440
right so oh no you can still work with

00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,600
git

00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,440
you you're still supposed to use git

00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,720
from within your container

00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,960
yeah you just edit in files directly

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,960
there

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,799
too we uh we try to just locally and

00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,640
make some kind of hook or a

00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,399
firewatch locally very simple thing or

00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,799
just unsafe sync it to your

00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,039
the docker copy to your image and it's

00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,480
it's insanely fast and then

00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,159
like for debugging purposes you want to

00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,559
just have debug through something yeah

00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,159
yeah

00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,080
all the data is in your container and

00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,640
then in the container itself there is no

00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,799
local

00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,039
i o anymore it's yeah it's it's very

00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:57,120
very fast actually

00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,039
actually i didn't understand you're

00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,480
using docker volumes which is fairly

00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,480
safe

00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,559
that would be fast i'm going to take a

00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:07,200
look at that that sounds

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,200
very useful

00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:11,279
yeah we use by default we use darker

00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,320
volumes

00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,960
over nfs usually but in dark soul you

00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,519
can have

00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,200
duck cell it's dark cell volumes none

00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:21,440
and it disconnects completely

00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,480
you're not using any shared volumes the

00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,399
volume will be

00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,840
native to the container yeah it will not

00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:28,799
be the same maybe you did

00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,960
too yeah that's that's very fast that's

00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,960
it

00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,720
i would i would echo what landi what

00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,480
randy said initially

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,480
it's like a first thing to look at which

00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,919
is is regardless of what tool you use if

00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,440
it's a docker-based tool like moving to

00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,919
wsl

00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,720
that's like everyone that i've talked to

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:46,399
has

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,480
basically expressed a night and day sort

00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,840
of reactions when they switch we have

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,080
people on our team who are

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,440
long-time mac people who are now running

00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,840
windows as their dev environment because

00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,840
wsl is so nice

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:06,720
cool uh so i'm going to pick another

00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,720
question from here

00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:13,679
it's going to be

00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,480
i think i saw a question here with

00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,080
saying

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:22,720
uh asking if cloud ide is a

00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,720
local development environment

00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:29,039
so that that was a good question yeah so

00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,039
this question in chats

00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,080
while you're answering it whether it's

00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:36,720
just total vendor lock-in or whether we

00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,519
can try it out

00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:40,480
yes sure um so i answered this question

00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,919
by saying

00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,159
we don't need to think about local dev

00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,919
environments only you know it was local

00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,679
because we didn't have a choice before

00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,600
now we have other options you know you

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:52,240
don't have only cloud id you have

00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,640
got spaces from github you have cloud9

00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,880
and

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,159
several diy solutions as well so the

00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,600
idea is that

00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,840
now you have the tools and the file

00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,799
systems that work for you to be able to

00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,640
have

00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,159
some good productivity in the cloud and

00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,240
that just works

00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,440
and in terms of vendor lock-in it's

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:10,000
based on top of

00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,560
an open source ui called thea so there's

00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,399
no

00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,240
lock-in per se the only lock-in that you

00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,200
can have with cloud ide because i can

00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:17,200
only talk about this

00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,639
is the integration with the cloud

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,240
platform inside factory

00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,320
which is obviously some custom

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,000
integration but technically it's still

00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:26,320
your code base it's still your db

00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,280
it's still your files we're not blocking

00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:30,079
you from

00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,960
uh getting access to configuration files

00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,119
uh so

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,320
it's just your box but this time it's in

00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,000
the cloud so it's really

00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,440
the only difference from your local dev

00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,599
environments

00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,679
so we can all try it out today without a

00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,280
acquia account or anything

00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,119
uh you do need to have an aqueous

00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,159
account and you do need to have a cloud

00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,359
subscription

00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:52,159
um we want to be able to have

00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,359
um acquia cloud free evaluator starts

00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,520
with an ide

00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:58,079
um instead of having the regular trial

00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,320
experience but it's slated for 2021

00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,440
so not yet but it's it's on the on the

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,040
horizon obviously

00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:08,000
yeah thanks

00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,200
thanks for answering that so i have a

00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,800
hard question here

00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:16,000
uh it says the macbook m1

00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:19,280
ir i are m processor

00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,480
is quite disruptive for most tools based

00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,240
on docker

00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:27,760
what are your thoughts and do you think

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,079
it will be solved soon they're demoing

00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,160
it

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,040
right as we speak at the docker

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:36,400
community all hands yeah i said that

00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:39,359
i'm missing it there's also one other

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,720
uh interesting thing that i i've been

00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,800
working with raspberry pi

00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,400
for years now and they use arm

00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,040
processors which are the same

00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:48,240
architecture as this new m1 processor

00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,200
one thing that's happened in the past

00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,160
two or three years is

00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,560
almost every docker image that i've used

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,480
is now being built for multiple

00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,839
architectures so you can run it on intel

00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,320
or natively

00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:02,320
and i actually yesterday i converted two

00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,280
of my images i have like 15 or so left

00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,760
to do nice

00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,839
um but it took like 10 minutes now

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,119
there's open source tools from docker

00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,599
like buildex

00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,480
it lets you make it so it can run on the

00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,119
m1

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,520
on intel chips on windows and everything

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,240
just

00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,760
by changing a couple configuration lines

00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,720
and as more

00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,599
docker images available it'll it'll be

00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,839
super easy

00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:27,839
for maintainers like me to switch

00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,760
all of devs containers are already ready

00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,839
with arm 64

00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,920
and already run on raspberry pi and

00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:38,960
other arm 64 places

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,720
but docker desktop isn't ready yet so

00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,720
we'll see when that comes i hope it

00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:44,400
comes soon um and we'll see

00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,839
and but they may have the same exact

00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,760
problem with the

00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,960
file system which has been the problem

00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:55,839
all along

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:55,839
arm 64 architecture doesn't solve that

00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:04,880
so another thing

00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,040
from chris he asks is there

00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,000
even a common language between these

00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:11,280
tools

00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:12,440
that would enable any sort of cross tool

00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,440
development

00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,440
consolidation

00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:23,839
that is a tough one is that is there any

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,839
common language

00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,280
well actually i think all the like i

00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:36,000
don't i think it's

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:37,280
randy that said that you're all docker

00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,880
compose orchestrators

00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,240
we just assemble a file that makes

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,920
something work with containers we

00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:46,800
provide ourselves with some

00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,680
other configurations so yeah i think

00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,440
double compose

00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,880
is the base language of every tool yeah

00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,440
docker-based tools

00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:55,839
okay but but but cloud id is kubernetes

00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,839
isn't it

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:03,520
yep okay okay cool so

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:06,160
uh the next question is uh a lot

00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,720
a lot of a lot of the environments use

00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,839
docker

00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,079
what's great but did you see some light

00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:14,480
on the horizon in terms of slow

00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:17,599
performance on mac i think this was

00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:21,680
responded already but

00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,680
anyone wants to give a stab at this

00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,680
so again usually it's really hard to

00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:29,680
slow this year um

00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,680
and haven't really succeeded yet

00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:36,880
you're trying good job

00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:39,839
okay cool um

00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,400
what about the local dev environment

00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:45,040
called

00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,040
docker for drupal if someone knows it

00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:51,200
the user catherine have you used

00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,640
and used that uh i i can't say i've used

00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,079
it i've looked at it i've read some

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,480
documentation

00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,480
um i think it's

00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,400
you know i think something that um we

00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,240
said earlier that each

00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,520
each one of these tools has something

00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,880
special about it there's something

00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:09,280
there's a reason why you settle on one

00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,880
thing or another and for whatever reason

00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,720
at the time that i evaluated it didn't

00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,359
have a special thing that made me want

00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,280
to

00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:16,560
try it out so i mean you know again but

00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,839
every user's different your needs are

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,240
different so

00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:22,000
um you know i think you have to find

00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:24,079
what what fits

00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,839
your use case but i i haven't had enough

00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:29,280
experience to speak to it

00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:31,599
uh always included it in his uh

00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,960
in his survey i think and it's just been

00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,960
dropping off the chart i think

00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,760
it's it's not even in the top 10 i don't

00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,760
think anymore

00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,880
i could answer the the mac performance

00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:47,599
question if it if

00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:49,520
it either improves or i have a nice

00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,760
linux laptop on standby

00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,280
to switch all my work over to so i think

00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:55,280
that's the answer just get there a lot

00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,160
of really great uh linux laptop

00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,200
manufacturers

00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,560
now so it's a great time

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:06,000
to uh become a

00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,640
more full-time linux user we back you up

00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,640
on that

00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:15,359
katherine um

00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:19,760
okay so uh docker 3.0

00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:19,760
just popped out are you all ready

00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:28,720
are you like during the college

00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,000
it was nicole yes this is all at the

00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:33,119
same time

00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,520
um any anyone

00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:36,160
wants to answer to that or we'll just

00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,440
leave it for

00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:43,079
next extra on the uh

00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,440
they released on linux they released the

00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:46,960
20.09 which i think is probably what

00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,560
we're talking about

00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:53,440
um uh the the docker desktop versions

00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:55,839
bundle docker in them and the big change

00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,520
i think and probably what they released

00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:00,640
is that docker 20.09 has a whole bunch

00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,280
of

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,240
nice new things in it and i gave it a

00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,040
test drive

00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,160
on ubuntu yesterday and didn't encounter

00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:11,839
any trouble

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:14,000
so i would bet that um that all of the

00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:15,040
docker using things will be fine with

00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:18,160
that i don't

00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:21,280
think that the if they

00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:23,920
did a release 3.0 of docker desktop

00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,680
that that's going to do much other than

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,680
the 2009

00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:35,839
docker internals but i got to go back

00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,839
after this to the to the docker

00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:42,720
good uh so i think we still have

00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,240
time for one last question let me see

00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,560
what we have here

00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:50,800
oh there's still a lot of questions um

00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,800
so

00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:58,720
this is this okay so

00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:02,160
with ddev doxol

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,880
lando could you still run docker compose

00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,920
commands

00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:08,560
directly or do you have to run

00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,200
everything through the command to the

00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,200
main command

00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,359
well i can respond for dark soul you can

00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,640
definitely run docker

00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:20,720
compose commands directly from thin fin

00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,599
docker compose in your command

00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,680
and you can actually use plain docker

00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:28,240
compose files with dark soul

00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,680
if you'd like to again this was the

00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:34,960
whole main idea of intercompatibility

00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:37,119
yeah for us the same we just yeah

00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,160
you it's like the expert modes you have

00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,920
the tool around to

00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,319
to shuffle around the files and if you

00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,319
want to go wild you have your

00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:47,359
your way to provide in your own compost

00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:47,359
file and go for it

00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,800
cool um let me see

00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:59,520
so much asks a question i'm not sure

00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,680
what

00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,880
i'll try i'll try to rephrase the

00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,079
question so is

00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:10,079
is there a repo we can look

00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:13,760
at that uses vs code

00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:17,040
server and lamp

00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,000
i think the um the right the the easiest

00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:22,319
answer most

00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:25,200
is um you in in wsl 2

00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:26,079
you just run the code command and it

00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,400
launches vs

00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,640
code on windows and that's the easiest

00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,359
way to experience that

00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:34,400
i think there's similar things but that

00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:37,520
integration is

00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:40,880
absolutely perfect so you just type in

00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:43,520
in wsl 2 you just type code

00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:44,880
dot and it'll bring up the current

00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,880
checkout

00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,880
in vs code on windows

00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:57,920
i think that's that's response to it

00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:01,920
um anyone else has questions

00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:05,440
i think we have two questions here

00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,680
uh it says but it is open source

00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,000
and stable on mac os so this is not a

00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:13,200
question this is just

00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,480
uh mike will this remain

00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:18,400
the same in the future and then he sends

00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:22,240
a twitter

00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,960
i don't know what is this uh

00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,640
maybe tormey wants to clarify what he

00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,520
sent us because i could not see the

00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:31,920
twitter

00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,920
there yeah i opened it up uh okay

00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,240
um it's about running orlando in

00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,480
production

00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,520
uh whether we have plans to change that

00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:42,880
uh

00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:44,560
we don't have uh plans to ever

00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,480
run landowner production as like a

00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:48,960
hosting solution that's definitely not

00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:51,359
something that we're going to do

00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:53,599
i will say that we think acquia's cloud

00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:55,200
ide is a good approach

00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,040
so i don't know take what you roll from

00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,760
that

00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:02,240
and let me just add that dev now has

00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:06,079
casual web hosting based on dww

00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:07,839
that is um is casual web hosting and of

00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:11,040
course there's dwb live different thing

00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:11,040
but i guess we're about to end

00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:19,839
uh time extended okay we can work

00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,520
okay thanks uh thanks everyone for being

00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,800

00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,920
everyone that watched the presentation

00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:32,960

00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:39,520
uh hopefully will be uh

00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,800
