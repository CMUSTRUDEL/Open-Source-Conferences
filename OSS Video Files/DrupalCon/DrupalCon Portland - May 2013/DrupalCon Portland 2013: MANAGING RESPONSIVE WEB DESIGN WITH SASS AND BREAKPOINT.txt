Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: MANAGING RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN WITH SASS AND BREAKPOINT
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	Writing css for responsive web design can get out of control quickly. Write some media queries for your layouts, some more for your menus, and even more to catch all the little details in a well-crafted design and they really add up.

I created a Sass extension called Breakpoint that lets you boil your media queries to their essential properties, and to give each one a meaningful name. This helps you write your styles more quickly, while also creating more maintainable and future-proof code. I'll demonstrate why this is needed and how it's become indespensible in my RWD toolset.
