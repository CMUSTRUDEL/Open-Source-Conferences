Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: MANAGING RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN WITH SASS AND BREAKPOINT
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	Writing css for responsive web design can get out of control quickly. Write some media queries for your layouts, some more for your menus, and even more to catch all the little details in a well-crafted design and they really add up.

I created a Sass extension called Breakpoint that lets you boil your media queries to their essential properties, and to give each one a meaningful name. This helps you write your styles more quickly, while also creating more maintainable and future-proof code. I'll demonstrate why this is needed and how it's become indespensible in my RWD toolset.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,520
good morning and that hopefully will be

00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:11,790
what was much as it woke me up I'm so

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:15,420
excited for sunday so welcome to this

00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:18,240
talk which is called that which is a

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:19,949
mouthful and it was originally shorter

00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,010
than that and then I had Sam start to

00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:25,350
talk about singularity it was now it's

00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:40,800
ridiculous so this was kind of how I'm

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:42,090
thinking of right now the mic cool so

00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,030
yeah this is the right way to do are to

00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:50,640
be there is no other way questions at

00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:53,820
the end so this was probably two years

00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,180
ago at Google pun so when he was giving

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,739
a talk about responsive and posed the

00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,649
question of the audience OHS responsive

00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:06,960
design part again I'm for the shop into

00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:10,710
the mic right so its responses are and I

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,240
thought it was a trick question people

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:16,400
were like acid i don't know i don't want

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:27,390
to seen it all so i stood up and said

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:29,100
well yeah it's designed um yes and the

00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:30,600
thing that i want to kind of keep in

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,549
mind and this is to talk about technique

00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,380
but the reason that I wanted to say this

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,880
now is that all these techniques they go

00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:41,880
to serve the both the greater good

00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:44,700
experience project so the techniques

00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,100
might be somewhat difficult but you guys

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:53,399
are gonna learn something you learned

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:55,320
something in this session so no but it's

00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:00,140
the process of thinking things through

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:04,410
and designing that's always so who are

00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:07,860

people and where I live in Philadelphia

00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:55,530
I organized the exact speedo and ha

00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,270
morning pop I'm Sam Richard I am also

00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,000
leaves a new front end developer over at

00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:01,770
nbcuniversal I am snuggled on twitter

00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,770
and github generally speaking the

00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:08,430
internets and I'm to organize your team

00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:10,470
SAS and the upcoming SAS conference so

00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:14,700
if you're interested in SAS follow

00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:18,570
twitter and you will get you will see on

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,660
announcements next week so before we get

00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,860
started let's get a few things straight

00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:28,459
everyone hold up your hand if you want a

00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:28,459
smartphone hold up your actual phone

00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:36,780
also give it give it raised give erase

00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:42,720
this is this is participatory I do it

00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:47,070
much lower your phone and only if you

00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,840
have the same device make and model with

00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:57,540
the same operating system as your

00:03:48,840 --> 00:04:01,800
neighbors that's what I thought so to

00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:03,240
get started with this we will be working

00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,940
on the premise that you are building

00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:15,560
device agnostic because if you designed

00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:18,600
for specific devices your devices but

00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,900
because responsible it's not about

00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:27,600
current devices and known unknowns

00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:29,670
future devices and unknown unknowns so

00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,110
yeah what's the right way to do things

00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:37,200
we're not targeting devices specifically

00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:38,669
we start with content first probably

00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:41,010
everyone in the room knows to Jeffrey's

00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:43,190
ailment is and I think he's good to talk

00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:45,540
about this in which redesigning his blog

00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:48,570
but it's something that I found in my

00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,160
work that it's actually kinda hard to

00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,680
design something until you know what it

00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,060
is you're designing and since we're

00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,190
working on the web and everything on the

00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,980
word is content with very rare exception

00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:01,140
good idea to know what the content is so

00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,840
start writing it start understanding it

00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:06,150
get a feel for what flavor the content

00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,419
is if you don't have the actual or its

00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:12,600
images so we do that and then we design

00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:14,130
for our most constrained device or

00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,919
system that we can come up with and

00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,990
that's usually my piece of to do a few

00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:21,300
months but for now we're talking about

00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,850
low first and I'm not gonna belabor that

00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:25,650
point beyond that we're going to use web

00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,000
standards these best practices we're

00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:28,740
going to listen to our industry and

00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,210
we're going to talk to our industry to

00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,120
make sure that we're all moving in a

00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:34,800
really good direction and especially

00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,410
we're going to be device agnostic and

00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,630
future friendly I don't know what what

00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,000
phones you guys have I don't know what

00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:44,240
device I'm going to have

00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,430
soon enough so we're going to try to to

00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,460
anticipate actually not anticipate we're

00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:51,280
going to try to justice commit the web

00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:56,810
as the web I'm going to meet you there

00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:59,630
like so what else do we do why are we

00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:02,750
here in this particular well we know SAS

00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:07,640
and SAS is the key to writing CSS the

00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:10,190
right one because this isn't a beginner

00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:13,280
course of energy session I want to get a

00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:15,380
couple of ground rules um so if you're

00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,030
working with SAS and you're in here I'm

00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:19,220
going to see me know about variables and

00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:21,230
nesting if you don't please don't go

00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,570
they're not too hard to pick up a new

00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:26,480
pic of us as we talk about to go over

00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:29,240
exactly what's put on there you've used

00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,890
some nixon's kind of the same deal to

00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,470
think that we're talking about are some

00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:36,169
custom mix and packages hopefully you've

00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:38,960
tried compass compass is we're going to

00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:42,350
get into the specific functionality of

00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,780
compass beyond its ability to import

00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:46,130
extensions but compasses a lot of really

00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:50,800
great features especially for writing

00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:53,419
css3 so let's learn some tasks together

00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,970
we'll start off without any of the

00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:58,400
special packages some vanilla SAS for

00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:02,140
writing matey Bruce and I want to talk

00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,140
about break points versus tweak points

00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,270
so everyone's probably worth of return

00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:14,720
break points and it probably not too

00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:16,040
crazy what we please my feet but I think

00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,620
of it in terms of when you've got large

00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,720
chunks and stuff that you react that

00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:22,130
you're trying to move in Iraq to screen

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,410
dimensions breaths so you've got a

00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:26,660
layout going from two columns or three

00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:28,790
columns six dollars of whatever going to

00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:31,430
be I would think of those as large

00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:33,860
changes big break points but to try to

00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:37,120
illustrate the difference between that

00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,740
kind of responsive web design and

00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,569
massaging little details I think the

00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:46,279
term click once makes sense

00:07:41,569 --> 00:07:49,279
so there's a reason I don't like writing

00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:51,080
things this way and that's the context

00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:52,729
of what I'm trying to change when I'm

00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,849
ready so I've got your two selectors

00:07:52,729 --> 00:07:57,319
want for menu 11 / sub nav and we're

00:07:55,849 --> 00:08:02,240
changing some padding when we get to a

00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:03,919
500 fixit's wide browser and what I'm

00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,159
actually trying to do in this example

00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,659
here is monitor is changed something

00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:11,839
within the context of either of those

00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:13,849
selectors so in under the selector menu

00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,849
when we get to a thing I want to do

00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:18,709
something else same thing what's up now

00:08:15,849 --> 00:08:20,959
so when I'm writing this when I'm

00:08:18,709 --> 00:08:23,029
watching this I'm watching that paddock

00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,709
and that you know eight other

00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:27,379
characteristics on the CSS that I'm

00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:29,419
changing in the real world and that's

00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:32,149
all in the context of making if fabric

00:08:29,419 --> 00:08:34,639
split up so the menu was you know 200

00:08:32,149 --> 00:08:35,509
lines above the media queries remain you

00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:38,659
I would have a hard time visualizing

00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:40,339
that as I'm writing so what's asked

00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:42,349
gives you the ability to do is to nest

00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:44,360
your media queries the insider selector

00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:47,660
to put it in the context of that

00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,579
selector so one level nested for menu is

00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,589
our media query and that's going to

00:08:49,579 --> 00:08:55,550
compile out to CSS that looks just like

00:08:51,589 --> 00:09:00,139
this and this is a lot easier to write

00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:01,970
individualize and then this especially

00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:06,889
when you get into complex selectors and

00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:09,500
complexes ecorse so is it a problem that

00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:11,360
we're breaking up our media queries into

00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:15,649
these fine brain things from farms

00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:20,420
perspectives didn't mean to do that no

00:09:15,649 --> 00:09:22,970
it is not the there been tests done it's

00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:25,699
not going to affect the speed at which a

00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,410
browser can interpret the CSS it's not

00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:30,620
going to affect your download / been a

00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:32,930
significant amount especially if you can

00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,360
compress your CSS which we were all are

00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:38,209
or should be doing Google to the side of

00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,339
the box so don't be scared to write your

00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:46,079
media queries another way it'll make you

00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:52,180
like a lot easier so there

00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:54,339
what a great point Bree point is the

00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,660
outcome of a little bit of frustration i

00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:57,459
was having writing media queries and

00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:01,120
that i was writing a lot that looked the

00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:04,420
same and i recently actually be written

00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,870
an article on SAS and how you can use

00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:09,250
SAS make sense to make me queries right

00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:11,319
a little bit more efficiently but I

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:14,439
thought the logic that I had worked into

00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:17,139
that was a little bit lacking so I

00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:19,269
started to play around with assigning

00:10:17,139 --> 00:10:22,449
breakpoint variables break once frankly

00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:24,490
values to variables and it saved my

00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:32,850
bacon on that project and actually open

00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:37,589
up a lot of cool six yeah a little bit o

00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:39,910
barely barely community patch so why

00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:43,120
would I want this why do i do this i

00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:45,639
started off like i said just kind of put

00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:48,250
a value to a variable and be able to

00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:50,319
pass that around i'm writing a lot of

00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:53,500
men with value lot of men with many

00:10:50,319 --> 00:10:55,569
media queries and so I said okay well

00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,459
how about I just set this one value the

00:10:55,569 --> 00:11:00,370
number of them in with media query to a

00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:02,759
variable and that's pretty cool it's

00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:05,050
simplified my little ones and then I

00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:08,050
abstract that a little further in the in

00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:09,670
the extension so that I could have that

00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,980
same kind of simplified syntax for

00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:16,240
complex media queries just right mid

00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:17,860
worthless just mostly um and then I

00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,509
found that I was a sunny was meaningful

00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,790
names because I can't just pull up in a

00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:24,250
great point 1 2 3 4 s kind of boring

00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:28,660
enough work so i decided a name based on

00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:30,189
why I needed a media query and then this

00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:32,529
was the unattended consequences i'm now

00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:37,689
managing my media queries by their

00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:39,930
purpose in other contexts so actually

00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:42,100
i'll come back to that second so if from

00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:45,790
I've got a media query that I'm writing

00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:47,620
because my menu at one state is so long

00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:51,399
and others dated so long our do

00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:53,110
something else then I can have that the

00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:55,290
inside to a name as a variable I can

00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:59,160
other things triple

00:11:55,290 --> 00:12:01,019
that effect so if we're going to start

00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,639
using break point this is where we go so

00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:06,120
I'm github and these slides are online

00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,470
up with the lincoln electric slide so

00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,959
you can go and check all that out and

00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:12,329
these links work so on your command line

00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:15,740
it's like how you would excuse any

00:12:12,329 --> 00:12:15,740
compass extension by otherwise you this

00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:23,430
so Jenna saw break point and your

00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:25,079
command line require great point and

00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:27,569
your compass that are be filed as if I

00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:29,009
where you configure your compass project

00:12:27,569 --> 00:12:32,579
there are a lot of other configurations

00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:35,009
to go there and then in your working SAS

00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:38,519
while you're an import break point

00:12:35,009 --> 00:12:43,160
that's going to allow any sassy right to

00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:49,440
use the break limit so let's get on to

00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:52,610
getting started with right point just

00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,970
hands up who knows point breaks movie

00:12:52,610 --> 00:13:04,319
good okay cool no that was like seventy

00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:07,290
eight percent of people point break

00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:10,399
movie 1991 class at Patrick Swayze Keanu

00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,399
Reeves look it up

00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:22,099
hi cool so this is the basic use of

00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:23,869
great point on that variable at the top

00:13:22,099 --> 00:13:25,249
basic 500 pixels I don't know if you can

00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:27,199
read there I don't if you can read the

00:13:25,249 --> 00:13:28,879
great comments for you on the screen but

00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:31,099
that is the great book very oldest

00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:34,459
that's a simple etiquette that's where

00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:39,799
you can post off so Johnny Utah is a

00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:41,539
character and his default color is Buffy

00:13:39,799 --> 00:13:44,449
he looks like coffee before anything

00:13:41,539 --> 00:13:48,799
cool happens and then once we get to 500

00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:51,349
pixels he's the color of badass so

00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,119
that's how you use break point and it

00:13:51,349 --> 00:13:55,849
just compiled like hopefully you would

00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:59,719
expect it to just make them in with

00:13:55,849 --> 00:14:01,069
media query it's pretty simple but the

00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:06,679
real benefit there is that we've given

00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:08,299
it an a pretty gets more complex but one

00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,709
of the other cool things that we can do

00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:12,979
is we can start to be a little bit more

00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:17,029
accessible without any extra effort it's

00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:19,129
if somebody is for whatever reason

00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:22,459
change to the default font size on their

00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:24,979
phone or on their device whatever your

00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:27,699
pixel based meeting queries will blow up

00:14:24,979 --> 00:14:30,379
and be not what you expected if you use

00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:32,959
MS and without em to talk about the

00:14:30,379 --> 00:14:37,159
biceps that's always going to be based

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,779
on a 16 pixel value then when they

00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:41,809
change the font size on their device on

00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:44,899
the Fonterra browser that value will

00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:46,719
then be this is the bloody usually what

00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:49,249
you intend when it actually renders out

00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:51,529
so all I did was change add this

00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:54,949
variable great fun to ms and set that to

00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:59,239
be true and that converted my 500 pixels

00:14:54,949 --> 00:15:00,879
to 31 point 25 EMS and if you think

00:14:59,239 --> 00:15:04,449
that's easy to calculate in your head I

00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:07,290
think you're very very members for me

00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:10,139
I'm very

00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:13,500
so I think I believe at this point so

00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:16,320
why it is this cool this is what we have

00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:19,230
written before the others to 500 pixel

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,959
media queries but what we were doing is

00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:24,920
reacting to the size of the menu and

00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:27,660
says the menu needed musiq 954 pickles

00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:30,389
we create break point we have signed

00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:32,040
value variable we use that okay we just

00:15:30,389 --> 00:15:36,540
got trouble to code around it didn't

00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:38,699
change anything for us but in the real

00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:41,009
world things happen you know the menu we

00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:42,839
get another item we changed the wording

00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:45,660
it gets longer so now we've got more

00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:51,089
real-world value there that's 142 pixel

00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:53,430
value that I made up what we change it

00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:55,079
in one place and that affects all the

00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:58,769
other places that have to react for that

00:15:55,079 --> 00:16:01,290
same reason and all most of the time

00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:03,720
that actually works that actually lets

00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,980
us have that same effect when we just

00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,649
needed a change of value for in one

00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,300
place we might have had reread three

00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:12,510
different reasons for having 500 emini

00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:14,130
query on our site but the only venue

00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:18,899
change mainly change lee based on the

00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:24,120
menu basically there's her through

00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:25,410
quality SS so like I said men with me

00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,230
crees aren't the only kind of media

00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:30,449
query right and I wanted to give a

00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:34,170
shorthand syntax for as many of the bake

00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:37,230
sales and salmon I started to call these

00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:42,350
fixed values we're fencing in a min and

00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:46,199
Max usually wins I'm tight so by default

00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:49,350
we're in Jinan whiffed so if we pass

00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:51,990
breakpoints two numbers like so that's

00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:56,279
going to result in a min max with we

00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:59,670
agree and there we go and I've loved it

00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:01,500
to treat up pixels so that we don't have

00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,120
to do any kind of mental gymnastics and

00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,900
get there faster but mama I would have

00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,820
great my damn Stern

00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:11,430
we can also have explicit tests and

00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:13,800
values so maps with or anything else to

00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:18,740
be considered a string and a number we

00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:21,570
get there we go max with 1000 pixels and

00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,430
we can combine the tests just like in a

00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:28,710
normal media query if you wrap your

00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:31,590
tests in parenthesis and them out as far

00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:34,050
as you need to go so this probably

00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:36,960
predictably at this point is going to be

00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:39,330
max with one pal pixels and orientation

00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,250
portrait and orientation portrait is two

00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:42,360
strings so we handle two strings as well

00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,040
actually we have a little bit of error

00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,690
correction in there too so if you put in

00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:49,110
portrait orientation it would still turn

00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:53,670
that around for you so there we go max

00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:55,020
with orientation portrait and we can

00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:57,330
combine lots of us we could think you

00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:00,570
just go down the line he could all be

00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:02,040
handed together and if you had a comma

00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:05,370
in there we can create an aura based

00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:07,770
media query we've built in support for I

00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:10,860
think every conceivable media query you

00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:14,160
might want to write its it comically

00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:17,030
robust at this point and there we go in

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:20,430
with min heights max I orientation

00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:22,230
pretty nice and those are kind of the

00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:29,480
most basic uses that's that's my

00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:33,320
day-to-day chop Philistines ok

00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:35,419
so the other thing that really makes the

00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,309
stand out from writing me create

00:18:35,419 --> 00:18:38,840
yourself or anything else I've seen for

00:18:37,309 --> 00:18:42,140
writing media queries is we've got

00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:43,760
support for fall backs or when browser

00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,100
doesn't support media queries at all or

00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,830
just support the feature that you're

00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:50,690
working with um and so what I'm

00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,380
illustrating here is something that's

00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:55,370
really really future friendly because

00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:56,890
you would know it correctly from wrong

00:18:55,370 --> 00:19:00,080
there's no browser that supports this

00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:02,990
yeah so this is CSS level for media

00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,730
query selector stuff and just because

00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:07,580
this is exciting i'm going to say what

00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:08,900
this is so we've got a breakpoint no

00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,580
free fall back so true that means it's

00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,429
going to brown for all back then that

00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:15,770
touch drive variable is our breakpoint

00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:19,460
variable for this example and we're

00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:21,830
testing on the pointer test and we're

00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,299
testing to see if its course and there's

00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,640
two values that you can test on for

00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:26,720
pointer and like we said this isn't so

00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,970
ordered anywhere you have produced the

00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,070
standard and it's going to be so we can

00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,590
test for fine pointers and for course

00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:36,080
water's fine pointers are going to be

00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:37,850
mice mice with little tiny one pixel in

00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,370
points that are very fine coarse

00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:42,679
pointers our fingers or something else

00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:45,110
that might be it might be course so that

00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:46,580
will give us a CSS native way to test

00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:51,919
whether we're working with a touch

00:19:46,580 --> 00:20:01,940
device or a or a mousy mousy devices

00:19:51,919 --> 00:20:03,650
would be welcome everybody um so what we

00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,360
got here is test status pony test or

00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:07,820
something that it doesn't exist yet but

00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,610
we do want to have a fallback so after

00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:13,580
the comma we've got two strings 14 no

00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:15,860
query and one that's not touched no

00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,780
query is flag that says this next thing

00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:19,040
is going to be the selector that we're

00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:23,020
going to spit out for our new query

00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:24,790
support so let's quickly see the compile

00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:27,940
place

00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:29,590
what happened was we rendered out the

00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,820
value for free fall before it even

00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:34,840
happened and then our media query

00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:37,300
four-pointer course and then you've got

00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,190
our color badass for that and then

00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,260
finally we've got our no query fall back

00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:45,490
where our fallback for what nest

00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:47,890
unsupported touch hash free fall color

00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:52,300
badass and we think we can use

00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:54,040
modernizer because a tool for testing

00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:56,710
for whether or not a device supports

00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:59,740
touch and to add that touch class to you

00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:01,660
our HTML element and then right now

00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:02,950
we're supporting it and in the future in

00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:10,720
the browser does it work we don't need

00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:13,600
that we also support calculating

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,250
resolutions and if you've ever actually

00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:19,030
hands up who's written a resolution

00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:21,010
based media query yeah and it was kind

00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:23,890
of crazy right like there's a lot that

00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:26,110
goes into it or at least there was when

00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:29,410
I looked into it so there's a lot of

00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:35,080
different ways that you can write it so

00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:39,220
you've got DPI g DB x and stoner is

00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:52,420
db.php two stops per pixel but it's not

00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:54,190
supported anywhere yet it's ok support

00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:57,820
it in one place and what we supported

00:21:54,190 --> 00:22:01,030
elsewhere but you don't want to have to

00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:06,070
write comma-separated resolution media

00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:08,350
queries so we took that over and if you

00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:10,780
input DPP X it will calculate your

00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:13,480
device pixel ratio which is vendor

00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:16,090
prefixed and oral compute the resolution

00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,800
for you if you give it resolution that

00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:20,250
will put out the device pixel ratio

00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:24,580
three as well so it's just a nice easy

00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:27,960
way to start to think in appx and let

00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,960
somebody else do the hard work for you

00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:35,970
and and what I'm not showing is how this

00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:38,309
can be how this can compound complexity

00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:41,190
if you've got other tests inside of that

00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:44,660
so if you're testing for resolution and

00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:47,850
made with or and high or and monochrome

00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:49,890
all of that comma separation will work

00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,120
breakdown sets out what you eat but it's

00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:55,919
really hard to manage you're doing under

00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:58,380
5 so there is a few things that I've not

00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:06,179
mentioned there's one crazy advanced use

00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:08,760
that I I promise you you live but I

00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:11,040
don't have very many uses for it except

00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:13,290
for when we're writing other other

00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:16,020
projects that would like to know about

00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:19,049
where we are media query so a breakpoint

00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:22,500
context and as a function that you can

00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:25,470
call in a min set that will spit out

00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:30,000
what the value of a break point of a

00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:31,620
media query is for a given test so up at

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,880
the top we've got a great point that's

00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:38,070
going to be min with originals and

00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,320
height a min and max height of 600 800

00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:43,830
with an orientation then table and then

00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,480
as we go down we've got three

00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:48,059
occurrences a great point get pumped up

00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,160
the first to check them firm in the

00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:52,020
second for orientation and a third from

00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:55,230
max width and the third is a trick

00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:57,330
question because we as we see it spits

00:23:55,230 --> 00:24:00,419
out direct values for all three which is

00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:03,150
the third is false so we can write a mix

00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:05,790
n that is aware of the context in which

00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:11,580
is being calm and create really awesome

00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:12,960
things oh yeah like singularity and so I

00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:16,340
water campus over to the same as he's

00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,340
been doing belief that one singularity

00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:26,409
so singularity singularity is a gridded

00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:28,850
system using singularity is pretty easy

00:24:26,409 --> 00:24:31,629
you could've gone to you guys laughs

00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:35,919
I've singularity you're going to find it

00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:38,600
gem install same desire vgs grid system

00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,690
requires in your dgs and import

00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:44,809
singularity GS now top and grits a

00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:49,519
little bit super quick who here uses

00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:52,669
grits raise your hand who here uses

00:24:49,519 --> 00:24:57,950
Twitter bootstrap Erzurum foundation all

00:24:52,669 --> 00:25:04,629
of you leave please no I can't be awful

00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:09,019
talk i'm doing the grid stop okay so

00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:12,200
let's take a look at some grit or city

00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:14,269
lacks because grids happen to work well

00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:17,120
if we're looking at both design for

00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:20,179
print and design for cities and we're

00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:23,480
going to go kind of counter ish i'm

00:25:20,179 --> 00:25:25,970
making sure let's look at toronto first

00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,620
because toronto is really bad if you

00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:29,419
take a look at Toronto's map you'll see

00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:32,000
that it really doesn't have a grid

00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:33,740
system and because of that if you were

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,690
to keep plop down in toronto you would

00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:38,059
kind of need to memorize all the streets

00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:39,679
to figure out very me to go something i

00:25:38,059 --> 00:25:45,320
have found is so much similar to hear

00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:48,590
important sorry oh it's kind of a pain

00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:50,779
in the ass to get around oh do you see

00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:53,269
on the other hand has a little bit of a

00:25:50,779 --> 00:25:55,129
grid system but it was a grid system

00:25:53,269 --> 00:25:57,590
that the ER generic grid system its

00:25:55,129 --> 00:25:59,809
squares and because it squares it's hard

00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:03,259
to know hard to visualize exactly where

00:25:59,809 --> 00:26:06,289
you are and any given point to me d

00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:07,669
smooth is kind of like the great that

00:26:06,289 --> 00:26:09,919
you get with twitter bootstrap resort

00:26:07,669 --> 00:26:12,200
foundation their generic printed single

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,330
message there really anything there

00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:18,490
generic prints designs or generic uses

00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:21,220
but don't provide the type of

00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:24,360
complex that you need are to have a grid

00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:28,540
truly work and be super great for users

00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:30,760
good silly or filly a secret system but

00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:32,679
Philly didn't quite stick to their grid

00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:35,020
so while you can generally figure out

00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:36,309
where you are there are times little

00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:39,280
side streets where you're just mocking

00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:42,640
it over you get so sticking to grid is

00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:45,010
important because because otherwise

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:57,910
people will get lost trying to find your

00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:58,990
house and then finally become don't

00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:02,470
think they can hear you because you

00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:05,440
don't even like Franklin way around

00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:09,880
philly my grandpa lost a beloved mind

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:11,260
thank you oh and it finally we've got

00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,780
new york and now in new york is

00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:16,179
interesting new york not only was able

00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:18,550
to rigidly stick to their grid system

00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:20,940
but they built a grade that was unique

00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:23,950
to the layout and landscape of New York

00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:27,309
unique to the content of New York if you

00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:29,290
will and because of that it's very very

00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:31,179
easy just even from looking at the map

00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:32,530
in New York to be able to visualize

00:27:31,179 --> 00:27:35,050
where you are where you need to go and

00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:37,090
how to get there if you're dropped into

00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:39,010
New York and just described with a great

00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:41,620
super quick you'll pretty much be able

00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:43,809
to get around now why do we use grids

00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:46,330
and web design because grids provide

00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:47,559
order from your design order for your

00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:51,190
design and structure for your

00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:53,590
information and the best grades are

00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:55,630
specific 12 your content and your design

00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:59,620
because they are its influence of both

00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:02,590
your content and your design singularity

00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:05,140
is built with these ideas in mind these

00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:08,700
ideals in mind and because of that it

00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:11,679
provides lots and lots of power for you

00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:13,059
but before we go anywhere let's take a

00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:15,030
look at the box model because the box

00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:18,600
models kind of terrible

00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:22,140
so everyone the right box model content

00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:26,460
box that looks familiar yes that is the

00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:29,580
css3 standard box model box model on the

00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:31,800
right border bucks who here eat internet

00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:34,560
explorer for changing the box model into

00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:36,120
I eat hacks for that yes everyone does

00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,580
because we're all front-end developers

00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:42,090
nearing scores terrible what turns out

00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:44,940
they got this right so if we take a look

00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:47,610
at the description for box model that

00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:51,210
yellow bar dividing everything that is a

00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:53,880
fixed height or fixed width and in the

00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:56,070
content box box model patten NGO padding

00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,550
lights and border wits go on the outside

00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:01,470
in border-box box model paddings and

00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:04,500
borders go on the inside in both markets

00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:06,780
down the hub slide so what that means is

00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:08,880
if you're to use content box and I asked

00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:11,790
you to tell me the width of something

00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:16,040
that is twenty-five percent wide with 20

00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:21,030
pixel cuttings and point to and borders

00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:25,380
what would that with be right laughs

00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:27,380
laughs is what that would be with border

00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:30,240
bucks that would be twenty-five percent

00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:32,100
and that makes it possible for us to use

00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,400
fluid grades and that makes it possible

00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:38,550
for us to be able to use a grid system

00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:40,440
in our responsive design need them or

00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:44,040
let them be fluid and not lovely not

00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:48,030
have them be static adapt different so

00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:49,890
let's cheat a little bit of CSS import

00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:52,140
compass will give us all of compasses

00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:54,690
mixes and then we're going to use the

00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:56,940
star selector star before and car after

00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:59,310
to include box sizing porter box on

00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,170
everything now I know someone's going to

00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:04,200
yell at me for using the star selector

00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:06,690
it turns out that the star selector on

00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,270
its own is just as performance as any

00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:12,420
single tag selector so in this case it's

00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:14,760
totally cool and this will change all of

00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:17,360
our box models to water box which means

00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:22,130
we can use a natural box model for every

00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:24,429
that makes us beekeepers so let's get

00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:27,049
start talking about granted singularity

00:30:24,429 --> 00:30:28,460
see you already I'll provide two

00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:29,750
different types of grades allows you to

00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,540
write two different types of birds are

00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:33,950
symmetric grits and asymmetric dress

00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:35,809
symmetric grants are what you're used to

00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:39,260
in things like foundation in bootstrap

00:30:35,809 --> 00:30:43,490
in 960 they are grids where every column

00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:45,770
is the same way so in this example all

00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:50,500
of our columns have a width of 1 and we

00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:53,090
have 12 columns 12 equal sized columns

00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:55,880
butters butters are the pieces that go

00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:59,630
in between is our margin that's fluid as

00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:03,200
well and that is a ratio of gutter with

00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:05,780
to a column of with water so because all

00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,419
of our grids are waiting one hour gutter

00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:10,690
with is one-third and it will be one

00:31:08,419 --> 00:31:14,750
gutter will be one-third of each problem

00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:18,770
and that looks something like this this

00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:20,120
is actually the column left of the 90 60

00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:22,580
credit if you're familiar with nine

00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:26,530
sixty 60 pixel wide columns 20 pics

00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:28,460
along gutters butter is one third column

00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:30,080
asymmetric grits are a little bit

00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:32,090
different placement rates are really

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,640
where the power of singularity comes on

00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:36,549
and where you can start to build grids

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,860
and specific to your content and design

00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:43,520
so we're all familiar with the Holy

00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:45,890
Grail layout the triptych layout for web

00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,799
design to sidebar on the left content in

00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:51,140
the middle and a sidebar on the right

00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:54,610
now while you may have heard me say side

00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:56,929
bars or false constructs and they are

00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:58,760
what we can do is you can set up a grade

00:31:56,929 --> 00:32:01,940
that actually looks like the designer

00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:03,380
can build so you'll need to remember how

00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,630
many columns you need span for each

00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:08,720
different piece we can do that using a

00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:11,780
symmetric rip so this critic sample we

00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:15,350
have three columns we have a column of

00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:17,990
width to a column of which eight and I

00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:20,120
column of with two Gunners are still

00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:25,640
one-third but the thing to remember

00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:28,790
here is this gutter is again still one

00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:32,120
third of a column of water and we have

00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:34,280
our first column is with two so this

00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:37,010
will actually be one sixth of the width

00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:39,770
of our first column I know that kind of

00:32:37,010 --> 00:32:41,660
seems strange but if you take a look at

00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:44,870
what that looks like it kind of makes

00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:47,300
sense I kind of resembles what you would

00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:49,490
expect if you had built call up both

00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,500
actual dibs on top of a 12 column grid

00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:53,090
now singularity you don't need to use a

00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,610
12 Concord you can literally use

00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:57,110
anything you like we're just using this

00:32:55,610 --> 00:33:00,080
as a good example because people are

00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:03,110
generally familiar with 1200 but really

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:05,240
you can use anything you want so that

00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:07,160
grade starts to actually look like that

00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:10,220
magical trip deep holy ground layout

00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:13,310
that we all really liked or our product

00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:15,680
owners really loved and we can do it

00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:19,300
with just three columns instead of all

00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:22,130
of 12 and remember no more stuff

00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:24,800
singularity is what's called a synaptic

00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:28,070
grid system now that's not to say it's

00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:30,620
semantics because it's classes are

00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:32,810
really well named what that actually

00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:35,510
means is it doesn't provide houses at

00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:39,860
all and what you wind up doing is you

00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:41,690
are applying the grid spans I'm the grid

00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:47,420
itself directly to the elements that you

00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:49,820
want on the grid that means that it

00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:53,090
becomes easier to see how grid's change

00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:55,490
and we can use nesting and many queries

00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:58,790
and great point to see how our different

00:33:55,490 --> 00:34:01,010
widgets change as we want them instead

00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:03,170
of getting to rely on looking at the

00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:04,910
HTML injecting classes everywhere which

00:34:03,170 --> 00:34:06,070
we know is super easy and fun to people

00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:09,870
drink

00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:12,250
we can do it straight through all CSS so

00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:13,960
let's all that spinning the group this

00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:17,830
is the example HTML we're going to be

00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:21,490
using for this we got us main plaza

00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:23,530
first class except me we are going to do

00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:25,450
the triptych design like the trick tip

00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:30,490
we're going to do add include grid span

00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:33,700
11 12 and 13 what is that say that says

00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:36,580
I want to span one column starting at

00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:39,580
the first column so it will be using the

00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:41,080
two I want to spend one palm starting at

00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:43,150
the second column you don't want to

00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:46,720
spend one column starting at the third

00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:48,640
column that makes using this great a lot

00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:56,320
easier than the alternative which would

00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:57,730
be spending 21 span 83 and span 2 which

00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,810
is a little bit harder to remember than

00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:03,610
one two three and that's my point

00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:06,130
looking like it looks exactly like when

00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:09,220
we think you look like the lights

00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:11,050
Tammany color is our visualization of

00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:15,430
our grade the red is the actual taste

00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:17,830
pieces work yes and we'll go back but

00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:22,600
all of this code is in our slides online

00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:24,370
afterwards so the point of the code

00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:26,500
isn't for you to be able to pop it down

00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:32,290
now it's free to be able to get inspired

00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:33,250
to go okay it's like the header and this

00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:36,580
is going to get a little bit long

00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:38,710
because we about Bigfoot examples but we

00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:41,500
can also do response great contacts so

00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:44,920
if you're used to having three or four

00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:48,220
baby grid layouts make great points for

00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:49,660
grades we can do that with with

00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:51,220
singularities weapons so we're going to

00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:53,620
start with a 12 column break this is

00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:56,890
building mobile first and we are going

00:35:53,620 --> 00:36:00,850
to add the 28 to grid at 700 pixels

00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:03,520
value I mean up so first we're going to

00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:04,700
span three four then we're going to

00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,890
stand 11

00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:10,190
then we're going to spend six seven and

00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:12,920
then 12 so and what you wind up seeing

00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:14,710
it's easier to visualize as you wind up

00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:17,900
getting something that looks like this

00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:19,550
start with a 12 column greater second

00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:23,270
section is to the left then first then

00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:25,910
middle and then we switch to our trip to

00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:29,210
grid and not only do we get a new grid

00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:30,980
but things move around as well they're

00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:32,660
able to move around because we're using

00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:36,079
what's called the isolation epic style

00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:37,609
and that gives you essentially pulling

00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,980
and pushing that you being used to with

00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:42,200
a normal with a traditional grid system

00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:44,960
baked into how you want to position two

00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,250
great items which is super useful for

00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,390
doing stuff like this what's called

00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:52,520
content choreography again just look at

00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:57,140
worth second section lips second section

00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:59,000
is first one we scratch it goes all the

00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,859
way over there so we're not changing our

00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,079
HTML but because we're using an

00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:05,119
intelligent grid system we are able to

00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:07,190
change the visual ordering without

00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,460
changing our source order middle section

00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:11,990
is still the middle set side selector of

00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,750
second go to the front then he goes back

00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:20,480
it's all topsy-turvy wibbly-wobbly in

00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:22,520
fun we can also desperate so this is the

00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,560
HTML we're going to be using just bear

00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:26,869
with the HTML the pictures look pretty

00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,690
and that's really what matters is to get

00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:32,990
the visualization so your expand 11 12

00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:37,990
13 and we get back grid that weeds like

00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:41,089
that we saw before then we can use the

00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:44,480
lammockson layout mixin is singularity

00:37:41,089 --> 00:37:48,050
is super useful what it says is that

00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:51,920
grid and that cutter variables those are

00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:54,740
global contexts that allows us to know

00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,990
where we are and not need to pass in our

00:37:54,740 --> 00:38:00,200
good definitions every single time to

00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:02,839
get span to specifically tell grits when

00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,750
where we are what Lao will do is buy us

00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,210
a chunk that we can say for this chunk

00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:08,339
of code

00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:09,839
I want you to use something different in

00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:12,540
this case I want you to use an eight

00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:14,720
column grid instead of the 28 to grade

00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:17,640
because we're in the context of 8 and

00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:22,050
then we can do grits bad one it's been

00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:24,330
18 it's been 16 24 and we wind up

00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:28,680
getting something looks like this so we

00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:31,470
now have put a new grid inside of the

00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,599
middle piece this is something important

00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:37,310
with singularity that distinguishes it

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:41,880
from other grid systems has anyone used

00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:43,230
Suzy grid system s us why ok so if those

00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:44,910
people haven't or for those of you who

00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:47,820
are familiar with it something like 960

00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:51,589
all of those current systems I'll work

00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:55,589
based on the thought that your container

00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:58,680
is something fixed even it's fluently

00:38:55,589 --> 00:39:01,650
next and that your grade are pieces of

00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:05,940
that tree to find container so for 960

00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:07,680
each column is 60 pixels plus the 20

00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:11,220
pixels plus the town on the side that

00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:14,550
lines up to 960 its peace it's based on

00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:17,520
the container singularity on the other

00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:19,500
hand works off will be thoughtful there

00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,290
is no contain the container is whatever

00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:24,599
you put it in at the end of the day all

00:39:22,290 --> 00:39:26,849
the thread is is it's a ratio at the

00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:28,980
hook and that is the only assumption

00:39:26,849 --> 00:39:30,990
singularity makes vector grids is that

00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:35,730
what you want is a ratio of one hundred

00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:37,770
percent so what we've done here is we

00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:40,800
have not only changed our current

00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:42,810
context we've changed like the physical

00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,420
type of grip we have changed from an

00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:47,490
asymmetrical grid to a symmetrical grip

00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:50,310
and are able to do this and do this on

00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:54,270
the fly because singularity doesn't make

00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:57,420
that assumption at your routine so we

00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:59,940
wind up having is grids inside that line

00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:02,030
up to the gutters on the outside but do

00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:05,090
it because we've chosen

00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:10,180
and then of course we can nest even

00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:13,100
further down layout 66 column grid and

00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:27,410
we wind up getting something that looks

00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:37,490
like this so whoa one more thank you

00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:38,720
guys very much thank you we have a

00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:40,940
little bit of time for questions if

00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:52,340
anybody wants to ders in writing sir yes

00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:58,190
obvious questions we have microphones hi

00:40:52,340 --> 00:41:01,040
hi so I'm curious is there a way to make

00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:05,600
one of those grits sides fix for example

00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:08,270
3.com grid layout they're not flexible

00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:12,370
so singularity offers this thing called

00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:14,990
output styles which allows you to define

00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:16,580
basically how the CSS code written it

00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:20,150
comes with two different styles float

00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:22,130
and isolation it does not way that you

00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:24,590
would need to do that is through display

00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:26,720
table and if you would like to you can

00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:29,180
write your own output style to work with

00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,710
display table it does not often outputs

00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:32,600
all for that but if you would like to

00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:35,360
have one you are free to write it and

00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:38,920
use the same singularities attack on top

00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:38,920
of it go

00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:49,370
hi Oh looks like you got using you know

00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:52,130
okay 960 no it's not too happy for theme

00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:55,490
that you like to go with oh is it Dean

00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:57,920
agnostic the great thing about working

00:41:55,490 --> 00:42:00,320
with SAS is that for me anyway is that

00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,960
it's really team agnostic duel agnostic

00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:06,830
but lots of running tool that works with

00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:08,870
any lapses won't throw it into it's just

00:42:06,830 --> 00:42:13,820
offering CSS and the same goes for break

00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:18,770
point or or singularity or you don't

00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:20,570
have a preferred but we have a 1400 the

00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:24,350
mighty four themes roar but I'm a little

00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:26,330
bit biased because I read it ah but that

00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:27,980
being said I prefer or because it's

00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:30,800
built from the ground up to use these

00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:33,410
tools and it's super mineralized it

00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,940
doesn't give you anything out of the box

00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:37,240
in fact it strips away a lot of the

00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:40,400
default settings that triple Q's have

00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:45,020
but it is it is built out of the box to

00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,370
support these tools it is not a good

00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,660
view but people who are brand new to

00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:49,370
viewing or if you're really used to a

00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:53,630
mega three it is kind of the empty

00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:55,310
omega-3 basting but these tools that we

00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:56,960
use just because the Roar is optimized

00:42:55,310 --> 00:42:59,480
to use them doesn't mean you can't use

00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,610
them any of the other box okay just a

00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,920
follow-up question do you guys have like

00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:07,730
a working example that you fund at DC

00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:10,970
where you've taken all of your sass

00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:13,820
you've got the default break points but

00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:15,200
it so we can work off something rather

00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:17,300
than I should figure it out from scratch

00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:23,360
no because there are no default rate

00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:26,480
once this totally dependent on the needs

00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:29,240
of the content to net in the project so

00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,620
we don't look at say the iphone ipad

00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:34,270
desktop models

00:43:31,620 --> 00:43:36,490
we're going to set these as break points

00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:39,790
and then move from there we look at the

00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:41,830
content and then to paraphrase Steven a

00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:43,570
ute and start small and you expand your

00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:45,880
browser until the content look like

00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:47,230
then you make a great point and so you

00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:53,950
just do that over and over until it

00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:55,810
looks good okay so on that's pretty easy

00:43:53,950 --> 00:43:57,850
to pick on foundations for it since I

00:43:55,810 --> 00:44:00,910
think for all the attention is very

00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:03,940
old-fashioned but you Susie looks to me

00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:06,700
like Susie pretty much does everything

00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:09,880
you're doing and explicit asymmetric

00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:11,740
ready to begin your pits and bars passes

00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:15,880
through so if I remember okay look this

00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:19,870
is the tutors his name is 22 you suffer

00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:22,270
28 so what can you do a similarity can't

00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:25,900
do a sushi or city upcoming Susie next

00:44:22,270 --> 00:44:30,600
so I actually worked on Susie next um

00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:33,550
and a lot of the original for underlying

00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:37,110
features of Susie next are based on this

00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:39,460
version of singularity that being said

00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:42,010
Susie next to significantly in flux

00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:43,540
right now so I don't know how it's going

00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:44,980
to bind it coming out and it is going to

00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:47,650
wind up being nearly as flexible

00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:50,260
singularity as for the current version

00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:52,840
of Susie Susie just simply isn't

00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:54,670
anywhere near as flexible as singularity

00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:56,260
and it makes the assumption that your

00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:59,380
grades are based on your container

00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:02,230
that's the setting your columns to a

00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:04,300
with 4m let believes the default and

00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:06,640
your gutters to a with one end is the

00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:08,560
default that makes that puts you into

00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,800
the mental model that it makes the

00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,510
assumptions that that what you are doing

00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:16,420
is you're basing a great baseball for

00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:17,980
desktop sighs Susie is really desktop

00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:21,640
car stereo system that may happen to

00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:23,380
write its CSS mobile-first singularity

00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:25,600
on the other hand is built and designed

00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:28,240
to be mobile first designed to take

00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,160
advantage of pre-processing it is a

00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,319
truly

00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,329
we process your first great system where

00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:35,460
Suzy is kind of an old-fashioned root

00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:37,819
system turned into a CSS preprocessor

00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:39,630
but one thing that you can do with

00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:41,569
singularity like one's really very

00:45:39,630 --> 00:45:45,930
specific example is that you can do

00:45:41,569 --> 00:45:47,640
ratio based grids that don't have a

00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:53,220
common common denominator like something

00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:57,890
based on ratios if that floats your boat

00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:57,890
a designer or not that's possible with

00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:11,309
chips also list yes I check out salsa

00:46:06,329 --> 00:46:14,160
he's actually part of Susan skin again

00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:16,710
all of the CSS we brought all of the

00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:19,020
good systems of all good systems not are

00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:22,289
quite nearly as flexible singularity and

00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:26,579
they all work on a similar mental model

00:46:22,289 --> 00:46:28,589
of your final container or a singularity

00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:30,720
is very different genetic totally

00:46:28,589 --> 00:46:32,640
ignores your container has no concept

00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:38,940
different container making it in the end

00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:43,950
much more flexible system thank you very

00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:50,779
much i love sess great work it's all

00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:55,470
great vision lens seekers my question is

00:46:50,779 --> 00:46:58,890
why if elements of their own creative i

00:46:55,470 --> 00:47:02,220
directly is there a hundred just for

00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:05,609
gutters it's been separate or something

00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:08,039
else so that background grade was just a

00:47:05,609 --> 00:47:10,530
visualization of your grid and it's not

00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:17,100
an actual grid

00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:20,690
truth be told uh base grits I don't

00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:24,420
necessarily use them on all projects but

00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:27,770
having a grid system is good for the

00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:30,090
widgets that you're working with as for

00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:32,850
why have a background grid when you can

00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:36,110
just kind of make one as you wish it's a

00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:38,850
very good question from the answer is

00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:40,290
you might find out when you have a

00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:43,470
flexible current system at singularity

00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:57,000
that you don't need one and edit that

00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:59,310
and that may be a construct of page hi

00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,400
this is crystal a great point it's like

00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:04,140
a very model with the approach to grab

00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,180
everything into a single mixing this

00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:11,420
morning if you considered looking into

00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:16,440
more than one for better readability or

00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:18,300
excited to go with the way I don't

00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:21,660
really feel like it is that model if

00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:23,700
they get approached its if I were to do

00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:33,450
it to break it apart i'm not sure

00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:36,810
exactly example we have called it

00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:40,170
meeting with food if you written for 60

00:48:36,810 --> 00:48:45,300
use three seconds great oh absolutely

00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:46,950
we've got yes so inside a great point

00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:51,870
you've also infinite that respond to

00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:54,540
syntax which is an older project that is

00:48:51,870 --> 00:48:57,950
been since move rolled into singularity

00:48:54,540 --> 00:49:00,090
and what at great point right sorry and

00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:02,340
what you wind up doing is instead of

00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:04,590
defining variables instead of defining

00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,370
any queries using variables you defend

00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:07,680
them using straight

00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:10,290
so the semantics that you wind up having

00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:14,760
or something like that include respond

00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:17,760
to navik inline navigation but that

00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:20,370
being said to your question great points

00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:23,700
monolith this Scism is a word i'm going

00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:26,280
to make up right now breakpoint is

00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:27,690
designed as it's under a system that you

00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,450
can use out of the box that also works

00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:31,740
as an API so one of our users has

00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:34,920
created something called breakpoint

00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:37,440
slice which is a sin tax on topic

00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:39,210
breakpoint batting provide sense and

00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,040
tactical sugar that he really likes that

00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:44,760
at the end of the day calls great point

00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:47,760
so your if mini with media query or

00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:49,410
mixing but that can do is you can have

00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,000
that mix in and then in that mix in call

00:49:49,410 --> 00:49:53,790
break point so breakpoint kind of

00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,680
becomes a media query API I never stuck

00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:58,230
me I use it for the convert to emma's or

00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:00,330
the other things am I specific I think

00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:02,640
our work was actually based respond to

00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:08,850
you guys did so thanks for the dress

00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:11,250
form I we did things can singulair into

00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:14,400
a fixed-width gutters or is it always

00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:16,740
ratios things with gutters on our

00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:21,720
function of padding and what we have

00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:25,320
found out as we have worked with with

00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:29,190
great systems and grid grid frameworks

00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:31,680
is that padding is really hard to keep

00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:35,130
track of and it compounds very very

00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:38,730
quickly so we did not include a fixed

00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:41,910
gutter output style and singularity but

00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:44,550
like the question of fixed sidebars and

00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:46,470
fluid stuff for an output style if you

00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:48,390
would like to make one you are free to

00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:50,310
make one and we encourage if you want to

00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:52,830
use fixed gutters for you to make one

00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:55,800
yourself so the mental model works the

00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:59,220
way that you expect that but it's doable

00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:01,430
with output styles or with um with their

00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:07,440
an output sounds we just have a good one

00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:09,810
if you were one of systems when you tell

00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:12,390
me to be found policy alarians and

00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:18,090
that's maintainer singularity how would

00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:20,930
you refuse that the biggest the biggest

00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:23,640
thing with singularity which is biggest

00:51:20,930 --> 00:51:27,150
problem the singularity is it's a very

00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:29,460
large and uncle shaped from other great

00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:32,100
systems other grid system really take

00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:34,440
the concept of page two part whereas

00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:37,680
singularity totally destroys the concept

00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:38,970
of a page which grits for grids so the

00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:41,070
biggest issue I found when explaining

00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:44,970
singularity is that you're not making

00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:46,830
fruits you are building ratios that wind

00:51:44,970 --> 00:51:51,840
up writing out something that uses that

00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:54,060
resembles a good and I don't it's a

00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:59,250
tough problem for us as for me as

00:51:54,060 --> 00:52:00,750
maintainer because it's hard to it's

00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:02,070
hard to explain to someone and I've

00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:05,970
actually different trainings on this

00:52:02,070 --> 00:52:08,790
this week where someone understands what

00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:11,490
singularity is doing and then like the

00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:12,900
mental block between I understand what

00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:16,230
you're doing but it's also not what I

00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:18,540
think it is that's really somewhat hard

00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:20,220
to get over sometimes but I don't know

00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:22,740
how to fix that in singularity because

00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:25,080
that's like the core system that

00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:27,650
singularity secret sauce is that it's

00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:29,640
not page grid system it is a web-based

00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:31,920
system

00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:36,140
that's probably the worst singly

00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:36,140
singular uses a totally new mental model

00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:45,569
I've been the nuisance ask a couple

00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:47,700
sacks responsive sites in oradell 3 or 4

00:52:45,569 --> 00:52:49,260
i've been using the year respond to

00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:53,789
which I like being able to put the

00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:57,720
response of great Maxum selector but I

00:52:53,789 --> 00:53:00,349
got to a site where broke down and who's

00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:03,750
because it was a front page had

00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:06,150
JavaScript changing things on the fly

00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:08,730
and so I found that in order for

00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:11,369
everything to ihop both horizontally and

00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:14,670
vertically as the screen width is

00:53:11,369 --> 00:53:17,099
changing devices are changing you

00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:19,260
counted with the fact that the content

00:53:17,099 --> 00:53:22,470
was being replaced in the paint things

00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:26,309
were changing with JavaScript I had to

00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:28,859
refer to sort of basically styling with

00:53:26,309 --> 00:53:31,980
in JavaScript having it measure wits and

00:53:28,859 --> 00:53:35,490
fights and boys ESS that way so I guess

00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:40,049
my question is did I not try hard enough

00:53:35,490 --> 00:53:42,210
or is having the Dom changed out from

00:53:40,049 --> 00:53:48,869
under you a legitimate reason to do it

00:53:42,210 --> 00:53:52,769
that way how can you say these empty

00:53:48,869 --> 00:53:55,589
project I would definitely try to employ

00:53:52,769 --> 00:54:07,859
writing actual CSS styling which on the

00:53:55,589 --> 00:54:10,289
script that said baby but yeah I would

00:54:07,859 --> 00:54:13,290
do that as a last resort yes sir boy I

00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:17,550
agree generally speaking I find

00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:19,200
I tried very very hard not to ever do

00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:23,960
any styling through JavaScript and

00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:25,890
instead of pipe classes and respond to

00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:27,660
specifically won't help with that

00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:31,500
because all that respond to break point

00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:33,660
as a media queries so if you're having

00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:36,210
issues with your other CSS I'm not sure

00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:37,440
I don't think great convo respond to you

00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:41,510
would have ever been the solution that

00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,510
you're needing to deal with as you can

00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:48,930
so so I think what you should be trying

00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:51,440
to do is find classes and see if you can

00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:54,630
picture problems using CSS or

00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:58,890
potentially creating more useful budgets

00:54:54,630 --> 00:55:01,500
and more more predictable patterns and

00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:04,170
then that will reduce that will allow

00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:06,950
you to write 30 CSS I mean we push back

00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:10,620
is just that the class cannot replace

00:55:06,950 --> 00:55:16,470
measuring with and can applying a margin

00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:18,750
with value or percent right so if you

00:55:16,470 --> 00:55:19,920
mean if what you're saying is there are

00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:22,950
something that you need to do in

00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:30,330
javascript and CSS Kent then yes that's

00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:37,500
true and I completely agree to give your

00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:39,090
diligence you guys I'm mostly back in my

00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:40,740
teens mostly back in it more and more

00:55:39,090 --> 00:55:43,050
projects requiring more funding work

00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:45,330
it's so exerting using compass and sass

00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:46,860
and so on totally new singularity and

00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:49,470
great points on beginner they came to an

00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:51,150
intermediate session this is really

00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:53,010
exciting Lee to some awesome stuff to do

00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:55,950
too much so fast with what I'm used to

00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:58,260
do you have I can obviously you know

00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:59,880
search for resources but you guys are

00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:01,320
experienced to know what's good does

00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:04,110
anything pop out is really good place

00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:08,190
you know to go from here continue to

00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:11,030
look if you're there's a contributing to

00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:12,200
about a year ago that

00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:16,190
really great content which there is

00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:19,310
fairly a green called the SAS wife and I

00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:21,920
think maintainer start to not forget

00:56:19,310 --> 00:56:27,140
pretty soon probably join immediately

00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:29,420
because and there are a lot of resources

00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:31,430
on SAS now I can't think another one

00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:36,650
that's you know that are good but a good

00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:38,450
google search for any particular generic

00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:40,580
searches and stuff or others the ball

00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:43,660
one particular anything particularly you

00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:50,000
wanted to defend assassin general or

00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:54,620
took them to too much so these just the

00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:56,480
documentation again and they're very

00:56:54,620 --> 00:57:00,280
well talk to you because I refused to

00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,280
launch them with active documentation o

00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:10,580
our spring if you have used content

00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:13,430
Bacchus and which is I think a copy do

00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:19,360
element queries media query response

00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:21,940
decisive element and just doing things

00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:31,820
singularity can kind of help you do that

00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:34,130
because you have sir vector textual so

00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:37,160
as Perseus similarity isn't going

00:57:34,130 --> 00:57:40,850
helping element styles helm queries it

00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:42,860
might help you to write better grades

00:57:40,850 --> 00:57:45,010
for when you do have an olive tree but

00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:47,980
it won't help specific element queries

00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:50,510
as for element pries itself and

00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:52,460
generally speaking there something that

00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:54,590
are very very hard I've written

00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:56,559
inquiries to a responsive image solution

00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:59,199
I have

00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:02,109
and what essentially amounts of element

00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:05,519
breeze and one of the big issues with

00:58:02,109 --> 00:58:08,589
omen queries is lots lots of elements

00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:10,059
don't get sizes until you've put

00:58:08,589 --> 00:58:12,999
something into them and if you're trying

00:58:10,059 --> 00:58:14,890
to query what their size is before the

00:58:12,999 --> 00:58:18,430
content is in there that it requires to

00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:21,430
know what size it is this kind of

00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:23,469
chicken and egg and that's that is the

00:58:21,430 --> 00:58:24,789
perpetual issue with Roman queries sighs

00:58:23,469 --> 00:58:29,880
in fact that they can't actually have to

00:58:24,789 --> 00:58:33,519
need to clean HTML or in browser so you

00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:36,759
can use them if you like I would as much

00:58:33,519 --> 00:58:43,650
as I hate to say don't because they're

00:58:36,759 --> 00:58:47,469
super useful don't not reliable right

00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:51,189
just I i try to do pretty much as much

00:58:47,469 --> 00:58:58,779
as i can in put the standard tools so

00:58:51,189 --> 00:59:00,670
HTML CSS thanks please allow from this

00:58:58,779 --> 00:59:06,849
isn't for me it's for a fernan seriously

00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:11,650
but singularity and dot sir you know

00:59:06,849 --> 00:59:14,410
anything those tools our back-end

00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:17,679
agnostic so as long as your front-end

00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:21,519
developer is able to work in a real

00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:23,529
person environment or really if they're

00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:25,150
able to install ruby on their site which

00:59:23,529 --> 00:59:27,009
is Ruby installer or on their local

00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:29,109
machine or installer before work then

00:59:27,009 --> 00:59:30,699
they'll be able to use sass and compile

00:59:29,109 --> 00:59:32,829
as long as they're able to compile sass

00:59:30,699 --> 00:59:34,569
and use compass will be able to you

00:59:32,829 --> 00:59:40,209
singularity and break point the output

00:59:34,569 --> 00:59:43,390
of either visas just CSS so as long as

00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:46,299
provided surgery found some goals that

00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:48,880
is fine doc there the rest is pretty

00:59:46,299 --> 00:59:52,270
much just write what it is the other

00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:54,970
thing is way that we work in Drupal is

00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:57,220
we don't use Drupal to compile our sets

00:59:54,970 --> 00:59:59,980
you compile our SAS through our previous

00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:01,510
life right so maybe the search you

00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:04,300
should be looking for isn't necessarily

01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:09,070
how to integrate dotnet with SAS but

01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:10,390
rather how to author SAS in the on the

01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:18,910
operating system environment that you're

01:00:10,390 --> 01:00:21,400
doing your local come on with the sauce

01:00:18,910 --> 01:00:23,880
I've notice that like inside of media

01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:27,090
queries it's a lot more to use a mix it

01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:31,180
isn't I have troubles with nixon's and

01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:33,730
like whatever the the ones cuz

01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:36,340
extendable takes time yeah have you

01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:39,100
since you're putting media queries in

01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:41,650
the code like multiple places it so in

01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:44,230
the context of what you're doing how do

01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:47,110
you have you worked with those kind of

01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:49,540
things I don't think that there is a

01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:51,220
typo constraint on make sense but there

01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:54,700
certainly is with extendable okay maybe

01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:59,100
see so wrong extendable says you can't

01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:59,100
extend the selector inside a media query

01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:05,530
so if you define your extendable outside

01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:07,120
given query you can't extend it with it

01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:09,310
one key to find it within the media

01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:16,770
query then you can extend it I think

01:01:09,310 --> 01:01:21,040
that's confusing so I try to avoid back

01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:23,020
so I have a duplicate definition of my

01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:25,720
extendable where i define it as a as a

01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:28,330
nixon first then apply it to silent

01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:29,980
extendable class then use it i can

01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:32,470
extend it when I'm not it's at the media

01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:36,160
query and I can use the mix it in okay

01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:39,940
yeah you do that a lot yeah so that

01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:42,130
works right up yeah to comment on that

01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:44,950
bike I saw talk yesterday we are using

01:01:42,130 --> 01:01:46,030
rights holders under sense and so if you

01:01:44,950 --> 01:01:47,710
since you put all your expenses

01:01:46,030 --> 01:01:50,680
placeholders and then include them in

01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:53,110
partial like the way your problem media

01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:54,460
queries to the company asks but if you

01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:56,820
have like you know like here's a big

01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:58,200
chunk of like p.m. i like my

01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:59,760
be free point thing and then you have

01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,800
your little like we can point select my

01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,110
menu needs to breathe but if you have

01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:07,320
like yours I'd pick up spray quiet you

01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:08,880
could have you can include a partial all

01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:14,310
your place holders and every big break

01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:17,790
point it depends on the product problem

01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:19,740
you're so yeah project I'm just a large

01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:22,890
layout somehow need to extend that that

01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:24,720
could work I think though that that's

01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:26,220
probably what you're going to extend

01:02:24,720 --> 01:02:27,750
very often because it's usually

01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:31,410
something he defined once and use once

01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:33,720
rather than most most of the time when i

01:02:31,410 --> 01:02:36,600
use placeholder selectors they are four

01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:40,230
things that will not be changing

01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:42,690
depending upon media queries so I don't

01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:44,880
use collectors for grades for example

01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:47,970
I'll use his holder sector for font

01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:50,550
definitions and four colors and for busy

01:02:47,970 --> 01:02:52,380
partying and stuff won't pack and style

01:02:50,550 --> 01:02:54,570
guide attempting them style abiding type

01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:56,430
things and not to change very much based

01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:58,470
on media queries and the changes or

01:02:56,430 --> 01:03:10,800
tweets that you would need to a soldier

01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:11,940
centers for anyway the other thing you

01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,530
can do is you can use media queries

01:03:11,940 --> 01:03:15,240
inside that reflected inside of

01:03:13,530 --> 01:03:19,490
placeholder selectors that get extended

01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:19,490
and that kind of solves that issue

01:03:31,810 --> 01:03:38,630
this is more question ikaw a useful with

01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:44,420
it seems like the biggest assumption of

01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:45,860
similarity is self-similar fractal and I

01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:47,450
was wondering buddy without your way to

01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:51,590
create kind of a complexity theory

01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:56,540
approach not sure I entirely understand

01:03:51,590 --> 01:04:10,910
the question oh just the idea that your

01:03:56,540 --> 01:04:12,640
own page they have similar properties no

01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:19,580
matter where the great place in venice

01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:23,930
is higher so nesting is nesting nesting

01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:26,240
is not like the central philosophy

01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:28,340
singularity was belong nesting is at by

01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:31,880
part nesting and the way that nesting

01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:35,450
happens is a byproduct of singularities

01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:38,330
non page assumption so we didn't go from

01:04:35,450 --> 01:04:41,270
the top let's be able to do the most

01:04:38,330 --> 01:04:45,110
intricate think out we went from let's

01:04:41,270 --> 01:04:47,750
just not assume a static page and in

01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:50,000
whom there that's the layout mix in that

01:04:47,750 --> 01:04:51,800
I show was one of the last things we

01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:57,800
added to similarity before actually

01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:59,480
launched so I don't think I think the

01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:02,350
answer to your question is no we didn't

01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:02,350
do that okay

01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:12,530
hi I was wondering about the great

01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:16,600
points model and is it just an API three

01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:16,600
points modules a terrible reception okay

01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:25,640
also the picture module is that another

01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:28,160
sort of using the same concepts that in

01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:31,970
a module for pink and download it so to

01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:34,550
me the big the big issue with both X

01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:36,200
module and break point module is they're

01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:39,010
both especially another inference engine

01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:43,250
record which are both Drupal modules

01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:45,290
aspects rap is that they are both they

01:05:43,250 --> 01:05:47,060
were both designed and predicated on the

01:05:45,290 --> 01:05:49,130
assumption that your site will have four

01:05:47,060 --> 01:05:50,810
break points or basically device great

01:05:49,130 --> 01:05:54,950
points in those device breakpoints

01:05:50,810 --> 01:05:57,730
probably our iPhone and that is just the

01:05:54,950 --> 01:06:00,650
wrong assumption to make when we build

01:05:57,730 --> 01:06:03,470
responsive websites we use 20 30 40

01:06:00,650 --> 01:06:06,410
break points and the assumption that a

01:06:03,470 --> 01:06:08,000
all those great points belong in an API

01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:10,430
and then be referenced about other

01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:12,230
things and be that those great points

01:06:10,430 --> 01:06:14,660
are things that would be useful even if

01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:18,859
you put them in it's a little bit silly

01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:22,190
in my my opinion on the conscious alien

01:06:18,859 --> 01:06:23,869
so excited it was both those were really

01:06:22,190 --> 01:06:26,800
like designed for a very specific use

01:06:23,869 --> 01:06:29,240
case in a very specific use case wrong

01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:31,340
right now too strong it doesn't follow

01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:33,950
best practices and in fact the practices

01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:35,869
at follows our haven't been the best

01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:42,560
practices for years now well it doesn't

01:06:35,869 --> 01:06:53,119
hold up when you look at it a while ago

01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:54,530
it made sense that we only have you've

01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:59,270
got a system from anthonys device

01:06:54,530 --> 01:07:04,000
frequencies just going it already has so

01:06:59,270 --> 01:07:04,000
try to be device agnostic future

01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:16,820
your content should look a device in the

01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:23,030
given characteristics push back on

01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:25,400
picture little bit all those if you have

01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:31,160
included breakpoints you're still

01:07:25,400 --> 01:07:33,320
serving a smaller size I mean not saying

01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:35,300
that response images aren't that idea I

01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:37,010
am saying the implementation of the

01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:40,280
drupal module picture and the juve

01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:41,990
module breakpoint is poorly done I agree

01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:43,490
that we need responsible images I don't

01:07:41,990 --> 01:07:45,890
believe that the picture element with

01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:47,180
the breakpoint module the picture module

01:07:45,890 --> 01:08:01,400
in the gradebook module are the

01:07:47,180 --> 01:08:03,950
connection born out for instance so

01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:06,110
given that how do you then create

01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:08,900
resized images with aidan Drupal

01:08:06,110 --> 01:08:12,110
specifically for the organic break point

01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:15,020
shooters so I have created a module of

01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:17,090
borealis for eons responsive images it

01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:18,380
uses helmet based media queries which

01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:19,550
means it will work for about eighty

01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:22,400
percent of what you want but it won't

01:08:19,550 --> 01:08:23,990
work for be instances where something

01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:26,150
needs to be sized based on the inline

01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:27,830
content inside of it generally like

01:08:26,150 --> 01:08:29,810
blank sliders and stuff like that but

01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:32,990
for the eighty percent of use cases

01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:34,460
where that does work uses element

01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:35,570
queries at a depth of all behind scenes

01:08:34,460 --> 01:08:37,640
and you don't need to choose what

01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:40,520
different styles you say i want this

01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:42,860
style to be responsive and then just use

01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:45,080
that image file and you'll get borealis

01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:47,660
and no getting responsive images based

01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:50,060
on Elm occurs which means you can use

01:08:47,660 --> 01:08:51,380
the same image multiple places on your

01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:53,759
site and have those images be at

01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:56,670
different points

01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:59,549
that is a preferred solution to

01:08:56,670 --> 01:09:02,519
responsive images in Drupal because it's

01:08:59,549 --> 01:09:04,319
a million and a half times more user for

01:09:02,519 --> 01:09:06,480
all technically pictures user

01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:08,730
friendliness is zero so I think it's

01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:13,769
infinitely more user pointing then

01:09:08,730 --> 01:09:15,719
picture element I know actually this but

01:09:13,769 --> 01:09:17,099
it's much more user friendly and it

01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:20,039
works off of helaman queries instead of

01:09:17,099 --> 01:09:21,299
high scoring points for the twenty

01:09:20,039 --> 01:09:24,539
percent of the time that it doesn't work

01:09:21,299 --> 01:09:26,639
then you need to use a picture fills up

01:09:24,539 --> 01:09:29,339
a district solution that is based on

01:09:26,639 --> 01:09:33,630
viewport picture Phil is one of them it

01:09:29,339 --> 01:09:35,670
is not the only one and here we are we

01:09:33,630 --> 01:09:40,650
losing through the module or we just

01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:42,869
actually doing it right so like what we

01:09:40,650 --> 01:09:44,339
tend to do is we don't use the modules

01:09:42,869 --> 01:09:46,199
for drought we don't use modules for

01:09:44,339 --> 01:09:47,460
JavaScript libraries we use the

01:09:46,199 --> 01:09:50,369
JavaScript libraries as we have much

01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:51,839
more control over them another similar

01:09:50,369 --> 01:09:54,510
examples we don't use the flex slider

01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:56,579
module we have we use flex slider the

01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:59,389
script because we have more control over

01:09:56,579 --> 01:10:05,250
it and it's actually easier to work with

01:09:59,389 --> 01:10:06,929
so so like and the other thing with

01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:08,639
responsive images is right now every

01:10:06,929 --> 01:10:10,949
single thing is because there is no

01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:13,110
standard so saying picture is the

01:10:10,949 --> 01:10:15,000
end-all and be-all solution because it

01:10:13,110 --> 01:10:19,230
might get him even though chrome refuses

01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:23,460
to edit control at the moment pick your

01:10:19,230 --> 01:10:25,920
favorite I picture as its place so does

01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:28,769
borealis picture module I don't believe

01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:30,989
is the correct solution that doesn't you

01:10:28,769 --> 01:10:34,280
picture Phil isn't a good solution but I

01:10:30,989 --> 01:10:38,420
don't believe picture logical solution

01:10:34,280 --> 01:10:38,420
those whose fault take a look at girls

01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:45,090
is that it we end if I of our time but

01:10:41,250 --> 01:10:47,480
we wrap and answer more questions will

01:10:45,090 --> 01:11:17,880
stand here forever forever and ever

01:10:47,480 --> 01:11:20,490
thank you this is wei zheng calm and

01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:25,320
it's got the basic syntax tough compass

01:11:20,490 --> 01:11:30,720
tylorg is the compass website and that

01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:54,630
has usage for all of its mixings my blog

01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:58,110
has yeah my blog has stuff you guys okay

01:11:54,630 --> 01:12:03,710
so go way you have you want to see

01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:03,710
