Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: THE ZEN OF HTML PROTOTYPING & DESIGNING IN THE BROWSER
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	OVERVIEW:

Responsive design is the new normal. As the web moves forward to embrace more mobile devices and new development technologies, the classic "PDF" wireframe becomes less relevant. An entire online experience can no longer be communicated to developers and clients in single pages and static documents, and a new process must emerge to take its place. Enter the HTML prototype. Using HTML to create "living wireframes" enables the design team at Lullabot to create quick, iterative solutions to complex UI problems. In this session, I will discuss how Lullabot uses HTML prototypes to solve design challenges, present a more complete user experience to clients, and create an HTML structure for themers and front-end developers. Since HTML prototyping and responsive design is still very much the "Wild West," I will also discuss several options for designers that may best fit their specific needs.

WHO IS THIS SESSION FOR?

Designers (who need to know why they should make the switch, and how to sell it to their organization or their client)
Front-End Developers / Themers (who wish to work with designers to create a front-end experience based on HTML prototypes)
Project Managers (who want to learn how to schedule and manage HTML prototyping)
Clients / Managers (who want to understand the prototyping process, and what to expect from their teams or vendors)
Anyone (as HTML prototyping becomes as standard as SEO or QA testing, everyone on the site-building team will benefit from learning more)
TOPICS COVERED & TAKE-AWAYS:

The ever-evolving HTML Prototyping process
The unique challenge of enterprise-level responsive design and why static wireframes don't work
Using a framework (Zurb, Bootstrap) vs. using a home-brewed prototype
Separating UX from creative design
Using prototypes and browser design to bridge the gap between "Designer" and "Themer"
Design Comps, Style Tiles, Element Collages, HTML Style Guides
Working in a team setting
Pros & Cons of HTML prototyping
How prototypes work in a Drupal specific environment

so hello everyone welcome to Portland of

00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:08,069
you guys are really enjoying drupalcon I

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,679
know I love Portland I've been here a

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:14,250
few times and liked the food and beer

00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,949
here is amazing so like I'm just really

00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,140
excited about that um it's also crazy

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,820
that there's so many of you guys and you

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,300
speak in the microphone play this

00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,949
microphone yes 30 there's so many of you

00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,560
guys here to see this this is crazy I

00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:30,300
thought there'd be like five people

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,000
showing up for this and because it's not

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,790
like core development so this is awesome

00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,860
um so I'm going to try to keep things

00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,870
pretty short and to the point since I'm

00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,829
sure everybody's got beer plans

00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,450
afterwards yeah or we can we can just

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:49,559
talk about brewing beer instead if you

00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:51,510
won so this is the Zen of HTML

00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:55,739
prototyping and designing working

00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:58,500
wireframes and the browser so my name is

00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,920
josh Josh Riggs I am a senior user

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:04,229
experience designer at lolla but if you

00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,500
haven't yet come by and see us in the

00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,060
expo hall we did have some really

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,560
awesome screen printed posters that we

00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,380
were handing out i'm not sure if they're

00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,409
still available but we have all kinds of

00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:18,000
goodies and you know we're just a fun

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:20,820
group of people so come by talk to us

00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,920
and hang out with us if you're not

00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,420
familiar with all about we're an

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,509
interactive strategy design and

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:30,720
development company we of course

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,490
specialize in Drupal and most of our

00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,890
work involves creating large scale

00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:37,520
responsive websites for enterprise

00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,659
clients with very very specific needs

00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,759
this of course creates a really unique

00:01:39,659 --> 00:01:44,579
design and user experience challenge for

00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,970
us and this presentation is basically

00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:49,920
going to be what I've learned and what

00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:52,259
we learned as a team from the mistakes

00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,549
and successes that we've had in creating

00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:58,560
wireframes and HTML prototypes so I have

00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:01,439
kind of four fundamental goals that I'm

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,869
hoping to accomplish today the first is

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,659
to remind us of why we actually

00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:09,179
wireframe in the first place why is it

00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,420
in the design process I want to convince

00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,660
you guys that static wire frames are

00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,240
useless

00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:18,350
and creating HTML prototypes are the

00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:20,640
bee's knees I want to show you guys that

00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:23,700
getting started with prototyping is

00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,690
pretty easy and I want to talk about

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,460
some of the options that you have

00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,340
available and then I want to talk about

00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:33,000
how prototyping fits into a modern

00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:36,870
responsive web process and how to get

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,520
your team and your clients on board so I

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,810
have a couple disclaimers the first one

00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,520
is that what I'm going to tell you is

00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,620
not a be all end all set in stone

00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,210
process it's a constantly evolving

00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:49,980
process it's largely trial and error

00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:53,100
it's not going to cure cancer it's it's

00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,370
not going to like shoot rainbows it's

00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:58,350
gonna be I'm going to discuss basically

00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,670
things that I've done and things that

00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,590
have been a success for me in the real

00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:04,490
world i'm also going to discuss some

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:07,380
things that haven't worked so well

00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:09,030
disclaimer to is that i am a designer I

00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,910
come from kind of the old school web

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:14,010
design days when the job of a web

00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:16,980
designer included user experience

00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:20,550
information architecture wireframing

00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,930
design comps HTML all that stuff and out

00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,850
of today that front end development has

00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:26,430
gotten really really extremely complex

00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:29,010
and so now that it's it's own

00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:31,080
specialization I tend to focus mostly on

00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,190
user experience in design but i still

00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,700
have solid front and development

00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:37,170
background we have our own front of

00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,600
development team at loll about that

00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:42,150
handles a lot of like the really really

00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:44,880
detailed stuff so i'm going to keep this

00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:46,890
at kind of a higher level ten thousand

00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,250
view talk 10,000 foot view talk excuse

00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:52,670
me focus on more why we should adopt

00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:55,470
HTML prototyping into the design process

00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:57,200
and of course if you want to talk to me

00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,250
some more please find me at drupalcon

00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,239
i'll probably talking your ear off about

00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:05,580
it so first thing i want to talk about

00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:08,100
is what's the difference between

00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,770
wireframing versus prototyping versus

00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,980
HTML prototyping you've probably heard

00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,630
these terms used interchangeably

00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:18,959
wireframes typically refer to static

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:21,750
documents that describe the actions of a

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,360
website or an application they can be

00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:25,520
made with you know illustrator fireworks

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,590
on the graph

00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,110
balsamic I I've even seen some Microsoft

00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:36,330
Paint wireframes and they were different

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:39,270
Theory horribly ugly um they can also be

00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,460
sketch on paper and then in contrast

00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,889
HTML prototypes are clickable demos of

00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,990
websites or apps that are actually made

00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:48,569
with good HTML and CSS and they run in a

00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:55,110
browser so since we cleared those things

00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:59,819
up never seen this movie yet me either

00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:02,759
so so a long time ago in a galaxy far

00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:05,819
far away or maybe it was last week at an

00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:07,349
agency near you we used wire frames as a

00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:10,349
first step in our design and layout

00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:12,840
process and it makes sense it seems like

00:05:10,349 --> 00:05:14,340
the right thing to do because you know

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,460
we would make a blueprint before we

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:22,770
build the house right a website is in

00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:25,050
the freakin house um as websites become

00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:28,979
more complex and responsive static

00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:33,210
wireframes just don't cut it anymore so

00:05:28,979 --> 00:05:35,430
in our hero the HTML prototype or if

00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,719
you're Sally young it's HTML she's

00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:38,969
British and she makes fun of me every

00:05:36,719 --> 00:05:43,379
time I say HTML so if you know any

00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:45,120
British people its HTML um so this is a

00:05:43,379 --> 00:05:47,810
static or excuse me this is a screenshot

00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:50,009
of a working responsive HTML prototype

00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:54,300
looks like a wireframe but it's made

00:05:50,009 --> 00:05:56,940
with valid HTML and CSS I tend to use

00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:59,219
ZURB foundation or create my own HTML

00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:03,509
prototypes and they're completely

00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:05,819
responsive cool so let's talk brief

00:06:03,509 --> 00:06:07,289
about why we wire frame why do we do

00:06:05,819 --> 00:06:09,539
this thing in the process in the first

00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:12,870
place it's been part of the design

00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:14,520
process for a really long time and how

00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,610
many of you guys have created a wire

00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:20,279
frame of some sort in your career that's

00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:24,120
pretty much everybody it's like as

00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:27,389
common as beards in Portland so why do

00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:30,319
we do it we need something cheap and

00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:34,620
ugly and this is not a your mom joke

00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,849
what one goal for wire framing is that

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,069
we need to create something cheap and

00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:41,759
ugly that helps clients focus on making

00:06:38,069 --> 00:06:44,310
good UI decisions we need something

00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,569
cheap meaning lightweight and quickly

00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:47,909
produced not spending a whole lot of

00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:50,550
time on it an ugly meaning mostly devoid

00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:53,039
of style and they should be somewhat

00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:54,750
disposable even though we're supposed to

00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,630
be cheap and ugly with our wireframes

00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:00,630
don't you guys like me have sat at your

00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:07,159
computer and like torture yourself over

00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:07,159
pixel perfection on a wire frame come on

00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:13,349
in the design process we need to

00:07:11,009 --> 00:07:15,830
separate the user experience from which

00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:18,300
is the layout the content structure

00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:21,120
component hierarchy functionality etc

00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,789
from the pretty stuff the typography the

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,630
colors the textures photography

00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:30,120
illustration those two should be

00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:33,060
separated so that we can focus on

00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,099
getting each one right in my opinion we

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,020
shouldn't be talking about color texture

00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:40,229
and typography when we're reviewing

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,849
wireframes so assuming that you've

00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:43,949
already done the work and in your

00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:45,779
process to understand purpose to

00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:48,209
understand content and structure and

00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:53,879
priority wire frames are just a way to

00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:55,080
further clarify and test things so if

00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:57,180
you've gone this long creating static

00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,099
wireframes why should we put the extra

00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,740
work into making responsive HTML

00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:04,110
prototypes instead when i'll just keep

00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:06,680
doing the same things when I just draw

00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:10,279
websites instead of actually build them

00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,279
I'll give you several reasons

00:08:10,909 --> 00:08:15,659
traditional wire frames are static

00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:17,069
documents but we try to use them to

00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:21,259
describe multi-dimensional user

00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:23,779
experiences the key word is described

00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:26,159
these are just blocks on a page and

00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:28,289
we're attempting to describe and

00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:33,630
communicate how website our app will

00:08:28,289 --> 00:08:35,310
work so prototyping is rendering ideas

00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,419
to understand the matter that's

00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:40,580
according to jarod school I'm sure

00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:43,670
you've all heard of him prototype is an

00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:47,700
early sample or model built to test a

00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:49,410
concept or process or act as a thing to

00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:53,790
be replicated or learn from this is

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:56,220
directly from Wikipedia an HTML

00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,440
prototype is essentially a working

00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,910
wireframe created with HTML CSS and

00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:04,290
JavaScript and viewed in the browser and

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:08,089
this creates a living breathing

00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:08,089
environment for users to interact with

00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:13,020
the goal of prototyping is to discover

00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:15,390
and solve design problems early on in

00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:18,540
the process by iterating testing

00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:21,000
implementing and refining and we all

00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:23,670
know that the earlier the earlier on you

00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,470
find a problem and solve it the less

00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,940
expensive it's going to be if you can

00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,550
get this done when it's more of a

00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,490
conceptual thing versus later on in the

00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:33,960
development process when you've already

00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:37,220
built ninety percent of your project

00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:39,330
it's just going to be so much better

00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,520
it's really hard to do that with us at a

00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:44,810
PDF wireframes and this this is kind of

00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,400
the reoccurring theme of this talk here

00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:51,110
if a picture is worth a thousand words a

00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,110
prototype is worth a thousand meetings

00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,680
this is true I like I've had meetings

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,280
about meetings about meetings about

00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,839
meetings about wireframes and if you if

00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,120
you give a client a prototype that

00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:11,280
actually renders in a browser then that

00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:13,700
leaves far less up for interpretation so

00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:17,730
prototypes show real interactions

00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:19,530
wireframes describe when you need to

00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:21,839
demonstrate a complex user interaction

00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:23,160
to a client or developer describing

00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,600
these interactions but the static

00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,420
wireframe just creates too many

00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:31,459
unanswered questions so here's an

00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:33,600
example this is a traditional wireframe

00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:36,360
we've been living on this illusion that

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,310
static wire frames are cheap they don't

00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,860
cost that much an effort in time to

00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,779
produce but if you ever tried to use a

00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:46,410
picture like this of a website instead

00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:47,620
of an actual website it can be really

00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,730
frustrating and

00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:53,529
using team and not the same thing at all

00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:56,670
because static wireframes don't actually

00:10:53,529 --> 00:10:59,910
do anything nothing here does anything

00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:02,290
we often wind up writing a lot of

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:04,089
documentation just describe things like

00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:07,210
what do these things do how do they do

00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:09,100
it when do they do it and you know like

00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:10,650
for example what do the menus do what

00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,450
happens when you click this button

00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:16,420
that's all all those little blue dots

00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:18,940
are the notation for that and even

00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:22,000
before responsive design came and kicked

00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:26,410
us all in the shins it got really out of

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,230
hand so basically wireframes just get

00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:31,060
really complex and like I don't know if

00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:33,910
I was being presented something like

00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:36,850
this as a client or even worse as a user

00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:38,830
I don't know where to start like it

00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:40,510
should not be this shouldn't be this

00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:46,240
complicated we should just show how it

00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:48,070
works so that gets a big WTF with an

00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,310
HTML prototype everything is responsive

00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:53,620
and everything functions just as it

00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:56,140
would on the website all of your

00:11:53,620 --> 00:12:00,850
components sliders content blocks tabs

00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:02,170
menus etc they'll actually work there's

00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,610
not much need for complex notation

00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:06,730
because you can actually click around

00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:08,940
you can you can resize the browser you

00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:12,940
can try to break things if you want and

00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:14,800
you'll actually see how it works so then

00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,810
like for example you won't need to write

00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,839
about how the main navigation drop-down

00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:23,230
has this crazy flyout doohickey thing

00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,390
and then drops down it does this bring

00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:28,029
animation because it will just do it you

00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:29,500
can actually do it in there it's you put

00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:31,870
in there for the clients to see it for

00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,020
the developers to see it and everything

00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,020
works

00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:42,760
working software always Trump's

00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,760
documents about working software

00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,680
prototyping forces you to discover and

00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,840
solve problems early on I did say that

00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,760
earlier on and I will be repeating a few

00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:55,010
things because I feel like they're

00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:58,160
important this is where designing the

00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:59,930
browser comes in just to be clear I'm

00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,000
not telling anyone to dump photoshop i

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:04,820
know there's it's kind of like a

00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,330
locating some people know photoshop some

00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:10,010
people hate it i still use it it's part

00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:13,910
of my process but when it comes to

00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:16,520
designing layout and designing content

00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:20,180
flow and things like that i go straight

00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:26,870
to the browser for that plus you can't

00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:30,230
replicate desert chrome and CSS yet so

00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:31,880
here's an example let's pretend you're

00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:34,040
working on a content heavy responsive

00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,240
drupal site say for the sake of this

00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,720
presentation we're creating wireframes

00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:42,110
for three break points a 1024 pixels

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:45,470
wide wireframe 168 pixel wide wire frame

00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:49,460
for tablish tablet excuse me and 300

00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:53,810
pixel 320 pixel wide wireframe for

00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:55,610
mobiles it seems like a good idea but as

00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:58,760
you'll see a lot of stuff can actually

00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:00,500
happen between these breakpoints things

00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:05,900
could get really messed up just kind of

00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:07,460
in between a 1024 and a 768 layout and

00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:09,470
the thing is you won't notice these

00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:11,300
problems until they're actually been

00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,340
implemented and tell their it's in the

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:16,370
theming phase or it's in the development

00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:19,670
phase so things like menus can break

00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:22,790
menu like menu might look fine at 768

00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:26,030
pixels wide but maybe you get down to

00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:27,470
600 and it breaks or you have a sintered

00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,750
layout and centered layouts can look

00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:33,650
really strange once you get to about 600

00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:35,450
pixels or a little bit wider margins and

00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:38,390
padding can get really really tight

00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:41,570
almost unacceptably so right before a

00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:43,400
breakpoint and some layouts just look

00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:45,760
like complete ass when they're you know

00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,870
not when they're between a break point

00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,760
but again you're not going to know these

00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:51,440
things if you don't do in each

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,910
I'll prototype you're not going to find

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,350
this out until later on when you get an

00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,540
IM from your front and developer saying

00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,430
dude your menu broke and you need to

00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,540
redesign it and it's like well I don't

00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:02,330
have any more design hours on this

00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,560
project what am I supposed to do that's

00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:07,420
also one of our front-end developers

00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:10,460
right there so he's IM me that before

00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:12,350
with HTML prototypes you can see how

00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:15,140
things look at always just by resizing

00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:17,030
your browser so if you want to know if

00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,830
your menu breaks between the common

00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:21,710
sizes or the margin padding is going to

00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:24,380
be off or what the vertical rhythm on an

00:15:21,710 --> 00:15:28,310
iphone 5 is going to be like you can do

00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:30,890
it you know these are all things again

00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:34,390
that you want to solve before the

00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:34,390
develop development process begins

00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:41,450
prototypes are more representative of

00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:43,310
the final product so to me this is one

00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:45,710
of the most compelling reasons for you

00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:47,270
guys to start using HTML prototypes that

00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:50,180
work in a browser instead of traditional

00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:52,430
wireframes to raise your hand if you are

00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:55,820
designed a website using traditional

00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:58,310
wireframes a PSD it's probably everybody

00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:00,560
in here keep your hand up if the actual

00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:03,320
implementation of your design ended up

00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:05,030
being wildly different than what you had

00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:09,830
in mind and without you knowing until it

00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:14,060
was too late to change yeah that's what

00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:15,920
we're trying to avoid here so here's a

00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:18,380
quote from 37signals book and it kind of

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,900
sums this up and it says that getting

00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:23,150
real delivers better results because it

00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,310
forces you to deal with actual problems

00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:27,110
you're trying to solve instead of your

00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,750
ideas about these problems and it forces

00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:30,980
you to deal with reality so basically

00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:35,540
you want to make something real as

00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:37,250
quickly as possible HTML prototypes

00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,940
makes your developers job easier and

00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:42,500
lets them focus on what they do best a

00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:44,570
lot of time can be wasted filling in

00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,820
some of the gaps on responsive products

00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:50,180
river projects going back and forth and

00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:52,580
you know hey man I need this for this

00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:54,440
breakpoint or this layout and you say oh

00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,870
I thought I did that already I gave you

00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,610
a wireframe well there's still like we

00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,259
said earlier there's still a lot of gaps

00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:02,419
there

00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:06,860
and we just don't want to leave things

00:17:02,419 --> 00:17:09,500
up for interpretation easier iteration

00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:13,100
design build test and evaluate for the

00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:17,500
win with an HTML or prototype you can

00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:21,169
easily change layout sizing etc with CSS

00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:23,809
just typography on the fly since we all

00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:27,019
know that our responsive website should

00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:28,159
be content first isn't typography one of

00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:30,970
the most important things that we're

00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:35,929
going to deal with in the design process

00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:37,429
add or take away breakpoints easy easily

00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:39,950
copy and paste segments so if you've got

00:17:37,429 --> 00:17:42,769
you know if you got blocks that you know

00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:44,539
say you have a section of repeating news

00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:46,549
items that you want to have going down

00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:49,760
the page maybe five or six it's an easy

00:17:46,549 --> 00:17:55,399
copy and paste of you know some some P

00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:57,440
tags and some some h2 tags and etc and

00:17:55,399 --> 00:17:58,970
ultimately you can use if you really

00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,630
want to get fancy you can use code kit

00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:05,450
or PHP to do some includes and kind of

00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:09,409
create components dynamically so that's

00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:12,289
always one you get immediate feedback

00:18:09,409 --> 00:18:15,379
for testing and iteration this is

00:18:12,289 --> 00:18:17,330
awesome so put your prototypes on a

00:18:15,379 --> 00:18:20,629
server somewhere and load them on any

00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:21,919
device with the browser like if you

00:18:20,629 --> 00:18:23,899
weren't of how something looks in an

00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,120
iphone you don't have to send your

00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:28,519
client a PDF and then tell them to open

00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,799
it up on an iPhone and like try to

00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:35,000
resize it till it's the right size just

00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:37,039
put it on a server and given the URL you

00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,230
can create a git repo of it put it in

00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:42,549
this source control so that you'll have

00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,549
to worry about accidentally deleting it

00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:47,929
so this right here is a photo of jeff

00:18:46,129 --> 00:18:49,789
robbins our CEO at all bots and he was

00:18:47,929 --> 00:18:51,649
perusing the tesla dealership and in

00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:53,179
rhode island and it's al all about

00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:56,120
website loaded on the browser and the

00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:58,190
center console of a tesla model s if you

00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,789
wanted to test your HTML prototypes on a

00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:04,629
Tesla Model S it's easy beans not so

00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:04,629
much with a wireframe

00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:16,770
so wireframes can't handle responsive

00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:18,630
design it's a bold statement but a major

00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:22,169
pain when it comes to responsive design

00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:24,659
projects is scalability so these are

00:19:22,169 --> 00:19:27,299
photos inside of Amazon comms warehouse

00:19:24,659 --> 00:19:29,429
or one of their warehouses and they're

00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:32,549
quintessential example of economies of

00:19:29,429 --> 00:19:35,330
scale so wikipedia defines economies of

00:19:32,549 --> 00:19:38,610
scale as the cost advantages that

00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:40,799
enterprises obtain due to size with cost

00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:43,530
per unit of output generally decreasing

00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:48,150
with increasing scale as fixed costs are

00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:49,049
spread out over more units of output so

00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,809
what the hell does that have to do with

00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:55,080
web development so basically if you make

00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:56,549
a tiny change the more the more

00:19:55,080 --> 00:20:00,780
components you have the more those

00:19:56,549 --> 00:20:02,580
changes are going to add up so let's

00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:05,159
consider a fairly typical responsive

00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:07,770
website project where we would be

00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:09,570
creating traditional wireframes so in

00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:13,559
this project we're making wireframes for

00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:16,799
four sizes I phone tablet medium with

00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:19,080
desktop and a wide desktop so already

00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:22,110
just for the homepage we have four wire

00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:24,240
frames we have to make so let's say this

00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:28,409
is a very complex content heavy website

00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,299
and we might have several things in the

00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:33,270
UX that we have to nail down by using

00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:35,940
wire frames so what if we have eight

00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:40,080
sections so maybe there is like a media

00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:42,659
section videos blogs recipes products

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:46,980
news and contact these are fairly

00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:49,230
typical for a law about type website now

00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:51,809
we have 32 wireframes we have to keep

00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:54,900
track of and that's not including any

00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:56,460
menus or widgets or additional

00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,549
components that also need to be

00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,919
wire-framed so keeping track of that's

00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:04,169
just insane imagine if a client comes

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:07,409
back and says all right we've made some

00:21:04,169 --> 00:21:09,299
organizational changes and now we to

00:21:07,409 --> 00:21:13,080
reorganize the menu and change some

00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:15,120
footer links and now we need to switch

00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,730
out some widgets I mean you're going to

00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,750
spin and you easily spend three to four

00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:21,240
hours just

00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:24,500
updating your wire frames that's that's

00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:26,730
crazy if you had HTML prototypes instead

00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,440
you'd only have eight prototypes that

00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:31,380
need to be updated because they're

00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:35,100
responsive I also learned this one the

00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:36,780
hard way so basically what I was trying

00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,880
to say the last few slides is creating

00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:43,380
static wire static wireframes for

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:45,570
responsive design is a nightmare and

00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,240
then lastly one of the most important

00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:49,860
skills in responsive web design

00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,710
according to Trent Walton is the ability

00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:55,400
to control the layout of how the content

00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:59,280
shifts and reflows at various widths

00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:02,610
this is true in so many ways and using

00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:07,560
HTML prototypes that you can put real

00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:11,640
content and just helps this so much cool

00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:13,830
so discuss why we wireframe why

00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,740
prototyping is better so I hope that

00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:20,400
I've actually sold you on this so where

00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:23,760
do you start what do you do now first of

00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,490
all every team and project and situation

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,190
is very different so start by evaluating

00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:32,610
these some important questions to ask

00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:35,760
yourself as a designer what is your

00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:36,840
level of HTML experience are you part of

00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,040
a large team or you're going to be

00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:42,570
working solo will you be handling

00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,360
front-end development orbit is someone

00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:47,700
else going to be doing that are you

00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,870
working with legacy content a legacy

00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,930
site or you're working with site

00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:53,670
migration which is a huge challenge or

00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:57,180
are you building a new product from the

00:22:53,670 --> 00:22:59,130
ground up what's the future forecast for

00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,170
the product you're working on meaning is

00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:04,080
it something that you're going to build

00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:06,540
that is is going to last for a long time

00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,280
and needs to have constant iteration and

00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:10,080
updates or is it something that's going

00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,940
to last for six months and then be taken

00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,430
down like some type of AD campaign or

00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,990
something and of course will this be a

00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:19,170
Drupal project because that actually

00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:21,180
does matter so once you've evaluated

00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:22,410
these things there's really two

00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:25,830
different approaches you can take to

00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:28,830
making HTML prototypes they can either

00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:30,780
be disposable or reusable so it'll level

00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,740
a berate a little more when i say

00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,809
disposable I mean

00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,940
that the HTML you create and your

00:23:33,809 --> 00:23:37,920
initial prototypes will not necessarily

00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:39,480
be used in the final implementation of

00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:41,910
the product you can kind of throw it

00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,860
away when you're done they're only meant

00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:48,000
for communicating that's communicating

00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:49,710
ideas to clients and to developers this

00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,890
lets front-end developers create their

00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:55,500
own HTML and CSS to their preference

00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:57,360
this really really makes them happy you

00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,880
know as a designer nobody likes to be

00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,200
told how to design well as a front-end

00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:04,350
developer of course nobody likes to be

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,910
told how to run and develop and of

00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:09,809
course less time is needed in the

00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:12,179
prototyping phase because they're more

00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:16,170
lightweight but more time is needed in

00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:17,790
development and theming phase now the

00:24:16,170 --> 00:24:20,670
other hand you can have prototypes that

00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:22,860
are usable the idea here is that you use

00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:25,890
the prototypes to create the final HTML

00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:27,240
structure of the product this comes from

00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:29,730
a concept of not wanting to waste

00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,920
anything this is a little bit more

00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,660
challenging it's something that we're

00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,130
working through at lullaby and to be

00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:38,970
honest we don't have a perfect solution

00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:40,679
for it yet but it does require a lot of

00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:43,290
collaboration between the designers and

00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:44,640
developers and you know it is something

00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:48,120
that does have a lot of benefits if it's

00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:50,100
done right it could take a lot of time a

00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,750
little bit more time excuse me in the

00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:53,100
prototyping phase but it can really cut

00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:55,950
time out of the development a theming

00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:57,390
face so those questions that you asked

00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,220
yourself in the last slide those are

00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:02,429
really going to help you determine which

00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:04,440
method you want to go with of course the

00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:08,309
big question is mobile or desktop first

00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:09,750
yes start I personally like to start

00:25:08,309 --> 00:25:14,130
with the most complicated interactions

00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:20,160
and then but make sure that my my HTML

00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:21,929
my CSS is mobile first become friends

00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,660
with your developers I can't say this

00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:27,570
enough prototyping with HTML does

00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:31,730
require collaboration and it has to have

00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:31,730
that to be successful so does anything

00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:36,870
you want to change expectations most

00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:40,290
clients and internal stakeholders expect

00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:42,809
a waterfall approach it's your job as a

00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:44,280
designer to change this in my experience

00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:45,450
at lolla bought I found that most

00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,580
clients are willing

00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,840
do things a little bit differently than

00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,700
they have done before if they know it's

00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:52,799
going to give them a better product it's

00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,809
okay to push a little bit the worst that

00:25:52,799 --> 00:26:01,679
someone can say is no we don't we can't

00:25:54,809 --> 00:26:04,080
do that so let's talk here so you can

00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,210
either prototype you with HTML you can

00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,409
either use frameworks that are already

00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:10,019
out there like Twitter bootstrap

00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:13,679
reserved foundation or you can home brew

00:26:10,019 --> 00:26:17,820
your own those course benefits to both

00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:19,559
of these and downsize both of these so

00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:21,899
some of the pros of prototyping

00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:24,690
frameworks like ZURB foundation is that

00:26:21,899 --> 00:26:26,340
there really quick there's all kinds of

00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:29,010
baked and stuff free to use like grid

00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:33,029
systems common styles components

00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:35,159
typography typically the people that

00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:37,049
make the frameworks are really really

00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:38,429
crazy passionate about it so they like

00:26:37,049 --> 00:26:41,760
to update them a lot they like to make

00:26:38,429 --> 00:26:43,139
sure that they're working and they've

00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:48,899
already done the browser testing for you

00:26:43,139 --> 00:26:50,909
which is huge they also have at least in

00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:53,990
the case of foundation and bootstrap and

00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:56,039
several other prototyping frameworks

00:26:53,990 --> 00:27:00,950
they all have very extensive

00:26:56,039 --> 00:27:02,909
documentation so the downsides is that

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:04,169
working with someone else's code if

00:27:02,909 --> 00:27:07,200
you're really particular about your

00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:09,740
front-end code that's fine you might not

00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:14,600
want to be locked into a framework

00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:16,350
looking at you there's a learning curve

00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:18,809
anytime you're dealing with somebody

00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:20,519
else's code it's it's always there's

00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:22,230
always a knowledge transfer time where

00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:25,740
you have to figure out what they meant

00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:28,830
by what they're doing and then in the

00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,539
case of like Twitter bootstrap observe

00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:33,480
there is proprietary markup from

00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:35,399
presentational classes so like an

00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,440
example this is foundations class based

00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:38,370
grid system if you want to eat if you

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,230
wanna have a did that's going to be

00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:42,750
three columns you have to include a

00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:45,330
class that says you know class equals

00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:49,169
three space columns to a lot of people

00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:50,630
that's a big no-no and then also might

00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:54,720
not be the best fit for your situation

00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:56,190
which is a big deal and it can be tough

00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,429
to get some frameworks to play well with

00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:59,690
tribbles markup let's be honest drupal

00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:05,509
markup likes to kind of do what I wants

00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:07,850
to do and we have to work for that so

00:28:05,509 --> 00:28:10,749
some of the pros of custom prototypes is

00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:13,580
that gives you ownership of your code

00:28:10,749 --> 00:28:15,529
you'll have more flexibility and not be

00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:17,690
limited by the assumptions and systems

00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:20,360
that someone else is built you can

00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:22,940
customize till your heart's content and

00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,559
then one of the biggest ones roll your

00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:27,499
own framework assuming that you know and

00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:30,230
what you're doing it's way more likely

00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:31,549
to create a basic structure layout for

00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,919
the system that can become your final

00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:35,690
product and you can also build up a

00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,789
library over time which is great because

00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:39,919
you know after a few projects you might

00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:43,460
have a lot more components that you can

00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,720
pick and choose from some of the

00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,909
downsides is that you can wind up

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,190
spending a lot of time planning this

00:28:46,909 --> 00:28:51,350
stuff and not actually getting to work

00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:53,869
on it you'll have a whole bunch of

00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:55,629
choices to make about things that you

00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:58,249
want to use like grid systems and

00:28:55,629 --> 00:29:00,320
JavaScript libraries all that stuff it's

00:28:58,249 --> 00:29:01,940
kind of like if you go into a big mega

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,700
store that and you're looking for a TV

00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:06,289
and there's 8,000 TVs you don't know

00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,450
exactly which one you want to buy so you

00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:12,590
end up leaving frustrated it could be

00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:14,350
like that you're on your own for support

00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:18,080
and testing if it doesn't work in ie8

00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:19,369
that's your problem deal with it and you

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,889
have to provide your own documentation

00:29:19,369 --> 00:29:23,929
so if you quit your job or if you hire

00:29:21,889 --> 00:29:27,320
somebody else to work with you you're

00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:29,869
the one that's got to explain that so

00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,669
some of the popular frameworks ZURB

00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:36,139
foundation and twitter bootstrap are the

00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:39,379
two biggest ones the option the one that

00:29:36,139 --> 00:29:42,020
I used mostly is Twitter boots or sorry

00:29:39,379 --> 00:29:45,740
wow that was a big mistake

00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:48,170
sorry snowman a foundation for is the

00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:51,710
one that I use the most it's mobile

00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:53,450
first it's got you can turn off the

00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:57,230
presentational classes by using SAS

00:29:53,450 --> 00:30:00,500
which is great and it's a lot more

00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:01,760
semantic and in this update it also has

00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,310
a lot of different templates and

00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,710
pre-baked components so if you're

00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:07,820
somebody that wants to have a bunch of

00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:09,260
different things to choose from if you

00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:12,110
don't have time to you know sit there

00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:15,860
and code out sliders and modal boxes and

00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:17,600
things like that are there they keep

00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:20,150
working on it so they're constantly

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,330
doing updates and they actually have

00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:24,380
training available to which is nice

00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:27,380
biggest downside is out of the box

00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:29,210
there's one break point bait then I've

00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:31,040
had projects where one break point was

00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:33,440
fine I've also had projects where I

00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,760
needed five break points so again that's

00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,630
kind of where you need to evaluate it

00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:41,210
for yourself some of the components that

00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:43,760
it comes with is navigation buttons

00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:48,050
forms typography and some other

00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:50,210
components so this is an example of the

00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:53,920
navigation patterns I mean if you go to

00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:58,880
ZURB calm foundation forget the URL but

00:30:53,920 --> 00:31:00,710
I'll tweet it out later I mean there's

00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,760
just so much to choose from you've got

00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:08,000
baked in pagination navigation

00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:11,990
subnavigation top navigation mobile

00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,130
navigation I mean it's all there they

00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:16,130
have a number of pre-built styles you

00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:18,850
can use for buttons tabs pills I mean

00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:22,400
really anything that that you might eat

00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:27,620
forms like creating forms and HTML is a

00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:30,110
pain and they have typography which is

00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:33,710
nice lots of you know links subheadings

00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:35,750
block quotes all that's there and then

00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:38,030
there's just a bunch of extra stuff like

00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:40,970
if you need to float something to the

00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:43,910
left or any progress bars pricing tables

00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:45,860
I mean again that's all baked in stuff

00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:49,580
that would just take you a lot of time

00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:52,130
to do on your own Twitter bootstrap has

00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:55,450
also gotten popular it's got a lot of

00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:56,620
documentation to it it has five

00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:58,840
didn't break points that you can utilize

00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:02,500
and it has a really good number of

00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:04,210
templates and components as well the

00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,059
downside is and this is kind of a kicker

00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:08,889
for me it's not semantics and it uses

00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:10,779
presentational classes for everything

00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:14,080
and there's no option to switch out

00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:15,760
those presentational classes still not

00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,639
mobile first but I hear that they're

00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:20,529
actually working on an update for it so

00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:24,580
that'll be really cool when that happens

00:32:20,529 --> 00:32:27,580
so basically desktop styles are the base

00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:30,610
and then it uses media queries to apply

00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:32,889
those styles downward so if you're in a

00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:36,610
mobile-first process that's that's a

00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:38,620
deal breaker of course there's a ton of

00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:42,480
other frameworks there's I mean last

00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:44,740
wire fri semantic GS SAS has a

00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,570
responsive framework code kit you can

00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:50,380
you I mean there's so many of them out

00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:52,809
there that it would probably take for

00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:55,870
the rest of drupalcon to cover all the

00:32:52,809 --> 00:32:56,919
frameworks that are available and

00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:58,960
there's even more than that so like if

00:32:56,919 --> 00:33:01,630
you google HTML prototyping you're going

00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,519
to look get a list that's a mile long so

00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:06,909
really the best thing to do is kind of

00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,710
know what your needs are and go play

00:33:06,909 --> 00:33:10,690
with some things go download some stuff

00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:18,299
mess around with it and see what works

00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:21,039
best for you so how do you make your own

00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:22,840
sure how many how many people here are

00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:26,110
interested in making their own prototype

00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:29,320
framework wow that's a lot okay cool

00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:31,570
well basically all you need is a grid

00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:34,419
system and basic styling and that equals

00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:35,769
a prototype framework I know everyone

00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:38,799
has kind of their own definition of

00:33:35,769 --> 00:33:40,779
basic styling but in my experience is

00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,850
best that you have a prototype that's

00:33:40,779 --> 00:33:45,730
just plain enough to not call attention

00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:49,049
to aesthetic but it can't look terrible

00:33:45,730 --> 00:33:52,450
either because if you give a client a

00:33:49,049 --> 00:33:54,010
prototype that's just plain HTML there

00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:56,200
they're probably not going to know what

00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:59,700
to do with it has to be as much as we

00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,700
hate it it has to be a little bit pretty

00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:05,830
so we've talked about why what and how

00:34:03,429 --> 00:34:06,800
so let's talk about how to get clients

00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:09,170
on board

00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:12,620
how to get your team on board to this

00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:17,060
new process first question is how much

00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:18,860
does it cost so I'm sure you're going to

00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,600
get that anytime you you talk to a

00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,100
project manager or sales person or

00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,810
client and say hey we have this new

00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:26,750
thing we want to try that's going to be

00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:29,600
the first thing that comes up so Brian

00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:31,670
Hoff says imagine asking a real estate

00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:34,429
company how much does a house cost

00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:35,780
depends first off what are the

00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:37,490
essentials you need you need three

00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,810
bedrooms because you have two kids need

00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:41,330
central air conditioning because you

00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:42,560
live down south now that we have the

00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:45,140
essentials what are some of the less

00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,960
essential yet nice features baseman

00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:50,690
extra storage large backyard three-car

00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:54,760
garage what if you could have it exactly

00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:54,760
your way how about a pool sounds nice

00:34:56,410 --> 00:35:02,810
those things are all like it's just like

00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,220
the design process every project is a

00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:06,380
little bit different and you can't just

00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:08,360
say it's going to take this much time or

00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,920
it's going to take this much money but

00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,950
the real important question to be asking

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:14,900
is what's it going to cost if we don't

00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:19,370
use prototyping on a wire frame or on a

00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:21,470
responsive project so you should already

00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:24,080
have allowed time and budget for

00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:25,400
wireframes right so overall the amount

00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,020
of time you spend creating HTML

00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,670
prototypes should cut down on the front

00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:30,710
of development as compared to

00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:32,210
traditional wireframe approach there

00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:34,700
might be some initial time investment on

00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:38,980
your first project but you should make

00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,980
that up with a quicker development cycle

00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,880
allow some time for experimentation new

00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:46,940
things always always take time to learn

00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:48,890
so talk to your team on how to best

00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:53,300
approach this it's okay to try new

00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:55,100
things and to learn to grow and don't be

00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:59,510
afraid of the new process step up and on

00:35:55,100 --> 00:36:01,220
it you know at lovett if we didn't

00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:02,720
experiment with stuff and the only

00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:04,120
things we did were things that we

00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,080
already knew about a hundred percent

00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:12,380
we'd still be making Drupal five

00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:13,640
websites at 800 pixels wide for ie6 how

00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:16,490
does the prototyping fit into the

00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:18,190
process we've made the sales people

00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:21,840
happy by talking about time and money so

00:36:18,190 --> 00:36:26,290
let's let's talk about design stuff now

00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:28,870
it fits in because you know for me HTML

00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:32,340
prototypes exist kind of in this area

00:36:28,870 --> 00:36:34,450
between three components of purpose

00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:35,530
content and hierarchy and systems in

00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:37,840
style you might have seen this from

00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:40,150
Jared pond shots talk about designing on

00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:41,710
purpose that's not a coincidence since

00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:43,720
we work together and he's my creative

00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:47,830
director so we share the same design

00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:49,750
process it's enormously helpful to think

00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:51,940
of the design process as more of a

00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:56,650
circular thing instead of a linear

00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:58,570
process so our value of designers is not

00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:00,760
in our ability to use a particular tool

00:36:58,570 --> 00:37:02,920
or make responsive wireframes and visual

00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,810
mocks our value is that we helped

00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,550
discover and communicate purpose and

00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:10,120
create meaningful order in system

00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:12,550
systematic elegance HTML prototypes are

00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:18,700
just a tool to help us do this just like

00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:20,140
Photoshop is sketch first it's a

00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:22,600
quickest way to hitter eight absolutely

00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:24,580
quickest way sketching allows you to

00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,770
filter your good ideas from your not so

00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:29,080
good ideas and you can do this really

00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:32,770
quickly because it's be honest not every

00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:36,010
idea that we have is a good one maybe

00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:38,950
some of you guys not me it's really

00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:41,080
lightweight and it allows for really

00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:44,380
really easy collaboration so you know I

00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:45,730
can five an idea I can quickly share it

00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:47,500
with client quickly share it with the

00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:49,810
developer or you know with a front of

00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:53,140
developer or whatever the situation is

00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:55,990
and quickly get feedback and for me

00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:58,120
sitting down to code before at least

00:37:55,990 --> 00:38:03,820
roughly sketching something out is just

00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:05,350
extremely difficult we need to shed the

00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,970
notion that we create layouts from the

00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:09,160
canvas in we need to flip it on its head

00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:10,780
and create layouts from the content in

00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:16,330
and that's mark Bolton talking about

00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:18,970
content first design an HTML prototyping

00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:20,830
basically is it design is it strategy or

00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:23,830
is it front-end development and the

00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:25,780
answer is yes it's all the above we need

00:38:23,830 --> 00:38:29,519
to think of responsive web design as

00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:32,769
holistic process that includes all these

00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:36,250
all right so it's drupalcon it's not all

00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:39,609
Drupal so try to keep my process a

00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:41,259
pretty platform agnostic but there are

00:38:39,609 --> 00:38:44,650
some tips and tricks for creating HTML

00:38:41,259 --> 00:38:46,839
prototypes for Drupal projects based on

00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:48,670
my own experience and doing these things

00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:54,190
will make your developers happy little

00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:59,319
trees keep your markup free of

00:38:54,190 --> 00:39:00,880
presentational classes I I can't stress

00:38:59,319 --> 00:39:03,339
that enough it's a challenge with

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,019
Twitter bootstrap as a framework but it

00:39:03,339 --> 00:39:07,089
can be done with sass if you're using

00:39:05,019 --> 00:39:11,200
ZURB foundation and if you're making

00:39:07,089 --> 00:39:13,630
your own that's up to you if you're

00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,970
using a grid for your drupal theme use

00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:18,640
the same grid for your prototypes i said

00:39:15,970 --> 00:39:22,420
earlier that a prototype framework is

00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:25,029
essentially a grid plus styles so let's

00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:26,470
say you're using zen grids for your

00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:31,089
drupal theme use that for your

00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:34,569
prototypes divide your HTML and CSS and

00:39:31,089 --> 00:39:36,279
the partials like drupal does this is

00:39:34,569 --> 00:39:37,390
what this does get kind of complex this

00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:38,940
is one thing that we're kind of messing

00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:41,410
around with that wallah bot but

00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:43,359
basically just want to structure it like

00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:45,009
drupal if you can do that it's going to

00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:49,869
be so much easier in that in the theming

00:39:45,009 --> 00:39:52,119
phase and then they actually have

00:39:49,869 --> 00:39:54,640
bootstrapping foundation themes so if

00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:57,220
you're planning on using either of those

00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:04,599
for your prototypes give it a shot see

00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:06,839
if it works for you well that's all for

00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:09,130
me as we like to say that all about tada

00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:13,200
but if you have any questions please

00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:13,200
step up and ask away

00:40:18,809 --> 00:40:23,920
also I will be I will be posting to keep

00:40:22,569 --> 00:40:26,950
checking back on loll about com I'm

00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,780
going to post the resources and links

00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:30,369
that I used on this as soon as I get a

00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:32,319
little bit better Wi-Fi connection

00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:34,000
that's a little bit more reliable

00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:39,400
because I have a lot of big files to

00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:41,740
post so keep a lookout for that you

00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:44,710
touched upon a lot of stuff that Stephen

00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:50,440
hey has talked about a news responsive

00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:53,440
web workflow and what I found was

00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:56,109
difficult was getting from the prototype

00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,849
to Drupal so what I did was I kind of

00:40:56,109 --> 00:41:02,890
made empty content types in a way and

00:40:59,849 --> 00:41:06,010
did the wire framing with us with a

00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:10,170
sub-theme that's a good idea dude do you

00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:13,240
have a particular sub team that you like

00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:15,130
because content first or design you know

00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:18,280
if they kind of go hand in hand so you

00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:22,270
can't really design content unless you

00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:24,670
know what your content is so have you

00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:27,460
explored that process and do you have a

00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:30,849
particular theme you like to use for

00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:34,089
kind of quick mock-up um well yes and no

00:41:30,849 --> 00:41:36,579
sort of that doesn't really answer it

00:41:34,089 --> 00:41:38,200
but it's kind of a two-part thing so as

00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:42,339
far as understanding what your content

00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:44,859
is we try to always do at least somewhat

00:41:42,339 --> 00:41:47,589
of a kind of like a Content exploration

00:41:44,859 --> 00:41:51,069
or content audit before we start any the

00:41:47,589 --> 00:41:53,920
design process because it's so easy to

00:41:51,069 --> 00:41:55,510
just to design something that you as a

00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,150
designer think is good but it's not

00:41:55,510 --> 00:42:01,390
really reflective of what the actual

00:41:58,150 --> 00:42:03,670
content is going to be so if you can

00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:06,279
manage a first step of doing like

00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:08,559
content audit or you know working with

00:42:06,279 --> 00:42:11,319
client to first just discover what the

00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:13,359
content types are start with that that's

00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:16,390
typically even before the design process

00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:18,609
starts and then as far as a sub thing I

00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:22,059
actually I don't have a really one that

00:42:18,609 --> 00:42:25,329
I can recommend but if if you're in a

00:42:22,059 --> 00:42:28,329
situation to where you're working with a

00:42:25,329 --> 00:42:28,690
little bit more complex theme and you

00:42:28,329 --> 00:42:31,780
know

00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:33,010
you don't you may want to consider doing

00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:35,140
something that's a little more throw

00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:36,940
away like using you know one of the

00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:38,910
frameworks or just creating your own

00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:42,190
framework but not with the intention of

00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:44,680
taking the HTML to the final process so

00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:49,079
i would use it as more of like a roadmap

00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:49,079
of how you want to build it thank you

00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:54,040
first of all thank you so much for the

00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:55,810
presentation you're welcome my question

00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:58,270
is so I'm the guy who sits at the desk

00:42:55,810 --> 00:43:00,490
and gets the wireframes and then gets

00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:05,250
the PSD and then has to put the two

00:43:00,490 --> 00:43:08,800
together with drupal and the are amazing

00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:12,849
well that's the issue is them I feel

00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:15,550
like the more specific my PSD is and the

00:43:12,849 --> 00:43:18,339
wire frames are the more challenging it

00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:21,369
is to kind of like wrangle drupal into

00:43:18,339 --> 00:43:27,700
making everything match exactly and to

00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:30,310
me to build multiple responsive designs

00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:32,160
like like this and have a very specific

00:43:30,310 --> 00:43:35,109
way that they're going to collapse down

00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,750
you know for the user page and for each

00:43:35,109 --> 00:43:39,700
content type and for the home page that

00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:43,599
seems like adding a lot of additional

00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:45,250
work that could be really challenging to

00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:49,300
implement within a specific time frame

00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:51,579
so can you speak to that process of how

00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:55,480
specific do we really want to be when

00:43:51,579 --> 00:43:58,089
we're deciding early on in a project for

00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:01,420
example what is going to happen as

00:43:58,089 --> 00:44:06,130
things shrink down well okay that's a

00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:08,920
good question um so the way I tend to

00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:12,069
look at it is the last thing I want to

00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:14,950
do is is tell front of developer exactly

00:44:12,069 --> 00:44:18,329
how to do what they're doing so I tend

00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:21,579
to look at prototypes as kind of like

00:44:18,329 --> 00:44:24,430
this is how I'd like it to work this is

00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:27,670
how you know this is kind of how things

00:44:24,430 --> 00:44:29,920
should work and then this PSD here or

00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:32,380
these style tiles or the visual design

00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,470
this is this is like the extra layer of

00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:38,890
style but I'm kind of giving it to you

00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:41,600
to have freedom and kind of make it look

00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:45,170
like that but I'm not expecting you to

00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:48,080
completely just be mindless about it and

00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:49,760
completely just duplicated you know that

00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:52,910
there is an art to front and development

00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:55,190
and when it comes to prototypes they're

00:44:52,910 --> 00:44:59,300
really they're just kind of more to

00:44:55,190 --> 00:45:02,030
guide you and like not have unanswered

00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:05,960
questions of what happens when it's

00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:08,360
between break points or when it's at 646

00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:11,330
pixels but the wire frame you gave me is

00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:12,980
for 700 pixels great yeah that that

00:45:11,330 --> 00:45:15,110
definitely makes a lot of sense I really

00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:16,730
appreciate that the challenge is

00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:18,290
communicating that to the client when

00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:19,760
they've seen these wireframes I that

00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:21,650
collapse or these prototypes that

00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,390
collapse down the way they do and I feel

00:45:21,650 --> 00:45:25,340
like that would be something that could

00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:28,100
be resolved for sure too yeah and I

00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:30,410
think a lot of that you it kind of goes

00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,670
back to being able to have an open line

00:45:30,410 --> 00:45:34,010
of communication with your client and

00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:36,590
say that you know these are prototypes

00:45:34,010 --> 00:45:38,690
these are this is not the final product

00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:42,050
the final product is going to come after

00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:44,090
lots of refinement it's going to look

00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:48,170
similar to this it's not going to look

00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:49,520
exactly like this and and maybe maybe

00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:52,640
I've just gotten lucky but I've actually

00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:55,580
found that clients don't always care if

00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,140
something isn't exactly like it was on a

00:45:55,580 --> 00:46:00,200
wire frame or prototype a lot of times

00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:02,090
it's within the agency like a project

00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:03,830
manager or something like that that are

00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:05,180
actually you know because that's their

00:46:03,830 --> 00:46:08,530
job their job is to make sure that

00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:12,590
you're delivering what you promised so

00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:15,320
it may actually be more of a change what

00:46:12,590 --> 00:46:21,650
you're promising type of thing awesome

00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:23,390
thank you so much Rotom I don't you

00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:25,250
mentioned using like PHP includes our

00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:27,290
code kit have you tried using like an

00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:30,770
extremely light CMS for prototyping like

00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:32,420
Jekyll I have not so I think it's like a

00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:36,290
yacht combining that with ZURB

00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:37,850
foundation might work like it's a ruby

00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:39,680
project but like the liquid templating

00:46:37,850 --> 00:46:41,870
is kind of similar similar to twigs you

00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,430
can really easily just get like the menu

00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:46,310
your blogroll your content is Justin

00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:48,560
Tuck scholar markdown that's cool we've

00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:53,259
been experimenting with our own Ruby

00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:59,170
based system open serve yes

00:46:53,259 --> 00:46:59,170
yeah what he said okay he works with us

00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:22,549
for posterity repeat on the mic Burt

00:47:14,150 --> 00:47:30,109
wait he started in Jekyll and moved to

00:47:22,549 --> 00:47:32,329
serve I can hear you just fine I guess

00:47:30,109 --> 00:47:34,640
I'm for the earlier question like sounds

00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:36,589
like a really tiny brochure site I'll

00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,059
just like pick a random just like Bartok

00:47:36,589 --> 00:47:39,349
and if they have any Content put the

00:47:38,059 --> 00:47:40,759
content in there and say does this

00:47:39,349 --> 00:47:42,470
navigation make sense of this content

00:47:40,759 --> 00:47:43,730
make sense and then from there is

00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:45,559
starting to sub-theme just kind of it

00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:49,069
early go through it and I found it works

00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:51,559
for example projects so I say definitely

00:47:49,069 --> 00:47:53,029
like I'm a fan like if possible just

00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:55,190
going from sketching to do you know

00:47:53,029 --> 00:47:56,990
iteratively designing in a browser cool

00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:58,640
and then as long as if you have like

00:47:56,990 --> 00:48:01,819
regular check-ins you find yourself

00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:03,500
backtracking loss I said I'm sorry I'm

00:48:01,819 --> 00:48:05,089
having trouble surrender yeah I mean if

00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,769
you kind of like check in with the

00:48:05,089 --> 00:48:08,779
people you're working with you find

00:48:06,769 --> 00:48:11,869
yourself back tracking a bit less yes

00:48:08,779 --> 00:48:13,160
this is absolutely true but you have to

00:48:11,869 --> 00:48:15,109
find the right person it's like okay

00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:16,309
with being like don't worry about the

00:48:15,109 --> 00:48:18,230
padding don't worry about the colors

00:48:16,309 --> 00:48:22,269
just tell me about how it works and

00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:22,269
functions yeah that's absolutely right

00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:29,940
have you had a experience using

00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:33,360
foundation wear foundation ends up in

00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:35,370
production or is it just strictly like a

00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:37,890
prototyping thing and then someone else

00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:39,300
has to come in afterwards so the most

00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:40,500
recent project that we did with

00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,780
foundation that was actually with

00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:45,090
foundation three before they kind of did

00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:48,300
the mobile first update and that one

00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:53,310
that one was used as more of a guide we

00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:54,720
intended to use it for I believe where

00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:56,760
they're going to try to do some

00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,440
decoupling magic basically decoupling

00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:02,340
the front end of Drupal from the back

00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:06,660
end using nodejs didn't quite work out

00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:09,480
as planned so it it was supposed to be a

00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:12,150
front end basically a front-end

00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:14,910
structure but ended up just being kind

00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:17,580
of a throwaway thing but it still worked

00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:19,860
out really well because after doing

00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:21,390
those prototypes I I gave those

00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:23,990
prototypes of the developer and then I

00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:27,390
did a few design mocks but not a lot and

00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:30,330
between those two things we were able to

00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:32,010
build out the entire website so it

00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:38,130
worked really well for us not quite as

00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:39,930
intended but you know I have two jobs in

00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:43,410
my freelance I can use whatever process

00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:46,260
I want awesome but because it's just me

00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:49,680
but my other job would work for

00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:51,720
University and I have kind of the same

00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:56,160
problem as the other guy where you're

00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:58,680
given your designs locked in a picture

00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:01,320
and then you take that picture and you

00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:07,110
from a different Department and you make

00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:10,490
it go in Drupal and I'm having a lot of

00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:15,780
trouble convincing the people who design

00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:18,930
that they need to learn that this is a

00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:22,770
fluid medium and and their print

00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:24,660
designers so it's it's really hard to

00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:29,330
break them out of them old do you have

00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:32,340
any suggestions yes Suh coach designers

00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:33,420
so I actually worked in a similar

00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:36,359
situation for

00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:39,000
healthcare company so is it a very large

00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:41,490
organization yes and I'm assuming you

00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,160
probably work in different buildings as

00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:46,650
these folks across campus um they're

00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:49,260
probably I'm gonna say that they're

00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:54,630
probably a subsection of marketing where

00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:58,770
is you're probably an IT yes so been

00:50:54,630 --> 00:51:01,260
there real everybody yes so you know

00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:03,329
unfortunately the well unfortunately or

00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:06,990
fortunately depends on how you look at

00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:09,660
it the best thing that you can do is go

00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:13,049
to lunch with those designers or go by

00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:14,910
of a beer it's most likely the

00:51:13,049 --> 00:51:17,819
communication breakdown it's not that

00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:18,960
the designers saying has stupid Drupal

00:51:17,819 --> 00:51:22,470
developers they don't know what they're

00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:23,940
doing it's somewhere in between you and

00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:26,520
them it's somewhere within the

00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:30,420
organization if you actually go to them

00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:31,740
and explain some of the stuff I I would

00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,380
have a hard time thinking that they

00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:36,839
wouldn't want to accommodate that

00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:40,849
because they're great with branding yeah

00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:40,849
the color schemes in the cloth

00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:58,940
a lot of presents a lot of times when

00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:01,310
you're dealing with large organization

00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:03,110
where everything is separated it's just

00:52:01,310 --> 00:52:05,150
that people just don't know what you

00:52:03,110 --> 00:52:07,670
have to do it so you can communicate

00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:10,250
that to that like Caleb this is a giant

00:52:07,670 --> 00:52:12,260
hand and it's very very difficult and

00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:17,540
you can just do these few extra things

00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:22,550
and it would make my life and then there

00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:25,520
something that you can do in return just

00:52:22,550 --> 00:52:40,400
build a relationship I know it's not an

00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:43,730
easy technical solution that's why I've

00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:50,390
been traveling like crazy right I've got

00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:52,690
like three hours sleep unless its window

00:52:50,390 --> 00:52:52,690
