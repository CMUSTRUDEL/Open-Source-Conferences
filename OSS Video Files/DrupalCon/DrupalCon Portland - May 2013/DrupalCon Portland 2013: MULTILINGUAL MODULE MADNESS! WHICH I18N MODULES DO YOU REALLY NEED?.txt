Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: MULTILINGUAL MODULE MADNESS! WHICH I18N MODULES DO YOU REALLY NEED?
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	Configuring a multilingual site in Drupal 7 is not for the faint of heart. If you search for i18n-related modules on drupal.org, you'll find more than 100 listed! So, which ones do you really need? And, why?

This session will give a rundown of the myriad of multilingual Drupal modules as well as take a peek at what is coming up in Drupal 8. We will cover:

Must-use modules like i18n and friends
Core content translation vs. the Entity Translation module
Making the translation process easier for translators and content editors
Preview of how things will change (for the better!) in Drupal 8
Our goal will be to discuss the most important modules for creating a multilingual Drupal 7 site but we will also touch upon some optional modules that might make sense for certain sites.

Help Drupal 8: To make multilingual Drupal 8 site building much better, please get involved with the Drupal 8 Multilingual Initiative! You can also sprint with us before, during, and after the main DrupalCon Portland session days. And, of course, don't miss GÃ¡bor's Multilingual Drupal 8 - plans and reality session!

Earlier Drupal Versions: If you are still on Drupal 6, not to worry. Many of the modules discussed for Drupal 7 have been around for awhile and are applicable for Drupal 6 (and, in some cases, even earlier versions!).

Target Audience: This session is targeted at new Drupal developers and site builders as well as more experienced Drupalers who haven't built multilingual sites in Drupal. If you are an advanced Drupaler or have built multilingual Drupal sites, you should check out the other great sessions during this time slot :)

but in reality you go there you

00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:50,660
you

00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:49,350
is

00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,160
now

00:16:50,170 --> 00:17:12,130
so you can or you can as there are

00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:12,130
different

00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,920
I

00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:02,460
actually not doing

00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:50,290
so

00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:53,360
is something that you could make sure

00:29:11,030 --> 00:30:02,980
that your if you want to translate your

00:29:53,360 --> 00:30:10,910
text on terms using this rather than and

00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:17,780
a little there is right now or as few

00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:27,770
months ago I did try to go the route

00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:30,350
with taxonomy terms maybe I ran into you

00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:32,300
know or you can try it I mean I was

00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:33,800
drawn I like entity translation it's the

00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:36,460
way of the future you want to try to use

00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,460
it if you can

00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:07,190
so

00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:49,480
in my opinion API you can

00:39:37,850 --> 00:40:00,380
there are so if you are there just if

00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:00,380
you're branded if you're not

00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:14,990
he

00:44:44,490 --> 00:45:29,650
your interval shakes you're going to

00:44:46,690 --> 00:45:31,120
bypass someone needs to focus on weight

00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:44,080
all right you mean you're building a

00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:47,920
site now in DC so the enemy

00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:51,330
transcription is only from seven so

00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:51,330
you're stuck where you are

00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:42,710
most of the standard modules just have

00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:45,350
that gold in guilty the check you know

00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:51,560
so it's with a grain of salt just what

00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:57,250
you do is you go to the project page I

00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:57,250
etienne or multilingual and then usually

00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:28,390
we did run into a problem with mr.

00:47:19,490 --> 00:47:28,390
panels by now because

00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:46,040
right so lingotek I don't want to use

00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:51,820
third party service right probably you

00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:51,820
have to get them all and maybe

00:50:57,350 --> 00:51:00,590
for each

00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:37,150
so that is that is basically you're

00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:37,150
talking about having published and then

00:51:54,190 --> 00:52:01,580
and I am the first time drupalcon

00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:03,470
speaker so i would really appreciate it

00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:06,500
if you gave me some feedback negative

00:52:03,470 --> 00:52:16,369
I'm okay with that I just some feedback

00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:19,090
so if you can go the situation will be

00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:19,090
