Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: BEHAT, BEHAVIORAL-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT AND SELENIUM IN DRUPAL
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	Testing our applications is something we all do. Ahem, rather, it's something we all *wish* we did. In this talk, I'll introduce you to Behat: a behavior-driven-development library that allows you to write functional tests against your application just by writing human-readable sentences/scenarios. To sweeten the deal, Mink - Behat's BFF library - allows these tests to be run in a real browser (via Selenium2) if you choose. That's right: you write english sentence, Behat+Mink run them in a real browser.

We'll also talk about some of the special challenges when working with Behat in Drupal, including writing tests against a production server and bootstrapping Drupal in your tests for local development. Whatever your case, you'll come away with the know-how to stop wishing you had tests, and start writing them.
