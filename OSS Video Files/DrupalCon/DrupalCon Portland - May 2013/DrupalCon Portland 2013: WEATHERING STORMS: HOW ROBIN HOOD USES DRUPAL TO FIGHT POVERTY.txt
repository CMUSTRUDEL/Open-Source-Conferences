Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: WEATHERING STORMS: HOW ROBIN HOOD USES DRUPAL TO FIGHT POVERTY
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	Your typical day's traffic barely tips the scales ... until Lady Gaga tweets your project and the Black Eyed Peas decide to play Central Park on your behalf. Your crack content team has strategy and messaging down cold ... but they need to be developers to do just about anything to your website. Your site looks pretty good, considering it's age ... but your Board wants something radical and punchy for the project launching day-after-tomorrow.

Come get a guided tour to how these challenges were met and bested. Phase2 Technology and the Robin Hood Foundation will break down some key business challenges and lay out the technical architecture underpinning their elegant solution. We'll talk about clever ways to give content editors both incredible control over their content and amazing powers to develop rich mixed media content on their own. And if you stay till the end we'll share with you some of the secret sauce that allows this site to gracefully manage traffic spikes of up to 3000% without breaking a sweat.

A panel consisting of representatives from Robin Hood (www.robinhood.org) and Phase2 Technology (www.phase2technology.com/) will cover the following problem areas and talk about some of the magic behind our solutions:

Empowering the Editor: Flexible Content Templates - Highly customizable nested sections that editors can use to build complex new site areas that support embedding of content elements.
Multiple Personalities: Microsites: The ability for content editors to transform those complex sections into microsites with their own urls and navigation at the touch of a button to serve the need for quickly creating a highly branded, highly unique "microsite" presence dedicated to an event or project.
Bring it On: Highly Scalable Hosting: Strategies for handling the onslaught of celebrity endorsement driven traffic by building for quick and elegant scalability rather than building to (and paying for) an infrastructure to handle the worst-case scenario.

good morning everyone and hope

00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,810
everyone's having a great time at

00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:08,099
drupalcon on the last day and you guys

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,080
have been filling your heads with

00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:13,320
awesome drupal knowledge meeting great

00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:16,560
people as well as enjoying some of the

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:19,590
best that portlet has to offer so we're

00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,410
going to get started this is a panel k

00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:25,800
study weathering storms how Robin Hood

00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:28,170
uses Drupal to fight poverty and I'm

00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,689
gonna be introducing the project team as

00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:34,590
well as myself in a bit but I'm we're

00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:36,989
going to get started so um we also have

00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,390
a website and Robin Hood work and web

00:00:36,989 --> 00:00:41,219
page watch drupalcon and which has some

00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:45,480
social media links for Robin Hood

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,800
Foundation as well as we've got hashtag

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,300
PT Robin Hood if people have questions

00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,399
or want to connect with each other

00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:53,270
during the presentation and we can use

00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:58,350
that and we've got a Robin Hood NYC and

00:00:53,270 --> 00:01:00,090
at phase 2 on the triple con site and we

00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,570
have a follower counter at the bottom of

00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:06,570
the page which has the numbers of people

00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:08,070
that are supporting Robin Hood to fight

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,900
poverty as well as tracking Twitter

00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,510
followers so if anyone falls at Robin

00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,960
Hood NYC during the presentation we can

00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:22,759
see that number go up so we're at a 16

00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:25,680
to 200,000 230,000 164 right now so um

00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:27,780
moving on to introductions um my name is

00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,750
Molly burns and the project manager at

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,030
phase 2 technology and i joined the

00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,820
robin hood team at phase 2 right after

00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:36,960
phase one of the website launched and

00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,790
i've had the opportunity to work with

00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,530
heather johnson who's the senior

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,680
application manager at robin hood

00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,390
foundation who's the primary contact

00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,490
that we have working with all the

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,540
stakeholders at Robin Hood and working

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:53,610
on the web and Brian McMurray and it's a

00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,750
software architect at phase two he's

00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:57,719
working on a lot of the front and

00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:58,600
architecture of Robin Hood org Steve and

00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:00,549
Meryl

00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,369

00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:06,100
two technology and he's also one of our

00:02:03,369 --> 00:02:09,160
server hosting gurus so i'll be talking

00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:11,319
about web performance in later on in the

00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,380
session and less than at least we have

00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:16,180
John Robert Wilson who's working on

00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,319
software architect a phase two and he's

00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,500
been doing a lot of a back-end

00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:22,390
architecture for Robin Hood org so I'm

00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:27,280
with that Heather's going to jump in and

00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:29,050
talk a little bit the ground hood so

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,670
first of all we're really excited to

00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:32,440
have everybody here today thank you for

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:35,230
coming to our session we want to tell

00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:38,170
you a story about the Robin Hood

00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,550
Foundation and how phase two and our

00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,769
partnership with phase two helped us

00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:43,540
solve some pretty significant challenges

00:02:41,769 --> 00:02:46,690
that we had with our website and with

00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,280
our organization first of all though I

00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:50,340
want to give you a little bit of insight

00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,310
into the robin hood foundation itself

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:57,310
robin hood isn't really that well-known

00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:59,950
mostly by by design robin hood tries to

00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,799
put all of its energy into publicizing

00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:05,260
the efforts of its grantees and stays

00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:07,570
kind of behind the scenes but in general

00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,030
what we are is foundation based in New

00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:13,000
York City's primary mission is fighting

00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:15,340
poverty and there are a few things that

00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,440
make Robin Hood especially unique

00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:22,200
relative to other foundations of its

00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:25,120
kind one of them is that out of almost

00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,299
30,000 poverty fighting focused

00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,060
organizations in New York Robin Hood

00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:34,900
actually finds and funds about two

00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:36,340
hundred give or take of those so right

00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:40,030
off the bat we're looking to find the

00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,340
very best grantees and by very best we

00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:46,000
mean the most effective as measured by

00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:48,250
hardcore concrete metrics so Robin it

00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:51,130
takes a very specific kind of approach

00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,810
to measuring the effectiveness of its

00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,030
grantees and puts the burden on the

00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:57,040
grantee to show that they are actually

00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,100
delivering on the mission that they set

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,989
out to perform another thing that makes

00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,420
us really unique relative to other

00:04:01,989 --> 00:04:06,699
foundations is that we give one hundred

00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,609
percent of the money donated to the

00:04:06,699 --> 00:04:11,500
foundation back to our grantees and this

00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:12,040
is something that is possible through

00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,799
the generous

00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:17,739
city of our board which pays all of our

00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,530
operating costs robin hood has no

00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:22,750
endowment so if you give five dollars to

00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:24,940
Robin Hood today your money will

00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:27,160
immediately go into the field within a

00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,840
very short period of time we don't hold

00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,570
on to the money and distribute it years

00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,190
later and we'll talk a lot more about

00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:36,039
this later but as an example of that

00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:38,919
with hurricane sandy relief which Robin

00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:42,550
Hood took a leading role in we collected

00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:44,349
around 70 million dollars in the service

00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:49,270
of Sandy relief all of which has now

00:04:44,349 --> 00:04:52,449
been distributed to our grantees we do

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:54,910
expect a lot of these grantees but we

00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:58,720
don't put them in a position to perform

00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:00,639
all by themselves we ask our grantees to

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,130
show performance we ask them to show

00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,750
success but we also help them so we have

00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:07,389
what we call management assistance

00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:09,070
program where grantees can learn to do

00:05:07,389 --> 00:05:12,520
things like make the equivalent of a

00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:14,590
business plan if they need help by way

00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,720
of legal services even technology

00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,240
services we have people on staff who

00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,599
helped them with that stuff we help

00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:25,360
staff their own boards and we help them

00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:27,310
to basically turn around and show us the

00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,500
very things that we're hoping to be

00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:34,030
shown by them the the measures of those

00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:35,979
successes so just a couple of quick

00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,330
things about Robin Hood despite our not

00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:39,250
really being all that well known

00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:42,990
particularly outside of New York City we

00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:46,690
are New York City's largest private

00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:49,570
poverty fighting organization we're also

00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:52,690
the largest private funder of emergency

00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:55,030
food in New York City we are the largest

00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:59,380
private funder of job training programs

00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:02,139
in New York City and as well as as all

00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:05,560
of those services we have provided a

00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:10,180
first-class education to over 45,000

00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:12,220
children in in the city Robin Hood is

00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:16,930
the largest private funder of homeless

00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:19,210
shelters in New York City it also

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,800
provides the largest amount of

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:24,990
assistance in the private sector to

00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,990
programs that help newborns

00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:33,990
despite having that kind of breath Robin

00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:37,180
Hood about two years ago say mid-2011

00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:40,060
had a number of significant challenges

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:43,210
with its website for our organization

00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:45,520
the website is critical it doesn't get a

00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:48,550
whole lot of traffic well at least not

00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:51,310
on an ordinary day-to-day basis but it

00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:54,340
is an extremely important marketing tool

00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,379
to target very high end owners and as

00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,939
such it needs to be slick it needs to

00:06:56,379 --> 00:07:00,699
work it needs to be effective in

00:06:57,939 --> 00:07:02,349
communicating our message unfortunately

00:07:00,699 --> 00:07:05,319
it did none of these things two years

00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:07,960
ago and today we want to talk with you

00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:10,000
about three very specific challenges

00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,370
that our website had to meet and that

00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,979
were effectively met as we partnered

00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:17,020
with phase two technologies the first of

00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:20,770
those is just the challenge of

00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:24,460
unleashing our editors in 2011 we were

00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:26,740
on a 10 year old dotnet based site with

00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,569
almost no ability to edit anything

00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,930
without the assistance of a developer

00:07:28,569 --> 00:07:35,020
that had to change Robin Hood hires the

00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:38,560
best in terms of its digital staffers

00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:40,449
and it wasn't cool to allow them to have

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,580
their hands tied in the way that they

00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:48,520
were in mid-2011 in addition Robin Hood

00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:51,029
is frequently engaged in very very large

00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,680
scale events many of which require

00:07:51,029 --> 00:07:55,330
unique branding and a completely

00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,839
different approach to messaging our

00:07:55,330 --> 00:08:01,120
website basically couldn't be used to

00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:02,560
serve any of those purposes any time we

00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,599
did a major event we had to create a

00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,599
brand new micro site from scratch which

00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:11,680
was extremely not cost-effective and in

00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,240
very time consuming and finally while I

00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,009
did mention that we don't get a lot of

00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,229
traffic on a day-to-day basis there are

00:08:15,009 --> 00:08:19,330
some extremely significant exceptions to

00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:21,639
that Robin Hood is about the spiky

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:24,310
astorga nization I've ever heard of in

00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:26,379
terms of traffic and so while it's true

00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,599
that day to day our infrastructure needs

00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:32,320
were relatively that you know

00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:34,089
uninteresting on occasion we really

00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,089
really need to step it up and we wanted

00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:38,200
to do that in a cost-effective but also

00:08:37,089 --> 00:08:40,750
very effect

00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,400
of way and so that was our third

00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:46,450
challenge something we approached face

00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:48,790
to with in the fall of 2011 so with that

00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:50,500
I'll turn it back over to Molly who'll

00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:52,990
tell you a little bit about phase 2 and

00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:56,980
then we'll hear from our team as to how

00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:59,560
we met these challenges and these two is

00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:03,910
a general strategy and development

00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:06,580
agency and we're basically solving a lot

00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,980
of problems for our clients and working

00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:11,260
really hard to understand the business

00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:14,020
as the organizational challenges and

00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:18,000
really making sure that we can deliver

00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:22,180
solutions that are really innovative and

00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,190
provide a lot of high value and so with

00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:26,740
that and we're going to talk about some

00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:29,830
of the challenges that Robin Hood had

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:31,780
came to face to it and we worked through

00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:34,690
a discovery process initially which is

00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:37,060
sort of when we talk through and do a

00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,280
lot of interviews and discuss all the

00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,440
issues before we actually go ahead and

00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:48,600
build something and out of this process

00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:51,340
and came Robin Hood Denmark so so

00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:54,340
challenge number one for us was about

00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:57,070
unleashing our editors as I mentioned we

00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:59,020
were in an extremely limited position

00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:02,290
when it came to making changes to our

00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:06,400
website specifically our site header in

00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:08,440
2011 was all flash we had nope no

00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,660
concept of anything like a content type

00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,820
if we needed to do anything new with our

00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:15,820
data or we needed to display it in a

00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:18,970
particularly new way we were either out

00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:21,550
of luck or we had to employ the services

00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:24,850
of a developer our content team had

00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:26,920
their hands practically tied when it

00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:29,380
came to rithi mming changing the look

00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,540
and feel of our site it was a similar

00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:33,570
story we really were not not in a

00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:35,890
position to do that either at all

00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:37,690
depending on the time line requirements

00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:40,300
of our project or we had to go outside

00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:42,070
of the scope of our team to hire

00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:44,440
development firm to create a brand new

00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:48,870
site for some specific branding effort

00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:51,029
so we were definitely in a bad place

00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:53,279
performance-wise we had a single web

00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:56,400
server with a single database sitting on

00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,920
physical hardware at Rackspace it was

00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,050
adequate most of the time but once again

00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,310
completely inadequate for certain

00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:05,700
special needs that you're going to get

00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:07,170
to hear more about momentarily so our

00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:09,300
first challenge we want to tell you

00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:11,310
about today is this business of

00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:13,710
unleashing our editors and giving our

00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:16,110
digital team back the control that they

00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:17,400
deserved of our site so Brian's going to

00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:21,029
tell you a little bit about how we did

00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,950
that so I'd like to take you back a few

00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:25,740
years if you remember about two years

00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:28,620
ago drupal 7 was just getting out of the

00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:30,600
gates and you've probably seen this

00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,420
graphic before this is from a few years

00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,700
back this is a picture of how a drupal

00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:38,160
developer might think about a page when

00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:40,529
you're when you're considering building

00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,200
something out it's a mixture of you know

00:11:40,529 --> 00:11:46,860
views slideshows or views listings

00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,450
blocks and node content and menus and

00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:51,810
panels and all these sorts of things and

00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:55,200
each of these then and also still now

00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:58,589
really has many different interfaces to

00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:01,380
to work with there's not one consistent

00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:03,870
editor experience you need to know a

00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:06,360
whole lot of the Drupal jargon and

00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,670
methodology to really work with this

00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,640
method and when we were talking with

00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:12,750
Robin Hood you know they just didn't

00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,070
know what to do with this they weren't

00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:16,050
familiar with Drupal they hadn't been

00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:19,200
working with it for years like some of

00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:21,740
us have when they thought about content

00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,180
this is what they thought everything is

00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:26,630
content and they want to be able to

00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:30,860
change and edit and adapt everything

00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:34,320
very easily with a consistent experience

00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,730
in addition as we started to see the

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,830
designs that they are working through

00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:40,440
they started to look like this these

00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:42,630
highly designed pages that don't really

00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:47,250
fit this the common metaphors of

00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:48,420
sidebars and content areas and you know

00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:50,670
perhaps you might be wondering well

00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,920
couldn't you just use panels well panels

00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:55,440
two years ago was a little hard to use

00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,390
and didn't quite work with revisions and

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,139
workflow and these were things that we

00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:02,120
were concerned about

00:12:59,139 --> 00:13:06,680
we really wanted to build a system that

00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:09,860
would let Robin Hood's editors be very

00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:12,019
free to create anything that they could

00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,639
dream up with their design agency or

00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:17,180
just on their own with their own

00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:18,680
creativity and an additional a number of

00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,959
these things that they were starting to

00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,569
think about were interactive content so

00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:25,339
areas of these graphics weren't just

00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:27,860
static images they were actually going

00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:29,959
to be interactive pieces that you could

00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,449
enter you know you could click on and

00:13:29,959 --> 00:13:34,790
touch on your mobile devices and play

00:13:32,449 --> 00:13:36,800
with and in the past you've probably

00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:39,110
thought about interactive content and

00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,939
you think okay we need to build you know

00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,800
something special in JavaScript or we

00:13:40,939 --> 00:13:44,959
need to build something special in flash

00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,389
and in order to get data into it we need

00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,279
to build a whole separate area inside of

00:13:47,389 --> 00:13:51,199
our Drupal site to manage that content

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,899
and or maybe it's just going to be an

00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:56,209
XML file and in order to update the the

00:13:53,899 --> 00:13:58,160
data that goes into that flash piece you

00:13:56,209 --> 00:14:00,500
know we need to like update an XML file

00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,000
on the server somewhere that's not what

00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,470
we wanted to do and that's not how they

00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,120
wanted to work with it that they found

00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:08,059
that a really frustrating experience on

00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,529
their previous site so we created this

00:14:08,059 --> 00:14:11,240
thing that jer's going to tell you about

00:14:09,529 --> 00:14:16,939
a little more called template field

00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:20,620
which helped us to to work through this

00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:23,569
create super flexible content areas and

00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,939
even enable us to create interactive

00:14:23,569 --> 00:14:28,670
content areas that all have a similar

00:14:25,939 --> 00:14:30,949
inconsistent editor experience the way

00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:32,839
we put this site together we called a

00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:36,319
constant we you know we reused the term

00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:38,600
pain pulling it from the panel's world

00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:40,389
but we called these pains these sort of

00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,189
content chunks that we're going to be

00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:45,589
reusable and customizable on it on a per

00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:47,779
page basis and then we assembled them

00:14:45,589 --> 00:14:50,059
together in you know another concept we

00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:53,420
called pain stacks which is basically

00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:56,930
just a bunch of content chunks brought

00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:59,769
together and and displayed as one

00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,769
consistent page

00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:08,550
cool thanks Brian so I'm going to talk

00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:11,820
about beams for a second so out of the

00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:14,190
box there is a different workflow

00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,900
process between blocks and nodes and

00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:17,760
what we were just talking about people

00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,590
that actually use the sites that we

00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,450
built for him consider these things as

00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:23,790
content they're the same thing in their

00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:25,440
head but out of the box there are two

00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:27,840
different workflow processes for

00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:30,660
creating and placing blocks and creating

00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:32,250
content so there's this module called

00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:33,990
beam that was written by Neil Hastings

00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:36,000
and main time maintained by a lot of

00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:37,530
other smart people right now there's the

00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,960
link for you that have your laptop's all

00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:42,870
right now and what it does is introduces

00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:47,040
things these things called beam entities

00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:49,770
these block entities aren't nodes and it

00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,460
bridges this this gap this disconnect

00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:55,890
between these two pieces of Drupal media

00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:59,340
that should be that end users consider

00:15:55,890 --> 00:16:00,960
content and it makes the editorial

00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:05,130
process behind managing blocks a lot

00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:08,070
more similar to managing nodes so beam

00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:10,830
adds an editorial you I similar to the

00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:13,680
node content creation to your Drupal

00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:15,690
site so they're entities so they're feel

00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,550
double and type Obol just like nodes are

00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:20,460
feel double and type of alike content

00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:23,820
types so there's one more disconnect

00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:25,350
though a lot of site editors a lot of

00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,990
site builders generally place blocks

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:30,900
using context the context isn't the most

00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:33,810
site end user friendly tool so that

00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,550
bridge this last piece of disconnect we

00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:38,850
use a module called embeddable an

00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:42,450
embeddable adds a button to your WYSIWYG

00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:43,890
editor that allows you to embed beams or

00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:45,990
other blocks that you've defined in the

00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:49,590
system directly into your WYSIWYG body

00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:51,180
so an editor can go in create a beam and

00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:53,520
when they're editing their pains their

00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,740
notes they can place the blocks directly

00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,810
into the content without and it's one

00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:02,160
workflow all its all content to them and

00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:04,020
it's all one process so Brian mentioned

00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,620
the module earlier called template field

00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:10,199
and we use template field to give the

00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:12,400
site editors a choice on what layouts

00:17:10,199 --> 00:17:14,950
they wanted to use a per pain in

00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,810
each pain in the pain stack and so we

00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,970
got up here on the screen as just some

00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:20,860
examples of some templates that are

00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:23,470
available to our site editors you'll

00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:25,360
notice that the top for our layout

00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:29,020
specific so we have you know fifty fifty

00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:30,910
columns 6633 columns three-column layout

00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,740
but you can also see at the bottom we

00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:35,380
also give the editors the ability to

00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:37,450
have interactive pieces so template

00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,880
field doesn't necessarily have to be lay

00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:42,610
out specific it can be media specific or

00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:45,040
interactive specific it's always up to

00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:48,280
you to decide what those templates are

00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:49,960
and what the mark-up is for when they

00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:51,940
choose a template and they use it so

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,090
just to show a little example of what it

00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:57,130
looks like to the end user this is just

00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:58,810
what your standard two column layout it

00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,280
creates a fieldset so you can see

00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:03,550
there's a top metal left middle right

00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,470
and bottom and it just provides a simple

00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:08,890
WYSIWYG text area and the editors can

00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:10,600
use all the predefined styles and as the

00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:14,830
site scheme the site color scheme to

00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:16,090
provide to make nice rich simple layouts

00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:17,710
but then in the end that they're all

00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,450
laid out with the correct template that

00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:23,170
the editor uses and I'll talk a little

00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:25,630
bit more about these text editors and

00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:27,400
and how we use these WYSIWYG editors to

00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:33,190
empower editors I'll let Brian talk a

00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:36,340
little bit more about that so you're

00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:38,620
probably thinking WYSIWYG what are they

00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,360
doing with WYSIWYG Karen McGrane was

00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,800
talking all about how terrible was he

00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,690
would kill me and you're probably

00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:46,360
thinking just like I was thinking a few

00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:50,860
years ago when we use a WYSIWYG all we

00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:52,270
get is a whole bunch of junk we really

00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,580
didn't want to do that but we really

00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:58,330
wanted to give our editors a lot of

00:18:54,580 --> 00:19:02,470
power and to control everything from

00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:04,750
font choices and a color to you know

00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:08,170
links and adding images and adding these

00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:11,710
interactive widgets these beans so

00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:13,660
really we we try to change that and we

00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:17,100
worked a lot with the WYSIWYG API to

00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:21,250
create a WYSIWYG editor that kept

00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:24,010
editors on brand on message with all the

00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:27,040
tools that they needed to quickly get to

00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:29,020
you know brand style guidelines but also

00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,080
give them the freedom to create within

00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:33,730
that system so again here's a picture of

00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,520
one of these pains or these template

00:19:33,730 --> 00:19:38,920
field areas that were using on the site

00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,740
these content chunks there's a lot going

00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:43,690
on here and this is only one example of

00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,960
many different types of designs that

00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:49,090
need to be functional within the system

00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:52,090
the way this gets put together as JR was

00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:54,250
showing before quickly is we've got a

00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:57,940
number of different WYSIWYG spaces

00:19:54,250 --> 00:20:00,460
within our template pains and in each

00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:02,470
area content editors can just go in and

00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:04,750
start working we use a little bit of

00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:06,610
extra JavaScript to change the

00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,260
background color of our WYSIWYG editor

00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:10,210
when they pick a background color for

00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:12,220
their template area so that they can

00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:14,530
actually see this and something pretty

00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:18,040
close to what's going to actually show

00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:22,990
up on the front end in addition we use

00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:25,990
the WYSIWYG API to go in and change the

00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:28,360
default options of things like the color

00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:30,400
picker so that their initial choices are

00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,290
immediately only the brand approved

00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,330
color set so they don't have to mess

00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:36,580
with you know hex colors and trying to

00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:39,160
look those up and find them again if

00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:41,230
they need to go off brand there is still

00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,940
the ability through the more colors

00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:45,490
option to you know get into a color

00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:47,110
picker and actually you know pick

00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:49,810
something totally unique and we'll talk

00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:53,020
about cases where they surprised us with

00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:55,240
this in a little bit in addition we

00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:57,760
provided a whole bunch of default styles

00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,500
into the WYSIWYG that allow them to just

00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,900
select their text and pick a style that

00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:05,500
puts them right into the correct styling

00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:07,960
for a header or an area with a special

00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:10,780
icon to call out text or a call to

00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:13,150
action to sort of link and all of this

00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:16,450
together gave our editors a whole lot of

00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:19,450
power to you know create and be creative

00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:22,840
within the content system that we set up

00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:25,630
and still stay very close to the brand

00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:28,180
guidelines without you know forcing them

00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:28,759
to use hundreds of fields to set colors

00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,669
and

00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:34,590
you know right little text and lots and

00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:37,049
lots of extra theming they've got a

00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:39,029
whole lot of flexibility here and almost

00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:40,639
never do we you know we as the

00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:49,169
developers of the website have to get

00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:52,769
involved to to fix something for them so

00:21:49,169 --> 00:21:55,019
having spent all this time setting up

00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:58,139
this fantastic back into admin interface

00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:59,759
for our editors you can imagine that

00:21:58,139 --> 00:22:02,759
when we got finished with this project

00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:04,799
they were pretty happy they were in fact

00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:06,360
ecstatic they felt for the first time

00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,100
like they could get in and really get

00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,450
their hands dirty and take control of

00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,999
the site in a way that they hadn't been

00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:15,059
able to do in a decade and so they were

00:22:11,999 --> 00:22:17,159
really happy but I'm sure that everybody

00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:19,320
has worked in context like this before

00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:23,309
the happiness the complacency it never

00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:26,820
lasts and we had a digital director who

00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:30,119
loved this but it also kind of created a

00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:33,869
monster in the sense that he wanted just

00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:39,090
that much more and so we were thinking

00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:42,869
about exactly what more meant when at

00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:46,289
the end of October last year hurricane

00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:49,110
sandy hit and suddenly necessity was the

00:22:46,289 --> 00:22:51,059
mother of invention so I'm sure

00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:53,039
everybody in the room knows the story of

00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:55,259
Hurricane sandy was one of the worst

00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,659
storms to ever impact the East Coast and

00:22:55,259 --> 00:23:00,299
it had particularly huge effect on New

00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:02,399
York New Jersey and Connecticut Robin

00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:04,740
Hood as an organization generally limits

00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:08,279
its charitable efforts to new york city

00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:10,619
proper and in the outer boroughs but for

00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:12,899
the first time in its history Robin Hood

00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:15,840
expanded its relief effort to

00:23:12,899 --> 00:23:19,309
incorporate counties in New Jersey and

00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:22,950
Connecticut that were impacted by Sandy

00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:25,830
Robin Hood raised in the course of less

00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:27,840
than a month after sandy hit almost 15

00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:29,600
million dollars and that wasn't the end

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:32,009
of it that was just in the first month

00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,980
but in connection with that effort the

00:23:32,009 --> 00:23:38,070
website played a critical role and one

00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:40,049
of the things that we found out maybe

00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,570
two or three weeks into the relief

00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:43,419
effort

00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:47,190
Robin Hood was that somebody had an even

00:23:43,419 --> 00:23:50,230
bigger idea than that 15 million dollars

00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:52,450
specifically the Weinstein group and

00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:54,730
chase came up with the idea to create

00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:57,759
what would end up being the biggest

00:23:54,730 --> 00:24:00,730
music event in history the 12 12 12

00:23:57,759 --> 00:24:03,039
relief concert and they wanted to make

00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:05,139
the robin hood foundation the sole

00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:10,240
benefactor of funds raised through that

00:24:05,139 --> 00:24:12,250
effort we quickly learned as the web

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,490
team behind this effort that the website

00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:17,799
would be the vehicle for live streaming

00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:21,610
the event collecting donations for the

00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:24,250
event we had three and a half weeks to

00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:27,429
prepare for this and we were told to

00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:32,169
expect as much as 450 million unique

00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:34,809
users in five hours to make matters

00:24:32,169 --> 00:24:36,850
worse we were told that the site needed

00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:40,029
to go through three distinct design

00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:42,190
iterations we would start out hosting it

00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:44,470
on Robin Hood org but it had to have a

00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:47,080
completely unique look and feel relative

00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:49,539
to the rest of the site within about a

00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:52,240
week we would completely revamp that and

00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:55,090
give it a second design look and feel

00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,250
and then we would finally launched with

00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:59,740
something that was unique relative to

00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:01,600
those first two iterations once again

00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:03,789
this needed to all be done in three and

00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,009
a half weeks by our small team and the

00:25:03,789 --> 00:25:09,039
help of our excellent partners at phase

00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:10,990
two in the end and I'm kind of giving

00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:13,090
away the punch line here but we did

00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:14,830
raise over 50 million dollars in

00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:18,100
connection with this event for sandy

00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:20,710
relief but before we get to that I'll

00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:23,440
let Brian talk and Molly talk a little

00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:25,710
bit about how we got there and what some

00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,049
of the challenges were in the meantime

00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:32,620
to introduce how phase two came on the

00:25:29,049 --> 00:25:34,480
scene we sat in a senior staff meeting

00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:39,129
one afternoon when we were talking about

00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:40,840
the three design iteration issue and we

00:25:39,129 --> 00:25:42,700
had already done a little bit of work on

00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,629
the existing platform to create a

00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:48,730
beautiful 12 12 12 page but our senior

00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:51,039
staff said you know Robin Hood's the

00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:53,950
benefactor of this but we are the

00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:56,409
beneficiary rather of this but we are

00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:57,970
not looking to publicize our brand

00:25:56,409 --> 00:26:00,279
through it at all in fact we think that

00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:02,350
would be completely inappropriate so

00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:04,809
what we need you to do is get rid of

00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:07,690
anything on this site that says anything

00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:09,220
Robin Hood but still plz host it on the

00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:11,200
Robin Hood site because we love these

00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:15,570
wonderful tools that you've built for us

00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:18,309
over the last year can you do that so I

00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:22,269
texted Molly from the meeting and I said

00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:25,779
Molly can we do that and within 20

00:26:22,269 --> 00:26:28,659
minutes we got the answer so yes we

00:26:25,779 --> 00:26:30,519
could do it but this is actually a

00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:33,370
question that comes up a lot and I've

00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:35,950
seen it in my previous work in the music

00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:38,830
industry where people want a branded

00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:42,130
separate experience and with the move

00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:45,460
from kind of a step static ftp based web

00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:47,230
to more of a dynamic CMS we don't really

00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:50,289
necessarily have the option to just

00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:52,120
upload a new site into a folder and take

00:26:50,289 --> 00:26:54,610
advantage of all of the workflows that

00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:57,880
we've built in that Brian and Jared have

00:26:54,610 --> 00:27:00,220
already talked about and so um you know

00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:02,740
attacked with Brian and said well what

00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:04,529
can we do and turns out the way that we

00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:07,510
had already architected the site um

00:27:04,529 --> 00:27:11,649
allowed us to put a pretty cool solution

00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:14,200
together yeah so when when Molly and

00:27:11,649 --> 00:27:16,299
Heather first asked me can we remove all

00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:19,000
the Robin Hood branding and make up

00:27:16,299 --> 00:27:21,580
essentially a microsite within the

00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,120
Drupal site without writing a new theme

00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:27,309
or writing some static HTML and dropping

00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,380
in a directory and they still wanted to

00:27:27,309 --> 00:27:30,909
be able to to tweak this content they

00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:32,049
were constantly tweaking the content

00:27:30,909 --> 00:27:35,049
throughout this whole three and a half

00:27:32,049 --> 00:27:36,880
week period it was a little shocking you

00:27:35,049 --> 00:27:39,490
know like typically when you think about

00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,260
those like sorts of requests and you and

00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:43,570
your told it needs to be live and

00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:46,720
basically less than a week for the first

00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:48,130
version you're stuck with a few

00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,679
decisions you know you can write that

00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:52,659
static HTML site put it all in code and

00:27:50,679 --> 00:27:54,669
take away all of your content editors

00:27:52,659 --> 00:27:57,190
ability to tweak and work with it unless

00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:59,600
they can handle you know working with

00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:04,160
get and your deployment process or some

00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:06,830
or you can write a whole new site you

00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:08,780
know start a new WordPress or Drupal

00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:11,150
site right off the bat and see what

00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:13,820
happens but then you still have to like

00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:16,309
build that and you have to theme it and

00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:19,370
that's that's not a quick effort

00:28:16,309 --> 00:28:20,809
necessarily and when you've got lots of

00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:22,700
design iterations coming you don't

00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:25,760
necessarily want to redo that multiple

00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:27,530
times and the other you no other choice

00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,419
is to try and write a new drupal theme

00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:31,549
and get it to work with the site in a

00:28:29,419 --> 00:28:33,409
very quick way but if you haven't built

00:28:31,549 --> 00:28:35,600
a site that's going to be switching

00:28:33,409 --> 00:28:37,370
themes really quickly that can be you

00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,039
know quite a headache to try and put

00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:42,350
together in a short period of time and

00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:46,309
what we found is within a few hours of

00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:48,650
the Robin Hood mobilizing to start

00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:50,659
working with Sandy relief they had

00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:52,370
already started creating these pain stat

00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:54,110
pages in the site that we're starting to

00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:57,530
look different than the rest of the site

00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:59,150
in some some big ways and so we kind of

00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:01,250
thought well what if we just give them a

00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:03,950
check box on their pain stacks that

00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:06,049
turns off all of the rest of the Robin

00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:07,640
Hood regions that add you know the the

00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:09,320
branded header and the branded footer

00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,929
and then they would just have

00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,580
essentially a microsite in a page they

00:29:11,929 --> 00:29:16,250
could do anything they wanted with their

00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:18,200
content pains they could add new images

00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:19,669
they could add all the content that they

00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:22,400
want they already had the tools to

00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:24,890
change colors and fonts they could do

00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:27,679
everything they needed to within the

00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:29,570
system we had already built so that's

00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,179
what happened the the entire solution

00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:34,850
was a single checkbox and you know four

00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:37,669
or five lines of code and that got us

00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:39,950
through this this huge thing they were

00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:43,640
able to constantly tweak their content

00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:45,770
and constantly tweak the design and

00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:49,070
update it on their own without us having

00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:50,690
to be involved to to help them through

00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:54,020
that effort they were able to use the

00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:56,480
tools that already existed to pull off

00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,799
something really amazing so again you

00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,179
know they were able to just create

00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:02,210
different panes and put them together

00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:05,270
into a paint stack that really built out

00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:09,110
these totally different microsite

00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:11,030
experiences and and you know we'll hear

00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:13,190
a little more from Stephen in a few

00:30:11,030 --> 00:30:15,860
minutes but when the request came

00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:18,140
you know what about putting this on a

00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:20,810
different domain instead of it being at

00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:23,420
Robin Hood org slash something or at a

00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:26,300
subdomain can it be at an entirely

00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:28,640
different domain we are super pleasantly

00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,590
surprised to find that the architecture

00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,880
that we've already put into building

00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:36,320
this server server infrastructure was

00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:43,970
going to help us out in a really big way

00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:48,230
too so that takes us to challenge number

00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:50,690
three you probably heard me say two

00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:52,310
things earlier on during the course of

00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:53,930
this presentation so far that seemed

00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:57,410
completely in conflict with one another

00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:59,750
one is that Robin Hood usually has very

00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:04,940
little traffic to speak of and the other

00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:07,520
is 450 million uniques in five hours so

00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:10,310
we had to do something that would enable

00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:13,250
us to handle incredible spikes of

00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:15,290
traffic and this was to be to be honest

00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:17,210
this is a pretty unique situation I

00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:19,310
don't know that we would expect to see

00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:21,770
again a situation in which we were given

00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:24,320
those kinds of numbers but in general

00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:26,120
Robin Hood does have extremely spiky

00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,190
traffic about two weeks ago we were

00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,150
featured on 60 minutes so if some of you

00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:31,220
are trying to think about where he might

00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:33,920
have heard a Robin Hood that might be it

00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:35,360
and that certainly spiked us

00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:38,840
considerably at about a nineteen

00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:42,380
thousand percent spike in unique users

00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:44,600
during that broadcast we had the black

00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:47,480
eyed peas play concert in Central Park

00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:50,120
for us two years ago that obviously had

00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,820
a big effect Lady Gaga played our annual

00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:55,190
benefit and she was at the time the most

00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:57,920
followed person on Twitter and tweeted

00:31:55,190 --> 00:32:00,500
us which was a blessing and a curse so

00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:03,280
we really needed to be able to handle

00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:06,350
these kinds of variations in traffic and

00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:08,480
so Stephen Merrill whom I'm sure many of

00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:10,700
you know and love helped build the

00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:13,190
infrastructure behind Robin Hood org and

00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:15,650
also behind what became our 12 12 12

00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:19,150
site he's going to talk a little bit

00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:19,150
more about the magic behind that

00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,440
so as Heather mentioned there were a

00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:26,720
couple of hosting challenges with Robin

00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,690
Hood org obviously their existing

00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,880
website was a set of physical hardware

00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:34,700
with their legacy CMS that lived in a

00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,570
datacenter Rackspace and as Heather

00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,730
mentioned there were quite a few

00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:39,260
event-driven traffic spikes and so we

00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:41,149
wanted to be able to without needing to

00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:43,220
involve phase two without needing to

00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:45,470
involve the Robin Hood team make sure

00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:48,080
that we could scale to meet any sort of

00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:50,330
demand there's also always security

00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,830
considerations when putting on

00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,210
high-profile sites like this you have to

00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:55,340
make sure that they're secure we won't

00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,600
talk too much about that just some other

00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:58,429
things for building out the initial

00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,770
version of the Drupal site like any

00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:02,510
large organization Robin use Robin Hood

00:33:00,770 --> 00:33:04,820
uses a number of different systems to

00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:06,740
manage its data so for example one of

00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:08,690
the big systems that it uses to manage

00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:11,330
information about its grantees is the

00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:13,669
open-source sugarcrm product so we had

00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:15,740
to be able to have sugar be the

00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:17,299
canonical source of data for grantee

00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:19,220
information and just have an automated

00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:21,440
process to import it into the website

00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:23,510
and finally the the most important one

00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,520
here is the last one that when we built

00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:27,679
the initial version of the site there

00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:29,750
were sort of two parts to it Drupal for

00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,640
the content side of the site using the

00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:33,320
tools that we had talked about but that

00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,820
the donation portion of the site still

00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,380
lived on their existing net

00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:38,510
infrastructures in other words in order

00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,039
to make it much more painless to launch

00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:41,600
we decided that we would start out with

00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:43,520
using Drupal for the majority of the

00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,770
pages but still have the ability to use

00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:47,919
their tested and true donation system on

00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:50,210
net so we had to have some way to

00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,159
seamlessly to the user be able to

00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:54,770
deliver certain pages out of Drupal and

00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,120
certain pages out of the dotnet

00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,260
infrastructure and of course we've since

00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:00,409
actually switched it so that the

00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:02,390
donations are also powered by drupal so

00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:03,740
in in coming to this Robin Hood had a

00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:05,149
decent amount of familiarity with the

00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:07,159
lamp stack and with other hosting

00:34:05,149 --> 00:34:09,200
providers because they had hosted some

00:34:07,159 --> 00:34:11,599
of their things like Sugar CRM or some

00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:14,359
of their micro sites on the lamp stack

00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,010
using custom PHP or other applications

00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:17,960
but we wanted to make sure that we could

00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:19,580
also in this theme of scaling up to meet

00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,530
demand be able to really easily add

00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:23,270
machines have their configuration in

00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:26,780
known state so we use two different

00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:28,730
tools to accomplish this we used puppet

00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:29,990
for the configuration management part of

00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,310
this in other words for all three of

00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:32,750
their environments which include a

00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:35,929
single machine

00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:37,639
a three machine stage and a six machine

00:34:35,929 --> 00:34:39,020
production infrastructure everything is

00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:41,270
provisioned by puppet and what that

00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:42,860
means is that if it would come to the

00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:44,990
case where Robin Hood needs to spin up

00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,490
another web head they could add it based

00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:48,110
on the name pattern it would come up

00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:49,580
with the appropriate set of services so

00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:52,760
they named it web three would come up

00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:54,770
with the lamp stack and with the you

00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:57,710
know ready to be tab Drupal deployed to

00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:59,960
it since puppet was also new to most

00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:01,910
folks Robin Hood's security folks are

00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,730
already familiar with it as for we we

00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:06,650
also utilized vagrant and what vagrant

00:35:04,730 --> 00:35:08,600
is is a really fantastic piece of

00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:10,970
open-source software that allows you to

00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:13,070
basically create your own local dev

00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:15,680
environment using a virtual machine so

00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:18,290
vagrant itself runs on mac OS 10 on

00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,720
linux or windows and then it can spin up

00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:22,700
pretty much any unix e or linux e type

00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,380
of vm for you so with all these

00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,610
configurations of all the things that

00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,080
i'll tell you about in a bit any

00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:28,790
developer on their first day on the

00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,190
project can go in and clone to

00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:33,470
repositories type vagrant up which will

00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:35,600
download a vm image and which will apply

00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:36,950
all this configuration you'd have to go

00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,780
and you know maybe make yourself some

00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:40,370
coffee toast a bagel but when you come

00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,810
back you've got the full stack up and

00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:44,540
ready to go and so this means that you

00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:46,460
can easily test with the entire stack

00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:47,810
and it means you can also test changes

00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,160
before they even hit any hosting

00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:50,870
environment so if you decide you want to

00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,150
change around the configuration of your

00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:54,920
cache server you can test that locally

00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:59,060
before you even put that into a standard

00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:01,460
workflow so I also mentioned that Robin

00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:03,950
Hood had some systems hosted at

00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,630
Rackspace and you know there are

00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:08,930
certainly quite a few options out there

00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:10,730
for hosting a Drupal site Robin Hood had

00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:13,400
actually used other cloud providers for

00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:15,320
some of their micro sites but we decided

00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,800
to use Rackspace for a couple different

00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:20,840
reasons the first one is that Robin Hood

00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:23,900
already had their legacy physical

00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:25,220
machines at Rackspace and one of the

00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,050
products that rack space offers is

00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:29,780
called a rack connect and rack connect

00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:32,120
does is it lets you combine at least a

00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:35,180
web application firewall and maybe also

00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:38,330
a dedicated load balancer to provide a

00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:40,220
secure way to let your virtual machines

00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:42,170
and your physical machines talk to each

00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:43,230
other and talk to the world so once you

00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:45,420
have rack connect up

00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:47,130
going you can make a comprehensive set

00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,359
of firewall rules just through a control

00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:49,830
panel so you don't do anything with

00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:51,090
puppet anything on your linux machines

00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:53,340
you actually just get a control panel

00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:55,200
where you can say I need these servers

00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,700
do we will talk to the old web head in

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,380
order to go and get some data or I need

00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:00,300
these new linux servers to be able to

00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:01,859
talk to each other in these boards so

00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,270
that's another thing where you know you

00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:05,250
don't need to have someone who can go

00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:07,530
and be a wizard with iptables to have a

00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:08,940
secure environment and another nice

00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:10,920
thing about rack connect is that it lets

00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:12,690
you do match things based on name so you

00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,460
can again in line with the puppet thing

00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,869
you can go in and say any of my web

00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,970
server should be able to talk to any of

00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:19,380
my database servers on port 3306 and

00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,369
then it's all automated there's no need

00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,520
to worry about having to do that

00:37:20,369 --> 00:37:25,020
yourself another thing as we mentioned

00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,790
you know we wanted to make sure that in

00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:28,350
general this would be a low-cost hosting

00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:30,480
solution but that it could quickly scale

00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:31,830
up to any spikes and in any sort of high

00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,430
traffic environment you're going to need

00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:36,630
load balancing now rack rack space in

00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:38,609
conjunction with rach connect will give

00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:40,890
you a very very powerful f5 load

00:37:38,609 --> 00:37:42,480
balancer but that'll cost you a pretty

00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:44,310
penny they also have a cloud load

00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,859
balancers product which you can just

00:37:44,310 --> 00:37:49,109
basically say here is port 80 and here's

00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:50,970
port 443 give me a load balancer and

00:37:49,109 --> 00:37:53,220
they count it based on the number of

00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:55,109
connections per hour so if you're under

00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:56,700
100 concurrent connections an hour for a

00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:58,740
month it'll cost you about 10 bucks it's

00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,690
really really low cost but then you

00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:02,700
scale up and you start having 5,000

00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:05,550
6,000 10,000 people on your site at the

00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:07,170
same time they scale up and meet the

00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:08,670
demand but again you're only charged on

00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:09,960
a per hour basis based on how many

00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:11,970
connections you have so it's really

00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:14,070
cost-effective the Rackspace cloud

00:38:11,970 --> 00:38:15,330
itself has recently launched a new

00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:16,680
version called their next-gen cloud

00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:18,780
service which has some really really

00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:20,910
great attributes one of those is that

00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:22,740
you can get SSD backed block storage so

00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:24,960
if you need a database server to be

00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:26,850
really really fast you can attach an SSD

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,250
for seventy dollars a month and your

00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:31,320
throughput goes through the roof they

00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:33,000
also expose the OpenStack API so all

00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,530
this means is that you can use gems like

00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,270
the OpenStack compute gem to

00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:37,980
automatically spin up new instances so

00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,570
if you discover that something's up you

00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:43,290
can do that we use that for the 12 of 12

00:38:39,570 --> 00:38:45,180
hardware and finally again since Robin

00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:47,730
Hood was traditionally used to hosting

00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:48,960
on Windows Rackspace offers you know one

00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:51,000
of their hallmarks is their fanatical

00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,470
support and they do offer a managed

00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,540
server level and so what this means is

00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:55,830
that you pay a little bit more per

00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,570
server / ma

00:38:55,830 --> 00:38:59,820
and you pay a hundred dollars a month on

00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:01,710
your account but certainly you know with

00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:03,450
phase two and Robin Hood we've gotten

00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,580
way more than that hundred dollars worth

00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:06,690
for we did have a different hosting

00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,280
environment that will briefly talk about

00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:10,860
for the 12th of health concert because

00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:12,390
of the increased traffic needs and you

00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:14,220
know for paying a hundred bucks and

00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:16,140
maybe another 50 bucks in costs and

00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:18,420
instances they helped to spin up new

00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:20,640
machines they vetted our approach for

00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:22,860
things they sat during the concert on a

00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,330
call in our chat room so it's certainly

00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,550
an incredible value that you get and

00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:28,770
they can really help you manage your

00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:31,710
servers if you don't want to keep a team

00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:34,290
of sis admin's on staff so as Heather

00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:36,120
mentioned most of Robin Hood's traffic

00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:38,220
looks like this this is traffic per day

00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:40,710
on a generally average month so you

00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:42,480
might get around 1,200 visits per day

00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:44,520
but we knew that we would need to be

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,990
able to handle large spikes of traffic

00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,700
and the good thing about these spikes is

00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:49,740
that they're largely anonymous right

00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,630
it's mostly folks who say the black eyed

00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:53,700
peas just tweeted or Robin Hood was on

00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:55,830
60 minutes I want to go take a look and

00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:57,600
see what's happening so the tool that we

00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:59,160
I would normally reach for and that a

00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,200
lot of folks in the Drupal world we

00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:03,230
reach for is varnish varnishes a

00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,130
fantastic reverse proxy cache and

00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:06,540
basically in a nutshell if you don't

00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:08,790
know varnish what varnish will do is

00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:11,610
requests will come in and if they're not

00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:14,790
for Drupal users that are signed in it

00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:16,590
can cash a request and send it back so

00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:18,210
in other words you get mentioned i

00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:19,260
always say slash dot but i don't think

00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:20,910
that's a thing anymore if you're on

00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,290
daring fireball or if you're on reddit

00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:24,300
you know you start getting these

00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:27,030
requests that come back for the homepage

00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:28,350
varnish will keep a copy of the homepage

00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:30,870
and then it'll cash it for say five

00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:32,790
minutes so the next X thousand people

00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:34,380
that come in five minutes we'll hit

00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:35,700
varnish and Drupal doesn't even notice

00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:37,710
that anything's happening the good thing

00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:39,270
is that during the huge traffic spikes

00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:40,740
on the 12 till 12 concert you couldn't

00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:42,330
have told there was an event going on if

00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:44,850
you just looked at the CPU usage on our

00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:46,320
web servers now varnish itself wasn't

00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:48,000
enough as I mentioned one of the big

00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,650
things that had to be done for the

00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,270
system was that it had to still accept

00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:53,750
donations and it had to still work with

00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:56,400
the existing dotnet infrastructure so

00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:58,440
varnish is a great reverse proxy cache

00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,450
it's very flexible but one of the things

00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,460
that doesn't do is it does not speak ssl

00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:04,980
so it can't actually make an SSL

00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,240
handshake with a client so one of the

00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,980
important things that we had to be able

00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,869
to do was have some sort of way that

00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:13,660
if a user came in and type to https

00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:15,640
colon slash slash WP robin hood org

00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:18,160
they'd have to be able to connect with a

00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,600
valid ssl session something would have

00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:21,609
to decrypt the session and say oh this

00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:23,170
is going over to.net or it's not and

00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:25,180
then based on that it would either send

00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:27,130
traffic to Robin Hood's physical servers

00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:28,600
in the same data center or back to the

00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:31,480
new cloud-based environment that was set

00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:33,460
up for the Robin Hood site so for non

00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,960
SSL traffic this is kind of a truncated

00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:36,609
version of what it looked like but this

00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,490
is more or less how the site went the

00:41:36,609 --> 00:41:42,340
blue lines are for HTTP traffic and the

00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:44,440
red lines are for HTTPS traffic so if

00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:48,640
you requested just plain dub dub dub

00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:49,900
Robin org over HTTP not over SSL request

00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,550
would come into the cloud load balancers

00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:53,770
they would balance back to however many

00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:55,300
proxies were there which was just two of

00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:57,160
them and the proxy machines are the ones

00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:58,300
that run engine X and varnish that's it

00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,250
and while talking a little bit about why

00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:02,500
we wanted to keep them separate for the

00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:04,210
first phase of the project then when it

00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,590
reached the proxy server it would look

00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:08,109
at a number of paths and you're pretty

00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:10,960
lucky because the robin hood CMS was

00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:12,940
in.net he was pretty easy to say okay if

00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:15,010
you get a dot aspx page throw it back to

00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:17,980
the dotnet system if you get it out a sh

00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:19,540
X axd page and most of the rest of the

00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:21,130
static resources for the Robin Hood site

00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:25,060
also had paths that we could key off of

00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:27,310
like / media / CSS or /j s so with the

00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:28,750
exceptions of a few special pages we

00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:30,250
could really pretty much just say if

00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:32,050
these things happen send them over the

00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:33,580
dotnet infrastructure and then serve

00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,750
them back out and again because we were

00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,980
using rat connect and because these

00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:38,290
things were in the same data center

00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:41,050
there was very little latency it added

00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:43,090
maybe an extra 50 milliseconds overall

00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:44,470
to the page so that was another benefit

00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:47,950
of being able to use Rackspace for this

00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:49,720
and of course for the SSL traffic the

00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:52,119
same thing happened a request comes in

00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:54,900
for HTTPS colon slash slash little bit

00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:57,400
Robin Hood org the cloud load balancers

00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,350
when we launched Robin Hood cloud load

00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,760
balancers couldn't speak ssl it actually

00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:02,470
turns out that they now can terminate

00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,090
SSL so you can actually even put your

00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:05,350
certificate there and let them handle it

00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:07,300
so they could have actually balanced

00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:08,890
directly back but it's the same idea in

00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,480
this case they're doing straight pass

00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:12,190
through it sends it back to one of the

00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:13,570
proxy servers the proxy server does the

00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:16,119
handshake of the browser you get the

00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:17,590
secure connection information and then

00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:19,690
in the proxy later we'll say okay is

00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:20,890
this for / media send it back and again

00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:22,240
it's always the

00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:25,570
the proxies themselves were also

00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,550
connecting over HTTPS to the existing

00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:31,000
net site so the connection was always

00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:32,650
SSL completely through so as I mentioned

00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,690
before we had these proxy servers up

00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:36,640
front they were running engine X for SSL

00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:38,440
termination rewriting and then we had

00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,660
varnish and the reason that we kept them

00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,310
separate was that we had to do it to

00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:44,020
enable the drupal and dotnet split

00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:46,120
another nice thing is that varnish and

00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:49,060
engine X actually use very little CPU

00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:50,800
even when doing SSL termination we found

00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:53,260
out that as we were saturating the

00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:55,450
network connections of a box we only use

00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:58,180
about fourteen percent CPU so as long as

00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:59,290
you're using ssl on an ssl session cache

00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:01,390
which is one of the things you can do

00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:03,370
with engine X you can really use very

00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:04,480
small instances and then you just have

00:44:03,370 --> 00:44:06,490
to worry about how much network

00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,170
throughput they have and the last thing

00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:09,670
is that generally when you tune Drupal

00:44:08,170 --> 00:44:11,950
you have to tune it to the number of

00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:13,750
Apache processes you can run so you can

00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:15,580
let Apache deliver a page and then let

00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:17,230
engine X actually deliver that out to a

00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:19,780
client so instead of tying up your eight

00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:22,240
or ten or twenty Drupal processes you

00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:23,650
can let engine X do that hard work so

00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,030
one of the wrinkle that we had you know

00:44:23,650 --> 00:44:26,980
pretty much everything else was really

00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:29,860
easy we said if it's an aspx page if it

00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:32,770
/ media send it through the legacy CMS

00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:34,990
also used / admin and of course Drupal

00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:36,880
also uses / admin but luckily the

00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:38,410
solution for this was not even something

00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,360
that we had to do in the infrastructure

00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:41,860
layer just like with everything else in

00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:43,840
Drupal there's a module for that so

00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:46,120
there's a module called rename admin

00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:48,100
pads and we got to use that to put a

00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,600
prefix before the Robin Hood admin

00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,830
screens and I meant that we just didn't

00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:54,760
even have to do anything to allow that

00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:57,010
to work so then Heather did mention that

00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:59,710
the 12 12 concert came up and there were

00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:02,110
a couple different phases of working

00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:03,580
with the 12 to 12 concert the first two

00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:05,830
versions of that design that we showed

00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:08,110
earlier were hosted from the existing

00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:10,210
Robin Hood Drupal infrastructure and the

00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:12,820
third was a completely separate set of

00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:13,870
infrastructure redundant across two

00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:17,590
different data centers across the

00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:19,840
country so for the first phase when the

00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:21,580
12 till 12 concert org site was being

00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:24,040
served off of Robin Hood's existing

00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:26,080
Drupal server infrastructure this was a

00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,940
case of some of the spikes so we saw you

00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,920
know a hundred times increase in daily

00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:32,080
traffic and the couple of peaks that we

00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:33,400
have out here were around when the new

00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,380
designs came out

00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:36,870
and also around when pre-sales were

00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:39,400
being announced for the concert tickets

00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:40,780
and another thing that that Brian had

00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,790
mentioned earlier was that in addition

00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:44,560
to everything happened very very fast

00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:46,900
when we were putting together the 12 12

00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:48,340
concert website infrastructure and one

00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,260
of the things that happened was we had

00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:51,760
this page up on the Robin Hood site it

00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:53,410
had all the information we were using

00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,050
the hide you know the show site chrome

00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:57,190
check box to turn that all off and then

00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:58,210
right at the end of the meeting one of

00:45:57,190 --> 00:45:59,530
the most important executive

00:45:58,210 --> 00:46:00,880
stakeholders said well when is this

00:45:59,530 --> 00:46:03,460
going to be on twelfth of self concert

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:07,000
org and no one had mentioned this before

00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:08,740
and so we're thinking and but luckily we

00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,150
had engine X at the front so we were

00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:12,220
just able to do a very simple rewrite

00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:14,890
where we went in and said okay if a

00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:18,190
request comes in to 12 12 concert org

00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:21,010
engine X will do a proxy pac request to

00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:23,350
Robin Hood org slash 12 12 12 so loads

00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:25,900
we can have a piece of content hosted in

00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:27,070
Drupal using varnishes caching rules and

00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:29,590
actually using the tools to be able to

00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:31,930
clear out the cash when editors edited

00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:34,450
it and so you know end users were none

00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:35,830
the wiser they went to 12 of concert org

00:46:34,450 --> 00:46:37,000
they saw the perfect branded site

00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:38,890
experience it was incredibly fast

00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,300
because it was served by varnish and if

00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:41,950
editors updated it the changes would be

00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,900
live in a couple milliseconds because

00:46:41,950 --> 00:46:46,660
varnish clears out very quickly so

00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:48,940
that's how we did that um so for the

00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:51,250
anatomy of a spike this graph from

00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:55,450
google analytics is the overall traffic

00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:56,950
per week for the year of 2012 so you can

00:46:55,450 --> 00:46:59,950
maybe see out in the May time frame

00:46:56,950 --> 00:47:01,840
there's a little blip there and under a

00:46:59,950 --> 00:47:03,340
normal graph that would look huge but

00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:05,710
yeah this is really what Robin Hood's

00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:07,420
spiky traffic looks like you know six

00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:11,410
hundred thousand users in a week whereas

00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:13,540
normally there were maybe 6,000 and then

00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:16,060
finally I won't go into it too much but

00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:19,060
we did use a separate web infrastructure

00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:20,440
for 12 12 concert org the good part

00:47:19,060 --> 00:47:22,540
about it was that we could reuse all of

00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:24,970
our existing puppet set up to set up

00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:26,590
these new servers we used Akamai to do

00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:28,300
global load balancing for them and

00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:29,920
another development partner was brought

00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:31,840
in to do the site itself just because it

00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,930
was such a compressed time frame but we

00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:37,060
help them architect the the code to make

00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:39,400
sure that it was incredibly cacheable by

00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:41,080
Akamai and yet at the same time things

00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:43,510
could update within 30 seconds or a

00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,830
minute so during the concert when we did

00:47:43,510 --> 00:47:45,359
have millions and millions and millions

00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:47,130
of

00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:48,480
uniques they were getting live updates

00:47:47,130 --> 00:47:49,980
you know you'd be watching the concert

00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,599
in a minute later to be a different call

00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:53,220
to action up at the top there'd be a

00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:55,289
different new set of featured tumblr or

00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:58,259
Twitter posts and yet the load on the

00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:59,190
web servers was about 0.001 in other

00:47:58,259 --> 00:48:01,049
words they really didn't know that

00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:08,609
anything was going on so we had plenty

00:48:01,049 --> 00:48:12,630
of capacity despair in that case so just

00:48:08,609 --> 00:48:15,690
to wrap up we have successfully over the

00:48:12,630 --> 00:48:17,849
last two years met three really

00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:21,029
significant challenges for Robin Hood

00:48:17,849 --> 00:48:23,369
the first being the way in which our

00:48:21,029 --> 00:48:25,259
editors hands were literally tied I mean

00:48:23,369 --> 00:48:27,660
we we needed to be able to give them a

00:48:25,259 --> 00:48:29,220
lot more control and not only will be

00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:31,759
able to give them an incredible amount

00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:35,160
of control without impacting code at all

00:48:31,759 --> 00:48:38,190
on our typical day to day website with

00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:41,489
Robin Hood org but ultimately we were

00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:44,730
able to enable them to have micro sites

00:48:41,489 --> 00:48:47,789
hosted on the same platform with unique

00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:50,489
URLs thanks to engine X and all of this

00:48:47,789 --> 00:48:52,319
on an infrastructure that costs us less

00:48:50,489 --> 00:48:54,779
than two thousand dollars a month and

00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:58,410
can handle huge spikes of traffic

00:48:54,779 --> 00:49:00,239
relative to our daily so thank you to

00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:03,119
all of you for hearing our story and

00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:11,849
thank you to phase two and our team for

00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:13,920
making all of this possible thanks if

00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:15,749
you have any questions please come up

00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:19,289
here there's a mic up front and that

00:49:15,749 --> 00:49:21,180
will make sure that the questions make

00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:23,239
it into the recording and we're we're

00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:25,920
happy to answer any questions you have

00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:30,720
first of all spend you make me feel

00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:33,119
really dumb so but so I had a couple

00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:35,519
questions number one you guys mentioned

00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:38,880
you move the donations to Drupal how are

00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:41,910
you guys handling that now specific

00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:44,489
module I guess maybe I'm asking or so

00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:45,980
the new the new site are the the phase

00:49:44,489 --> 00:49:48,200
to roll out of the

00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:50,150
Robin Hood infrastructure we rebuilt the

00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:52,880
donation platform using Drupal commerce

00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:55,790
so the entire site is Drupal 7 and we

00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:58,730
use Drupal commerce with a paypal back

00:49:55,790 --> 00:50:02,030
end cool the other question was with the

00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:04,670
beans and you know these really custom

00:50:02,030 --> 00:50:06,920
implementations have you guys discussed

00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:08,570
any type of responsive or mobile

00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,920
implementation and what are like the

00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:14,270
challenges that you're struggling with

00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:16,010
their that's a great question what we

00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:19,190
found with this site is that it actually

00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:22,520
works super well already out of the box

00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:25,310
on ipad the way the content is already

00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:28,390
structured with with in the in the way

00:50:25,310 --> 00:50:30,920
it's designed it fits super great on to

00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:33,320
mobile devices and it actually is very

00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:37,609
readable still on on iPhones and

00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:39,560
androids typically when we created the

00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:41,540
interactive pieces that was a big

00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:44,150
concern you know when we started this

00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:46,100
project we were told you know the most

00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:49,490
important stakeholders the executives of

00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:52,490
the board use internet explorer 7 and

00:50:49,490 --> 00:50:54,170
iPad and creating interactive

00:50:52,490 --> 00:50:57,920
experiences that are good on both of

00:50:54,170 --> 00:50:59,750
those is not particularly easy what we

00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,690
found is that there's a library called

00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:05,180
Raphael j/s which is a drawing library

00:51:02,690 --> 00:51:08,600
that handles in modern browsers that

00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:12,290
draws in SVG and in Internet Explorer it

00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:15,140
it draws in vml which is sort of the

00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:19,550
bastardized version of SVG that Internet

00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:21,440
Explorer has the older versions and what

00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:23,060
we found there is that we could use that

00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,590
to create interactive pieces that were

00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:26,720
touch-enabled that worked really well on

00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:34,400
ipad but we're also seamlessly

00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:35,810
interactive on desktop experiences first

00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,660
I'll just want to say it's really

00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:39,770
informative and learned a lot have a

00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:41,720
couple of questions about your

00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:43,670
individual set up you guys talk about

00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,230
why you didn't use the proxy server to

00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:46,640
handle the static assets is that

00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:48,350
typically not something that's done with

00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,930
flourish seemed like was hopping off to

00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:52,580
something else yes so actually I should

00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:53,990
have also mentioned we are using Akamai

00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:56,119
to handle the delivery of all the static

00:51:53,990 --> 00:51:57,710
assets we're not using it to deliver the

00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:58,289
site content itself to do that you have

00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:59,640
to

00:51:58,289 --> 00:52:00,869
pay extra and get a special

00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,219
configuration to say if you got a

00:52:00,869 --> 00:52:03,929
session cookie passed through so we

00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:06,689
didn't mention it but yeah the you know

00:52:03,929 --> 00:52:08,279
we're not actually doing delivery of CSS

00:52:06,689 --> 00:52:10,199
JavaScript web font files those are

00:52:08,279 --> 00:52:11,369
actually handled by Akamai but for our

00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:12,779
use case that could even probably be

00:52:11,369 --> 00:52:14,729
done by something like cloud front you

00:52:12,779 --> 00:52:17,429
know the just anything to offload it

00:52:14,729 --> 00:52:19,769
from our own web origin and that was my

00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:21,509
second question I was trying to get a

00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:22,829
picture about how Akamai fit into

00:52:21,509 --> 00:52:25,109
everything and you guys were saying you

00:52:22,829 --> 00:52:27,269
had a minute to killer cash and you know

00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:29,219
we use Akamai as well and we use it for

00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:31,739
you know full page caching not just

00:52:29,219 --> 00:52:34,319
static resources and that minute was

00:52:31,739 --> 00:52:35,699
quick it'sit's they don't guarantee that

00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:38,549
kind of thing I think they like eight

00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:40,049
minutes or something like that so yes so

00:52:38,549 --> 00:52:41,489
what we're talking about here so for 12

00:52:40,049 --> 00:52:44,119
to self concert that org we did actually

00:52:41,489 --> 00:52:46,739
use Akamai to do full page delivery and

00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:47,789
sorry witch named Jonathan so what

00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:49,499
Jonathan's talking about is that

00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:52,380
generally to purge something out of

00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:53,579
akamai will take at least seven minutes

00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:55,169
let's say and it could take up to maybe

00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:57,509
15 minutes to hit all the edge nodes

00:52:55,169 --> 00:52:59,279
akamai's got you know I think like a

00:52:57,509 --> 00:53:00,989
hundred fifty thousand servers around

00:52:59,279 --> 00:53:02,549
the world and that's what makes it you

00:53:00,989 --> 00:53:04,469
know they have a server close to

00:53:02,549 --> 00:53:06,630
everybody that's what makes them fast so

00:53:04,469 --> 00:53:08,309
yeah if you're if you're doing long

00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:09,659
details and doing purging that works but

00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:11,249
instead what we did with the 12 of 12

00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:13,380
concert we literally set like a 30

00:53:11,249 --> 00:53:16,259
second TTL on everything and had the

00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:18,299
origin update the file and so you know

00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:19,890
and basically the layout was there were

00:53:18,299 --> 00:53:21,359
a number of like kind of page for the

00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:23,099
there were a number of different pages

00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:25,019
that the user should visit and then we

00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:27,809
had a number of different JSON feeds you

00:53:25,019 --> 00:53:29,669
know like Tumblr chase on Twitter DOJ's

00:53:27,809 --> 00:53:31,049
on Instagram today so I'm like alert not

00:53:29,669 --> 00:53:32,969
JSON for the banner at the top that was

00:53:31,049 --> 00:53:34,619
the call to action so instead we just

00:53:32,969 --> 00:53:36,689
set those Akamai ttls to be I think

00:53:34,619 --> 00:53:38,429
either 30 seconds or a minute and then

00:53:36,689 --> 00:53:40,439
Akamai would just check back from its

00:53:38,429 --> 00:53:41,699
origin nodes and we did still have

00:53:40,439 --> 00:53:44,069
varnished the front of the origin here

00:53:41,699 --> 00:53:47,159
so varnish can very easily serve a 304

00:53:44,069 --> 00:53:49,529
so just if you don't know you'll what

00:53:47,159 --> 00:53:51,630
you do if you want to work in a scenario

00:53:49,529 --> 00:53:54,239
that's very compatible with HTTP caching

00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:56,189
you send a last modified header out to

00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:58,319
your clients to say this file is last

00:53:56,189 --> 00:54:00,329
modified say two minutes ago and then

00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:01,890
Akamai will check back when it's TTL

00:54:00,329 --> 00:54:03,659
runs out every 30 seconds with an if

00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:05,519
modified since request in other words

00:54:03,659 --> 00:54:07,799
just asking your web server which would

00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:09,809
be varnish in this case has the content

00:54:07,799 --> 00:54:11,260
been modified since a minute ago if not

00:54:09,809 --> 00:54:12,580
varnish will send a 304

00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:14,530
modified header it doesn't have to send

00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:16,390
any content so that's how we we did that

00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:18,490
you know orange was serving a lot of 30

00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:19,720
force to akamai but because it's so

00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:25,540
efficient there was actually very little

00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:28,120
load of the system thank you yep great

00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:30,340
presentation guys thank you I have three

00:54:28,120 --> 00:54:32,830
questions one of them is really to the

00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:39,220
beam module you know if there's anything

00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:42,940
you can do with provisioning so beams

00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:46,360
are entities and being entities they are

00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:48,190
revisional so they just you have to

00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:50,440
specify I think you have to specify a

00:54:48,190 --> 00:54:54,400
revision table but they're your entities

00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:56,290
so they're original yeah and work

00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,480
flowable so if you have a workflow

00:54:56,290 --> 00:55:01,720
module out there that allows you to

00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:03,700
apply state state to work flow States

00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:06,160
and transitions to your entities that

00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:10,300
can be applied to beans as well okay

00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:12,700
thank you second question with what you

00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:16,240
did with the WYSIWYG if someone were to

00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:20,320
do like a paste from word like with

00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:22,930
those fonts be fonts and colors would

00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:25,750
maybe use specifically or do you have to

00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:28,120
lake set them up in another way where it

00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:30,370
it it you know the branding stays right

00:55:28,120 --> 00:55:31,720
act this is this is something that you

00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:33,850
know we run into all the time you have

00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:35,590
editors that set up things in word and

00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:37,870
you paste it in inward creates all this

00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:40,500
crazy markup and they actually mentioned

00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:43,270
this during the keynote yesterday I

00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:45,250
think the the way that we kind of get

00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:47,830
around this we just make sure that word

00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:50,830
isn't the canonical place where the

00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:53,980
content is kept so they there is no

00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:55,630
there is that there still is that bug

00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:57,160
where you know where we will put in all

00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:58,870
that bad markup and your wizard game for

00:55:57,160 --> 00:56:01,600
if we're just copying pasting directly

00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:03,310
and so there's definitely at the top of

00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,960
the project a perception problems like

00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:06,820
you know this is where the content lives

00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:11,140
and you're going to be editing it using

00:56:06,820 --> 00:56:13,090
these nicely approved themed tools to

00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:16,150
create the content and style it given

00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:20,320
the brand accepted color schemes and so

00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:23,250
on thank you and my third question

00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:26,380
is you might have mentioned this but

00:56:23,250 --> 00:56:30,250
what was the reasoning behind not doing

00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:32,050
SSL termination at the lb level it was

00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:34,060
just that when we started out cloud the

00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:35,740
bouncers didn't have that capability so

00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:37,480
when he first launched yet they couldn't

00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:39,910
do it now they can which is yet I mean

00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:41,470
both like Amazon ZL bees and racks

00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:43,480
versus cloud load balancers can do it

00:56:41,470 --> 00:56:44,950
and so we might consider doing that at

00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:46,390
some point as well I mean we have it up

00:56:44,950 --> 00:56:47,740
and working with engine X and we're not

00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:49,900
having any capacity problems at the

00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:51,400
moment but yeah it is now an option just

00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:54,460
that it didn't happen to be when we

00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:59,380
started ok and is there a pro to that

00:56:54,460 --> 00:57:01,150
like less latency not necessarily I mean

00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:02,260
you're going to incur the same costs

00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:05,350
it's still going to have to hop through

00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:08,290
as many layers i think you know given

00:57:05,350 --> 00:57:10,630
that we might be able to remove engine X

00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:14,110
from the equation if we were to get rid

00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:15,610
of engine X doing SSL termination now in

00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:17,350
the donation you now that we have

00:57:15,610 --> 00:57:18,400
everything being run through Drupal we

00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,200
don't have to do that kind of partial

00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,120
rewrite over to the existing data center

00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,920
so yes it might be possible in the

00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,480
future to kind of get rid of one of the

00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,980
hops that has to travel in the data

00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,690
center before it goes back to users

00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:30,400
browser so that would probably be the

00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:32,500
advantage is that yeah we we could

00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:35,140
potentially remove engine X from the

00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:36,490
equation but it's not something that

00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:40,900
we're you know we're not particularly

00:57:36,490 --> 00:57:43,300
pressed for for CPU or on the speed of

00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:48,070
our our delivery right now right awesome

00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:50,860
thank you hey done so i have a question

00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:52,480
regarding templating so i think there

00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:54,520
was a note that you demonstrated is

00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:57,820
where you can select like the bubbles

00:57:54,520 --> 00:58:01,750
and a different layouts so how did you

00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:03,910
approach that what you use for that so

00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:06,510
the templates i'll use the template

00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:09,460
field and the template api modules and

00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:13,450
the we created a number of different

00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:15,760
templates in code and the way each

00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:19,930
template works as you can define a

00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:23,020
number of custom inputs and HTML file

00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:27,400
that has uses the mustache rendering

00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:29,710
library to print out those inputs that

00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:32,250
you custom inputs that you define and

00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:34,440
you can also bundle with that CSS and

00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:37,200
script and any Drupal libraries that are

00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:41,280
available to the system so that when you

00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:45,410
choose a template and input content it

00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:48,110
will all get rendered through the HTML

00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:50,220
template file that you provide added the

00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:53,370
JavaScript and CSS get added to that

00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:56,160
page and it renders out the custom thing

00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:59,700
okay see soul the fields will be created

00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:01,340
through that template module right so

00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:04,530
they're not or would I be like a cck

00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:07,170
they're not Drupal fields the fields

00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:11,250
that are part of template field or the

00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:15,320
template API aren't it's not an entity

00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:18,660
and it doesn't use the field API there

00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:21,120
but you do add a single template field

00:59:18,660 --> 00:59:23,310
add a node that lets you pick from the

00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:25,140
available templates oh and the plugs

00:59:23,310 --> 00:59:28,200
right in right because we were looking

00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:31,320
at doing something similar so okay yeah

00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:33,540
thank you mm-hmm hey I'm wondering if

00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:35,870
you guys had any requirements for

00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:38,190
tracking source codes or campaign codes

00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:41,340
refers from google analytics my

00:59:38,190 --> 00:59:44,480
membership and marketing folks would be

00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:47,670
salivating to get you know that data for

00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:50,370
120,000 visitors and in one shot and are

00:59:47,670 --> 00:59:51,630
always asking for cooking and that sort

00:59:50,370 --> 00:59:54,150
of thing so we can pass it on to convey

00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:56,280
oh and convene track those codes which

00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:57,780
means all that traffic is not going

00:59:56,280 --> 01:00:00,030
through varnish so I was wondering if

00:59:57,780 --> 01:00:07,950
you had to deal with that and how you

01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:09,000
would have so well so admittedly well

01:00:07,950 --> 01:00:11,220
yeah like everyone who comes to the

01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:14,310
robin hood side gets a google analytics

01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:15,510
cookie right and so I'm not a hundred

01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:17,340
percent sure about that but as long as

01:00:15,510 --> 01:00:20,400
you keep your your cookie setting in

01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:21,510
purely in JavaScript yeah I mean every

01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,770
visitor to the Robin Hood site has a

01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:24,720
number of cookies including the Google

01:00:22,770 --> 01:00:27,780
Analytics ones the standard practice

01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:30,570
with the with using varnish with Drupal

01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:32,310
is to actually in vcl receive you go in

01:00:30,570 --> 01:00:34,490
and you cut down the cookies like I sent

01:00:32,310 --> 01:00:36,210
to the back end because generally

01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:37,440
depends on what you want to do but

01:00:36,210 --> 01:00:40,500
generally you know you don't care

01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,990
exactly what google and google analytics

01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:45,000
cookies you have because the JavaScript

01:00:42,990 --> 01:00:46,099
will run on a page load and do those so

01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,869
generally what you'll do

01:00:46,099 --> 01:00:50,599
see this like if you take a look at the

01:00:47,869 --> 01:00:52,009
press flow or the wall about VC LS in V

01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:53,239
cell receive you can actually say like

01:00:52,009 --> 01:00:54,259
kind of take all the cookies that were

01:00:53,239 --> 01:00:55,670
sending which could include a lot of

01:00:54,259 --> 01:00:57,529
different things from Quan sir from

01:00:55,670 --> 01:00:59,839
google analytics from chart bead and

01:00:57,529 --> 01:01:01,249
actually strip them down and only send

01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:02,720
them to the back end if it's a Drupal

01:01:01,249 --> 01:01:04,309
session cookie and then maybe also like

01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,599
you know for a site like this you might

01:01:04,309 --> 01:01:07,430
say also allow any cookie that starts

01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:09,289
with robin hood underscore and that way

01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:10,940
you can still preserve cash ability

01:01:09,289 --> 01:01:12,769
while having all these cookies that work

01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:15,229
with javascript things like chart be

01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:17,299
crazy a google analytics with all those

01:01:15,229 --> 01:01:20,329
are sort of external so they get passed

01:01:17,299 --> 01:01:22,970
through fine but if and i don't know how

01:01:20,329 --> 01:01:26,329
sugarcrm works but it like if we want to

01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:28,400
set a domain cookie for you know a

01:01:26,329 --> 01:01:31,039
source code that's coming in and have

01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:35,150
conveyed that then we need to do that

01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:36,289
with PHP in that i guess it sounds like

01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:37,670
maybe you're saying there are some

01:01:36,289 --> 01:01:40,279
varnish settings that i could look into

01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:43,519
the wood let me still catch that page

01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:44,989
even though it would depend i mean if it

01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:46,759
would have to go back and talk to convey

01:01:44,989 --> 01:01:48,710
oh then it wouldn't necessarily although

01:01:46,759 --> 01:01:50,180
again what you might do with that would

01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:51,410
be you could actually make it so there

01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:52,999
to be like a javascript to include that

01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:54,170
you know that could do a request to come

01:01:52,999 --> 01:01:55,789
via which weekend would have all the

01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:58,069
cookies and then we'd go back and be

01:01:55,789 --> 01:01:59,749
there so it really depends on if you are

01:01:58,069 --> 01:02:00,859
actually bootstrapping drupal to talk to

01:01:59,749 --> 01:02:02,960
convey or if there would be some other

01:02:00,859 --> 01:02:04,579
way and like also with engine X in the

01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:07,099
mix you could considerably also do like

01:02:04,579 --> 01:02:08,960
an ssi which is like an ESI include

01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:10,190
although i mean that that's getting

01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,319
pretty deep to just do sort of like

01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:13,759
source code tracking so most of the time

01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:16,519
if you can do something like doing it on

01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:18,140
the front end you know if you can do it

01:02:16,519 --> 01:02:19,729
through javascript then it very much

01:02:18,140 --> 01:02:22,249
increases the cache ability of your

01:02:19,729 --> 01:02:24,769
pages okay and add one more question i

01:02:22,249 --> 01:02:26,420
looked into the embeddable module why

01:02:24,769 --> 01:02:27,559
you guys were talking and see it's still

01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:30,229
an alpha it's not really very widely

01:02:27,559 --> 01:02:32,900
used and i was wondering what benefit or

01:02:30,229 --> 01:02:35,119
using token filter was that an option to

01:02:32,900 --> 01:02:37,130
give people your content editors kind of

01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:40,190
a library of blocks blocks that are

01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:41,239
generated by views and is that something

01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:42,710
that you looked into are you familiar

01:02:41,239 --> 01:02:44,119
with that or did you decide that that

01:02:42,710 --> 01:02:48,559
wouldn't work for what you're trying to

01:02:44,119 --> 01:02:50,780
do oh we look into some of the other

01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:53,160
options besides embeddable

01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:55,500
what we like about embeddable ziz that

01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:58,110
it adds a little bit of stuff into the

01:02:55,500 --> 01:03:00,630
WYSIWYG that you can then use the

01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:02,850
styling options built into the WYSIWYG

01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:05,280
to do things like center the blocks or

01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:06,780
or other sorts of styling improvements

01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:09,030
that need to be treated to those

01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:10,980
specific beam entities or whatever that

01:03:09,030 --> 01:03:12,450
are going to be included so we found

01:03:10,980 --> 01:03:17,760
that that worked a lot better than

01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:20,070
asking them to you know no tokens and

01:03:17,760 --> 01:03:22,200
look up the tokens and then figure out

01:03:20,070 --> 01:03:24,870
how to style them either by writing some

01:03:22,200 --> 01:03:27,690
HTML themselves or you know through some

01:03:24,870 --> 01:03:31,320
sort of special WYSIWYG interface cool

01:03:27,690 --> 01:03:34,740
thanks so my question kind of piggy

01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:35,700
backs onto that is this the content for

01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:37,680
those field paints or those reusable

01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:39,420
content and you find them again and how

01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,860
you manage those reusable things like

01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:42,720
things for the navigation all the micro

01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:44,340
sites I'm sure that's a reused piece of

01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:46,620
content does that get really you know

01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:48,030
the huge page of reusable stuff people

01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:51,900
go through a now or how do you guys

01:03:48,030 --> 01:03:54,090
manage that so in this site content

01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:55,710
reusability was was pretty important

01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:57,660
when we were starting out so that's why

01:03:55,710 --> 01:04:00,390
we broke things into two concepts to the

01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:02,310
pains which is a content type which has

01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:03,480
the template field basically is just a

01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:05,460
template field in a little other

01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:07,530
metadata fields on that content type and

01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:09,990
then pain stacks which is another

01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:13,230
content type with node references for

01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:15,870
pulling in the pain so they're they're

01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:18,030
reusable in that any specific content

01:04:15,870 --> 01:04:19,710
chunk can be used on any number of

01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:21,330
different pain stack pages and then

01:04:19,710 --> 01:04:23,160
paint stacks are really the main

01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:25,890
building block for the site those are

01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:30,060
sort of main level landing pages okay

01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:32,970
awesome thank you hi guys thanks really

01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:35,550
informative going back to the bean

01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:37,350
revision in question so much of the

01:04:35,550 --> 01:04:41,250
content of the site it sounds like was

01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:43,800
in beans but I you mentioned that you

01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:46,470
needed workflow capability how did you

01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:52,040
sort of resolve the revision needs with

01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:54,420
the reusable components and so on so we

01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:56,880
we're not using it there's no official

01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:59,840
sort of like editorial work flow behind

01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,840
beans that they use right now

01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:04,010
they generally go in and just create it

01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:05,690
just like they would a node and then

01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:09,590
they can reuse it in either WYSIWYG

01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:13,640
areas if I were going to use a workflow

01:05:09,590 --> 01:05:15,500
module around it I mean Oh knock on what

01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:16,880
I would probably use maybe state flow or

01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:20,390
workbench just depending on what your

01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:22,400
specific needs were but since they're

01:05:20,390 --> 01:05:25,160
entities those modules allow you know

01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:27,950
well a workflow to be applied to them

01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:31,630
just like any like a noted to twood are

01:05:27,950 --> 01:05:33,620
the editors currently is these are the

01:05:31,630 --> 01:05:37,010
pardon me are the nodes themselves

01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:38,960
currently subject to workflow not right

01:05:37,010 --> 01:05:41,240
now okay so there is not really a

01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,980
currently a workflow of any kind known

01:05:41,240 --> 01:05:44,870
that generally she's like a published

01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:47,870
and unpublished sort of thing okay great
