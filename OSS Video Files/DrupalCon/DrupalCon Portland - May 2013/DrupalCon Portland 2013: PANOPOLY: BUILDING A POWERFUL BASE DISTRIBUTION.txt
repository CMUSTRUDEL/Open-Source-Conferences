Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: PANOPOLY: BUILDING A POWERFUL BASE DISTRIBUTION
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	Panopoly is an Apps enabled base distribution of Drupal powered by lots of Chaos Tools and Panels magic. The distribution is designed to be both a general foundation for site building and a base framework upon which to build other Drupal distributions.

This session will rock out with the latest and greatest version of Panopoly. We will discuss the major features of the distribution, talk about how the different contributed modules that are working together, and do a live demonstration around key functionality.

Afterwards, we will dig into the technical details to talk about the anatomy of a Drupal distribution and outline the steps that are required to extend Panopoly to customize your own "sub distribution".

Come to this session to learn both about Panopoly and about what it takes to build your own Drupal distribution!

hello hello okay let's get started so

00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:10,110

sites for some amazing clients creating

00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,540
some group of 5 s first distributions

00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,670

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,660
platform helping tens of thousands of

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,149
Drupal sites with their development and

00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:57,329
hosting including money which run Drupal

00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,460
distributions a longtime contributor to

00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,680
the panel's University of modules Maddox

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,350
currently relieve maintainer of the dena

00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,750
Polly Drupal distribution which provides

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,000
panels based page building tools out of

00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,890
the box and serves as the base

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:20,189
distribution for many other Drupal

00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:29,430
districts so there's the intro and thank

00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:32,670
you very much RSS actually my expansion

00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:34,079
i work at heavy on and one of my roles

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,780
there is to try to make purple

00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,729
distributions rough do believe those

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,170
people asked me to run double-digit

00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:42,210
percentage internet and I think

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,850
distributions are the way that we need

00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,729
to get there as part of that work to

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:50,040
maintain a distribution rupal that sort

00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:51,570
of labeling as a piece distribution it's

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,189
something that allows people to take a

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,680
lot of common building blocks that

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:57,390
they've already been done use that to

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,369
sort of start their site development and

00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:02,280
make a really high quality Drupal site

00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:04,920
or distribution that I think people is a

00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,110
magic thing as a monic into but if you

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,209
download it off drupal.org you get this

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,209
thing this is not what most people long

00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,590
like you know I want websites that like

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,709
this comes off as anything that's

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:21,329
related to my hopes dreams that you know

00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:24,480
even though Drupal's great we've got

00:02:21,329 --> 00:02:26,700
21,000 County modules we have and here's

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,019
worth open source development we have

00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,049
such as far as people I've ever met

00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:33,180
working on that stuff every day then to

00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:35,430
the end user to the site builder that

00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,189
Drupal still is really limited that it

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,680
has a lot of confusing administration

00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:42,510
systems and then when you're coming to

00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,650
mobile website you know sometimes you

00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:46,019
need something really complicated

00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,790
acquires a lot of constant word roll

00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,760
adverts you just want something that

00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,319
feels like a website this is open public

00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,329
which is a great triple distribution

00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,280
works for like local government like

00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:59,430
higher level government and when you

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,750
download it it is a website that feels

00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:02,669
like a website and you can start

00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:04,919
changing stuff around you can sit demo

00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:07,470
content you actually have the ability to

00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:09,299
turn this live relatively quickly and

00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:10,829
this is super important for site

00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:12,599
builders because you don't have to sort

00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:15,900
of like it figure out into it you just

00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,040
sort of modify this party there it's

00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:18,810
helpful when you have common

00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,720
functionality this is commerce kickstart

00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,940
this is out of the box ecommerce store

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,129
it's got product catalog checkout

00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:28,409
integrates with it payment processors

00:03:26,129 --> 00:03:30,329
it's very cool and if you're building an

00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:31,919
e-commerce store much rather start with

00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:34,530
a demo store i can change there's

00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,239
nothing to make work then try to like go

00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,370
back to that blue screen and say how do

00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,290
i turn this into is because drupal's

00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,510
hard enough just to do some basics not

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,879
let alone all the site building and and

00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:46,709
that becomes really hard and it's

00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,599
specifically hard to when you've got on

00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:51,569
the branding and it's now requirements

00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:53,970
is a vertical distribution it's you know

00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:56,579
from university you have specific brand

00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:58,560
style requirements like you just have it

00:03:56,579 --> 00:04:02,639
look like that and since to the option

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,739
to like figure out CSS and sections

00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,629
those do what if how the box you can

00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,639
just have these styles and that's what

00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:10,709
people want they want something really

00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,840
great out of the box they don't want

00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,389
basic drupal they want something as

00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,630
close and as awesome to what end up

00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:18,250
having not

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:19,930
and provide folks through more problem

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,790
site builders who are responsible for

00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,920
making Drupal sites that your focus is

00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:26,050
on content and on making the pages and

00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,420
the experience of people from your

00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:30,670
website see and that's why you want

00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,200
something that comes out of the box that

00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,570
actually is really breaks that you can

00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,360
spend your time off topic working on

00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:41,680
really amazing amazing content pages

00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:43,150
free site to like struggling you want

00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,040
something right out of the box if you

00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:47,110
work for a large organization you also

00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,300
want to get closer box and come a lot of

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:50,710
sense and that's one of the things over

00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,290
the castle right here that I've been

00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,330
working on with a lot of larger

00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,580
customers and edges people in the Drupal

00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,590
world that they want to create a

00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,200
situation where you can spin up some

00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:04,210
fingers and a 100 of subject have a lot

00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:09,880
of different websites all do really

00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:12,010
great stuff on the box that's very much

00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,370
monopolies is trying to help with

00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:17,020
because this is a trend that all across

00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:18,370
this land we've got Drupal distribution

00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:21,190
so you've got the Canadian government

00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,770
and related Open University folks again

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:26,790
distribution their standardizing on to

00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:29,320
help with multilingual stop

00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:31,510
distributions are work that UC Berkeley

00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:34,450
has several distributions join hundreds

00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:36,910
of diversity sites folks like these two

00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:39,190
huge number of different distributions

00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,870
from a lot of people off we have a

00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:44,230
couple really great distribution murmur

00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:45,430
skies ecommerce store and individuals

00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,900
all over the place or working on

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,200
distributions based on other

00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,240
distributions I see it work the space

00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,920
lives to do stuff all the time and it's

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,110
really it's really powerful because I

00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:59,260
think what I think about purple we've

00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:02,250
got you know a pretty good community a

00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:05,880
lot of sites and if you were approaching

00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:11,590
I've only had rupal sites are fine but

00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:14,470
you know it's cooler the iliad review

00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:16,930
sites and I think if we want to get to a

00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,700
Drupal sites if you want to be the

00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,710
platform that runs double-digit

00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,720
percentages on the internet if you want

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,689
to make it is easy to have a website it

00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,979
is to get a facebook account we need to

00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:28,869
it really hard to make sure that our

00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:31,269
foundation and are sort of platform

00:06:28,869 --> 00:06:33,789
technology that people use is really

00:06:31,269 --> 00:06:35,860
good and we want to have foundation for

00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:38,769
building distributions that if you're

00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,419
not my years of development because the

00:06:38,769 --> 00:06:42,939
university it wants to spin up a

00:06:40,419 --> 00:06:44,799
common-looking site across rotation your

00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:46,389
media company that needs to have a bunch

00:06:44,799 --> 00:06:48,309
of different about the researchers if

00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:49,929
one person it wants something easier

00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:51,579
than what you had to do a built-in

00:06:49,929 --> 00:06:53,829
scratch you want to start a little bit

00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:55,869
higher we need really great technology

00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:58,179
for distributions and drupal i'm home

00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:59,889
through all these bodies problems where

00:06:58,179 --> 00:07:01,629
i'm showing you today triple seven about

00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:03,849
a copy of title button d afterwards

00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:06,189
during the Q&A but in general I think

00:07:03,849 --> 00:07:07,989
the important thing and this is where we

00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:10,329
really get into the police not to say

00:07:07,989 --> 00:07:13,089
it's a building a Drupal distribution is

00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:14,679
really hard for folks who have sort of

00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:17,169
struggle to make it small profiles

00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:19,449
myself included figure out how features

00:07:17,169 --> 00:07:21,249
works as great as it is and making sure

00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:22,799
they all and it sees and all the

00:07:21,249 --> 00:07:25,299
different libraries work to make

00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:27,279
attribution it's hard and that's the

00:07:25,299 --> 00:07:28,959
message before you start building a lot

00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,029
of general Drupal things you need and

00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,559
kind of get your WYSIWYG and Alex turn

00:07:31,029 --> 00:07:37,119
it on that you needed to be customized

00:07:32,559 --> 00:07:38,379
of integration useful input filters you

00:07:37,119 --> 00:07:40,539
want to make sure that you have a bunch

00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:42,879
of layouts you can use for your site you

00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:44,679
want to make sure you got a better admin

00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,559
experience you have to select put your

00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:49,569
modules and that like every time like

00:07:47,559 --> 00:07:51,069
folks this room orgy development will

00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:53,949
the site you're doing a lot of saying

00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:55,839
things to you you know about some of you

00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:57,849
have scripts with your own distributions

00:07:55,839 --> 00:08:00,789
to do this but to me like that's a lot

00:07:57,849 --> 00:08:02,529
of work then that Edmund for happy to do

00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:05,949
every time and when you're building a

00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:07,449
distribution a lot of distributions so

00:08:05,949 --> 00:08:09,849
you have to make sure you're always

00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:12,339
making an awesome is always making your

00:08:09,849 --> 00:08:13,989
loss lab always making improvements just

00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:15,039
you can get to the point where they're

00:08:13,989 --> 00:08:18,699
actually going to build something great

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:21,189
and so what properly is this is it is it

00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:23,499
an attempt to help people move on its

00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:24,819
back it's about saying if you're going

00:08:23,499 --> 00:08:26,829
to build a Drupal site and it

00:08:24,819 --> 00:08:29,349
specifically for Drupal bikes out of

00:08:26,829 --> 00:08:31,029
sites like a distribution like don't you

00:08:29,349 --> 00:08:33,550
start by downloading Drupal and sort of

00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:34,690
party from there look at something like

00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,370
probably

00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,020
we're going to obviously have triple

00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,729
core we're going to have a bunch of

00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:42,220
Drupal contributed modules that we've

00:08:39,729 --> 00:08:44,650
looked at reviewing integrated and we're

00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:47,590
going to build like parallel function on

00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:49,660
top of all that stuff in a way of it

00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:51,640
like it gives you a starting point then

00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:53,830
we turn on something like cannot believe

00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:56,260
it doesn't just give you you know I like

00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:59,260
no content and like not a lot of options

00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:01,390
to extend stuff yeah still is a starter

00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,920
site but it gives you a lot of features

00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:04,960
which I'll show you today how the box

00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,880
and if you're just looking to do same

00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:08,050
building great place to get started and

00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,820
if you're looking to build the

00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:11,860
distribution it's an even better place

00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,930
because it's super easy to get kenapa

00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,610
Lee a great adventure distribution and

00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:17,590
you could have a lot of functionality

00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:19,840
likely to mix of layouts and

00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:22,600
improvements without having to really do

00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:24,940
anything include a couple modules a file

00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:29,830
and that's where this kind of stuff is

00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:32,020
really vital and hopefully probably saw

00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:34,060
your face problems it will help you

00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:36,610
distributions if you want and it's

00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,770
accepting that I think you put Drupal

00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:40,600
and do a sort of higher level and get

00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:42,820
more people using it because it won't

00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,620
require a constant Pedro you do all that

00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,600
stuff but you can make oh I'll make some

00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,040
space really great pages and stuff

00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,070
actually you might like put on the

00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:55,150
internet without having to do any coding

00:09:50,070 --> 00:10:00,040
necessarily so let's talk stop away on

00:09:55,150 --> 00:10:01,300
some pictures so the first thing I throw

00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,560
out there is it promptly like I

00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,930
mentioned it's based on truth before

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,730
it's people seven and it's also based on

00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:08,680
a bunch of modules that you need to do

00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:10,390
all the different things that we do here

00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:12,580
some of the modules so like you know

00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:14,770
more branded and unique ones that we

00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,660
include find entirely exhaustive list

00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,370
that's very close and the ideas that

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,170
these four modules that for folks to

00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:22,089
their models office actually really

00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,860
familiar list it might look a lot like

00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:26,190
what you would saw on your site so you

00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,660
get going and this is the kind of thing

00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:30,550
for someone who sort of you know you

00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,710
need rupal funding this kind of like

00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:34,810
stuff already there already installed

00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:36,160
already configured and already tested or

00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,620
together it's really

00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,389
this you probably all know about fuse by

00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:42,279
extension pc tools because it's the

00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:44,709
pregnancy but you might not use you know

00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,149
admin user modules filter which are

00:10:44,709 --> 00:10:48,009
great modules make your drupal site

00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:50,949
along and then you have some of these

00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:52,000
like you know Morgan v8 kind of features

00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:54,430
or stop it's a little bit more

00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,740
complicated surgery is actually be super

00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:59,230
hard to spell I have all of that already

00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:02,050
there and already sort ready to go is a

00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:04,600
big deal it's also cool because comple

00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:05,980
keeps all these modules up to dating so

00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,680
you download the latest version of

00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:11,189
monopoly in art as all the modules right

00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,930
versions and any like sort of must have

00:11:11,189 --> 00:11:15,339
included along with it that makes it

00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,779
super straightforward so when you're

00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:18,519
sort of to your development you are

00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:20,110
opting a module you can stop you can

00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,639
probably distribution it's the latest

00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:25,569
and then you'll have all the modules

00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:27,189
you'll be able to go on and I've spit

00:11:25,569 --> 00:11:29,949
really about a year half working with

00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:31,269
full of modulator here around a lot of

00:11:29,949 --> 00:11:33,160
patches to make sure all these stuff

00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:34,660
wait space together and can be

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,319
disconnected you guys can use to build

00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:40,149
sites and to do a bunch of code I think

00:11:38,319 --> 00:11:42,279
that's that's really important these

00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:43,720
people a lot of time you turn probably

00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:45,670
on you acknowledge you get all these

00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:54,040
things you've done really not a lot of

00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:56,529
work future too so every group will cite

00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,120
page layout and traditionally feet i

00:11:56,529 --> 00:12:00,220
provide a lot of these layouts and

00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,870
that's why themes are really great there

00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,399
are a lot of things one of the things

00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,250
that probably that's different is that

00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:09,939
it's based on panels as a module but you

00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:11,259
can use anything you want but what

00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:12,910
you'll be great is it out of the box

00:12:11,259 --> 00:12:14,709
with monopoly you get will be one

00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:17,050
layouts that are all I cross-browser

00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:19,870
tested they all have responsive CSS

00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:21,850
properties are able to be added changed

00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:24,519
and switched in real time on the site

00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:27,069
all that most of that for you folks on

00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:29,949
my pocket candlelight gates and demos of

00:12:27,069 --> 00:12:31,779
how you could clover layout believe but

00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,309
in general this is a really great way to

00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:36,100
get started because you don't have to

00:12:33,309 --> 00:12:38,019
write CSS to do any these things just

00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:40,870
got these layouts they're already there

00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:42,699
and you can play fixed end and like

00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:45,080
maybe you're going to run into use cases

00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:47,210
that have different than this

00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:48,740
it's super straight fork just copy the

00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:52,340
one that's closest keep some stuff

00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:57,650
change its pain and go from there and

00:12:52,340 --> 00:13:04,220
there's obviously water on the other

00:12:57,650 --> 00:13:06,290
ones it's really great because this is

00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,640
something that what I used to like build

00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,410
a lot of sites I would have to like

00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,360
start building a way out just when I get

00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:17,270
it now I can just line the layout that's

00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:19,790
closest I just to reinforce wheel every

00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:22,640
time I just use this and for

00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:24,620
distribution sis's core because because

00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,600
you have a distribution based monopoly

00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:28,220
you know all these these versions are

00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,370
already going to be there so you can

00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:33,530
roll out a feature like a news feature

00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:35,150
or you want faq feature you can roll out

00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,830
a lot of stuff and you found a bunch of

00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:39,050
layouts that you can depend to be there

00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:41,270
just like I dare site and that's really

00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:43,250
valuable slicing plenty of sites you can

00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:52,160
both Papalii or distribution to make

00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:54,710
some properly these really good because

00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:58,370
if it saves you I again you get this off

00:13:54,710 --> 00:14:00,710
for free out of the box something

00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:03,100
they're due to my heart I Drupal library

00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:06,740
school organized a lot of information

00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:09,290
when I saw Triple I loved it honey and

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:11,480
my me was really big maybe be very

00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:13,610
happiest librarian the search system

00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,140
over tonight but Drupal core search is

00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:17,660
not a particularly strong and search

00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:21,020
solution it's designed to work on a lot

00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:23,750
of platforms with what resources so

00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:26,510
doing a lot which is good for everyone

00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:28,760
to use but like this is 2013 we have a

00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:31,130
lot of extra cool technical piece we

00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,350
have Search Search API at Apache Solr

00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:37,760
that will pull back the powerful solar

00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:40,070
services a lot of fun and beyond have

00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,960
solar already built in and what the

00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:43,550
great things nopalitos said we'll look

00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,980
list let's do something better with

00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,960
whiskers just Drupal core searchable

00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:50,900
provide it and that's not an integrator

00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:53,080
solar affair or you search a TI BB to

00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,080
sing

00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:58,880
so you can actually with Napoles put it

00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:00,950
on and you get a switch page it's pretty

00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,870
advanced already you can do fascinating

00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:05,600
based on quantum fiber it's easy to put

00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:07,339
in one of your danger whatever you want

00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,959
and this makes the experience better

00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:10,880
because you can build a great site you

00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:13,399
can have great content but if people can

00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:15,589
find it a little tricky probably helps

00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:20,930
you do this you know one of the great

00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:23,810
things also architectural modules module

00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:26,240
powers this thing is you don't use

00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:28,519
virtual just turn it off and you won't

00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,529
have to have dependencies running back

00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:33,440
code and that's the thing that sort of

00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:35,389
stuff Hossa got a lot of people sites

00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,070
and for distributions that need search

00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:41,089
or suggest observe be able two options

00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:43,639
probably the most useful feature right

00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:45,620
now monopoly is busy week this is

00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:48,980
definitely very time intensive to get

00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:50,959
out get a little demo of a sort of the

00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,880
devil face let's talk but in general

00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,519
like setting up Oh easily get rupal is

00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,440
not that easy I mean it's you can set

00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,329
you can download the librarians if it

00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,250
was even module and might turn on some

00:15:59,329 --> 00:16:03,709
options and you can get it to pop off

00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:06,380
but you want to a lot of problems really

00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:08,329
quickly with what most of Commodus

00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,860
security problems but in order to like

00:16:08,329 --> 00:16:12,829
really how about what you see is what

00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:15,140
you get but not allow any able to go

00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:17,320
through you have to write very specific

00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:20,630
rules to filter out certain tags

00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,579
tributes on various tags it's sort of a

00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,199
mess if you're trying to do it one of

00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:25,820
the things probably done already gives

00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:28,250
you input foot patrols at rupal

00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:30,050
literally are that are secure so that

00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,940
you can still have a pretty rich was a

00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:34,940
big experience but you don't have to

00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:37,519
like open up full HTML all users can

00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,050
create security convoys it also

00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,269
integrates a lot of cool for Lydia

00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:44,149
contention modules like the captions are

00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:47,600
module thing we have on the right here

00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:50,120
it integrates it's cool little like you

00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:52,819
can say plugins you can pop the buttons

00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,080
and hide the bottom bar is raised media

00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:56,390
modules you can use

00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:58,970
your images that's part of the WYSIWYG

00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:01,370
and it's not another sort of on the back

00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:03,620
to really search box make sure to urls

00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:05,930
are good at this whole experience nice

00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,910
and if you off let's do busy now you can

00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:09,500
toggle it to an HTML mode and it uses

00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,480
the market up editor's you these

00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,770
receipts and tags and this is the kind

00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:15,380
of stuff that you can spend a lot of

00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:17,600
time making sure that you can was even

00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:20,000
online probably ZZ this for free and

00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,980
it's imported extended and if the kind

00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,390
of favorite just a lot of your content

00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,430
errors were really like and it's

00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:27,800
something you don't like to do you know

00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:30,260
in a few hours it's there you just get a

00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:32,240
fist with a plus for right out of the

00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,950
box that's the thing that's optional

00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,150
included you can probably with you it's

00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:39,650
not really if you pull it into your

00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:42,140
distro or you can use it and this is

00:17:39,650 --> 00:17:45,470
really great if it helps cuz people put

00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:48,170
stuff I have to write code HTML and so

00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:49,940
that's that super great those who make

00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:52,760
exists in a larger market editing page

00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:54,830
so this is the admin section was even

00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:58,610
obviously left that you have stuff on

00:17:54,830 --> 00:18:01,760
the right are sort of use the authors

00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:04,730
published should it be revision feature

00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,530
image or attributes on that events save

00:18:04,730 --> 00:18:08,660
buttons and this is something that this

00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:10,550
is looking to look a lot like a better e

00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:11,900
and an experience will look and it's

00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:13,790
just something that's something and if

00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:16,400
leaves already provide but probably

00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:18,110
provides us form of a you can change it

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,060
if you want but if the kind of thing

00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:21,770
that I think helps to sort of you don't

00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,660
emphasize the stuff that's important but

00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:25,490
you'll see like title is that raised as

00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:27,500
big as the other stuff is like titles

00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:29,510
matter and also are actually quite big

00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,820
on the page and then having that college

00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:34,670
connection is it's very very important

00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:37,010
as a lot of it makes its properly as

00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:40,390
well as like stronger and distribution

00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,390
because you have all your

00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:50,390
landing pages or something else speaks

00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:58,330
really easy folks your views patrols on

00:18:50,390 --> 00:19:01,490
my god we have a bunch of existing pages

00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:03,710
panels breadcrumbs and it's something

00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:06,230
that you could use panels that you've

00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:08,990
used it have been levels like eight sort

00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:13,309
of complicated pages but the promises

00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:16,370
for music back an admin interface is a

00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:18,710
lot of confusing terminology and it does

00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:22,220
a lot for that complexity but for a

00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:23,960
normal user just as a four-page my site

00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:26,150
I want to have some control over it

00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,650
actually can be really fired one of the

00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,660
things that probably makes easy is that

00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:31,540
when you hit add a contact it actually

00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,250
gives you an option to drill any page

00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:36,440
landing pages on the back end it's going

00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:38,510
to be perilous but you never have to go

00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,240
tails back end they just you just take

00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,980
everything and many paths and it just

00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,420
sort of science every way and not

00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,790
because it's really awesome because you

00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:48,950
can quickly create these pages and then

00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,690
i will also lets you customize them so

00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:53,690
you can actually turn around and you

00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:55,610
know if i'm not mistaken spies the page

00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:57,380
you can change my house frank says

00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:59,240
around change search them all plugins

00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,940
and if you really have a pretty good

00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,970
time making sure that right as an end

00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:07,309
user you can make the land occasion book

00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,870
it feel the way that you really want and

00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:10,640
that's the kind of sore it's hard but I

00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:12,260
think I'll you can do really well if

00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,620
it's puts in the hands of people who

00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:17,000
have really great ideas but maybe slowly

00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,200
learning some the technical stuff or

00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,540
just don't want to be bothered because

00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:23,000
it's much more fun just to say hey I

00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:26,210
want to add stuff to a page let me click

00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:28,400
a link on the and let me ask you one

00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:30,830
thing I want to do I want to add an

00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,590
image to say si bar image to a header

00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:35,480
bar and Drupal like you can get a sort

00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:36,860
of do that at the image in there if you

00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,350
guys figure I make a block and make sure

00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:41,540
it reaches the right way physically role

00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,950
soy Joseph Mary absolutely make sure

00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:46,690
it's not responsive properties if you

00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:48,920
need the image to be that way just

00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:51,770
you know monkeying around the drupal

00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,840
back end probably it easy every place

00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:57,980
that you see every sort of like blue be

00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:08,059
giving off you can pick lights tables

00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:10,309
maps videos page book tool which a lot

00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:11,600
of value and for folks are using cop

00:21:10,309 --> 00:21:13,910
elites is repelled drug distribution

00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,430
this is the thing you can hand over

00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:18,559
someone who's not super technical think

00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:21,170
they'll make pages they could add here

00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,820
and then they get an option it's all

00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:25,940
very understandable someone doesn't know

00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,470
any group ilysm I know about a trooper

00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:34,460
purses don't know what a table is I

00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:38,179
still know what a page manager handle or

00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:42,410
something this makes it easy this is

00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:45,080
these are very commonly good because you

00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:48,170
wanna let people you want to let people

00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,300
look at something on the right preview

00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:51,980
see for what it is this is a view in

00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,230
this case and you want to be able to get

00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,700
the various options so I can change the

00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,320
number of things in the view i could

00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:04,280
change in field show i can change the

00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:06,350
order of the title and I can do that all

00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,510
from a front-end interface other

00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:10,040
preferred to go to the back of rupal and

00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,570
it's the kind of thing that you can use

00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,880
to make really really powerful

00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:16,429
distribution stuff that people actually

00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:20,000
uses and users to both sites it's not a

00:22:16,429 --> 00:22:21,980
really great and slice or probably

00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,960
provides this really great guy to

00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:25,580
distribution development that's why

00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,800
there's unto different folks we're

00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:30,050
usually properly to actually build sort

00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:31,760
of more impressive in higher level

00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:37,790
functionality we got you know small

00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:39,559
stuff there's always stuff for music

00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:41,480
professionals to spin up quickly in

00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:42,950
sight there's a distribution for

00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,590
restaurants here is basis of an apple

00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:46,919
you can set up a restaurant menu and

00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,389
some customizations

00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:50,999
and you've got a lot of universities

00:22:48,389 --> 00:22:53,600
that use X or throw eternal family

00:22:50,999 --> 00:22:56,519
version so it's probably plus University

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:59,159
and you got even open a trio for drupal

00:22:56,519 --> 00:23:01,320
silent or spit sighs Carson a lot of

00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:03,480
great work commander face to make open

00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,399
atrium to really awesome as also thinks

00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,919
my monopoly is those kinds of page

00:23:05,399 --> 00:23:09,840
building tools see are really helpful

00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,659
for people who want to make sites but

00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:14,340
also don't want to make distributions

00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:17,639
it's also great because probably because

00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:19,739
it's based on gas tools and takes this

00:23:17,639 --> 00:23:21,840
really strong like an approach to

00:23:19,739 --> 00:23:24,119
development just extremely similar to

00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,999
how Triple P is handling positive market

00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:29,009
system so in copley world you can make a

00:23:26,999 --> 00:23:30,869
way out you make a CTools plugin for a

00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:32,399
way out you want to make an access rule

00:23:30,869 --> 00:23:34,080
or disability rule you make up like an

00:23:32,399 --> 00:23:37,249
Etsy tools you wanna make it's the mill

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,749
like like option to beam sunlight region

00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:42,179
see tools help Logan you want to add a

00:23:39,749 --> 00:23:44,309
piece of content like ctools content

00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:46,559
type is a plug-in for content you want

00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:48,600
to have in a fuse exposed through this

00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,999
way you wanna see tools content take

00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,269
reviews you got enough functionality and

00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:55,679
because everything is a plugin

00:23:53,269 --> 00:23:57,690
everything can be extended and easily

00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,899
modified and that kind of consistent

00:23:57,690 --> 00:24:04,379
architecture is really really important

00:23:59,899 --> 00:24:06,570
thing that has developers has people who

00:24:04,379 --> 00:24:09,450
try to make distributions it makes it

00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:12,179
really easy I don't want a triple size

00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:15,210
it's really easy take it like a bunch of

00:24:12,179 --> 00:24:17,159
wireframes you're just this is the

00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:18,779
layout book and this is a content

00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:21,149
plugging this is a view and you can sort

00:24:18,779 --> 00:24:24,629
of build all them make a library of

00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:26,730
components to sort of see stuff don't

00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:28,379
nothing basically what a great Drupal

00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:32,309
site properly in a matter of minutes and

00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:33,929
is awesome I'll show you I'll show you

00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:35,789
watch yourself in the demo portion but

00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:39,239
if it all I mean this is these were for

00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:41,159
the name properly and it hopefully help

00:24:39,239 --> 00:24:42,419
solidify things that folks this roof

00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:44,960
could see to be really great for

00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:47,609
yourself exterior your friends exactly

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:50,220
what it's not what Bradley isn't it it's

00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:51,869
not a you know it's not like necessarily

00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,240
something that you're going to just have

00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:56,250
to put your own content your own feet

00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,050
is designed to be that based

00:24:56,250 --> 00:25:00,210
distribution the thing that can help

00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:05,160
everybody else and it just helps people

00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:06,809
to get out of the world that's why it's

00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,520
a great guys institution development

00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:10,530
it's a great library doctor-patient

00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:12,480
record of how to use it and extend it

00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:16,650
how to make sure features that work

00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:17,880
really well with propylene add some your

00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:20,880
own stuff you can have a really great

00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:22,770
sin so say you like that you like

00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,710
phenomenally and you won't actually bake

00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:27,150
make a Drupal distribution you want your

00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:29,340
own distribution maybe you're uh you're

00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:31,550
a Drupal a Drupal shocked that every

00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:34,290
time you want to pick up a diversion

00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:36,660
project you want to have your own custom

00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:40,260
stuff you want to use slippery stuff but

00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:42,090
maybe not all and you want to use you

00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,470
want to use your own custom code so the

00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,970
first thing you do is you should go on

00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:47,550
through what work you grab this properly

00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:49,559
age distribution starter kit it's just

00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:51,990
you know a couple files these sort of

00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:55,650
even changed from starter kit to your

00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:57,840
name and now you have profile profile

00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:59,640
and these are the sort of building

00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:01,890
blocks of building a Drupal distribution

00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,809
for folks who've before she agrees rate

00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:06,570
forward for folks interview it's a lot

00:26:03,809 --> 00:26:11,730
like Dorothy you just sort of put in

00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:14,100
some information about your profile this

00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:17,340
article obviously say you're included

00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,840
probably not modules and appendices but

00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:21,720
the idea is that you can extend it to

00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,980
your own stuff so an obvious extension

00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,960
if you don't want to use that Drupal

00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:27,750
pollute responsive Arctic theme you need

00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:30,240
to have your own theme your side for a

00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:32,929
couple of lights so here to set a

00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,890
specific in this case University theme

00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:36,690
branding from the University

00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:39,240
communications department that has a

00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:41,940
comic header common footers common

00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,410
styles and a lot of folks who maybe have

00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:45,120
a common theme that don't have a

00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:46,710
distribution might be really interested

00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,440
in this because you can take starter kit

00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:51,059
take your theme add these to do lines

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,610
with code to actually make sure it turns

00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:56,130
on when you spin it up and then you get

00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:58,140
this kind of thing just right there and

00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:00,120
you have your feet enabled soul eater on

00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:01,980
the Drupal site you install instead of

00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,500
having like get this like blue screen

00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,110
you get something

00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:08,270
your your shop or your University of

00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:10,430
your organization and that's great two

00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:13,700
lines of code and the theme that you can

00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:15,020
get it every time when you start up you

00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,420
also probably want to add a little bit

00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:19,100
of custom functionality to it let's do a

00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:21,440
lot of the box if there's plenty of

00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:23,210
other things people want and stuff it is

00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,680
pretty easy to do and have two

00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:26,930
distributions you can do it a million

00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,190
times if you want we've got in this case

00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:30,530
these are just a couple quick examples

00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:33,280
of stuff you just put in a makefile

00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:36,440
these are a couple other modules exist

00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:39,890
as module to do single sign-on your

00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:41,870
university or large organization there's

00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:43,880
some sort of signal silent solution

00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:45,590
sometimes I can be a little tricky to

00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:48,230
set off on me you've got some settings

00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:50,480
fields you need a couple modules to

00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:52,100
degrade and it's not that harder to make

00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,480
a custom module it turns on those

00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:58,400
settings and you include it enable it

00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,290
same thing for you want to include Soros

00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,030
and feed there's an external data very

00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:03,410
straightforward for a couple things in

00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:05,930
and this is a start building your

00:28:03,410 --> 00:28:08,540
distribution you take the opposite makes

00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:10,790
distribution you had a feed you had a

00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:13,220
little bit of custom functionality and

00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:15,410
you can go for hardness you can extend

00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,850
this to do a lot of a cute stuff but

00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:18,920
it's the kind of thing that is pretty

00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:20,750
straightforward to do once you have that

00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:23,570
kind of videos where us what you want

00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:25,730
and use dope and you get this kind of

00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:28,040
distribution made can turn it from like

00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:30,830
you know your ideas into actual

00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:34,940
distribution and in the matter of nets

00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:37,490
something that can easily damaged to you

00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:39,230
know at are ball and as a drupal

00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:42,050
developer this is obviously pretty

00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:44,540
pretty great because I don't have a car

00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:47,210
ball off people word that just a simple

00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:50,270
I downloaded a distribution as my feet

00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:56,710
so my functionality and all the stuff

00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:59,720
probably due course one's avatar ball I

00:28:56,710 --> 00:29:02,000
smaller Drupal which is you see these

00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,730
are the instructions from drupal org to

00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,990
get Drupal up and running and that's

00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:08,060
something that you know one of the

00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:09,700
pieces I work on it has the oddest or

00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:12,680
kind of aid this process easier

00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:15,140
it'll be an arc state we actually want

00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,670
to have an easy way to get online sort

00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:18,080
of things that I've worked on which is

00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:20,540
for even which game is worth lead into

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,970
the demo is we've got these new screens

00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,410
if you want to drive for example the

00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:26,330
stuff I'm showing off to pay for

00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:28,370
properly it's easy enough you can

00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:31,150
through it go to go to our site and you

00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:33,290
get a link to go it's all probably

00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:35,960
either create a panic account right

00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:37,280
there or if you have a sign in you just

00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:45,530
go ahead and said I want to name my

00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:47,030
snake the way it is through bar and it's

00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:49,730
you know the people yet world it gives

00:29:47,030 --> 00:29:51,440
you a lot of cool stuff but the

00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:56,240
important thing is it set you up with

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:58,550
site that has already has the probably

00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,940
Kody maple and allows every time new

00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:03,800
release and this is between a thing

00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:06,790
looks like pretty important for people

00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,900
who are trying to figure out sort of how

00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:11,110
so that you know keep keep up to date

00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:14,950
that's a huge problem with maintenance

00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:14,950
for folks if you build something

00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:20,990
pantheon provides a lot of support for

00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:22,550
distributions that's what if you know a

00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:24,560
lot of all the work I'm doing is to try

00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:26,240
to put these things together in a way

00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,650
that makes it easy because I wanted like

00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:30,860
I want to see this world we have

00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:34,100
double-digit percentages of websites

00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:35,600
running you know on Drupal and stop

00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,910
lying together we need these

00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,220
distributions we need people to just

00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:42,530
sort of be able to say hey I can not

00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:44,840
something that has my brand has my

00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:46,820
custom functionality I know these things

00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:52,280
for easy to sit up there easy to

00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:54,020
maintain and I sort of go that's surgery

00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:57,230
where I'm coming from and when I spend a

00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:59,840
lot of my time working on but I can also

00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:03,920
go ahead let's go ahead and show you

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:05,960
guys sort of looks like so I've spun up

00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:08,770
a couple instances on my local

00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:12,550
environment just cuz I've Drupal

00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:12,550
conference things long enough

00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:18,139
hopefully we'll be fine there is a

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:22,330
YouTube bit of this I want to show that

00:31:18,139 --> 00:31:22,330
will need the internet but looks like

00:31:22,629 --> 00:31:28,629
but otherwise it's just straight up out

00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:28,629
of the box I've got two versions of it

00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:38,450
so this is version 1 and will run

00:31:36,649 --> 00:31:40,580
through a couple for quick examples but

00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:43,460
I can show us stuff like center features

00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:45,620
in QA or otherwise in fact because for a

00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:48,320
free status but in general like

00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:50,720
businesses a top down the box not a demo

00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,820
content module it comes with topoli

00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,129
isn't happening it's opal because you've

00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:56,419
actually what to say yeah I'll

00:31:55,129 --> 00:31:58,850
have probably set works if you have

00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:00,619
content there it's also a great model if

00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,360
you want to replicate it as the same

00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:05,720
song challenge makes this demo out when

00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:09,019
they can do that really easy profile

00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:10,970
remake my god I think you I praised it's

00:32:09,019 --> 00:32:13,730
pretty straightforward way I think the

00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:16,039
important thing that slides overly show

00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:18,440
is that every page of these options at

00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:21,529
the bottom to customize this page and

00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:24,080
this is done by the panel's IP which is

00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:26,509
vital part of panels it's more that sort

00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:30,019
of Rupa modules because it takes in any

00:32:26,509 --> 00:32:32,450
landing page and node and user page and

00:32:30,019 --> 00:32:34,759
it turns it into an object that you can

00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:36,769
actually customize right there and it

00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:38,779
doesn't require you to go to back so

00:32:36,769 --> 00:32:40,519
we'll go back to the homepage they

00:32:38,779 --> 00:32:43,460
customize this page and I immediately

00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:45,440
get these UI tools actually change

00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:47,059
around this kind of thing and it's

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,889
blooming there's obvious stuff like it

00:32:47,059 --> 00:32:50,659
might drag stuff around which is you

00:32:48,889 --> 00:32:52,519
know pretty easy and I can save or

00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:56,600
cancel depending depending on what I

00:32:52,519 --> 00:33:00,649
want I also have the ability to elite

00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:01,909
self if for some reason search and this

00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:04,129
is the kind of thing that you know

00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:05,899
excited nerds might want to do site

00:33:04,129 --> 00:33:07,220
builders might want to do actually stop

00:33:05,899 --> 00:33:09,470
pumps default or if they want to change

00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,179
it later they looked a little bit so

00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:13,490
that like I can change the layouts in

00:33:11,179 --> 00:33:15,590
this page so this pulls off the layouts

00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:17,389
I showed you we got 31 of them but

00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:20,450
actually switch it's just a matter of

00:33:17,389 --> 00:33:22,550
clicking clicking to another one I'd

00:33:20,450 --> 00:33:25,070
rather lay off and it'll just enroll

00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:26,630
I'm switch my way out for me and it will

00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:30,140
require me to actually go change any

00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:32,090
template files or any CSS just just go

00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:33,680
ahead it swamp that one out that's right

00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:35,390
this is the landing page will work out

00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,610
wait for notes it will either do it

00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:39,500
occupancy good basis so just change this

00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:41,510
one node to be this way or you can

00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,850
change all no to that tight roll users

00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:46,040
well whatever you want that's one of the

00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:47,060
sort of values of this that's

00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:49,190
interesting what you told the

00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:51,050
distribution people want to change it

00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:54,980
from what the default is this makes it

00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:56,930
easy and is it making go the other piece

00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:58,940
is super helpful and you see the slot

00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:01,460
notes for a clear head space as a lot of

00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:03,590
our own organizations I'll tell it's

00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,760
good to be maintained for design but

00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:07,100
they have a lot of users that want

00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,929
steaks to look in different ways so one

00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:10,550
of the plugins you can add to this kind

00:34:08,929 --> 00:34:13,460
of stuff is you've got a smile plugin

00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:16,820
and this is a perfect example of styles

00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:18,710
so we've got better like its default on

00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:20,929
the right but go ahead and change the

00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:24,670
styles right here actually have you know

00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:26,780
various features from the group of Orcs

00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:28,700
receive it looks like make sure it's

00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:33,860
depending i want and that this beam

00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:35,570
function that CSS classes but allows me

00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:38,150
to start to do stuff like this so i can

00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:41,390
actually change the visual appearance my

00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:44,390
site without copy to go and might do CSS

00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:48,250
or complicated look at group is markup

00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:50,270
which is just can be a handful for sure

00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:51,830
and this is a stuff when you're building

00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:54,440
a distribution or you have your own

00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:56,600
theme your themes to ship with several

00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,640
style games that do stuff like this you

00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:04,400
can make it go from different visual

00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:07,370
looks better whatever you want that's

00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:09,350
super you also get the ability for

00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:11,930
anything that's exported it comes as a

00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:13,970
few views views is written us and for

00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:16,970
several panels so just refusing that

00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:19,220
kind of normal it's really easy to hit a

00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:21,560
novelty get customized you actually get

00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:23,720
this interface looks like this and this

00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:26,750
is basically a bunch of options

00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:29,090
oh I feel better play match orbit is

00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:30,859
diffuse UI which is like dis really

00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:32,750
common better and the last couple years

00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:34,180
but I'm still be tricky especially if

00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:36,980
you don't know a lot of terminology

00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:39,290
probably just exposes easy it's

00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:41,300
different I might only watched show you

00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:43,010
know that's two things it's basically

00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:45,140
brief I might not want to show the

00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:47,270
images but I do want to show the teasers

00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:50,150
I mean wanna show you the author who

00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:52,520
post maybe not and that this is the kind

00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:55,730
of thing I can switch a lot of options

00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:58,220
cuz i want the back but require them to

00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:59,810
sort of you know of the end user only be

00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:02,540
presented itself that actually changes

00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:04,550
their experience and it's the kind of

00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:06,530
thing they'll be a drupal product that

00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:08,630
becomes really easy so if I'm something

00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:11,030
like open atrium I want to let certain

00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:12,830
pieces of my distribution of my sight be

00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:15,140
customized I don't want to let other

00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:17,210
stuff be so let me go turn on the right

00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:20,570
options push it through this UI and

00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:26,420
panels and so much stronger experience

00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:30,560
and I thinking work for a bunch of the

00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:32,630
other pieces it's you can also make new

00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,820
stuff obviously that landing page idea

00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:44,800
something two plates to do really well

00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:48,170
so I can go ahead and do web page so you

00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:53,900
can just go ahead and say this page I'll

00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:55,280
add menu on the top level and this is

00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,599
going to go out and promote about a

00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,550
struggle through the panels back end

00:36:56,599 --> 00:37:02,570
let's not worry about that let's just

00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:04,099
take the page and this is the first

00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:06,500
thing work I should send us off

00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:08,570
yesterday but it's it's really valuable

00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:11,000
to understand it as a site builder I

00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:13,190
want to take peaches I want to make my

00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,990
site logo circle right or ps3 way I

00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:18,140
don't necessarily want to do a bunch of

00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:20,119
google code to get there I I want to

00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:24,320
like find the stuff I found so the

00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:28,000
library's my existing pieces of course

00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,000
or biggest want to have this image

00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:35,890
portage their throat you later 12x10 one

00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,890
and

00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:26,880
text and why just take the WYSIWYG text

00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:36,380
this is my favorite that you have some

00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:44,250
for vegetarians be planted for years I

00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:47,310
mean you can add text right there and

00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:50,820
you don't have to worry about like you

00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:57,570
can copy paste or this is going to be

00:38:50,820 --> 00:39:00,890
true for all spotlight videos the other

00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:03,450
clerks uses a media module which is

00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:12,980
definitely pretty full module I don't

00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:16,800
know it is neither modules great module

00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:18,330
under Star Trek memories perfect and we

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:20,790
can module is cool because anything that

00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:24,930
I upload or or select in this case from

00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:26,609
YouTube will show up on I will show that

00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:28,680
the media library so when I go to other

00:39:26,609 --> 00:39:34,500
spots I can reuse it that's also really

00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:41,190
important idea you can also rig the

00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:44,490
video and this is really experienced box

00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:46,230
or it sitting there and try like what

00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:48,690
triple really people to do like mrs.

00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:50,580
suit report and fill out distributions

00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:52,170
they want stuff to work out a box they

00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:55,200
want to be the kind of thing that is

00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:57,810
most be but they also know have to

00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,490
change you have to accept it if you say

00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:00,840
here's the distribution but can't do

00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:02,670
anything new with it you know how these

00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:05,220
customizations on it doesn't work very

00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:06,780
well people want people see really great

00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:09,210
sounds in the internet they wanted to be

00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:11,340
very much like them give them the tools

00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:13,200
and stuff from purely well the other

00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,910
source tools i brush so quickly we've

00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:17,610
got this now mar module which is going

00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:20,460
to be a for app experience you can use

00:40:17,610 --> 00:40:22,680
an allen key seven seasons it's a pretty

00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,360
cool sort of admin experience there's

00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,860
some properly specific settings just to

00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:29,610
adjust sort of some of the components

00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:32,280
you see you can turn if you want to

00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:35,610
customize very cool but you also have

00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:37,200
this were a standard item and this is

00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:41,820
their content creation here for the page

00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:46,100
i want to go out to tax i want to go out

00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:46,100
an image i can use the PIAA module

00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:54,690
before and it'll likely back to my files

00:40:52,590 --> 00:41:01,170
repository haven't managed in my files

00:40:54,690 --> 00:41:05,130
table let me access it at Pickett's

00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:08,790
image style i want and and be able to do

00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:10,560
really image resize module which is

00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:13,380
super great i can actually just the size

00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,000
this thing and drupal automatically drop

00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:20,030
it to be just that sometimes you have to

00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:27,210
deliver something go ahead maybe

00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:29,100
captions this is pdx and this is the

00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:31,080
kind of experiences like this is hot

00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:32,940
away like the wordpress editor the same

00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,809
vendors or dress almost the same bottom

00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,859
placements

00:41:33,809 --> 00:41:39,449
sink Ayakashi filter and wordpress

00:41:36,859 --> 00:41:41,369
install through glass and one of the big

00:41:39,449 --> 00:41:43,619
reasons is that word princess something

00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:45,420
out ox is super awesome it makes you and

00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:47,339
how to kill you block and you get a

00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:49,140
WYSIWYG and you get a generic rule you

00:41:47,339 --> 00:41:51,180
get ad interfaces and you don't have to

00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:52,829
worry about it Andy and things are

00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:54,749
simple like you only see this top bar

00:41:52,829 --> 00:41:58,170
and you go see more buttons if you want

00:41:54,749 --> 00:41:59,759
but you start saying Eddie 3 like people

00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:02,069
don't necessarily understand that and

00:41:59,759 --> 00:42:06,359
the simplicity of the whole thing is

00:42:02,069 --> 00:42:07,709
really really really valuable sort of

00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:09,749
site builder and someone who doesn't

00:42:07,709 --> 00:42:11,339
work with distributions the easier the

00:42:09,749 --> 00:42:13,019
better is even if you've got group a

00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:15,029
long time there's a bunch of stuff that

00:42:13,019 --> 00:42:16,979
can be attained if you're new to Drupal

00:42:15,029 --> 00:42:20,729
endorse and triple isms you start from

00:42:16,979 --> 00:42:23,749
people like drupal yeah classes are

00:42:20,729 --> 00:42:26,369
ebooks and come to this like this just

00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:28,880
that I think is that it's a whole triple

00:42:26,369 --> 00:42:31,529
back it makes it so you have to be

00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:33,299
purple site because how it should be I

00:42:31,529 --> 00:42:35,910
think you should be able to spit up

00:42:33,299 --> 00:42:37,859
distribution how to easily officine and

00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:40,999
then make the kind of like content

00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:45,859
changes ultimately what makes your site

00:42:40,999 --> 00:42:45,859
most rupal sites don't have complicated

00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:51,900
to do to make it work and want a great

00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:54,420
piece of Drupal supplies to trip modules

00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,920
free to contribute back distribution for

00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,900
every way for an aggregate put stuff

00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,849
together mop in particular and take the

00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:02,579
best of the Detroit space put it

00:42:59,849 --> 00:43:04,410
together way to have experiences so you

00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:06,839
can have stuff like there's a safe drive

00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:09,179
module properly so I actually go ahead

00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:11,670
Mike you publish my content if I wanna

00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:12,900
live or save it as a draft and that's

00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:14,670
cooking dinner right there are the

00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:23,189
action buttons it's not like a hidden

00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:25,769
box it feels sticky what a fat take a

00:43:23,189 --> 00:43:29,400
front page page which does it work is

00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:32,479
your Aegis fall which because justice

00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:35,689
and this is the kind of thing like

00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:35,689
Drupal sites

00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:41,589
and that's that's our policy straight

00:43:39,849 --> 00:43:42,880
and that's expecting it like these are

00:43:41,589 --> 00:43:46,329
the rules of a sort of tools people

00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:50,349
people have to go do stuff but we also

00:43:46,329 --> 00:43:53,589
have a distribution properly but this is

00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:55,930
what for another University and it's

00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:58,059
like hey why you know why just have the

00:43:55,930 --> 00:44:01,240
blue turn on your theme every single

00:43:58,059 --> 00:44:03,940
sign-on and we hit customize the content

00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:08,619
for the various pages they actually you

00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:10,960
know change the odds but also have seen

00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:13,059
very specific branded ones from the

00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:16,119
University and this is the case stuff

00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:18,369
what you want to give people drupal few

00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:20,710
conversations like I needed rupal site

00:44:18,369 --> 00:44:22,690
give them something with a bunch of

00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:24,790
styles such a way out so that bunch of

00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:27,640
tools that they can actually make really

00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:29,079
awesome pages and not require sort of it

00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:31,150
have to third group won't go through a

00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:32,680
bunch of classism and do all that me

00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:36,220
drupal's break you should learn it's

00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:38,230
definitely worth the time but its site

00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:40,270
will be perspective you know the sooner

00:44:38,230 --> 00:44:42,160
you get people building their content in

00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:45,220
happier but be in the e service and

00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,230
that's why we're these distribution is

00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:50,290
really great and Pam comprised looks

00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:51,940
really great easiest and the world we

00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:54,760
live in is one word like you can have it

00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:58,990
possible sites Facebook site and that's

00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:00,609
a face or spit up few options and you're

00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:02,770
just dragging drop in your page that's

00:45:00,609 --> 00:45:03,970
what he's trying to do specifically so

00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:07,359
if you're looking for the drupal site

00:45:03,970 --> 00:45:09,099
use properly and that's what this sort

00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:10,809
of base distribution ideas I do for

00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:12,480
everyone so if you want to have your own

00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:15,220
distribution your own flavor of Drupal

00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,049
check out the slip it under power and I

00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:19,480
how to set it up come talk to me after

00:45:17,049 --> 00:45:21,040
this or email me or be the issues you're

00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:23,500
prob way off to figure out of a people

00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:25,150
I'm really great distress although these

00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:28,559
questions but thanks for the Quran to

00:45:25,150 --> 00:45:28,559
see everything and hope you check it out

00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:49,710
asking questions feel free to come up

00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:49,710
here or I wouldn't just under people go

00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:02,710
one thing that's Lava springs office

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:07,060
typing modules and each other the right

00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:09,280
the right versions one things were both

00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:11,859
really poorly is in it's sort of install

00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,020
process because it sees an ex all stuff

00:46:11,859 --> 00:46:16,420
is part of distribution there's some

00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:20,710
code actually start that will actually

00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:22,630
go install a module dependencies of that

00:46:20,710 --> 00:46:24,910
module to make sure that those qualities

00:46:22,630 --> 00:46:31,780
like it's in topic for it's like a five

00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:34,270
line just to be a little more specific

00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:36,400
about that so if a security update is

00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:39,760
released for a module that now p

00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:41,590
requires do you recommend updating the

00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:44,500
module discreetly or do you recommend

00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:49,450
actually pulling in a new and I'm

00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:51,550
waiting for you to update yeah so

00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:54,760
publishers much of modules gets updated

00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:57,130
pretty regularly when there's new that's

00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:59,800
like you like definitely security

00:46:57,130 --> 00:47:01,960
casements 31 / defects you what a cool

00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,880
things the triple architecture is that

00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,550
all the comedy code it's all in sludge

00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,080
profiles properly or give a disc another

00:47:06,550 --> 00:47:10,390
base diffusion profile secure

00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:12,970
distribution and so if you need updates

00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:15,100
AC tools as an updated comes out you can

00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:17,530
download the new version CTools throw in

00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:19,390
sites all modules and Drupal actually

00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:21,369
prefer that version over the line of the

00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:23,590
profile and so that's an easy way to

00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:25,390
actually update your site without having

00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,920
to break the distribution and that's

00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:28,540
just a choice you can wait for tompa to

00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:31,619
come up new releases we do that pretty

00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:31,619
often but um

00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:43,349
first of all thank you very much you're

00:47:39,990 --> 00:47:49,170
talking and you were my question is do

00:47:43,349 --> 00:47:51,510
you have a recommendation yes so if

00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:53,279
you're interested basting the a really

00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:55,079
great one that works it probably is

00:47:53,279 --> 00:47:58,529
based on true bootstrap is called rapist

00:47:55,079 --> 00:48:00,299
our ad hi aksam that's basically open

00:47:58,529 --> 00:48:04,109
atrium bound is getting a lot of money

00:48:00,299 --> 00:48:05,789
just in general it is it's pretty well

00:48:04,109 --> 00:48:09,750
documented and it's designed to be a

00:48:05,789 --> 00:48:11,339
base that can be extended it's gonna be

00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:13,920
bottle the next version of properly for

00:48:11,339 --> 00:48:17,069
people to try to you go on triple mark

00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:19,140
now and get it our ad is it's a good way

00:48:17,069 --> 00:48:22,049
to get started don't leave a good base

00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:29,819
themes like in the space and is

00:48:22,049 --> 00:48:34,190
obviously great Omega all like it it's

00:48:29,819 --> 00:48:34,190
bootstrap which is also great libraries

00:48:38,359 --> 00:48:46,770
I do wonder if you've been following the

00:48:42,839 --> 00:48:55,710
development of the boy you see the full

00:48:46,770 --> 00:48:57,990
upgrade because it's good yeah so I

00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:59,579
definitely want that Drupal 8 and what

00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:01,049
great things is below the waves that

00:48:59,579 --> 00:49:04,170
properly is sort of thinking about

00:49:01,049 --> 00:49:07,109
Drupal and taking action work plugins

00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:09,240
very similar to t8 it also helps that

00:49:07,109 --> 00:49:13,020
you know for Scotch initiatives for

00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:14,970
blocks layouts which is for same boy is

00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:18,539
a commentator multi through the comedy

00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:20,190
Rococo be mad to decide which TC c 2 l's

00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:22,920
me from that so a lot of these concepts

00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:26,430
are going to be a PA internal the plan

00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:28,260
48 is that the course of anomaly a lot

00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:30,680
of it's already good in Hitler before so

00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:33,930
that was you know like layout system

00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:35,430
blocks anywhere that should be stops

00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:37,859
this code that we don't even beeping

00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:39,990
worry about except for the data and the

00:49:37,859 --> 00:49:41,760
data model is not the same but it's

00:49:39,990 --> 00:49:43,529
close enough that I think writing a very

00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:45,510
pastoral public site to be actually

00:49:43,529 --> 00:49:46,170
pretty easy to do and that's what are

00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:49,020
things

00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:51,630
da we're working on for control module

00:49:49,020 --> 00:49:54,030
set a lot of modules improperly there

00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:56,310
are more or less optional like a live it

00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:58,380
happens often a lot sorry expert things

00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:59,940
are something that you could have safer

00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:02,220
half to three module but if you don't

00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:04,680
have it 48 like popping whilst also be

00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:07,290
da version the really the only thing

00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:09,840
that I think is people breaker BPD is

00:50:07,290 --> 00:50:13,470
actually building this this I bees were

00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:15,360
a page building tool d8 stuff as far as

00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:17,400
I can tell it depends how much death

00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:20,720
will actually get done by the fries but

00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:23,730
on this time in you is something good

00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:27,180
mobility 8 the world we included day1

00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:29,460
api's this will be the biggest piece of

00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:31,080
atonement to do but the hope with the

00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:33,510
ages of all a vehicle modules we need

00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:35,250
things like use or si tutul library

00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:37,800
module those sort of a moving in a

00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:41,970
correr ways I don't be back jquery

00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:43,470
update any more to the jQuery and so I'm

00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:45,540
going to list in my head of the bottles

00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:48,120
are secured I the tape ripping tool to

00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:59,430
fix one but because probably have lost

00:50:48,120 --> 00:51:03,390
up my ta the upgrade hi dan looks

00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:06,690
incredibly useful I work for a company

00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:09,510
that does very very custom project work

00:51:06,690 --> 00:51:12,210
and we recently we've tried all sorts of

00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:13,590
solutions and that man just looks like a

00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:17,010
huge improvement from what we've been

00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:18,960
using basically the question is work for

00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:21,870
you agree the custom theme that

00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:27,390
uses foundation we customers a lot of

00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:31,260
HTML I just have some concerns with is

00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:35,100
there a way to use monopoly and have a

00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:37,800
high level of customization or do I mean

00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:40,080
I'm just not sure exactly how much if we

00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:42,390
went with how much we would be able to

00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:45,029
customize and still allow them to do a

00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:48,509
lot to drag and drop stuff

00:51:45,029 --> 00:51:49,769
yeah so good question i would say in

00:51:48,509 --> 00:51:52,380
general properly there's a lot of

00:51:49,769 --> 00:51:54,419
customization as possible select this is

00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:56,159
all true poets all this can you take

00:51:54,419 --> 00:51:58,439
that can be changed or altered or things

00:51:56,159 --> 00:51:59,549
like that and then one of the titles of

00:51:58,439 --> 00:52:01,049
you've seen a lot is that you can

00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:03,119
actually include the pieces of property

00:52:01,049 --> 00:52:05,339
you really want so if you like it like

00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:06,599
it was you can clean back you know if

00:52:05,339 --> 00:52:07,979
you want to search legacy what you do

00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:10,799
you don't even need to include that and

00:52:07,979 --> 00:52:12,959
then once you get office 08 all of this

00:52:10,799 --> 00:52:15,390
stuff is if you understand the camel

00:52:12,959 --> 00:52:17,459
CTools world is easy to customize so

00:52:15,390 --> 00:52:19,169
that had been page for example that is

00:52:17,459 --> 00:52:21,119
felt as a panel and you can go into

00:52:19,169 --> 00:52:22,619
panels that you can change the order or

00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:25,049
you can change the layout that you can

00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:27,569
have that for and it always for our

00:52:25,049 --> 00:52:29,099
philosophy is provide a same default but

00:52:27,569 --> 00:52:31,259
allow people to change and almost

00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:33,929
everything here is and can be changed

00:52:31,259 --> 00:52:36,119
and then what a great also development

00:52:33,929 --> 00:52:37,739
patterns they it girl feature eyes can

00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:39,029
hear if you want to have a version of

00:52:37,739 --> 00:52:41,249
this it's a little different there's

00:52:39,029 --> 00:52:43,259
much of home features over I've you turn

00:52:41,249 --> 00:52:45,509
our features over ID say hey like they

00:52:43,259 --> 00:52:47,999
give you know that it changed explore

00:52:45,509 --> 00:52:49,229
that in mind over it feature and then it

00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:50,249
will all just work and you can deploy

00:52:49,229 --> 00:52:52,589
it's pretty straightforward but

00:52:50,249 --> 00:52:54,959
everything is extendable you sizes we

00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:56,789
get into that you know kind of stuff

00:52:54,959 --> 00:53:01,259
there's my great appreciation properly

00:52:56,789 --> 00:53:04,019
do for their shows thank you for the

00:53:01,259 --> 00:53:10,739
presentation I 30 I was wondering if

00:53:04,019 --> 00:53:15,209
there's not a theme but just really for

00:53:10,739 --> 00:53:16,890
Pendleton views yeah so the apps for 31

00:53:15,209 --> 00:53:20,880
of under using us for a 960 grid

00:53:16,890 --> 00:53:23,099
approach there's nothing it's good super

00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:24,419
magical in general like you actually

00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:26,579
have a lot of flexibility like

00:53:24,419 --> 00:53:28,109
everything in that sort of me in the

00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:30,749
theme world everything in the contact

00:53:28,109 --> 00:53:33,569
region is controlled by properly and

00:53:30,749 --> 00:53:35,849
that you can use any kind of theme grid

00:53:33,569 --> 00:53:37,439
system you want we use 964 oh my alex

00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:39,839
Justice asked what we've actually sort

00:53:37,439 --> 00:53:41,450
of knew we could then I mean it's fine I

00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:43,160
don't think you do

00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:45,859
thing you want I was just speaking the

00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:49,510
right way out picture I think you secret

00:53:45,859 --> 00:53:49,510
system itself is good a lot of properly

00:53:59,619 --> 00:54:06,349
um but when you put the plus sign waves

00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:08,510
right now can you I couldn't find the

00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:10,880
ability to add like a few that i created

00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:13,070
just I saw the ones that you had already

00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:15,020
done on the side there I was just

00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:20,960
wondering if I was missing something or

00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:24,680
if you have to turn yeah yeah so that

00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,589
the trick here is that views views and

00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:29,690
football have a buncha display case

00:54:26,589 --> 00:54:31,849
there's a block and pages there is a

00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:33,980
display type in views called content

00:54:31,849 --> 00:54:35,420
page on which is labeled totally

00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:37,940
different than what it should be because

00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:40,849
it's four pails and if you make a few

00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:42,530
displayed it says content it won't and

00:54:40,849 --> 00:54:44,030
you know when you add that it'll

00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:46,220
actually prompt you sis give me a name

00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:48,079
and give me a category and then it will

00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:50,180
show up in this place so the category in

00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:52,220
this case is demo this is these are

00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:56,599
three displays review you want to add

00:54:52,220 --> 00:55:00,230
one new you just add a new content and

00:54:56,599 --> 00:55:02,720
that's weird once you get at it and then

00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:04,099
you have much options to it okay if you

00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:05,480
want too much you want the fields to be

00:55:04,099 --> 00:55:06,650
able to be selected you want the sort

00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:15,430
selected you want the number of items

00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:18,050
and all that's right questions yeah

00:55:15,430 --> 00:55:19,819
everybody's thinking about responsive

00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:22,640
design there are there different

00:55:19,819 --> 00:55:25,190
approaches for choosing what bits of

00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:28,310
London show up different for different

00:55:25,190 --> 00:55:31,339
media do you have a recommended approach

00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:34,040
within not lately yeah so one thing

00:55:31,339 --> 00:55:36,290
which I didn't demo suppose so the site

00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:38,390
actually is responsive in some ice it's

00:55:36,290 --> 00:55:40,040
responsive Arctic which is the death

00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:42,440
beam but if you have a theme that sport

00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:44,510
responsive design all home ayats and all

00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:47,720
the four components are properly all

00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:50,000
responsive properties the way it works

00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,380
how is a 30 standard just like you know

00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,940
that's removed

00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:55,759
it's not the content flow the image

00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:58,549
resize the text change but what they're

00:55:55,759 --> 00:56:00,650
really cool features of camels is that

00:55:58,549 --> 00:56:02,990
you actually have the ability with these

00:56:00,650 --> 00:56:04,880
disability rules to decide what kind of

00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:07,730
content gets showing to what kind of

00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,109
device so there's a really great module

00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:11,329
loss chatting earlier about with folks

00:56:09,109 --> 00:56:13,190
are at cocktails breakpoints that

00:56:11,329 --> 00:56:14,539
actually you can specify what

00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:16,339
breakpoints you want to use for your

00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:19,430
responsive design and then you can

00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:22,900
actually have the system the cow system

00:56:19,430 --> 00:56:25,759
nachos sidebar elements or other things

00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:26,809
202like mobile devices and this is

00:56:25,759 --> 00:56:29,210
really important salad of folks

00:56:26,809 --> 00:56:30,950
responsible just like displaying on the

00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:32,750
sidebar if it's on phone you're still

00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:34,730
downloading all that code and in some

00:56:32,750 --> 00:56:36,529
cases even getting the images and then

00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:38,960
that's what kind of thing that can take

00:56:36,529 --> 00:56:40,849
a lot of time you saw a profile for a

00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,380
boy or there's a few other kinds of our

00:56:40,849 --> 00:56:45,769
solutions actually integrative

00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:48,069
disability rule you can actually not

00:56:45,769 --> 00:56:50,809
ship stuff to mobile devices the network

00:56:48,069 --> 00:56:53,450
in general positive stuffing properly is

00:56:50,809 --> 00:56:56,539
it we've got lots of layouts got

00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:58,279
responsive images CSS but there's

00:56:56,539 --> 00:57:00,500
definitely cooler stuff it's going to be

00:56:58,279 --> 00:57:03,650
two da and in general that's a pretty

00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:05,390
fun and innovative area so there is an

00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:07,309
issue in the panoply shakeel making more

00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:08,720
stuff responsive and a bunch of

00:57:07,309 --> 00:57:10,990
recommendations and people start talking

00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:14,930
mostly nice or saying something

00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:19,269
rethinking it a week later and the

00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:19,269
details right points from kind of stuff

00:57:33,039 --> 00:57:41,660
you mentioned theme that you recommended

00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:46,990
that use the Twitter bootstrap yep I was

00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:46,990
wondering the templates

00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:54,060
the template for comp we do not use the

00:57:50,820 --> 00:57:58,560
Twitter bootstrap and that's market we

00:57:54,060 --> 00:58:01,080
are starting before then before super

00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:03,720
big the radix stuff does though and

00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:06,450
actually radix has its own layout module

00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:10,830
called ratings layouts and that actually

00:58:06,450 --> 00:58:13,290
has these are all probably like approved

00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:15,330
layouts that actually work with food /

00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:16,860
bootstrap stuff and if you're into

00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:19,320
pixels or boot shopping for business

00:58:16,860 --> 00:59:34,020
cool check out this instead it actually

00:58:19,320 --> 00:59:35,790
has a lot of saying I mean I believe

00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:37,470
that people should have like the website

00:59:35,790 --> 00:59:40,260
they want and people should have the

00:59:37,470 --> 00:59:42,360
ability to customize and changes and I

00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:44,400
think that was he big some of the more

00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:46,170
general kind of tools it doesn't let

00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:48,630
people sort of go to help you know to

00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:50,730
whatever does try to make like a website

00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:51,180
like Microsoft Word browser or something

00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:53,680
like

00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:55,840
these are like bottles of contact

00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,520
creation that people understand this is

00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:59,830
the kind of stuff when you say how do

00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:02,770
you get information out to organization

00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:05,500
people ready need eldritch tax time some

01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:07,090
or diamonds they make PS and telling

01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,530
them that like that's not how you to go

01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:11,440
ad you have to learn this better way

01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:14,020
because I learnt like you know we have

01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:16,060
like new ideas I can think if you take

01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:17,410
is good that's awesome but if it's just

01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:20,380
going to force people different way it's

01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:22,300
hard enough to learn technology hard

01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:24,430
enough to a purpose straight up and I

01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:27,610
think having people have familiarity

01:00:24,430 --> 01:00:29,110
which they're cool is what a strongest

01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:31,660
ways to improve accessibility and

01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:33,010
usability of them and I think I love

01:00:31,660 --> 01:00:36,190
look a roller like there's better ways

01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:37,990
to get online Lucy wig but it eight

01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:39,880
people understand that concept in a

01:00:37,990 --> 01:00:41,950
pretty important way and I think that's

01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:44,200
not going to change anytime soon and I

01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:45,610
think that but one of the good things i

01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,470
think one of the things probably hopes

01:00:45,610 --> 01:00:49,150
to do is it does give you alternate

01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:51,790
methods if that's what you can use was

01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:53,710
easy to style stuff ever you want or you

01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:56,380
can add more structured style point if

01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:58,540
we do with particular and i think we can

01:00:56,380 --> 01:01:02,710
move in that direction to where we are

01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:05,050
right now I mean like deary ID I oh it's

01:01:02,710 --> 01:01:06,880
cool i just lost emails if you like

01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:08,230
gotta get people they want people want

01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:10,150
was you think i'll put their content

01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:11,680
life they know how it works we have

01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:13,540
trouble getting people to write their

01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:15,370
squad and do it that's that's what i

01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:17,830
said i want the top people put their

01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:32,310
ideas i'm a better place and people

01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:32,310
