Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: USER EXPERIENCE FOR ONLINE EDUCATION
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	I work for UniversityNow, a San Francisco startup in the online higher education space. We deliver online education to working adults through our flexible, self-paced degree programs.

In this presentation, I will talk about the role of user experience in online education. Sticking with an online class, let alone a whole degree program, is a huge commitment for a user to make. As a user experience designer, this creates unique opportunities for research and usability testing. It also makes it easy for users to get fed up with you. User experience is key in this market.

I will also talk about the conflux of user experience and marketing, and the skillsets that user experience professionals bring to the marketing world. At our company, user experience is involved with understanding our student base, how we market to them, and keeping tabs on their experience as students. I am going to talk about how this integrated approach has helped us, and ways that other user experience teams can begin to work closer with their marketing and customer service departments.

Drupal world for four or five ish years

00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,120
i guess around when drupal five was

00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,010
coming out i used to do kind of

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,590
independent web consulting drupal web

00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:48,239
development that kind of stuff I worked

00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,039
for Google for a little bit mostly on

00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,930
the search team but also had a little

00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,300
bit of exposure to user experience

00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,010
projects there and most recently I

00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,489
worked for a company called university

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,109
now which is the ed tech piece of the

00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,480
talk today that will talk a lot about

00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,880
that's me making coffee in my office

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,640
with cats I'm really happy that

00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,080
drupalcon is in Portland this year a lot

00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,770
of really good coffee being roasted out

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,920
here so that's really great for me oh

00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:19,619
and about these slides there on like

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,390
they're inside of a google doc so it'll

00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:22,830
be you know open for everyone to look

00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,290
and I'll show the bitly link at the end

00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:29,400
and that's my Twitter handle and all

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:31,619
that stuff okay so here's what I want to

00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,420
talk about today first I really want to

00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,979
kind of give you guys an idea of what

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:39,990
it's like to be doing user experience

00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:42,329
for online education I mean very

00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:43,829
specifically from for within my company

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:46,590
university now what the unique

00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,659
challenges are that we face I'm going to

00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,149
talk about a couple of different I guess

00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:52,590
recurring themes lessons kind of things

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,259
that has been pounded over and over

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,780
again to into my head from from doing

00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,939
work with you now and I also want to

00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:04,380
share with you guys a cup-like very

00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:10,020
three maybe tools that I've kind of used

00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:13,930
a bit and found really useful okay so

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:16,090
let's get started about university now

00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:17,950
really important that I get this out

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,200
that way you kind of everyone

00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:23,019
understands where I'm coming from so the

00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,269
mission of our company is to ensure that

00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:26,590
high-quality post-secondary at higher

00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:28,689
education well that was kind of

00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,579
repeating myself to basically it's to

00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:32,349
ensure that high quality post-secondary

00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:35,260
education is available to people

00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:38,019
everywhere so this means basically that

00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:40,450
a college degree is within reach of

00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:43,180
everyone that wants it so it's a very

00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:47,139
mission-driven organization and we

00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:49,120
operate these two universities we own

00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:51,010
them one of them is called new charter

00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,290
University it's a hundred percent online

00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:55,329
offers like associates bachelor's MBA

00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,370
degrees the other one is called patent

00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:59,950
University that one has a campus in

00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,629
oakland california and also does online

00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:06,310
degree programs so that's sort of the

00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:08,469
structure of the organization so has

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,500
anyone ever heard of any of these guys

00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:14,799
up here on the slide okay a couple hands

00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,349
cool so this is sort of the world of ed

00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,030
tech that you might read about in the

00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:21,489
new york times every day or any other

00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:24,069
you know news technology kind of website

00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:26,139
and what these guys are doing is is

00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:29,169
really cool anyone familiar with the

00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:31,629
acronym Mook kind of cringe when I say

00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:35,079
it but Mook yeah so moog stands for a

00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:37,090
massively open online course and what

00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:39,159
places like Coursera Udacity you to me

00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:41,530
EDX what they're doing is essentially

00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:43,989
taking this really high quality amazing

00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,280
course material packaging it up from

00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:46,689
some of the best universities around the

00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,549
world there's just from that from some

00:03:46,689 --> 00:03:50,439
of the best content authors and kind of

00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:53,560
making it available and accessible to

00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:56,169
people and its really awesome I've taken

00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,180
some Coursera classes a really great

00:03:56,169 --> 00:04:00,669
thing that they're doing and so where

00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:05,199
does university now my company where do

00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:06,609
we fit into this ed tech thing so we we

00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,129
kind of sort of fit that's what I like

00:04:06,609 --> 00:04:11,099
to say I mean we certainly embody the

00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:13,509
combination of technology and education

00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:16,599
however we're really different from the

00:04:13,509 --> 00:04:20,440
other guys because we actually own and

00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:22,060
operate two real universities in the

00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,979
sense that you can go to one of our

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,990
schools and get a full degree program or

00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:28,790
you know get a degree

00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:31,700
engagement for us and success is

00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,860
incredibly important so Daphne Koller

00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,500
who's the i guess founder of Coursera

00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:39,170
actually came to our offices and we had

00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,790
a nice conversation with her and I asked

00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:43,280
her I said hey what is the role of

00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,980
course Sarah and keeping people engaged

00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,810
keeping your students engaged and and I

00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,250
thought her answer was really really

00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:50,810
interesting she said you know we're

00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:53,120
making that information available for

00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:54,860
people everywhere and that's that's the

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,510
point like we don't care if they

00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,980
complete the course all the way to the

00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,390
end the point is that it's out there and

00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,160
for the people that want to do it to the

00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:03,650
end they can the people that want to

00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:05,870
just access it it's available to them so

00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:08,030
for us in terms of student retention

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:11,030
which is something very important to any

00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:13,280
university keeping our students engaged

00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:14,900
and coming back and completing courses

00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,270
is absolutely critical to what we're

00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,650
doing so that's sort of a from a design

00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:24,100
standpoint that's a very big difference

00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:26,570
for university now ok but online

00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,070
university right like I'm sure you know

00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:30,200
some of you guys are familiar with these

00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:32,420
names up here online universities are

00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,060
not a brand new concept this is not some

00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:36,890
something we invented there are many

00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:39,020
working adults that pursue higher

00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,150
education online and these are some of

00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,180
the institutions they attend but our

00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:46,010
schools are even you know ok we're fine

00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:48,530
we're not the whole ed tech thing

00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:52,600
exactly but we're also not the whole

00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:55,430
online university thing exactly and so

00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,610
here are some of the reasons why we're

00:05:55,430 --> 00:06:00,560
not like them and I'm going through

00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,980
these to give you guys an understanding

00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,830
of the the cognitive sort of overload

00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,810
this presents to our users when they try

00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,970
and start to understand what exactly it

00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:13,310
is that our schools offer so to begin

00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:15,740
with our coursework is self-paced you

00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:17,600
can go as fast or as slow as you want as

00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,160
a student you know if you have something

00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,810
going on one week you don't really need

00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,010
to do anything if you don't want to you

00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:24,530
can come back the next week and work

00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:27,740
harder we don't have any financial aid

00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:30,260
or any government based loans so you pay

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,820
out of pocket to go to school the school

00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,130
is incredibly affordable we have a

00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:37,040
monthly or an annual tuition so we don't

00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:38,750
do the we don't do financial aid classes

00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,590
start every Monday

00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,150
whenever you want to go to classes

00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:44,940
really whenever what you want to begin

00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,740
schools up to you we have this thing

00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,970
called a disaggregated faculty model

00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,430
which is just essentially means the

00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,720
person grading your exam is not the same

00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,040
person that's coaching you through the

00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,260
course material and that's also not the

00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,990
same person who's kind of advising you

00:06:55,260 --> 00:07:00,240
throughout your degree process which is

00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:01,740
unique to many schools and also wear

00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,260
something that's called competency-based

00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,450
which essentially means that we are

00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:08,310
really focused on that you actually know

00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:10,470
the material not exactly how you learned

00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,820
it so if you come in already having a

00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:14,070
lot of knowledge about a subject you

00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:19,830
could theoretically test your way out of

00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:21,810
a class so for all of these reasons I

00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:24,570
kind of want to move a little bit but I

00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:26,310
afraid to this microphone um so for all

00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:30,120
those reasons and for many others that I

00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:33,300
didn't talk about we basically have

00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,610
created tons of mismatched expectations

00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,710
for our users for our students for

00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:39,270
prospective students when they come to

00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:42,360
explore our school websites and try and

00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:48,150
wrap their heads around what it is that

00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:50,100
new charter or patent offers them so

00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:54,300
this is an example of some of the quotes

00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:57,210
that in user interviews I'll oftentimes

00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,720
here with prospective students stuff

00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,590
like well when do classes start because

00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,120
University classes always start at a

00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,160
certain date right is a semester but

00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:08,730
well at new charter classes start every

00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,800
monday and they say sometimes wow this

00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:12,540
is really expensive and so we're talking

00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,090
like for a bachelor's degree like two

00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:17,370
hundred dollars a month but the idea is

00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:19,890
that if you're used to this idea this

00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,480
model of paying later where you're

00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,130
taking out loans and you're not worrying

00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,450
about it until after you graduate with

00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,310
thousands of dollars of student loan

00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:28,770
debt having to pay two hundred dollars

00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,960
right now seems like a lot of money it's

00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:32,760
a totally different model you know

00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,500
when's my final well you schedule your

00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,690
final whenever you'd like and take it at

00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,000
home in your pajamas I mean it's kind of

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:41,490
new you don't have to take in your

00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,190
pajamas but you can it's proctored via

00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:46,770
webcam but it's you know we're not going

00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,180
to judge your clothes or anything okay

00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,710
the questions like how long does the

00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,330
course last well with the

00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:52,200
competency-based stuff if you already

00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:53,820
know the majora

00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,950
the course you might be able to just

00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:57,510
test your way out of it you know how

00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,970
will they grade me the whole thing's

00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,350
online and we the person that coaching

00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:04,170
you through your course doesn't grade

00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:06,030
your stuff so these are all a lot like

00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,460
these are some of the things that we

00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:13,110
hear routinely from prospective students

00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:16,980
from new students even and as user

00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:20,880
experience people it's very much our job

00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:24,240
to kind of fix this or at least to

00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:26,970
deliberately try and help people

00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,120
understand what it is that that makes us

00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:32,430
different and how our model works and so

00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:35,520
I kind of think of design as sort of

00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:37,290
this layer between what our users want

00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:41,120
to achieve which is being successful in

00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:49,200
getting a college degree and the actual

00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:51,390
work and doing it so yeah I've i've been

00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,180
with university now for I guess about

00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:57,720
about a year and a half and it's a hard

00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,940
problem and I've seen some stuff some

00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,060
stuff that's worked Wells and stuff that

00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,590
hasn't worked well but as a user

00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:08,040
experience person it's been a really

00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:11,130
wonderful opportunity to kind of think

00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,140
about problems that do not that are not

00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:15,030
my own like I'm our team is very

00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,150
consciously designing for people that

00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:20,130
are not like ourselves and that's a very

00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:22,440
you know ux thing like don't design for

00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:26,070
yourself designed for others or rather

00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:31,620
design for your user so yeah it's it's

00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:33,810
been a very 78 adventure ok so these are

00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,480
the three things I want to talk about as

00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:38,910
kind of items that I've learned sort of

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,310
time and time again from from working it

00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:43,920
at you now and doing user experience

00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,540
work so we're going to drill into each

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,280
of these the first one is just about the

00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:49,680
importance of talking with people even

00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,440
when they're not considered your target

00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,060
customer or your target user the second

00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,040
one is sort of stressing the importance

00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,770
of quantitative analytics and

00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:03,450
quantitative usability results and the

00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:05,010
last one is about the word customer and

00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,680
the word user and why they're really

00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:08,870
kind of this

00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:14,480
yet they have different homes and side

00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:16,670
organizations which is weird okay so

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,550
talking to people this is the first

00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:22,910
website that our school new charter

00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:25,399
launched with it launched right after I

00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:27,529
joined the organization and one of the

00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:29,029
things I was scratching my head over was

00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:31,009
like have we shown this to people before

00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:32,420
we just gone off and making this website

00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:34,730
I mean it looks nice and everything but

00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,259
have we shown it to anyone and no we

00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:39,500
hadn't really shown it to many people

00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:40,639
okay so I was scrambling I'm like oh my

00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,380
god we got to show this to as many

00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:44,329
people as we can like right before

00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,220
launch like I think I was there maybe a

00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:48,440
week before it's supposed to launch and

00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:50,269
so I just went around talking to as many

00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,149
people as I possibly could like the

00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:54,949
crazy gorilla you x-type stuff you know

00:11:53,149 --> 00:11:56,000
like can you give me five minutes to

00:11:54,949 --> 00:11:58,040
look at this please what do you think

00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,730
this is like that kind of stuff and a

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,560
lot of the feedback I got was like uh I

00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,779
don't know what is this like and I'm

00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:09,079
talking about asking questions like what

00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:11,480
kind of a website is this what can you

00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:14,060
do here you know like how would you

00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:17,240
proceed if you wanted to find out more

00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:19,399
very basic vague questions just to try

00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:22,069
and pick apart what is it that people

00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:25,250
are getting from from here and what I

00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:27,529
found is that people were like no idea

00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,839
oftentimes it like the initial thing was

00:12:27,529 --> 00:12:33,079
that this is not a school it's a bank or

00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,790
financial services thing when people

00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:36,470
finally got it was a school it was very

00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,939
quickly dismissed oh this is some

00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:39,139
University of Phoenix type school

00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:42,170
they're going to take my money but I was

00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:43,699
it go okay very not the right

00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:46,370
impressions we were trying to get and

00:12:43,699 --> 00:12:48,050
when I brought this back to my team at

00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:51,170
that time the feedback was kind of like

00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:56,000
well these aren't our target users these

00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:57,740
are not our real customers and really we

00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,410
went we ended up going down this path of

00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:02,899
weeks and weeks and weeks before it was

00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:05,120
sort of formally acknowledged yeah we're

00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:07,490
doing something really different and we

00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,889
need to take our time to better explain

00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:14,120
what it is that that makes us as a

00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:15,980
school unique and really I guess I'm

00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,600
using this as an example because yeah

00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:18,920
like there are some things that of

00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,540
course are very specific

00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,490
pic to the to the customer that you're

00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:25,910
trying to sell to but there's some

00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:28,399
general kind of do people understand

00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:30,829
what we're trying to do that you should

00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,750
feel confident going out and getting

00:13:30,829 --> 00:13:36,500
some feedback on and bringing it back to

00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:38,810
your team because you know even if

00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,459
you're not the youth like even if this

00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:43,310
person you're talking to is not your

00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:46,010
exact user you should be able to at

00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:48,980
least get across some very broad things

00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:52,519
to them so that's one point about you

00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:54,199
know not feeling married to talking only

00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:56,089
to target users because as a start-up

00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:59,180
target users or can be very hard to find

00:13:56,089 --> 00:14:02,990
and very costly as well to recruit and

00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:05,570
schedule and stuff for interviews so

00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:08,980
another thing about not always having

00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:12,829
access or working with target customers

00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:14,709
it's the idea of kind of using the 10

00:14:12,829 --> 00:14:17,540
usability heuristics that Jakob Nielsen

00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:20,300
wrote about a while ago Jakob Nielsen is

00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,769
a god of usability with the Nielsen

00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,410
Norman group they do conferences and

00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:27,589
write books and stuff very insightful

00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:29,000
findings and articles and so there's

00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:31,220
this is linked to at the end of my

00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,500
presentation but the idea of the

00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:37,640
heuristics are that basically this is

00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:40,130
like a list of 10 things that in most

00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:44,149
all cases make for a better user

00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:45,709
experience we're talking about these

00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:47,449
kind of things like oh do people know

00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:48,890
where they're at do they know how to go

00:14:47,449 --> 00:14:50,930
back to where they came from do they

00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,880
understand what is currently happening

00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,310
what happening in the interim of them

00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:57,620
doing in action and so performing

00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,850
usability studies task-based usability

00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,410
studies where you're just sitting with

00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,829
someone and asking them to do a thing

00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:05,690
and observing them it will very clearly

00:15:03,829 --> 00:15:08,839
give you feedback about these kind of

00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,819
just interface level interactions and

00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:13,220
you can almost consider this as sort of

00:15:10,819 --> 00:15:16,190
objectively does the design we've

00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:19,970
created allow our user allow a user to

00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:22,220
meet their goal so just in this

00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:24,319
discussion of well we can always find

00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:27,199
like the 33 year old single mother

00:15:24,319 --> 00:15:30,350
working two jobs you know well okay fine

00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:32,449
but this super tech savvy web developer

00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:35,509
couldn't even find our tuition beige

00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:37,970
so it's like you know those types of

00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:42,040
things getting that type of data can be

00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,040
very useful to broaden your discussion

00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,379
okay so this is a piece of raw meat and

00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:49,999
a bunch of different numbers and I put

00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:52,309
them next to each other because I think

00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:54,649
that numbers by themselves are really

00:15:52,309 --> 00:15:58,100
cold and don't aren't like not really

00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:59,600
that appetizing I mean beef tartare

00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,179
likes a chart or whatever it's pretty

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:03,889
good not gonna lie but I mean just like

00:16:02,179 --> 00:16:06,259
by themselves without any contact

00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:09,559
without any story that any appeal to pay

00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:13,339
this you know numbers kind of fall short

00:16:09,559 --> 00:16:16,720
kind of lame but like I'm going back and

00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:21,379
forth here um numbers don't usually lie

00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:23,419
you can tell data points in a way that

00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:26,839
sort of construes them towards a certain

00:16:23,419 --> 00:16:29,509
point of view but I think one thing I've

00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:31,489
really seen is that I do a lot of

00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:33,439
qualitative usability testing like I

00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:35,749
talked to people I listen I right quotes

00:16:33,439 --> 00:16:37,699
down I get really nice quotes that I put

00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:39,859
on slides and in presentations and it's

00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:41,359
like wow people say oh my god that's a

00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:44,209
really great quote it really summarizes

00:16:41,359 --> 00:16:48,489
what our users are feeling yeah but

00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:50,929
having numbers to sort of backup what

00:16:48,489 --> 00:16:53,119
percentage of users feel that or what

00:16:50,929 --> 00:16:55,910
percentage of users took an action can

00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:57,529
be really helpful in distributing the

00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,850
results of the usability work that you

00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:01,639
do throughout the rest of your

00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:04,130
organization these are three tools that

00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:06,889
we use at different points at university

00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:10,309
now optimizely for a/b testing Mixpanel

00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:12,589
for sort of I guess granule granularly

00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:14,659
measuring actions that users are taking

00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:17,269
on pages as well as google analytics of

00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:20,449
course and now I think it's unreasonable

00:17:17,269 --> 00:17:22,549
to say well all usability you know

00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:24,889
people and researchers and designers

00:17:22,549 --> 00:17:27,049
should understand analytics and go out

00:17:24,889 --> 00:17:29,330
and be measuring stuff that way I mean

00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:31,309
you can't do everything right but at the

00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:33,230
same time if you can align yourself with

00:17:31,309 --> 00:17:35,480
someone in your organization that has

00:17:33,230 --> 00:17:37,789
data and cares about data and knows how

00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,919
to work with it it'll make what you're

00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:42,320
doing all the more powerful and allow it

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,960
to kind of seep into two people that may

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,220
not be interested in fluff which

00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,580
unfortunately is some time

00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:51,500
how qualitative feedback is looked at so

00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,919
it's not rocket science but I just think

00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:57,350
as a user experience like as a community

00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:59,570
it would be helpful I think for all of

00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:01,309
us to take some responsibility for

00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:06,710
actually working with with people that

00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:09,020
work with data okay here's the the last

00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:11,659
point in the thing I've learned section

00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:14,210
which is that I and I believe this very

00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:16,820
strongly that your customer is your user

00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:18,080
there are many different depending on

00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,940
how big your organization is but

00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,730
oftentimes there's different parts of an

00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:24,830
organization that touch a customer or a

00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,539
user at different points in the life

00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,940
cycle of their involvement with your

00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:31,340
organization for us this is something

00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,200
like the person that's chatting with

00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,059
them on the website the person that

00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,640
answers the phone and the enrollment

00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:39,919
center if they call in the person that

00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:42,169
is responding to their technical issue

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,570
all the way to their student advisor

00:18:42,169 --> 00:18:47,870
their instructor these are people that

00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:50,059
do different jobs but all touch you know

00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:52,340
our students and then you even have me

00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:53,270
who is sitting there in the room you

00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,140
know in the office in San Francisco

00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:58,669
calling you up in New York new meaning

00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:01,039
or student and having a conversation

00:18:58,669 --> 00:19:03,350
with you and I'm learning things about

00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:07,100
you but so is everyone else along the

00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:10,340
entire you know chain there and at least

00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:12,559
in my experience I have seen that when

00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:14,990
these groups of people do not

00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:17,809
communicate properly or at least as

00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:20,750
frequently as they should very different

00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:23,960
kind of ideas and expectations of our of

00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:26,360
our students are formed pretty readily

00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,520
and it creates a lot of problems because

00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:30,559
it turns out that the marketing team is

00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:34,700
actually they actually have their own

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:36,380
set of personas then the UX team and

00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:38,419
they're not the same people at all and

00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,159
number like so we're sellin of these

00:19:38,419 --> 00:19:44,929
people but we're designing for these

00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:46,940
people and it just doesn't make sense so

00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:48,980
this is a this whole thing is a quote

00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,169
from from an article that also is sited

00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:54,890
at the end from this website 52 weeks of

00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:57,250
UX and I love this idea that user

00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,990
experience is really just good marketing

00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:01,940
it's about knowing who your market is

00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:04,550
knowing what is important to them

00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:09,080
knowing why it's important to them and

00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:10,790
designing accordingly so I started off

00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,880
at you now as a user experience designer

00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:15,890
and I was working pretty exclusively

00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,500
inside our actual learning management

00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:21,230
system the actual course platform that

00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:23,510
that students interact with as it became

00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:25,370
more and more obvious to me through the

00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:27,980
usability research I was doing with our

00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:29,870
actual school websites that we just were

00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,580
not explaining ourselves properly I

00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:34,040
started getting more and more involved

00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:37,970
with that world and so at this point

00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:40,520
like on the lead of our UX team but i'm

00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:42,980
doing a crapload of marketing i'm doing

00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,690
a lot of like how do we display

00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:46,790
something on a website that helps people

00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:49,220
understand how online courses work it's

00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:52,040
a totally different like departmental

00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,860
type world but at the same time it is so

00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:57,260
fundamentally a part of the role of a

00:20:54,860 --> 00:21:00,800
user experience designer of an

00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:03,140
information architect helping you know

00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:06,770
your customers understand what you're

00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:09,710
all about so if you guys have any

00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:15,260
marketing related people oh wait that's

00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:16,850
next slide right so you know if you have

00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:18,590
any marketing related people that you

00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:20,059
work with or in general people that are

00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:22,550
out like a sales team interfacing with

00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:24,410
customers go out and talk to them say hi

00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:26,540
to them maybe work with them maybe just

00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:30,800
sit in with them on lunch or something

00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:33,350
like that and I and I think that type of

00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,510
collaboration is really what allows

00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:37,760
companies to have a more holistic vision

00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,679
of who their users are and better design

00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,350
and market to them all at the same time

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,420
and another argument taking this even

00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:46,220
one step further would be to say that

00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:48,200
this is like my google hat now would be

00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,900
saying that SEO like search engine

00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:53,750
optimization is also really just about

00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:56,210
good user experience and about creating

00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:58,340
semantically appropriate metadata rich

00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:02,960
web sites and I and I really do think

00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:07,190
that's true so broaden the if I may even

00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:12,679
further diluting what UX is right okay

00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:13,880
so any questions on that stuff so far we

00:22:12,679 --> 00:22:17,180
can we can like do that

00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:21,640
at the end too but just what is the

00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:24,920
thing with just me personally you know

00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:28,940
that's a good question I just love cats

00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:30,800
I love every kind of cat yeah I do I was

00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:33,170
semi quoting a YouTube video right now

00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:36,470
but I don't know if anyone else the

00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:37,850
eharmony one but ya know i just i have i

00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:39,290
have four cats in New York I'm in

00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:42,140
California now I don't have them with me

00:22:39,290 --> 00:22:56,360
anymore so it's like a sad my parents

00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:59,240
have them yeah yeah that's a great

00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:01,850
question so the question was about if we

00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:05,870
do any user testing with faculty in

00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:09,590
addition to students so unfortunately we

00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:10,850
do not do enough I think it's very known

00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,860
that the faculty have their own

00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:15,890
experience instead of tools that they

00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:18,170
use and they are not as well sort of

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:20,480
maintained as the student facing ones

00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:23,240
but it's a very you know that's like a

00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,100
very good thing to highlight that you

00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:27,080
know your user is not necessarily just

00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:29,870
your student what we do do is talk to

00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,000
students as well as prospective students

00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,770
people that have kind of considered our

00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,390
schooler in that decision process so

00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:42,050
yeah okay so let's go on to the small

00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:45,440
bag of tricks section I love today at

00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:47,330
the keynote mental models right that was

00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,620
like wow she's totally saying exactly

00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,920
what I wanted to talk about today so

00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,000
thank you Karen that was awesome um yes

00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,900
we're gonna talk about that a little bit

00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,080
also paper prototyping and last but not

00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,580
least creating a continuous feedback

00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:07,490
mechanism which kind of gets into how we

00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:11,240
actually talk to people so here's Jakob

00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:13,430
Nielsen again same picture and this is

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:17,090
his kind of definition of what a mental

00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:18,950
model is and you know this morning was

00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:21,440
was great like I said that it was talked

00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:24,200
about and it's really important here to

00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,630
think about a mental model not as how

00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,680
someone not as how a thing actually

00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,590
works but real

00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:32,750
as how someone imagines it to work and

00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:34,700
the fact of how it actually works is

00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:37,100
kind of irrelevant right like it really

00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,440
only matters what how this user

00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:41,090
experiences the thing to work what they

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,760
think happens when they will do an

00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:44,780
action or when they do in action so okay

00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,970
we're going to talk about why this is

00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:52,010
important so this is a screenshot of a

00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:54,830
course dashboard inside one of our

00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:57,410
courses a lot going on there so I'm

00:24:54,830 --> 00:25:01,360
going to zoom into a portion of the

00:24:57,410 --> 00:25:01,360
dashboard called the readiness meter

00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:07,820
okay that's this right here there's

00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,890
there's multiple readiness meters

00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:11,930
actually um so the idea the original

00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:14,060
idea of the readiness meter was that it

00:25:11,930 --> 00:25:17,060
would be a way for students to be aware

00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:20,000
of how far they've come in a course and

00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:22,040
sort of help them understand how much

00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,110
longer they have to go before being able

00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,880
to schedule their final because at our

00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:27,320
schools you actually schedule your final

00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,880
exam what you know when you're sort of

00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,160
ready when you when you hit a threshold

00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,530
so the readiness meter was both a

00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:36,170
measure of progress like how much you

00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:37,910
have actually done in terms of how many

00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:39,920
practice quizzes have you taken have you

00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:43,450
taken your initial assessment like those

00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:46,310
types of things but also a predictor a

00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:50,270
predictor of how far you have to go that

00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:52,640
was the original intent so in some of

00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:55,160
the original interviews I was doing with

00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:57,290
with our first set of new students

00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,630
feedback was overwhelmingly positive

00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:01,430
it's like oh my god I like watching the

00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:04,040
green bar go up the green bar it's so

00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:06,350
great I you know I always lets me know

00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:09,740
where I am I like watching my progress

00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:12,500
helps me feel like I'm getting ahead and

00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:15,890
so this was great feedback right um I

00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,750
didn't really ever ask what is the

00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:21,410
readiness meter like what is it telling

00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:23,180
you is just this is my error kind of

00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:25,280
just asking what people thought about it

00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,900
what you know how they experienced it

00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,220
what was their favorite part of the of

00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:32,660
the platform and this is something that

00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:35,310
would frequently come up a couple months

00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:38,620
later it was like

00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:39,940
readiness meter like people students

00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:43,890
were really not happy with the readiness

00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:46,270
meter they were really pretty pissed off

00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:47,800
these were some of the the pissed off

00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:50,410
quotes they weren't necessarily all in

00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:52,150
caps I'm kind of just playing it up but

00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:53,860
it was like oh it doesn't get brainer I

00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:56,380
just i'm looking at i'm reading things

00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:58,150
and it doesn't get greener all right I

00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:01,720
go to Internet Explorer and it's here

00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:04,120
and I go in chrome and it's there I've

00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,190
just I've given up we've had students

00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:08,790
like on the verge of leaving the

00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:11,620
University over the readiness meter and

00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:14,320
student it just it makes no sense okay

00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:16,240
like when I when I read 20 pages it goes

00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,330
nowhere and I take one quiz it goes up

00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,040
there so just like total infuriation and

00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:23,140
I really sympathize with them because

00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,420
being an online student if anyone has

00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:27,940
taken any online courses it is really

00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:31,450
really hard it is very difficult work

00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:33,520
and if you are trying to trust in this

00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:35,080
little metric idea of like oh I have a

00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,420
readiness meter and it doesn't do things

00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:42,190
when you're putting in all that work

00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:44,460
imagine what that feels like so really

00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:48,070
what it came down to is that our

00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:50,740
students didn't didn't really know at

00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:52,810
all how the readiness meter worked they

00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,700
just sometimes it went green and in the

00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:57,220
beginning it would go green more

00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:59,260
frequently and we had this formula

00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,720
around it where you know based on the

00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:03,640
activities you did and how will you did

00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,830
on them the thing would go up and it was

00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,420
over all the logic on it like the idea

00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:09,400
was good but the logic wasn't well

00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:11,590
implemented and so our students thought

00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:14,650
that well every time I do in action the

00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:16,720
thing will go up but in reality every

00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:18,430
time you read something it you never got

00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,410
any readiness like if you read 20 pages

00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:22,420
and spent four hours your readiness just

00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:24,850
wouldn't go up like it just wasn't built

00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:26,440
that way and we did also have browser

00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:29,320
compatibility issues that was the whole

00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,930
browser thing but it was this idea like

00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,850
I could trust in this signal to tell me

00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:35,980
where I am in my course how far I am

00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:37,450
away from graduating we actually the

00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:39,400
readiness meter was bubbled all the way

00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:41,650
up to how far you have to go in your

00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:44,830
degree program so it became this core

00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:47,680
metric that users had placed trust in

00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,900
and just didn't deliver because it you

00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,790
know

00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:52,130
it wasn't just about progress it was

00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:54,140
about different ratios of health how

00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:57,170
will they had done on things and really

00:28:54,140 --> 00:29:00,340
a measurement of more assessments rather

00:28:57,170 --> 00:29:02,840
than readiness so this is also from

00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:04,460
Nielsen's article about well okay what

00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,740
do you do when you become aware of

00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:10,340
mental models how do you fix problems

00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:12,590
related to them one option is to make

00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:15,980
the system conform which basically means

00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:18,590
okay if users think that when they do

00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:20,960
actions the thing will go up we change

00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:24,170
it so it does that we meet what their

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,940
expectations are the other option here

00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:30,710
and what Nielsen would say is improve

00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:33,050
users mental models I don't know if

00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:34,400
improve is the right word but I think or

00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:35,660
maybe just taken out of context it

00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:38,150
sounds weird but really what he's

00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:40,700
getting at here is the idea of educating

00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:42,170
users and showing them how your

00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,700
interface is supposed to work and kind

00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:46,580
of giving them contextual clues along

00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:49,490
the way of this is you know how the

00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:51,740
feature works so these are generally the

00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:57,580
two kind of paths forward when you have

00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:59,720
a mismatched mental model situation so

00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,720
what a number of my colleagues are

00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:05,420
working on right now is completely

00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:07,100
changing how readiness works and my

00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:09,110
current understanding of how that's

00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:10,790
going to happen is that we're kind of

00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:12,860
doing away with readiness because the

00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:14,990
concept just falls short of what users

00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:17,060
expect they expect that when they do a

00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:19,400
thing it goes green and they can feel

00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,600
good about it so we're really kind of

00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,840
moving towards a model that's about

00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:25,370
progress about track your progress not

00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,540
your readiness we're not going to tell

00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:29,270
you your readiness going to tell you how

00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:30,680
far you've come we might also break that

00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:32,420
out have already pneus be a separate

00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,400
metric but really that bar is going to

00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:36,140
become about progress we're kind of

00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,090
meeting users where where they're at

00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:40,250
were there thinking about it at the same

00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:42,830
time this is something that has been

00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:44,390
added to the platform where we've got

00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:46,160
this nice little hover tooltip when you

00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:48,830
hover over the readiness meter it

00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,080
actually tells you this is how that

00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:53,000
thing fills up so this is kind of the

00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:55,040
idea of contextual e helping users along

00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,220
the way to understand how your model

00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,220
works

00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:04,510
okay so now I'm going to talk a little

00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:07,730
bit about paper prototyping which is a

00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:13,250
really nice way of getting feedback from

00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:14,840
users in person so the idea is you know

00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:17,060
if you're doing a traditional usability

00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,890
study task based in front of a computer

00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:21,800
you know you have someone sitting next

00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:25,220
to you and you're saying find out how

00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:26,840
much this course you know would cost you

00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,980
to take then you kind of just sit there

00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,320
and you watch them do it you basically

00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:32,240
are giving them things to do contact a

00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,790
student advisor and kind of see how they

00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,080
go about doing the task but you know on

00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:37,790
the screen you need definitely designed

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,340
or at least you need to have something

00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:42,080
on the screen with paper prototyping

00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:44,120
it's great because you can essentially

00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,710
just draw what pen and paper or you can

00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,990
make something up in fireworks whatever

00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:52,610
and print it out cut it up and do a

00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:56,300
usability study based off that so this

00:31:52,610 --> 00:32:00,950
is an example of this is actually inside

00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:05,090
of a PDF but so this is a God sorry this

00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:08,090
is this is an example of a mock-up that

00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:10,520
we made to illustrate an early prototype

00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:13,400
of explaining how to courses work online

00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:15,020
courses at our University and what we

00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:17,330
did was we brought in I think for people

00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:19,280
and we printed this thing out and we cut

00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:20,990
up all the little boxes and it was

00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:23,420
basically this large container element

00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:25,100
with no with empty and we gave them the

00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:27,020
put the puzzle pieces we were like how

00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,880
do you think this would fit in here like

00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,110
how does this make sense to you and we

00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,340
just kind of watch them arrange it

00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:34,340
sometimes they didn't even arrange it

00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:36,710
linearly what is this called vertical

00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:37,790
they arranged it like horizontally or

00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:40,940
diagonally all these different

00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:44,270
directions and it was kind of this very

00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:46,490
fluid way of getting inside of the users

00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:49,130
head and it was paper and the actual

00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:52,190
tangible miss of it that allowed us to

00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:54,590
do that we also were able to iterate

00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:56,600
really quickly because of that we found

00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:58,490
out this page is only half of what the

00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,530
original design was we realized very

00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:02,900
quickly this is like information

00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:04,940
overload we can't we cannot put this all

00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:07,130
in one page so we ended up just cutting

00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:08,810
the page in half and kind of splitting

00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:11,960
up the usability study for the following

00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:14,590
users which ended up being really

00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:18,260
successful for us

00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:21,010
so why does paper prototyping rock well

00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:23,480
because it's really fast and it's cheap

00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:25,130
you can make changes on the fly like I

00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,470
said and granted that was like that was

00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:29,330
a legit mock-up done in fireworks but

00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:32,120
you could do this with pen and paper as

00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:33,590
well and the other nice thing about it

00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,850
is not involving any development

00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:40,220
resources so I did a presentation at the

00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:41,630
Bay Area drupalcamp in 2012 about

00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,700
prototyping and I'll link to that at the

00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:45,440
end of this slide because I also talked

00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:47,120
about click through prototypes in HTML

00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,740
there's many cool ways of getting

00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,660
feedback but I think paper prototyping

00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:55,220
is is really great because pretty much

00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:57,410
anyone can can do it the other thing

00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,810
about paper prototyping is that what it

00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:03,730
allows you to do is get a larger group

00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:06,530
of people inside of a room witnessing

00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:09,170
usability you know in practice and

00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:12,710
actually kind of being a part of that at

00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:15,020
an early level oftentimes sort of the

00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:19,010
key stakeholder person will not get

00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:20,480
involved in you know a project inside of

00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,400
it from the usability standpoint until

00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,890
the end and then they're like well you

00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:26,660
know we actually this feature you know

00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:28,940
it doesn't make business sense for us to

00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:30,950
build it so we can't even you know have

00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:33,110
it in the place you're thinking of so

00:34:30,950 --> 00:34:35,780
what paper prototyping does is it since

00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:37,460
it feels so low fidelity since it feels

00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,350
so generative and like we're all working

00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,870
together kind of thing it encourages

00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:44,180
people to kind of come in and speak up

00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:47,210
and be there at the early part of the

00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:49,430
process and so I find it to be a very

00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:51,650
successful method for introducing non

00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:54,140
usability people to the world of

00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:59,690
usability and to how fast an iterative

00:34:54,140 --> 00:35:01,400
it can be okay so the last point I want

00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:04,880
to talk about here is continuous

00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:07,700
engagement and how to kind of foster

00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:11,240
that inside your organization so for us

00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:13,100
as a school it's sort of just you know

00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:16,660
like I was saying in the beginning we

00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:18,740
have students who are invested in our

00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:22,070
schools because they are trying to get a

00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:24,290
full degree from us but when I first

00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:26,330
started working at university now that

00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:27,530
didn't I didn't really get that I kind

00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:29,930
of felt the entire time

00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:32,270
I'm like well why would they want to

00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:33,590
talk to me if I'm gonna just say hey

00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:35,210
I'll give you twenty bucks if you talk

00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:38,120
to me for 30 minutes like why would they

00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:40,730
be invested in doing that but if you're

00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,130
solving a problem for someone with

00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:44,600
whatever it is you're building a website

00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:45,950
product you know an app like what

00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:49,040
whatever it is if you were solving

00:35:45,950 --> 00:35:50,660
something I'm pretty sure you know you

00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:53,270
will have some users that will

00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:55,460
intrinsically be motivated to make that

00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:57,710
product better if you're solving

00:35:55,460 --> 00:36:00,170
something people want to help you solve

00:35:57,710 --> 00:36:02,420
it because it's a real problem and I was

00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:05,330
very heartened to see that there are

00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:08,360
tons of students that we have that want

00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:09,980
to go out of their way to help us can

00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:14,510
continue to make the experience that

00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:16,640
they have better so this is an example

00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:19,580
email that I received from Coursera

00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,960
actually yesterday maybe if anyone else

00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:23,120
is a part of Coursera you probably also

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,910
got this email so I'm like making this

00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:28,790
presentation and like oh look at that so

00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:32,740
this is just an example of how Coursera

00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:36,350
is trying to reach out to its super huge

00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:38,870
student base and kind of asked like hey

00:36:36,350 --> 00:36:43,730
you know tell us what you're thinking

00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:46,220
kind of thing so on our scale this is an

00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:49,850
example email that I would used to be

00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:51,650
sending out pretty frequently to a group

00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:54,080
of students who at one point or another

00:36:51,650 --> 00:36:56,090
had sort of opted in to the idea of

00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,710
being contacted it was this very vague

00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:58,940
thing that kind of popped up on the

00:36:57,710 --> 00:37:00,320
bottom and said hey would you be

00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,630
interested in talking about your new

00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,790
charter experience yes or no so they'd

00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:06,170
say anyone that said yes I would hear

00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:08,680
about it and I'd send them this really

00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:13,340
kind of simple somewhat personal email

00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:14,780
like hey first name like but I'd love to

00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:16,960
talk with you about how your experience

00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:20,030
is going would you be interested

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,790
compensating i highly recommend people

00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:26,480
have lots of things going on and time is

00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:28,130
valuable so depending on how long you're

00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,360
asking to speak with them you know

00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:33,530
amount make sense but yeah there's

00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,210
actually a sentence in there which is

00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:36,920
sounds kind of stupid it says in like

00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:38,330
you're not dreaming or something often

00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,160
times when I would send these emails out

00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,880
the response I got was like is this real

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,440
this

00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:44,119
really the school contacting me and you

00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,369
really want to talk with me and hear

00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:49,190
what I'm saying I find that people

00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:51,470
oftentimes they're really kind of happy

00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:53,569
to be given a place to air their

00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:56,710
feedback and talk with you about it so

00:37:53,569 --> 00:37:59,329
doing small things like this to kind of

00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:04,150
Tata get engage with your users

00:37:59,329 --> 00:38:07,460
oftentimes can can be successful for you

00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:10,549
so this is another example of a way that

00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:13,609
at our school we try and solicit

00:38:10,549 --> 00:38:17,240
feedback from our students this is a

00:38:13,609 --> 00:38:19,430
service called user voice which is one

00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:22,160
service among a bunch of others like

00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:24,309
zendesk that we kind of have on on our

00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,509
dashboard it says site suggestions

00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:29,509
students click on that and it's a way

00:38:26,509 --> 00:38:31,819
for them to sort of post ideas share you

00:38:29,509 --> 00:38:34,759
know other people's ideas and kind of

00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:37,660
have a discussion about it and so this

00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:40,789
is another sort of more background

00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:42,470
channel that we have that allows us to

00:38:40,789 --> 00:38:44,599
get feedback from users and you know

00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:49,519
user voices is just one service there's

00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:51,289
tons of others and really having sort of

00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:53,480
continuous feedback cycles where

00:38:51,289 --> 00:38:55,369
sometimes we're hitting people before

00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:57,680
they enroll right when they enroll a

00:38:55,369 --> 00:38:59,359
little bit down the line after their

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,539
first semester and kind of keeping tabs

00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:04,460
on that it helps to you know give you a

00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:07,309
better perspective in side into the life

00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,960
cycle of you know your users and also

00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:18,109
just make them feel more invested

00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:20,390
another question yeah let me see zooming

00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:22,670
in with my eyes to the screenshot and

00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:25,099
yeah you can see it says like 47 votes

00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:26,480
number of comments so that's actually a

00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:28,039
really nice thing about it because it

00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:30,230
makes it gives students an opportunity

00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:32,960
to kind of vote on things within

00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:36,140
themselves and comment so we do have

00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,369
that as well and oftentimes really maybe

00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,589
not in use your voice I think it might

00:39:37,369 --> 00:39:42,380
be more in Zendesk which is sort of a

00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:44,630
support network we have students

00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:47,000
complain about certain things and get

00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:49,220
upset and it's kind of like we let the

00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,049
community see that and kind of pick it

00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:55,060
apart ourselves and with them so it's

00:39:51,049 --> 00:40:00,740
good to have open feedback we found

00:39:55,060 --> 00:40:02,870
so yeah in summary these are the things

00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:07,340
that we talked about or I guess I talked

00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:09,470
about just the importance of showing

00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:12,170
your stuff to people even if it's not

00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:15,320
your target user and really actually

00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:16,880
doing that and getting feedback working

00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,890
with analytics even if it's not you

00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,690
yourself finding people in your

00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:22,250
organization who work with analytics and

00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:23,870
figuring out a way to get them involved

00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:27,920
in your work or you get more involved in

00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:29,960
their work customers or users the idea

00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,340
of you know talking with people all

00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,980
throughout your organization that are

00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:36,680
talking with with your customers and

00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:39,110
being all in sync and then the three

00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,670
methods mental models really trying to

00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:42,350
understand how do people approach your

00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:45,020
your system and how can you work for

00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:49,820
that or round it prototyping on paper

00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:52,550
and lastly you know setting up

00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:56,860
continuous mechanisms for feedback so

00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:56,860
yeah that's all I've got any questions

00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:07,130
sure so for face-to-face usability

00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:08,840
studies I so I live in San Francisco and

00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,970
if anyone here is heard of a service

00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:13,670
called TaskRabbit it's a really great

00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:15,950
way I don't know I believe they're in

00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:18,460
most metropolitan areas but it's a

00:41:15,950 --> 00:41:21,220
really great way to sort of post a chore

00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:24,350
and have people go out and bid for it

00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:26,300
like normally it's like I'll pay you

00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:28,760
money to get my groceries or to pick up

00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:31,730
something from the store so what I do is

00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:33,410
I'm like hey you come to downtown San

00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:36,260
Francisco for a usability study and

00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:37,250
people bid on how much they'd be willing

00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,170
to do that for and I actually

00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:40,610
pre-screened them with a with a survey

00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:42,560
and I'm like to be eligible please fill

00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:44,390
out this five question thing so I have

00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,360
some general background of where they're

00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:51,320
coming from craigslist at least in San

00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:52,790
Francisco works really great also well

00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,760
for universities I used to go to

00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:59,330
university campuses and literally put up

00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:01,250
flyers said hey like come call this

00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:05,900
number if you want to make fifty dollars

00:42:01,250 --> 00:42:08,030
and talk to me and also another service

00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:10,310
i use is called user testing calm that's

00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:12,680
remote usability studies but those

00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:15,110
craigslist just in person ads and

00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:22,220
taskrabbit are the three main ways i've

00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:25,790
gotten people so pretty minimally at

00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:28,040
least four with taskrabbit the questions

00:42:25,790 --> 00:42:31,880
I was asking for screening were highest

00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:34,970
level of education age what they're

00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:37,520
currently doing and I think like last

00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:41,780
institution attended so really kind of

00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:43,580
big blocks there with TaskRabbit you can

00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:45,050
get people you can get people that are

00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:47,270
just kind of maybe not what you're

00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:48,920
looking for for very cheap prices or you

00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:50,960
can get maybe someone you are looking

00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:58,970
for for much more expensive so it really

00:42:50,960 --> 00:43:00,320
depends on the project i think so i'm

00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:02,630
just using us because it's easier ya

00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:05,030
know it's that's the smart thing yeah ok

00:43:02,630 --> 00:43:08,120
i'm curious to know a little bit more

00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:10,820
about the marketing personas and the ux

00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:14,390
personas we're kind of in the same

00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:15,710
situation and so yeah maybe you want to

00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:17,000
i'd be interested to learn a little bit

00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:18,860
more about that and maybe what the

00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,100
difference is between market research

00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:23,870
and UX research yeah ok that's a great

00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:25,820
question I guess everyone could hear it

00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:29,450
because i was on a microphone so i won't

00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:31,220
repeat it so in my experience at

00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:37,940
university now what ended up happening

00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:40,730
was that we we were putting out ads on

00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:45,620
Google like Google search ads with words

00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:47,630
like you know I almost almost that felt

00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:49,430
cheap that felt like we were selling

00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:51,020
this idea of being cheap and then we

00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:53,030
were talking to users who would never

00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:55,310
use the word cheap would never use the

00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:57,830
word like inexpensive they were using

00:43:55,310 --> 00:43:59,720
affordable are they were using like well

00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:03,020
priced or stuff stuff something that

00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:04,100
just felt better and kind of then like

00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,590
looking at the ads and hearing what

00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:10,460
people were saying sort of what woke us

00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:12,890
up to this like huge disparity in

00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:14,720
between just at a language level how we

00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:18,020
are talking about ourselves and to other

00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:21,260
people the marketing world at least in

00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:23,960
the Internet can be very run by

00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:25,670
tengen stuff like how do we best use

00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:27,890
words in a way that search engines will

00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:31,130
pick up our pages and all this type of

00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:34,100
stuff which is not people speak so for

00:44:31,130 --> 00:44:38,000
us at least that was a very big like how

00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:42,200
are we going to get around this we ended

00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:44,870
up you know really kind of I guess using

00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:47,090
usability studies as a way to put some

00:44:44,870 --> 00:44:48,260
more color to what you know the

00:44:47,090 --> 00:44:49,550
marketing team was working on where I

00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,710
was like well you know that these

00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:53,390
keywords will do well but this is what

00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:55,430
our customers actually say and it was

00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:58,850
just a lot of conversations over and

00:44:55,430 --> 00:45:00,470
over again honestly at this point we

00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:05,420
don't really have a dedicated marketing

00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:09,200
team it is the UX team that handles that

00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:10,850
handles marketing I think that as these

00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,830
are experienced people it's really our

00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:15,590
role to facilitate these discussions

00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:18,950
coming from like marketing like I think

00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:23,120
market research oftentimes can be more

00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:25,070
about from a larger scale like how an

00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:28,910
industry is doing like water people

00:45:25,070 --> 00:45:31,070
buying and not as granular about how

00:45:28,910 --> 00:45:33,830
this individual product that you're

00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:36,590
doing will be received by people so kind

00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:38,150
of countering this kind of the industry

00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:41,660
says with them this is what our

00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:43,970
customers say can be useful but yeah

00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:45,920
it's it's a tough line and I just really

00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:48,080
think that communication is the absolute

00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:51,200
communication and collaboration is the

00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:53,180
key and if as the UX person to come in

00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,860
and be like I really value what you do

00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:56,960
and I want to work with you so we can

00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:58,520
like find those people together the

00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,050
other thing now that I'm thinking of it

00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,460
was that I think the marketing team at

00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:03,260
this point was trying to sell to someone

00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:05,030
who wasn't really the user that was

00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:07,160
going to be successful at our school if

00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:09,200
you are a student that's looking for the

00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,970
cheap fastest way to your degree like

00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,890
our schools are kind of hard like you're

00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:15,200
not gonna that's not going to be the

00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:16,880
answer for you so making sure from a

00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:19,700
business perspective everyone's aligned

00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:22,070
on what they're trying to do it's hard

00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:23,720
but I think being a facilitator and

00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:25,730
getting people in the room to talk about

00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:29,270
these things is kind of how you have to

00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:33,200
start and that article that I it's in

00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:34,910
the end of this L me home that's the

00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,559
that's the bitly link to the slides

00:46:34,910 --> 00:46:38,960
and I'll put some more resources at the

00:46:36,559 --> 00:46:44,380
end of it too but uh that article i

00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:44,380
mentioned i check that one out sure

00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:51,619
pushback from developers on UX

00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:53,390
recommendations for sure and it's

00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:55,730
someone that also does a lot of

00:46:53,390 --> 00:47:00,170
front-end development implementation

00:46:55,730 --> 00:47:02,510
time and cost and tearing hair out pneus

00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:06,349
is certainly something that needs to be

00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:07,339
grappled with I think oftentimes i'm

00:47:06,349 --> 00:47:10,099
trying to think there was a specific

00:47:07,339 --> 00:47:12,470
example once where we were doing a

00:47:10,099 --> 00:47:15,109
coursed or for inside of our courses and

00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:17,240
the desired functionality was that there

00:47:15,109 --> 00:47:18,890
was an X button to it's like a modal

00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:22,430
window like let's have an X to get rid

00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:24,650
of it or you can click outside or you

00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:26,329
can hit escape and the developer was

00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:28,520
essentially saying having the X button

00:47:26,329 --> 00:47:30,349
will be really complicated and there are

00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,940
already two ways for them to to get rid

00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:34,250
of it they can click anywhere or they

00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:37,760
can hit escape and so the conversation

00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:39,319
just came about like well okay what if

00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,559
you don't know those two things let's

00:47:39,319 --> 00:47:43,970
think about what kind of user actually

00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:47,420
knows to hit escape or click out

00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:49,369
anywhere how would that feel to be kind

00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:53,029
of trapped inside this modal window and

00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:56,390
not be able to escape I think has the UX

00:47:53,029 --> 00:47:58,460
people appealing to at like empathy and

00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:00,650
emotions and trying to help developers

00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:03,230
who oftentimes are very receptive

00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:06,289
sometimes does not get inside the head

00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:08,900
of what users feel like is what I do

00:48:06,289 --> 00:48:10,730
also I try and invite people to all the

00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:13,460
usability studies I do whether it be in

00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:15,380
person or remotely or just publishing

00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:18,020
all usability reports in a public way

00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:19,520
for the company and trying to get people

00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,309
involved sometimes if there's a

00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:25,010
developer that's particularly kind of

00:48:21,309 --> 00:48:27,440
not responding to you x results I will

00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:30,049
invite them personally to a study and

00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,420
say hey like Sarah please come and i

00:48:30,049 --> 00:48:35,029
want you to see what what happens here

00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:36,140
just just come and observe i think

00:48:35,029 --> 00:48:37,880
getting people it's all about getting

00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:40,490
people involved getting people to feel

00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:46,779
like you're not making it up and the

00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:46,779
numbers help yeah any other questions

00:48:47,829 --> 00:48:53,839
yeah I said a question about assessment

00:48:51,019 --> 00:48:57,019
and stuff so that readiness meter is

00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:59,299
there anything that's replacing that yes

00:48:57,019 --> 00:49:01,819
so the readiness meter is still going to

00:48:59,299 --> 00:49:04,849
be a meter but it's no longer going to

00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:06,829
be the idea of helping you predict when

00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:09,049
you're ready it's going to be literally

00:49:06,829 --> 00:49:11,630
just about progress like how far have

00:49:09,049 --> 00:49:14,539
you come and do you have to justify to

00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:16,339
the users how that scores yeah alkylated

00:49:14,539 --> 00:49:18,859
yes that's a great question and I think

00:49:16,339 --> 00:49:20,569
that's something that my colleagues are

00:49:18,859 --> 00:49:23,869
trying to figure out right now we're

00:49:20,569 --> 00:49:25,490
definitely needs to be so it's my view

00:49:23,869 --> 00:49:27,710
that we definitely need to communicate

00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:31,069
that there's a change and the way the

00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:32,990
bar is being calculated and sort of that

00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:34,430
that tool tip that I that I showed is

00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:38,930
kind of one example of how we're trying

00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:41,720
to communicate that but yeah it's it's a

00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:43,369
question of how do we kind of

00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:47,210
contextualize that the thing has changed

00:49:43,369 --> 00:49:49,460
in a way that's not I guess totally in

00:49:47,210 --> 00:49:51,170
your face and makes you freak out and is

00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:53,779
that like the kind of the metrics like

00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:55,609
of how that is all determined do the

00:49:53,779 --> 00:49:58,279
teachers get input on that at all or is

00:49:55,609 --> 00:50:01,039
that pretty much like is it it's like an

00:49:58,279 --> 00:50:03,200
auto auto graded system or it is a

00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:05,299
summative or formative yeah so the

00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,460
assessment meter itself is actually just

00:50:05,299 --> 00:50:09,079
it's it's an algorithm it's really just

00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:10,609
based off how many things you have

00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:12,859
completed at this point it'll be like

00:50:10,609 --> 00:50:14,750
you've you've done your initial

00:50:12,859 --> 00:50:16,130
assessment check you've done quizzes one

00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:18,920
through four check check director check

00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:20,839
like that kind of a thing instructors

00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:23,990
and advisors here a lot of feedback from

00:50:20,839 --> 00:50:25,670
students who are having those frustrated

00:50:23,990 --> 00:50:27,680
quotes I assume you get pushback yeah

00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:29,809
they put the pushback and so that kind

00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,160
of bubbles up to us and we can you know

00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:33,759
work from it from there but it is

00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:36,650
supposed to be this objective measure of

00:50:33,759 --> 00:50:38,569
your progress which doesn't like to do

00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:41,029
with the subjective opinion of your

00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:42,920
instructor or any human and one last

00:50:41,029 --> 00:50:45,259
quick question Oh which is generally

00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,720
more of the more advanced user the

00:50:45,259 --> 00:50:50,180
students are the teachers that's a great

00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:53,990
question okay who do you think the

00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:55,700
students exactly yeah I mean we have so

00:50:53,990 --> 00:50:58,130
many students who are software

00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:59,599
developers who are people who like run

00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:00,770
the internet because these are people

00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:02,390
who are self-starters

00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:05,330
super motivated know how to manage their

00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:06,890
time and to be honest to be successful

00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:08,420
in the tech world you don't always need

00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:09,770
it you don't usually need a degree right

00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:11,900
like you can teach yourself stuff so we

00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:14,060
have a lot of students who are super

00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:15,890
tech savvy who are literally like I've

00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:18,650
had students be like this is why it's

00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:20,600
not working in IE 7 okay the box model

00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:23,690
let's get on it here like literally like

00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:25,460
people who totally know their stuff our

00:51:23,690 --> 00:51:27,800
teachers I'd say are more from

00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:29,780
traditional academia or in general from

00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,940
from online instruction models as well

00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:34,100
but are not the type of web savviness

00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:37,100
that our students are many ticket that

00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:40,160
requires a much more kind of greatly

00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:41,960
more simplified you aux experience for

00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:46,040
the teachers more so than the students

00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:47,750
well this world in a perfect world I

00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,940
mean in a perfect world teachers would

00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:51,170
feel like they wouldn't have to even

00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,550
think of the fact that they're using it

00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:54,260
interface right it would just be like a

00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:56,630
gradebook and they can just do their

00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:58,310
stuff and it's all good but yeah

00:51:56,630 --> 00:52:01,250
teachers have a lot of responsibility

00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:02,810
and I think our we have not figured we

00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:04,550
have not optimized like the question

00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:08,120
before we haven't optimized the teacher

00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:09,680
experience yet because we were small and

00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:11,660
we're still trying to figure everything

00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,520
out for the student first but they are

00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:15,680
very different experiences and they but

00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:19,660
they are just as much users as our

00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,660
students so yeah thank you

00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:31,690
you said that retention was important

00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:33,309
and we all know that taking high red is

00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:35,020
difficult whether it's online or offline

00:52:33,309 --> 00:52:37,329
use very difficult can you just like

00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:41,049
maybe talk for a brief moment on

00:52:37,329 --> 00:52:42,940
usability things you did to help people

00:52:41,049 --> 00:52:45,869
get through that challenge besides just

00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:48,670
it's easy to use but were you able to

00:52:45,869 --> 00:52:50,349
give people a little boost yeah that's

00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:55,270
not a great point and I really think

00:52:50,349 --> 00:52:56,710
that the the majority of that of the

00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:58,599
success there is really about our

00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:00,609
academic staff about our student

00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:03,549
advisors and our instructors who are

00:53:00,609 --> 00:53:05,589
interacting with students on a very

00:53:03,549 --> 00:53:06,910
personal level and helping them in

00:53:05,589 --> 00:53:09,790
coaching them through their degree

00:53:06,910 --> 00:53:12,040
progress they are the first line of

00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:15,250
defense for technical issues for

00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:19,180
academic issues for billing issues I

00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:22,059
mean we have incredible staff of people

00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:25,059
that you know really guide students

00:53:22,059 --> 00:53:26,740
along the way I think so in our case I

00:53:25,059 --> 00:53:30,520
really think that's where the where the

00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:35,859
credit is due in terms of the UX side of

00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:38,500
things yeah i mean i think in if

00:53:35,859 --> 00:53:40,420
anything this the establishing the sort

00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:42,369
of continuous feedback cycles where

00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:45,400
we're learning something is a really big

00:53:42,369 --> 00:53:48,430
pain point and then working to fix it

00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:52,299
like the readiness meter i think that's

00:53:48,430 --> 00:53:55,000
kind of the you know that's sort of that

00:53:52,299 --> 00:53:56,349
is our role to fix things when we really

00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,720
hear about people struggling through

00:53:56,349 --> 00:54:01,750
them but it's definitely our academics

00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:10,450
staff that kind of helps students get to

00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:12,099
where they need to be so this isn't a UX

00:54:10,450 --> 00:54:14,609
question but it I thought it was kind of

00:54:12,099 --> 00:54:17,980
interesting that your pricing model is a

00:54:14,609 --> 00:54:20,650
time-based but courses can be done as

00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:23,290
quickly as you're ready do you have

00:54:20,650 --> 00:54:24,910
anything to add yeah so well okay I

00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:27,819
guess I'll say this slightly more

00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:30,760
extended version of that so semesters at

00:54:27,819 --> 00:54:35,079
let's pick new charter so semesters are

00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:36,740
16 weeks long and basically when you

00:54:35,079 --> 00:54:39,110
begin a course you

00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:42,560
have you can go as slow or fast as you

00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:44,869
need within this semester period within

00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:47,000
16 weeks if you you go one after the

00:54:44,869 --> 00:54:49,580
other maybe you can complete five

00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:52,780
courses maybe you only complete one but

00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:56,390
it is a 16-week kind of time-based

00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:58,040
semester chunk so we have like a

00:54:56,390 --> 00:55:00,140
bachelor's degree which you know can

00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:01,430
take four years or if you coming in with

00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:04,130
a lot of transfer credits and you're

00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:05,420
working incredibly hard I don't know

00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:07,550
maybe you get it done in two years like

00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:10,119
in that sense it's very up to you but we

00:55:07,550 --> 00:55:13,460
do have this delimited 16-week block

00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:16,160
that makes sense and the tuition is

00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:18,710
monthly or its annually or no sorry

00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:21,530
monthly or I guess by term paying

00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:26,030
upfront with that so yeah the websites

00:55:21,530 --> 00:55:28,070
you know.com for the company a new ed

00:55:26,030 --> 00:55:33,440
you for a new charter and patent that

00:55:28,070 --> 00:55:36,350
need you for patent my question sure so

00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:38,660
I'm you said like with user voice that

00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:42,280
you hash things out with students and

00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:45,560
staff and I'm just curious if you um

00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:48,800
like when you are addressing the

00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:51,140
students if it's like the UX team says

00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:54,380
this or do you get like personal and say

00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:56,359
like your first name or like that in

00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:59,990
that process sure that's a really great

00:55:56,359 --> 00:56:02,660
question so I I wanted to mention that

00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:05,570
in the context of this email so this is

00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:07,730
an email that I wrote on behalf of like

00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:11,119
me the UX person to a current student

00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:14,240
and in my experience I've found it very

00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:16,070
helpful to be very specific about who

00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:18,770
you are and what your intentions are and

00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:20,720
having a conversation I have nothing to

00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:23,300
do with your grade I am NOT a teacher

00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:25,640
and I can like help you or hurt you or

00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:28,310
anything all I'm concerned about is the

00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:31,490
experience that you have with our school

00:56:28,310 --> 00:56:34,040
online so being very upfront about that

00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:36,680
and kind of saying my role and and who I

00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:39,020
am has for me been the most successful

00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:41,090
when I started out in the beginning i

00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:43,040
don't think i mentioned outright about

00:56:41,090 --> 00:56:44,540
user experience and i did have some

00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,609
students saying well do you know my

00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:48,170
teacher do you know like are you going

00:56:46,609 --> 00:56:49,490
to be able to how what are the

00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:52,310
communication channels like

00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:53,600
so in I think as you know if you're

00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:56,480
doing this on behalf of user experience

00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:58,520
research it's really helpful to just say

00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,410
that and it often times it makes your

00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,580
users potentially at least in our case

00:57:00,410 --> 00:57:09,950
for students and makes them feel a bit

00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:13,180
more relaxed and willing to open up okay

00:57:09,950 --> 00:57:13,180
