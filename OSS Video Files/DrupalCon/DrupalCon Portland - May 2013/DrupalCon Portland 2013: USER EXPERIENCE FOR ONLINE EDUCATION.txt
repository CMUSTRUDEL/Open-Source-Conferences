Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: USER EXPERIENCE FOR ONLINE EDUCATION
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	I work for UniversityNow, a San Francisco startup in the online higher education space. We deliver online education to working adults through our flexible, self-paced degree programs.

In this presentation, I will talk about the role of user experience in online education. Sticking with an online class, let alone a whole degree program, is a huge commitment for a user to make. As a user experience designer, this creates unique opportunities for research and usability testing. It also makes it easy for users to get fed up with you. User experience is key in this market.

I will also talk about the conflux of user experience and marketing, and the skillsets that user experience professionals bring to the marketing world. At our company, user experience is involved with understanding our student base, how we market to them, and keeping tabs on their experience as students. I am going to talk about how this integrated approach has helped us, and ways that other user experience teams can begin to work closer with their marketing and customer service departments.
