Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: DEVOPS FOR DRUPAL: WHY WE COOK WITH CHEF
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	We continue to see DevOps, as a growing movement to bring together the practices and people in Development and Operations, take shape within the world of Drupal. It touches on a wide range of areas and activities: from building a Drupal site, to testing it, to deploying it, to monitoring it, to maintaining it, and to supporting it.

We'll provide an intro to DevOps (what it is and what it isn't), talk about the needs and goals for infrastructure as code, and how it applies to Drupal. We'll also talk about Opscode Chef, our configuration management tool of choice for automation in working with Drupal and how we use it to make our lives (and the lives of our clients) better. We'll show examples of how to build, deploy, and manage Drupal stacks and sites leveraging the power and flexibility of Chef.
