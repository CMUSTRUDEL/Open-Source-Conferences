Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: NEXT STEPS FOR DRUPAL COMMERCE
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	Drupal Commerce is an open source eCommerce framework developed to help you create unique online shopping experiences. Its core modules provide the basic systems you need to do business online without hard-coding assumptions for any particular business model, allowing you to build sites that meet your business needs instead of getting in your way.

Drupal Commerce was developed from the ground up on Drupal 7, both benefiting from and contributing to the development of the enormously powerful Views and Rules modules. Additionally, many of the project's earliest and longest contributors come from top notch Drupal shops who have all helped to ensure Drupal Commerce is ready for use in markets requiring complex tax, multilingual, and multi-currency configurations.

Having laid such a strong foundation for truly flexible eCommerce, the question we'll answer in this session is... what's next?

COMMERCE KICKSTART 2.0 WALKTHROUGH

Commerce Kickstart is one of the most popular distributions of Drupal that installs and configures Drupal Commerce and its dependencies. We've always described it as the fastest way to get up and running with Drupal Commerce, but it certainly hasn't been the prettiest or most comprehensive.

At DrupalCon Munich, Commerce Guys unveiled the 2.0 version of the distribution to incorporate more essential contributed modules, flesh out the example store content, and ship with an attractive eCommerce theme.

In this session, we'll demonstrate the work that has gone into making this distribution not just a quick way to get up and running but even a complete solution for powering small to medium sized businesses online. Hands-on demonstrations will be running at our booth throughout the conference.

DRUPAL COMMERCE 2.X ROADMAP

Drupal Commerce 1.0 was released at DrupalCon London, but we were in no hurry to open a 2.x branch immediately thereafter. There was plenty of work to do in contributed modules to flesh out the feature set required to do business online, and we were eager to incorporate feedback into the 1.x branch from developers and users of live Drupal Commerce sites.

Now with the feature completion phase of Drupal 8 coming to a close and over 10,000 additional sites reporting usage of Drupal Commerce, we're ready to open the core up to a new round of development. This session will highlight key areas targeted for improvement and modules developed since Drupal Commerce 1.0 that may be considered as new dependencies or rolled into core.

Active development on the 2.x branch will begin soon after the feature completion phase ends.

alright hopefully you have intentionally

00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:07,620
come to the next steps for a drupal

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:09,059
commerce session if not my feelings will

00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:13,549
not be hurt if you need to go find a

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:15,990
different room i am ryan serama and I am

00:00:13,549 --> 00:00:18,750
married to Christina and a father of two

00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,760
as of last year Williams actually a

00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,000
little bit bigger now we live in South

00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,460
Carolina in Greenville it's the upstate

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,010
near Asheville North Carolina if folks

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:31,050
have come out east it's a really nice

00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:32,700
place to visit and hopefully it'll be a

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,980
nice place to have a drupalcamp one day

00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,399
that's that's a sort of long-term goal

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,489
of mine but in the meantime I fly around

00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,129
to events like drupalcon Portland and

00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:47,610
every other drupalcon since Barcelona to

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:50,610
talk really Drupal powered ecommerce in

00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:52,680
general at first it was using a Drupal

00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,719
with uber cart and that was my first

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,590
e-commerce system developed on Drupal 5

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,539
and then in 2009 early 2010 with

00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,149
commerce guys we undertook to develop

00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,760
this new e-commerce system on Drupal 7

00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:06,900
called Drupal commerce I won't be

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,270
providing a whole lot of background

00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,030
information on the core framework itself

00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,710
I'm going to assume that since it's been

00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,890
out for a few years now we have a

00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,420
general idea of what it is in the room

00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,700
if not I will have time for questions

00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,229
and answers at the end but the gist of

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:25,110
it is that it is just an e-commerce

00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:27,689
framework that facilitates any type of

00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:30,000
e-commerce experience on your Drupal

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,590
site so you install these modules and

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,049
you get a shopping cart ooh check a

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,960
check out form in address book customer

00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:38,070
profiles all that kind of stuff it does

00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:40,079
but we're talking about here in this

00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:42,990
session is what's next for Drupal

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,509
commerce because we have drupal commerce

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:47,850
itself we also have commerce kickstart

00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:50,100
which some of you may have seen the the

00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,770
demo at our booth in the commerce

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,380
village we have that which sort of

00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,790
provides a full store out of the box as

00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:01,860
a distribution of Drupal that includes

00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:04,710
Drupal 7 with Drupal commerce with a

00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,030
couple of themes and August an could

00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,429
correct me but I'm sure it's about a

00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,289
hundred additional modules that are

00:02:08,429 --> 00:02:12,540
supplying a bunch of other functionality

00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:13,569
for the store we also have the commerce

00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,060
marketplace

00:02:13,569 --> 00:02:18,819
which is in development and is itself a

00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:20,590
next step because the marketplaces is a

00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:23,079
continual work-in-progress it's the

00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:25,030
place where we connect commerce sites to

00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:27,609
the third party service providers that

00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:29,139
make ecommerce truly work at scale and

00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:31,629
because there's only so much that you

00:02:29,139 --> 00:02:33,969
can do through your one website you're

00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:36,000
going to have to depend on analytic

00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:38,680
services payment services for sure

00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,389
fulfillment services accounting CRM etc

00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,680
so we will continue to build out the

00:02:40,389 --> 00:02:43,719
marketplace and I'll talk a little bit

00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,260
about that and show what that looks like

00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:49,590
in the back end of commerce kickstart

00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:52,959
we're also here at drupalcon Portland to

00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:55,480
kind of demo unveil launched the private

00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,250
beta of the Commerce mobile offering

00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:00,189
which you can see on my phone afterwards

00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,709
if you're curious it's a mobile app that

00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:05,049
uses the commerce services module and a

00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:07,329
variety of configuration modules to

00:03:05,049 --> 00:03:10,480
expose your commerce kickstart store to

00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:12,069
a native iOS mobile app that's been

00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,169
built in titanium so it could also work

00:03:12,069 --> 00:03:16,480
on Android I'll talk about that a little

00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:19,000
bit in the later in the session and then

00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,949
we have commerce platform which is as I

00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,540
said in a private beta you can come get

00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:23,799
on the beta list will be sending invites

00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,349
out i believe over the next couple of

00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:28,750
weeks to launch the the full final

00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:30,609
offering a triple con prague in the

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,650
meantime i look forward to seeing some

00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:34,689
of you testing and for us even as I test

00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,909
it with my own site ah and a bit of

00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:39,519
background information aside from my

00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:41,829
work in Drupal i'm also a cheesemonger i

00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,290
eat my own dog food and use drupal

00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:47,739
commerce to sell Amish made raw milk

00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,509
cheese online and so I like to say that

00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:51,250
Drupal commerce has successfully got at

00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:54,819
least one Amish farmer to sign up for

00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:58,419
email that was a major achievement of

00:03:54,819 --> 00:04:00,519
mine and within Commerce guys I am the

00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:02,079
leader for R&D team which is myself and

00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:03,969
one other person Josh Miller at the

00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:05,650
front of the room here who helps me

00:04:03,969 --> 00:04:08,319
maintain drupal commerce at work right

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,909
documentation communicate about commerce

00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,219
in general so that all of you here know

00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:13,389
how to solve your problems and if you

00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:15,129
have a problem that you don't know how

00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:17,979
to solve I strongly recommend you

00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:21,549
assault josh after the session and see

00:04:17,979 --> 00:04:23,560
what he cannot do for you but once we

00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:25,750
get in talking about what's what's going

00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,310
on right now in the broader drupal

00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,139
commerce ecosystem

00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,300
you will talk specifically about how the

00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:33,010
framework itself is going to mature and

00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:35,200
evolve over the next year year and a

00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:38,380
half as we make the transition from

00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,790
Drupal 7 to Drupal 8 and that may be

00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,740
part of the big reveal is just that

00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:45,220
Drupal commerce will not have a second

00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:47,650
version a 2x branch on Drupal 7 will be

00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:49,000
jumping straight to Drupal 8 and I'll

00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,650
discuss some of the implications about

00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,240
that toward the end of our time the day

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,370
and i have a note here in my presenter

00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,830
notes that's so handy after my

00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:02,830
presentation this evening at our booth

00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,840
submit kataria who's been our go-to guy

00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:07,000
for mobile app development will be doing

00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:09,700
a demo in the little commerce saloon on

00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,860
the back end of our booth just so you

00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:14,860
can actually see the whole thing in

00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,450
progress or you can come steal my phone

00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,850
afterwards and check it out as well and

00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:20,950
there are demos of the commerce platform

00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:23,350
at the booth you can find Damien tourney

00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:25,060
at our CTO and he's really happy to work

00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:28,690
through that and show that off and use

00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:30,490
my cheese site as an example so before

00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,800
before we go any further I do want to

00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,350
remind us all and remind myself of the

00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,450
big idea this is how I've introduced all

00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:39,789
of my drupal commerce presentations at

00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,440
least since drupalcon chicago and it's

00:05:39,789 --> 00:05:44,620
the idea that our vision at commerce

00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,140
skies is for drupal commerce and by

00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:49,990
extension drupal itself to be the number

00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:53,500
one open-source e-commerce framework in

00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:55,600
the world we want to beat my predecessor

00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,880
and form a project ubercart we want to

00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,580
beat magenta we want to beat prestashop

00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,979
overseas we want to go toe-to-toe with

00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,870
these guys and win with in commerce guys

00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:08,139
we are doing it against them and against

00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:10,210
a man wearing Hybris an atg when we go

00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:11,889
out and bid on large projects but we

00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:16,180
hope we also want to beat them at just a

00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:18,400
mass market broader adoption metric so

00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:19,810
we want you to be a part of that we want

00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,669
to cast that vision keep that vision

00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,010
before you end and and I say this

00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:25,690
because i think it's truly possible

00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:27,940
because with drupal commerce with drupal

00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,950
itself being so flexible and moving so

00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,990
fast and making such rapid advances

00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,940
especially when you look at Drupal 8 vs

00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,370
Drupal 7 we think that we can power

00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:38,740
truly flexible e-commerce that would

00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:40,620
make Drupal commerce the solution for

00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,800
any merchant of any size in

00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:46,050
particular you know vertical market we

00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,880
don't hardcode assumptions into Drupal

00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,160
commerce itself so that you can actually

00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:53,060
take the framework and configure it to

00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,310
work for any type of storm it could be a

00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:58,350
well I guess I have a wall Oh pictures

00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,720
here I'm it could be a product store

00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:02,820
selling jewelry you could be selling

00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,650
subscriptions you could be registering

00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:06,120
for drupalcon Portland maybe you didn't

00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:08,790
know it but you use Drupal commerce to

00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,889
do that there there are many different

00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,120
applications of Drupal commerce and we

00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:13,949
think that Drupal commerce is

00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,169
flexibility is one of its key selling

00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:18,210
points and so we make that point we

00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:20,400
definitely make that point to developers

00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,260
because that speaks to developers none

00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,990
of us like being pigeon-holed by a rigid

00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:29,160
system unless you're like me and I still

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:31,050
love developing games in basic III guess

00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,300
I'd like that that that fun sense of

00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,560
punishment when you're dealing with 640

00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,110
Killa by memory limit and other things

00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,870
like that but whenever we're doing work

00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,130
we won't work to just work and not have

00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,960
to deal with the frustrations of a

00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:45,750
limited system so we don't pigeonhole

00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,639
anyone into any particular business

00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,620
model checkout workflow order management

00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,000
workflow anything it's all there for you

00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:55,139
to build from the ground up which is

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,200
again great for developers we don't we

00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:01,229
don't want to be a frustrated we don't

00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,180
want to have to to unhook or unregister

00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:04,950
hooks and modules it's easy enough to

00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:07,320
turn off a rule or to change the way a

00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:10,560
view has been configured let's go

00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:12,419
through here we also don't want you to

00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,070
be tied to a particular data model so by

00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:15,599
depending on drupal's feel double entity

00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,910
system you can actually construct the

00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:19,199
product data model that you want you can

00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,729
then extend those with the other

00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,500
contributor modules that work with the

00:08:20,729 --> 00:08:24,030
field system you have automatic

00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,010
integration into views so you have a

00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:27,630
mantra like the commerce reports module

00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:29,310
that can actually look at your field

00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:32,430
data from all of your order history and

00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:33,750
generate pretty graph reports right on

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,690
the backend of your website just by

00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:38,580
having access to all of this data in and

00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:41,640
I guess in a man or a format that views

00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:43,349
can understand so we've always kind of

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,990
pitched Drupal commerce as this great

00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:47,610
platform or framework for developers but

00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,170
that's not going to make us the number

00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,910
one open-source e-commerce framework in

00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,490
the world because there's only so many

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:54,340
of us and and only so many of us are

00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,400
able to take this

00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,510
communicate that to an actual merchant

00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,800
it's great for us when we have our own

00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,780
projects to be able to spend something

00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,430
up very fast but when you have to go and

00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:06,040
compete against someone like magenta who

00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:07,330
has ebays marketing budget behind it or

00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,160
any of the other major e-commerce

00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:11,530
players you need to actually be able to

00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,030
speak the merchants language and so I

00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:15,820
guess I have some questions here that

00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:17,920
maybe we aren't answering as directly so

00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,720
how will Jubal Commerce help me make

00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,910
money how can I see what's happening in

00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,800
my store or even something simple for me

00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:25,570
or it should be simple for me with my

00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,190
cheese I was when I send out this

00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:30,010
newsletter how much money am I actually

00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:33,400
making and those questions can actually

00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:34,690
be difficult to answer and we should we

00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,910
should do a better job of making that

00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:38,980
simpler what what is this about the

00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,420
product data model again you know we

00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,360
definitely hit that whenever we're doing

00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:45,310
our usability testing people and maybe

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,620
this is some context that we don't all

00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,880
have but in Drupal commerce just in the

00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,950
core of the framework we separate

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,480
product data definition from how a

00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,760
product is displayed so you have to

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,380
define say all the variations of a

00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,300
t-shirt the different sizes and colors

00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,410
it may come in and then have a node that

00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,360
references all those different

00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:03,670
variations to turn it into one add to

00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,290
cart form and that's sort of like entity

00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:07,000
referencing and even as the word entity

00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,860
is scary for a merchant or store

00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,900
administrator who just wants to go add a

00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,150
product page and give it sizes and

00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:14,470
colors and put in a description so

00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:17,260
whenever we we look at the sort of

00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,640
development of Drupal commerce I'd say

00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,110
that like this may be frustrating was

00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,030
actually by design because it was a

00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:24,520
matter of priority our first priority

00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:28,060
was to actually get an implementation of

00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:30,520
e-commerce on Drupal 7 and then right

00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:32,170
commerce kickstart to a text to actually

00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,210
make drupal commerce look and feel like

00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,290
a complete e-commerce solution and I

00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,400
believe we've accomplished that if

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:38,410
you've been able to put your hands on

00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,450
the demo you can see that what you get

00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:42,730
when you install commerce kickstart is a

00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:44,800
store not only that we wanted to

00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:46,270
simplify this user experience for store

00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,950
administrators so when they're

00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,990
administering orders and managing those

00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:51,730
managing the customer relationships when

00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,710
they're adding new products to the side

00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:56,200
or managing stock or whatever we wanted

00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,850
to make those routine tasks simpler we

00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,080
wanted to make it easy to add messages

00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:01,120
to orders and communicate with your

00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,290
customers and see that trail of

00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,630
everything that's happened to an order

00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:07,630
so we used a meaty booze message module

00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,710
to accomplish that so commerce kickstart

00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:11,410
was the point where we took the

00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,870
framework and started started optimizing

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:16,660
it for a particular like market segment

00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:18,400
in this case it's you know non-technical

00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,950
store administrators who are selling

00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,170
physical goods so we took something that

00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,270
looks like something that looks like

00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:27,060
this out of the box which doesn't

00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:30,880
communicate anything except that well

00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,560
bartok works and we made it look like

00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,540
this which communicates wow this is a

00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,190
side that actually sells something so

00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:38,200
out of the box as soon as you install

00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:40,900
commerce kickstart this is what you see

00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:43,840
and actually I pulled up some some tabs

00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:46,420
here to run through we have basically

00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:49,600
implemented on the front end a variety

00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:52,840
of e-commerce best practices using

00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,210
obviously big images and easy ways to

00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:57,340
advertise offers free shipping of course

00:11:55,210 --> 00:12:00,100
communicates to everyone on the internet

00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,870
but not just focused on like the front

00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,510
page branding experience but also

00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:06,880
product catalog so commerce itself does

00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:08,620
not have any concept of the product

00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,960
catalog but here in commerce kickstart

00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:13,690
we've used views in the Search API and

00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,450
facet API to have a sort of faceted

00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:18,040
product catalog browsing experience you

00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,710
could browse the catalog using the

00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,450
normal taxonomy related menus but here I

00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:24,700
can actually see the full list of demo

00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,020
store content which is optional on

00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,450
installation then you can remove it

00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:30,460
afterwards but I can just filter down

00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,620
through i believe it's got some ajax you

00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,180
functionality in here i can actually

00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,340
filter my search results just like you

00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:38,460
could on newegg is kind of the common

00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:41,140
example of someone that really nailed

00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,820
faceted product searching and then

00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:46,600
whenever i get down to an actual product

00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:48,930
page we have it looking and functioning

00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:51,370
like you might expect just an attractive

00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,960
product page to to work like so actually

00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,060
have the image gallery with zoomable

00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:56,770
product images and not just a select

00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:58,060
list to choose the color because hey we

00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,440
can actually make that the color itself

00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,510
that you're buying so we have the

00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,940
commerce fancy attributes module which

00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:06,250
exists as a standalone project so that

00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:08,380
that customers can come and see the

00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:10,200
color there they're changing to update

00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,790
the whole image gallery at the same time

00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,140
maybe see price changes or whatever else

00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:16,120
based on the attributes that you're

00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:18,160
selecting and then once the Add to Cart

00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:20,620
happens we provide you with an

00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,139
opportunity to again directly market to

00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,019
them to

00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:25,579
brian drive conversions so this isn't

00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:28,129
something that the core of Commerce is

00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:29,749
concerned with in in the heart of Drupal

00:13:28,129 --> 00:13:31,129
commerce it's not like there's a module

00:13:29,749 --> 00:13:33,470
you can turn on that says conversion

00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:34,790
optimization but but we're interested in

00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,379
conversion rates you need to know that

00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:38,239
kind of stuff because you need to know

00:13:36,379 --> 00:13:39,169
how to head a tool or retool the front

00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:41,119
end of your website or what

00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:42,889
recommendations engine to integrate with

00:13:41,119 --> 00:13:44,779
or how to change your your menu

00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:47,600
hierarchy so that you can capture more

00:13:44,779 --> 00:13:49,730
sales and maybe at a recent hackathon I

00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,589
rigged it together so that using the the

00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:54,079
relo fiop I was actually putting product

00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:56,179
recommendations into this modal dialogue

00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,619
because it's just built using the views

00:13:56,179 --> 00:13:59,779
module so it's really easy to extend

00:13:57,619 --> 00:14:01,519
this and customize it show them what

00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:04,879
else they're buying up sell other

00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,579
products or related products etc so with

00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:09,019
commerce kickstart too we've tried to

00:14:07,579 --> 00:14:10,939
give merchants a lot more tools in the

00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:13,339
front and to have an easy quick

00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:15,970
attractive e-commerce site that provides

00:14:13,339 --> 00:14:18,529
them with with places to optimize for

00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,149
conversion and it's actually gone so

00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:22,339
well let's see if I can remember the URL

00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:24,109
and hope it loads because I wasn't

00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:27,980
planning on pulling them up that we're

00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:29,899
starting to see submissions to the to

00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,549
the drupal commerce showcase if you go

00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:33,559
to Drupal commerce to work / showcase

00:14:31,549 --> 00:14:35,749
that's where that wall of images came

00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:38,299
from we're seeing stores like this one

00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:40,309
that if taken commerce kickstart 2x

00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:43,369
changed a few colors stopped in

00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:45,709
different images and launched with no

00:14:43,369 --> 00:14:47,299
development required I'm all they had to

00:14:45,709 --> 00:14:49,819
do was tweaked some CSS and they had a

00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:51,319
live store that was ready to sell in

00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:54,019
this case one hundred percent pure raw

00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:55,279
honey and they had the dynamic product

00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:57,230
pages of course they just have one

00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,730
product page but it but it's fully

00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,819
dynamic thanks to the way the Add to

00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:03,649
Cart form works with in Drupal commerce

00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:05,749
and and again like for the merchant like

00:15:03,649 --> 00:15:07,699
this speaks to them and in one day you

00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:10,309
can turn around a new e-commerce site to

00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:13,549
sell my product and and hopefully that

00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:16,339
speaks to you as developers and sales

00:15:13,549 --> 00:15:19,100
guys etc as well it's it's much faster

00:15:16,339 --> 00:15:21,649
with commerce kickstart to deploy in

00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:24,199
this case a simple ecommerce site but as

00:15:21,649 --> 00:15:26,269
the market place itself fills out even

00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:27,499
more complex sites and I'm sort of run

00:15:26,269 --> 00:15:29,269
into the back end as well because we

00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:31,819
didn't just optimize the customer

00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:34,160
experience in the front end oh let's go

00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:34,610
here as I mentioned we also spent some

00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,560
time

00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,720
rethinking the way that our our

00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,490
administrative views work because we

00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,100
wanted to simplify routine tasks for

00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:45,170
example editing all of the products in a

00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,250
particular product group so again if

00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:48,320
you're familiar with you the

00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:50,089
architecture of Commerce if you're

00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,220
selling the t-shirt and it has four

00:15:50,089 --> 00:15:54,740
different sizes there are four separate

00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,450
product entities with unique skews that

00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:58,519
get tied in through one product display

00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:00,890
which is great for stock control and

00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:02,810
reporting and other things like that and

00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,220
some analytics and data mining but it's

00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,779
not so great when it comes to actually

00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,120
managing a group of products at the same

00:16:05,779 --> 00:16:10,339
time so here within this products view

00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,709
I'm actually seeing a list of my product

00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:15,410
displays and if I click this quick edit

00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:17,630
button it will expand out this row in

00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:18,890
the view using the views Megara module

00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:21,500
another separate module that we've

00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:23,690
released on drupal.org to include all of

00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,730
the different product variations that

00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:28,040
are in this display so I can enable them

00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:29,750
disable them tweak the price and then

00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,050
make those updates right here in line in

00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:34,459
the form and if i needed to the the

00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,200
combo button has a drop down it would

00:16:34,459 --> 00:16:39,050
actually let me access the full note

00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:41,449
edit form where i can add new variations

00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:43,459
change the images edit the body of a

00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:48,290
product maybe change which catalog

00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:50,029
category it's a part of etc are our node

00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,399
edit form also it doesn't just use the

00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:53,930
standard product reference autocomplete

00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,970
widget it's using what's called the

00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:58,459
inline entity form widget which again is

00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:00,320
a separate project on dido that's

00:16:58,459 --> 00:17:02,360
packaged into the distribution so that

00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,910
you can actually add update create

00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:07,970
delete product entities right in line

00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:10,270
from the the note edit form itself this

00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:12,439
this module is not restricted just to

00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:14,510
drupal commerce so it will work for

00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:16,100
other types of entities of well so maybe

00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:17,959
if you're using a node reference or user

00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,589
reference or something like that you

00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:23,030
could use the module for those cases so

00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:25,010
what what used to require going to one

00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:26,419
interface to create a bunch of products

00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,040
and then another interface to create a

00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:29,600
node and then remembering all the

00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,669
different SKUs that are supposed to go

00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,620
together well all those steps have been

00:17:31,669 --> 00:17:35,540
collapsed into one single page where you

00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,490
can come and create the node add the

00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:39,919
variations reorder them so you have you

00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:42,320
know different sort orders perhaps for

00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:46,880
the default product selected and then

00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:48,460
save everything all at once yeah so

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,840
that's pretty interesting

00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,160
I'm pretty happy about it and I'm

00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,350
looking forward to see how that develops

00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,940
on Drupal 8 because the entity reference

00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:57,790
module is now a part of Corps and the

00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,980
inline entity forum will be carried over

00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:02,680
and added as a new actual dependency of

00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:04,540
Drupal commerce itself so commerce

00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,430
kickstart was the use case the test case

00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:08,170
that sort of proved the concept and then

00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:10,240
in commerce to that X will be able to

00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:11,620
depend on that and take advantage of all

00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,150
the work that's gone into building

00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,820
commerce kickstart to and making it what

00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:17,320
it is so this is the order

00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,440
administration interface again it looks

00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,370
similar to the product interface and I

00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,810
guess I didn't I didn't call out

00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:26,020
everything you know every feature of

00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:28,750
this of these pages in the last screen

00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:31,030
but not only is it a view that uses the

00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:34,860
views mega row to expand and do that

00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:37,600
quick edit function up did I just unplug

00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:39,280
we also use vuze bulk operations for you

00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,080
to be able to do bulk updates to orders

00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:43,120
as you're processing a group of orders

00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,370
or bulk updates to products the same

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,560
things on those forms filtering

00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:50,950
searching by you know customer name

00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:53,170
order date order number etc all this is

00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:55,180
sort of built into commerce kickstart

00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,830
out of the box thanks to another

00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,290
separate module called commerce back

00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:01,000
office and so this is sort of a common

00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:03,190
refrain here as I'm running through

00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,070
these screens a lot of the functionality

00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:08,530
of its in commerce kickstart to X exists

00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:10,360
in standalone projects on drupal.org and

00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:12,970
the idea was we wanted you to be able to

00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,770
build a site that uses drupal commerce

00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:17,530
and many of these modules without having

00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:19,420
to start with commerce kickstart 2x a

00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,580
drupal distribution is great for

00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:23,230
launching a new store but once the store

00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:25,270
is launched you can't go back and get

00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:27,070
the distribution features unless they

00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:29,590
exist as these separate projects on

00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,790
drupal.org so even as every new user of

00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:32,410
kickstart gets to take advantage of

00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:34,810
these features if you already have a

00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:36,910
site using con using drupal commerce or

00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:38,770
don't want to use this distro as your

00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:41,680
base you can still grab these modules

00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:43,570
and I and install them configure them

00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,030
and have the same exact user experience

00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:47,890
for your store admins and such and Josh

00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:50,710
actually is doing a series of videos

00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:52,210
called Commerce module Tuesday you can

00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,700
find those through the Drupal commerce

00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:56,770
or blog where he's actually been showing

00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,620
how to install and configure these

00:19:56,770 --> 00:20:00,460
various modules on an existing Drupal

00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:03,610
commerce

00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:05,890
I all right and then last but not least

00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:08,290
in the backend of commerce kickstart we

00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:10,600
have this connector to what we call the

00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:12,990
commerce marketplace the commerce

00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:16,810
marketplace is sort of the place to find

00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:19,360
vetted and in hand-picked integrations

00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:21,820
with third-party services that we have

00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,750
partnerships with so you'll see in here

00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:27,580
giraffe is our partner for e-commerce

00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:29,980
analytics on-site my other partners

00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:32,380
include payment gateways performance

00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:34,240
services sales tax calculation services

00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,160
and many of these folks are actually in

00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,690
our booth right now in what we call the

00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,600
Commerce village which is our effort to

00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:42,940
bring ecommerce service providers to you

00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:44,800
at drupalcon so we go to trade shows

00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,600
where they have huge boots and they

00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,090
reach out to the whole general commerce

00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:51,040
community but they typically haven't had

00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:53,400
a representation at Drupal conferences

00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,480
even though other parts of the sort of

00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,030
Drupal environment have so there have

00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,890
been hosting companies at Drupal cons

00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:01,180
for some time now well now we're saying

00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:04,330
let's bring some of these ecommerce

00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:05,500
companies to the conference as well to

00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:07,600
get to know you to get to talk about

00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:10,300
their integrations in Drupal to talk

00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,470
about you know their prices and their

00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,030
their business models and their

00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,740
offerings so that whenever you go to

00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:17,050
launch your next ecommerce site using

00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:19,240
Drupal commerce you'll have them here

00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:20,590
ready to plug in right into your website

00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,450
and you can search them find them right

00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:24,100
to the back end and what's great about

00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:26,620
this is that some of these services like

00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:29,650
giraffe actually have registration api's

00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,480
so you as a developer can create an

00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:33,640
account on the Commerce marketplace and

00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,800
then go and register any site that

00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:37,330
you're building for giraffe and manage

00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,970
all of your API keys for all of your

00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:41,790
client sites through one user interface

00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:44,140
within the commerce marketplace itself

00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:46,390
additionally the connector module here

00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:48,100
will even should be able to create that

00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,870
all in line and configure the modules

00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,820
for you right from the back end of

00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:54,160
commerce kickstart again this is part of

00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:55,510
our effort to make it faster simpler and

00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,950
easier for you to get a new e-commerce

00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:59,050
site up running as quickly as possible

00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:00,790
and if you look at some of our

00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:03,280
competitors magento does something

00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:04,780
similar with their their magento go

00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,060
platform in the Magento connect

00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,650
ecosystem or at a sort of meta level

00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:11,260
google does the same thing with google

00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:13,990
apps it's all about a sort of embedding

00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:16,360
into the interface you're already

00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:18,190
using a way to connect to a variety of

00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:23,640
additional services and add-ons for the

00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:25,750
site so let's go back to the slides

00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,130
because I just have you know one more

00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:30,460
little slide here that says hey come

00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:32,620
join us at the Commerce village we have

00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:34,690
these partners here with us at the

00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,700
conference and they are doing demos

00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:38,620
there you know offering whatever they

00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:40,360
have to offer they're explaining

00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:42,429
themselves and their integrations into

00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:43,990
Drupal and it's a great opportunity for

00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:45,730
you to actually talk directly to these

00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:48,010
companies and say you know what would

00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:50,050
make your life as a merchant or as an

00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:51,280
e-commerce integrator easier and hear

00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:53,170
from them what they have come down the

00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,420
pipe in fact one of these at least just

00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:57,790
launched the american express payment

00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:59,410
gateways a brand new service from MX and

00:22:57,790 --> 00:23:01,090
that our team in the UK has been able to

00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:03,370
integrate and then they're here to talk

00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,510
about that at the conference so come

00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,920
find us at the Commerce villager in the

00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:08,980
back right hand corner of the exhibit

00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:11,260
hall and will at least be having beer on

00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:14,620
thursday afternoon so come join us for

00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:16,390
that if nothing else so what else are

00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:18,790
the next steps for drupal commerce and

00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:20,470
we're looking at you know continuing to

00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:22,690
expand that the suite of products and

00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:24,580
services around drupal commerce to make

00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:26,860
it easier for you to sell commerce to

00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,530
your your clients and make it easier for

00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:32,170
us to communicate about to the broader

00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:33,280
sort of e-commerce ecommerce world one

00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:35,170
of the things that everybody asks about

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,910
it what about mobile integration not

00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:38,410
just responsive design but actually

00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:40,450
native mobile apps that can take

00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:42,309
advantage of phone hardware that can

00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:44,230
take advantage of push notifications and

00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:46,780
other hooks that the operating systems

00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:48,280
offer and so our first implementation of

00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:50,230
this is the commerce mobile offering

00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,360
again developed in partnership with

00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:54,700
Simic kataria and he'll be demoing this

00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:57,250
at our booth the idea is that this will

00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:00,250
connect directly to your site and pull

00:23:57,250 --> 00:24:02,290
down product data order history data if

00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:03,730
the user is logged into the app and give

00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:06,550
you as the administrator the and the

00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:09,309
ability to push out through rules push

00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:11,100
notifications to the device you know you

00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:13,929
know advertising special offers or

00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:16,210
eventually making personalized offers to

00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:17,800
different customers within your stores

00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:19,570
maybe it's a discount code for someone

00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,280
that hasn't placed an order in two

00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:22,840
months or something that sort of

00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,210
functionality can be rigged up through

00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,220
the rules module set to run on prawn and

00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,879
then you can actually use the mobile app

00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:30,009
to start to

00:24:27,879 --> 00:24:32,229
to drive more sales to the website

00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:33,399
itself and so it's tools like this that

00:24:32,229 --> 00:24:35,319
we want to bring to bear so that

00:24:33,399 --> 00:24:38,349
everybody else can take advantage of

00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:39,609
these two to sell triple commerce to all

00:24:38,349 --> 00:24:41,409
the different merchants that you have

00:24:39,609 --> 00:24:43,329
access to that will never hear from and

00:24:41,409 --> 00:24:44,889
that's actually been one of them the

00:24:43,329 --> 00:24:47,079
coolest things about doing ubercart and

00:24:44,889 --> 00:24:50,469
then drupal commerce is that their their

00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:52,569
combined about 75,000 ecommerce sites

00:24:50,469 --> 00:24:56,289
using the software and i've personally

00:24:52,569 --> 00:24:58,179
talked to maybe like 75 of them so so by

00:24:56,289 --> 00:25:00,969
a factor of 1,000 there there's so much

00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:03,129
more going on with e-commerce on Drupal

00:25:00,969 --> 00:25:05,109
than then I or commerce guys will ever

00:25:03,129 --> 00:25:07,299
be able to touch but we want to continue

00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:09,999
to develop the framework and the sort of

00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:12,159
ecosystem of tools that you are much

00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:13,629
better equipped to to win these projects

00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,609
and work in partnership with commerce

00:25:13,629 --> 00:25:17,679
guys to deliver them and so if there's

00:25:15,609 --> 00:25:19,569
something like the commerce mobile that

00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,339
we don't offer or that count that Drupal

00:25:19,569 --> 00:25:24,129
commerce the framework doesn't do I'd

00:25:21,339 --> 00:25:26,379
love to hear from you it's it's it's a

00:25:24,129 --> 00:25:27,819
much better as an open source community

00:25:26,379 --> 00:25:29,709
when we're not just an echo chamber for

00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:31,059
the guy that's releasing stuff when you

00:25:29,709 --> 00:25:32,859
can actually hear back from the

00:25:31,059 --> 00:25:34,269
community how its meeting your needs are

00:25:32,859 --> 00:25:36,339
not meeting your needs it helps us make

00:25:34,269 --> 00:25:38,319
the next version even better and you

00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:39,429
know helps Drupal continue on its path

00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:41,919
toward becoming the number one

00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:44,949
open-source e-commerce platform in the

00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,839
world all right so the last thing here

00:25:44,949 --> 00:25:48,459
is the commerce platform this will be a

00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:52,559
hosting platform that's specifically

00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:54,940
tooled to host commerce sites it is I

00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:58,809
guess working through amazon cloud

00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:01,989
services to sort of rethink how cloud

00:25:58,809 --> 00:26:03,579
and agile hosting can work for you so I

00:26:01,989 --> 00:26:05,739
strongly encourage you to get a demo

00:26:03,579 --> 00:26:08,199
from Damien because he's yeah he's the

00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:10,329
one that can best communicate how the I

00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:13,329
guess that the lack of a paradigm that

00:26:10,329 --> 00:26:16,029
that platform sort of forces you into is

00:26:13,329 --> 00:26:18,339
a benefit for you so it's basically a

00:26:16,029 --> 00:26:20,199
hosting platform that lets you spin up

00:26:18,339 --> 00:26:22,029
new development environments using git

00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:23,519
branching and managing all of your

00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:27,069
environments as separate branches with

00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:28,869
basically forked forked file systems and

00:26:27,069 --> 00:26:32,169
databases and then mergers back upstream

00:26:28,869 --> 00:26:34,479
etc etc so I hope that's not over folks

00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:36,219
head in the site building track but just

00:26:34,479 --> 00:26:38,549
suffice it to say that the platform is

00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:41,470
trying to rethink the way that we are

00:26:38,549 --> 00:26:44,580
building and then launching

00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:47,679
websites using Drupal kind of escaping

00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:50,880
maybe some of some of the limitations or

00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,929
restrictions of the dev staging and prod

00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,820
environments that we're used to so

00:26:52,929 --> 00:26:56,289
strongly encourage you to get that demo

00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,820
from Damien and then I do believe that

00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:59,820
comes with a free beer ticket or

00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:01,750
something at the end of it as well

00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:04,150
because again it's actually much easier

00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:09,760
to find beer at drupalcon important than

00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:15,760
it is to find water if anybody or coffee

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:17,860
yeah okay it is a city for that um so

00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,740
let's talk about Drupal commerce to dot

00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:23,679
X and then I'll break for QA and then

00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:29,679
we'll break for beer and coffee and

00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:31,150
water so the Drupal commerce I what's

00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,480
what's the best thing to say here how to

00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:36,669
dive in I think the the the fact that

00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:40,440
Drupal commerce is both a core framework

00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:43,000
and a sort of complementary distribution

00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,580
becomes confusing when you look at the

00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,350
version numbers people look at commerce

00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,720
kickstart 2x and think that is the

00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:51,549
second version of commerce but commerce

00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,010
kickstart 2x actually uses drupal

00:27:51,549 --> 00:27:55,780
commerce one and then there is a

00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:57,940
commerce kickstart one that's that's

00:27:55,780 --> 00:28:00,280
much more bare bones and minimal but

00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:02,110
it's still just drupal commerce one and

00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,760
then in drupal 8 will have drupal

00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:05,860
commerce to and austin sively commerce

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,970
kickstart 3 who knows how to work out

00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,370
but basically what i'm talking about

00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:13,659
here is the next version of the core

00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:17,919
framework so the the sort of like

00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:19,840
coerced or order customer payment

00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,830
entities etc and all the systems that go

00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:23,340
with them like shopping cart and

00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:25,900
checkout all that stuff is going to be

00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:28,150
re-architected in and updated for drupal

00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:29,500
8 um so this will sort of run through

00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:31,630
some of the changes but it's important

00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:33,250
to note that development of the next

00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:35,380
version of the framework doesn't really

00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:38,110
begin in Drupal commerce itself it

00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:40,000
actually began in Drupal core so for the

00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:42,400
last I don't know exactly how long last

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,010
year year and a half Chris Vander water

00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:47,919
is a commerce guy working from his home

00:28:45,010 --> 00:28:50,110
in Oklahoma as an initiative lead for

00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:52,630
the core of Drupal 8 he's been heavily

00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:55,059
involved in the plug-in system the new

00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:57,100
blocks and layout system for Drupal 8

00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:59,559
so a lot of our contributions to that

00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:01,480
was facilities is facilitating what we

00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:03,399
hope to do with Drupal commerce on

00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,039
Drupal 8 but not only that there's also

00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:08,409
the entity reference module so Drupal

00:29:06,039 --> 00:29:11,200
commerce was was the primary test case

00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:13,059
for architecting a major contributed

00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,679
module for Drupal 7 using the entity

00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:17,019
system and feels and references and all

00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:18,909
that and at the time there was no entity

00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:21,129
reference modules so we included in

00:29:18,909 --> 00:29:23,440
Drupal commerce a product reference

00:29:21,129 --> 00:29:24,940
field customer profile reference field

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,710
and a line item reference field and

00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:28,509
because they were sort of like each

00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:31,419
successive implementations of the same

00:29:28,509 --> 00:29:32,259
idea they got progressively better so

00:29:31,419 --> 00:29:33,970
that I think the line item

00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:36,159
implementation is probably the worst and

00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:38,740
maybe the product implementation had the

00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,210
most love but you know that there's are

00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:42,610
some inconsistencies there and that was

00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:44,529
just a result of the API is developing

00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:46,869
and then commerce developing and it's

00:29:44,529 --> 00:29:48,730
all very organic and messy but

00:29:46,869 --> 00:29:50,950
thankfully during the course of Drupal 7

00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:53,350
at Commerce guys we were able to build

00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:54,940
the entity reference module when

00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:57,759
prototyping a client site and that

00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:59,230
module far eclipsed actually the

00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:01,450
Commerce usage stats so there's

00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:03,249
something like twice as many my sites

00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:06,159
using the entity reference field as

00:30:03,249 --> 00:30:08,049
there are using Drupal commerce so for

00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,509
Drupal 8 we were actually able to get

00:30:08,049 --> 00:30:13,659
the entity reference field module into

00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:15,220
core so by focusing on getting into the

00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:17,230
reference in there and Andre Matisse q

00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:19,330
is one of our our prime sort of pushers

00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:21,429
for that within Commerce guys we now

00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:23,529
will be able to deprecate thousands of

00:30:21,429 --> 00:30:24,940
lines of code from Drupal commerce

00:30:23,529 --> 00:30:26,919
itself will no longer have to manage

00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:29,529
that because Drupal core will do it for

00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:31,259
us and so we really sought out ways that

00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:34,090
we could contribute to the Drupal 8

00:30:31,259 --> 00:30:36,070
Drupal 8 timeline and roadmap so that we

00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:37,899
had less and less code in Drupal

00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:39,999
commerce and really as far as I'm

00:30:37,899 --> 00:30:42,789
concerned the most successful Drupal

00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:45,039
Commerce 20 release will involve the

00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:46,779
least amount of code necessary so that's

00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,549
that's why we really focused on building

00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:50,830
into the plugin system the entity API

00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:52,779
the field system we had guys

00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:54,549
contributing to getting views into core

00:30:52,779 --> 00:30:56,499
so that we can take advantage of this

00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:59,889
code and get rid of a lot of code out of

00:30:56,499 --> 00:31:02,799
the commerce modules themselves we will

00:30:59,889 --> 00:31:04,809
open the 2x branch for drupal commerce

00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:08,470
once we have a minor release out of

00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:08,990
Drupal 8 3 said that in alpha release of

00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:10,670
Drupal latest

00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:13,010
coming soon so as far as I'm concerned

00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:14,990
when that happens I will be comfortable

00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:17,450
opening the new branch and beginning to

00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:19,220
to re-implement our commerce entities

00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:23,059
and field relationships and views

00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:24,920
plugins etc etc on Drupal 8 so that

00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:27,230
should happen any day now and then I

00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,700
guess Drupal 8 will maybe be ready by

00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:31,610
the end of the year and we hope to have

00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:35,150
a Drupal commerce to dot 0 beta version

00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:36,230
or higher by that time and then when we

00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,000
think about what's actually going to

00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:40,429
happen in Drupal commerce obviously the

00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:43,490
big thing is we will riorca tect around

00:31:40,429 --> 00:31:45,679
the new features of Drupal 8 itself so

00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:47,510
we're really excited to get rid of some

00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,330
of our dependencies like the entity API

00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:52,280
the will no longer be necessary because

00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:53,960
the entity metadata wrapper that we

00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:56,510
leverage so heavily within our modules

00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:57,740
is now a core part of Drupal 8 so we'll

00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:59,540
be able to change all of the code and

00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,460
interacts with that especially as it

00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,410
pertains to manipulating field data and

00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:05,300
dealing with multilingual sites a lot of

00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:06,770
that will change but it's for the better

00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,020
and it's actually really exciting to be

00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:10,309
able to rearm katek this now and stop

00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:12,260
you know dealing with all the issues

00:32:10,309 --> 00:32:13,790
that we sort of endlessly crop up in the

00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,170
issue queue about one more part of the

00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:17,330
drupal commerce interface it isn't

00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:19,730
translatable or that translates to the

00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:21,800
wrong language or something so we've had

00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,780
some pretty fun localization issues

00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:25,490
because of that and we also want to

00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:27,920
address common configuration and

00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:30,590
development challenges and one of the

00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:33,710
reef rains that you hear is that people

00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:35,240
still choose to use uber card because it

00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,679
allowed them to create a product that

00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:39,020
had a lot of attributes and options

00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:42,440
without forcing them to using a unique

00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:44,660
skew for every different combination now

00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,280
I would say well that's bad data to have

00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:48,679
all these anonymous changes to the same

00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:51,530
product but not know what variations

00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:52,850
actually exist but the the critique of

00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:54,860
the user interface with in Drupal

00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:57,140
commerce itself is fair we should be

00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:59,270
able to have the same architecture but

00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:01,070
make it easier to manage and build out

00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:03,620
large groups or what we're going to call

00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:05,510
product hierarchies within the core of

00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:08,150
Commerce without having to revert to

00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:10,490
some sort of you know old software that

00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:12,890
doesn't really give you great data and

00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:14,660
and has you know much smaller gear

00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:17,240
system etc etc again like I said we want

00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:19,149
to kill it so so I'm trying to put down

00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,169
my old docks my new dog can flirt

00:33:19,149 --> 00:33:24,609
and it's not happening fast enough but

00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:26,999
and the other thing we want to do is

00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:29,649
that sort of apply a broader set of

00:33:26,999 --> 00:33:32,889
development emphasis to the sort of

00:33:29,649 --> 00:33:35,409
broad I guess core of the Commerce

00:33:32,889 --> 00:33:36,940
modules and let's just skip this like

00:33:35,409 --> 00:33:38,649
second already mentioned timeline and

00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:41,649
actually look at what those development

00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:43,389
in feces are so this kind of this first

00:33:41,649 --> 00:33:46,179
one here actually goes along with what

00:33:43,389 --> 00:33:48,070
juries presented in his keynote and what

00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:50,499
I think makes Drupal 8 really exciting

00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:51,820
it's the idea that that we don't have to

00:33:50,499 --> 00:33:53,889
do everything within Drupal and

00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:56,109
certainly when it comes to e-commerce we

00:33:53,889 --> 00:33:57,729
can't do everything within Drupal so

00:33:56,109 --> 00:34:00,729
let's make sure that Drupal and drupal

00:33:57,729 --> 00:34:03,129
commerce is is a very muddy find data

00:34:00,729 --> 00:34:04,989
conduit not just a container not just

00:34:03,129 --> 00:34:06,820
the sole source of all of your

00:34:04,989 --> 00:34:08,799
e-commerce data and the sole point of

00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:10,659
manipulation for all these things but

00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:12,700
but make it a much better channel to put

00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:15,190
you know your customer data into your

00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:17,409
CRM and send your order data out to your

00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:19,659
fulfillment system and you know provide

00:34:17,409 --> 00:34:21,940
your analytics some service with all of

00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:23,770
the different I guess user behaviors and

00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,899
interactions on the site so you can

00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:28,089
depend on all of these sort of best of

00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:30,339
best of breed or best-in-class services

00:34:28,089 --> 00:34:31,869
to continue to improve your store and

00:34:30,339 --> 00:34:33,879
improve your conversion rates and reduce

00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:35,889
the management rates etc so I really

00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:38,200
really look forward to seeing how Drupal

00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:40,720
8 enables this thanks to things like the

00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:43,599
rest module so out of the box we will

00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:45,159
have I'm I guess out of the box will

00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,859
have rest resources for all of our

00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:49,869
commerce entities and better tools for

00:34:47,859 --> 00:34:51,700
consuming data from remote web sources

00:34:49,869 --> 00:34:54,159
so there are things like that happening

00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,960
in the core of Drupal 8 that should make

00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,450
it easier for us to use Drupal commerce

00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,980
as that that data conduit and then

00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:01,990
provide much better integrations with

00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:03,819
these services that we're bringing to

00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:06,309
the market place and maybe the ones that

00:35:03,819 --> 00:35:08,440
don't exist yet I'm additionally I want

00:35:06,309 --> 00:35:10,779
to really serve the majority use case in

00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,510
a much better way how many folks you've

00:35:10,779 --> 00:35:16,660
actually launched Drupal commerce sites

00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:18,250
so far all right so yeah dozens of you

00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,950
have done it and I'm sure that that

00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:22,660
maybe maybe at least one of you has has

00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:24,970
been befuddled by the shopping cart

00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:27,190
refresh happening every sting in time

00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:29,619
the order gets loaded or maybe somebody

00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:31,480
else's wondered why can't I just why

00:35:29,619 --> 00:35:33,580
can't I write a piece of

00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,750
code that can manipulate a product price

00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:37,660
why does everything have to be done

00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:39,369
through rules that's a common question

00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:41,680
another one might be shopping cart

00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:43,180
revisions or check out revisions why am

00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,800
I getting a new revision of my order

00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,210
every time something gets added to the

00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,859
cart or the user progresses through the

00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:50,500
checkout form and a lot of these

00:35:47,859 --> 00:35:51,820
features or a lot a lot of these

00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,590
features were added in to really kind of

00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:55,570
serve the most complex use case

00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:57,340
imaginable so for example we thought

00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:59,020
well it'd be it'd be really nice to be

00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,970
able to see exactly win the customer

00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:03,310
abandon the checkout process and capture

00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:05,140
all of their data as soon as possible so

00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:07,060
we have you know really aggressive

00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:09,160
revision strategy for orders during the

00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:11,050
cart and checkout process but for the

00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,280
average user what they found out was

00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:13,990
that their database was just filling up

00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,910
with all of these rows of entity

00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:17,980
revisions and field revisions and they

00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:19,570
really had no good way to take advantage

00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:21,670
of that data so it's just useless data

00:36:19,570 --> 00:36:23,650
taking up space and preventing them from

00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:26,530
maybe making some other customization or

00:36:23,650 --> 00:36:28,390
configuration and I think they just

00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:29,710
didn't serve them at all and then come

00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:31,810
to find out we could actually integrate

00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:32,740
with someone like giraffe and provide I

00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:34,450
guess I didn't actually show the

00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:37,270
screenshot but we can actually provide

00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:39,040
in the back end of Drupal commerce a

00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:41,350
dashboard that's actually going to show

00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,790
you you know a funnel of who's visiting

00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:44,470
who's shopping who's added to the cart

00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:47,380
at what point of the checkout process

00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:48,820
did they abandon the abandon ordering

00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,440
from you what are your click-through

00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,240
rates and your conversion rates and your

00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,470
abandonment rates all that stuff that we

00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,119
thought oh we need to have all of this

00:36:53,470 --> 00:36:56,920
data in the drupal database so let's be

00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,150
really aggressive about revisions well

00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,580
it turns out it's much better and much

00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:02,380
easier and you know I'm much more

00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:04,119
powerful experience for the merchant to

00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,400
just provide integrations with services

00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:08,230
like giraffe or you know if you're using

00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,330
it google analytics MailChimp has their

00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:11,650
e-commerce 360 analytics these other

00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:13,780
things so let's stop trying to do

00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:16,000
everything within the core commerce

00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:17,920
modules themselves and instead focus on

00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,010
serving the majority use case better I'm

00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:24,400
so as anybody actually used sell price

00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:26,770
pre calculation actually have used it

00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,109
one guy two guys out of the dozens of

00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:31,000
hands that were raised if I had to guess

00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:32,950
I'd say it's probably like less than one

00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,230
percent of our users use this this

00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:37,840
ability of Drupal commerce to look at

00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:39,820
all of your pricing rules and then sort

00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,530
of compile to the database all of the

00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,359
dynamic prices that are possible on your

00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:45,220
site so we could literally take it take

00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,869
a side of a thousand products

00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,190
and look at all of the different pricing

00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:50,170
rules in place maybe there's a dozen of

00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:51,849
them and then generate a million two

00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:53,830
million rows in the database that have

00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:55,420
all of these dynamic prices calculated

00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:57,430
out with their that are keyed by the

00:37:55,420 --> 00:38:00,310
different conditions and context etc

00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:03,099
where those prices might you know might

00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:04,869
might be I guess might be used or would

00:38:03,099 --> 00:38:06,400
come to bear and that was done so that

00:38:04,869 --> 00:38:09,369
you could have views that could actually

00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,869
sort and filter by calculated prices not

00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:12,640
just the price of the product store in

00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:14,500
the database but the problem is it

00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:17,440
serves three people in this whole room

00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:19,270
of users well while everybody else just

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,070
wants to be a to have a simpler sell

00:38:19,270 --> 00:38:23,560
price calculation process but we sort of

00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:25,750
we limited the broader process to serve

00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:27,430
that edge case and so I what I want to

00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:29,320
do is find those places within Drupal

00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,609
commerce where we can better serve the

00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:32,619
majority use case and I know that we

00:38:30,609 --> 00:38:34,570
haven't hit them all if you go look at

00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:36,220
dribble commerce out of work / roadmap

00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:37,630
and you can see at least the ones that

00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,490
I'm aware of but I know we haven't hit

00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:41,349
them all so we'd love to hear from you

00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:43,180
what what is this you know where the

00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:46,060
areas where we have sort of preemptively

00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:49,119
or prematurely sort of optimized for the

00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:51,609
power user and not better not you know

00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,869
properly serve the majority user so I'd

00:38:51,609 --> 00:38:55,119
love to hear from you on that so that's

00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:56,589
a sort of broad emphasis that will you

00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:58,210
know have implications across the

00:38:56,589 --> 00:39:01,000
shopping cart system check out price

00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:04,000
calculation tax order management and all

00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,589
those things we also want to continue

00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,690
our march to using explicit

00:39:05,589 --> 00:39:10,270
configuration instead of sort of

00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:11,470
implicit magical behaviors I mean I'm

00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:13,240
not sure how long some if you've been

00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:16,119
using commerce but if you recall before

00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,890
we had our 10 release it used to be that

00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:20,260
if you wanted a product attribute field

00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:22,750
like the size of a sure to the color of

00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:25,089
a coffee mug or something you just had

00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:27,160
to you just had to kind of know what

00:39:25,089 --> 00:39:29,410
field types would work as attribute

00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,630
fields and you had to know that they

00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,830
could only be single value and I think

00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:34,869
there's one other thing like three

00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:37,150
different magic configuration parameters

00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:38,619
that had to be just so in order for in

00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:40,540
order for that field to work as an

00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:42,460
attribute field but eventually we

00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:44,770
realized that was just not usable at all

00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:46,690
nobody got it and we couldn't throw

00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:48,339
enough documentation video tutorials at

00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:49,839
it to make sense of it so I was like oh

00:39:48,339 --> 00:39:52,119
well we could just add a simple checkbox

00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:55,660
that says make this an attribute field

00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:57,580
and only show the checkbox for those for

00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:59,470
those cases where it where it's possible

00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:01,030
and whenever we realize that and made it

00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:03,190
explicitly suddenly stopped having

00:40:01,030 --> 00:40:06,010
support requests about how to add new

00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:08,680
attribute fuels to products so that was

00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:09,970
a case of using implicit magical

00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,130
behavior and then switching that too

00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:13,750
explicit configuration and making it

00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:15,130
much easier for site builders and store

00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:17,830
administrators to understand what's

00:40:15,130 --> 00:40:20,440
happening with their site so we want to

00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:22,620
continue to find those areas I'm not

00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:25,630
aware of any that are that are sort of

00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:27,040
common problems but if you are left it

00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:29,440
for you to come comment on the road map

00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:31,420
or adipose to the issue queue and let's

00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:33,490
continue to snuff these out and my hunch

00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:35,200
is that a lot of the sort of magical

00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:37,120
behavior and implicit functionality is

00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,650
at this point probably happening in some

00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,710
of the major contributed modules that

00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:43,240
people are using for commerce so I don't

00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:45,340
know all of those I'd love to hear from

00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:47,950
you where we can do better there and

00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:49,930
then finally on the last emphasis would

00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:52,720
be to to actually build and use robust

00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:54,850
internal ap is one of the things that

00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,340
happens in drupal module development is

00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:59,620
that we realize that that administrators

00:40:57,340 --> 00:41:02,680
are commonly interacting with our data

00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:04,870
through forms and so a lot of data

00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:07,450
manipulation saving updating deleting

00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:10,110
etc happens directly in form submit

00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:12,640
handlers or in form validation handlers

00:41:10,110 --> 00:41:14,800
the problem is if you then want to use

00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,290
that same code somewhere else say in a

00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,730
rules action you have to kind of copy

00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:20,980
and paste that code over to your rules

00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:22,720
code and then you know if somebody's

00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:24,850
riding a migration plugin then they may

00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,740
have to copy the same code etc and it

00:41:24,850 --> 00:41:29,200
kind of kind of just it does not serve

00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:31,330
our developers well to put all of this

00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:33,400
all of this data manipulation in these

00:41:31,330 --> 00:41:35,560
various callback functions much better

00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,350
would it be for commerce to have robust

00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:40,240
internal API is that you could then

00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:42,940
invoke from form submit handlers and

00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:45,070
from views plugins and from rules

00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:46,300
callbacks and all that stuff so one of

00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:48,850
the clear cases where this needs to

00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:50,680
happen is with the pricing API right now

00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:53,770
it's it's a pain for folks to write code

00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:56,170
that that directly manipulates prices

00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:58,510
because you can't just change the amount

00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:00,010
on the price field you also have to

00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:01,930
write a price component that kind of

00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:05,230
keeps everything in sync so that when

00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:07,000
you go to grab the total of an order you

00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:09,410
aren't left with that with a unit price

00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:11,870
on a line item that mismatches the

00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:14,030
total price and then isn't reflected in

00:42:11,870 --> 00:42:16,100
the order total night I guess that could

00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:18,290
have used a diagram but the idea is it's

00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:21,110
actually difficult to manipulate and

00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:23,660
customize product pricing right now but

00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:24,830
we can fix that with commerce to that X

00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,900
and there are other places where we can

00:42:24,830 --> 00:42:29,480
fix this as well and this will kind of

00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:31,640
tie back into the first emphasis which

00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,350
is Drupal commerce as a data conduit

00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,540
when you deal with them with web

00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:40,190
services requests and exposing your data

00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:42,470
in custom custom rest resources it helps

00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:44,090
to have that API ready so you don't then

00:42:42,470 --> 00:42:45,980
have to reproduce the code yet again and

00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:48,200
translate it into something that that

00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:51,290
your mobile app or web service or

00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:53,780
whatever it is can use alright so let's

00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:56,120
talk about actual tasks and integration

00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,950
that needs to happen in Drupal 8 i've

00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:00,170
already mentioned we have the entity

00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:01,580
reference feel so we'll drop thousands

00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:03,910
of lines of code from the product

00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:06,170
reference customer and lana two modules

00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:08,840
and we will just depend on that core

00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:11,390
field and then if we need to write

00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,890
widgets and for matters for them but if

00:43:11,390 --> 00:43:15,050
we depend on the inline into deform

00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:17,990
module we may not even have to write any

00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:20,000
custom widgets at all in fact one of our

00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:24,470
widgets got moved into Drupal 8 itself

00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:25,790
the hidden that the hidden form are the

00:43:24,470 --> 00:43:27,350
hidden widget or whatever would I can't

00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:30,770
remove the name of it but in Drupal 8

00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:32,240
you can have just a field that is not in

00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:33,890
the form at all by using the hidden

00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,960
widget well that came from Drupal

00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:37,370
commerce because some of our sites had

00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,370
product reference fields that literally

00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:42,170
referenced tens of thousands of products

00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:44,030
it's a gyro centers calms the prime use

00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:45,710
case and so we said well it's not going

00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:48,350
to work for them to have this HTML

00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:51,020
document that lists out 10,000 product

00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:52,790
IDs in a select list so we we just

00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:54,650
created this hidden widget for them now

00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,850
it's a part of core more code that will

00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:57,650
be able to remove from the product

00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:59,270
reference module and so it's really

00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:01,490
exciting to me to see just how much we

00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:04,010
will be able to get rid of again we'll

00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:05,390
have using core better into the API

00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:08,630
supporting course we'll be able to

00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:09,920
remove a lot of our helper functions and

00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:11,660
then we'll you know update all that

00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:14,060
stuff I'm actually have the shopping

00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:15,890
cart block and shopping cart form use

00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:18,290
vuze completely instead of using custom

00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:19,820
callbacks that just embed views so a lot

00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:21,740
of these things are in the roadmap there

00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:22,490
in the task list I encourage you to go

00:44:21,740 --> 00:44:24,260
and look at the task

00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:26,030
list and see if you know your pet issue

00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,920
is not represented because I'd love to

00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:30,560
hear from you and consider what we could

00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,060
do to to better address your concerns we

00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,740
also need to convert our Commerce data

00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:36,500
structures like taxes and check out

00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:38,720
pains to the core plug-in system and

00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:41,119
last but not least add a new entity type

00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,800
to Drupal commerce so Drupal commerce to

00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,260
that X will have the understanding of a

00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,970
store right now a store in Drupal

00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:48,500
commerce is really just the site and

00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:50,240
that makes it a challenge for people

00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,730
that are implementing multi-store cases

00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,660
like a marketplace site because it

00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:55,310
because you kind of have to then think

00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:57,380
well what what actually does represent

00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:59,750
the store and how do i do access control

00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:01,790
for products in this store or make sure

00:44:59,750 --> 00:45:03,050
that payment goes to the right person or

00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:05,690
make sure that products get grouped

00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:07,360
together logically so we're going to add

00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:10,160
the store in 2d type in some

00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:12,740
configuration for you to be able to to

00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:15,850
rig up that that multi store or multi

00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:18,080
seller ecommerce site more easily

00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:19,910
alright and then there are some existing

00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:22,070
areas inside of Drupal commerce that we

00:45:19,910 --> 00:45:23,930
will target for improvement let's just

00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:25,760
throw these all up on the screen so

00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:27,680
product hierarchy and group management

00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:30,560
I've already mentioned but we actually

00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:32,750
want to erase the the administrative

00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,910
complexity of managing products and

00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:36,890
product displays and we'll do that by

00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:39,050
actually allowing products but not

00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:41,150
requiring them to function as displays

00:45:39,050 --> 00:45:43,280
themselves and actually the function is

00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:46,790
as displays for an entire hierarchy of

00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:49,520
the product catalog so you can set up a

00:45:46,790 --> 00:45:50,869
product hierarchy that puts your

00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,720
attribute feels in there and will I

00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:55,880
guess sort of set a token pattern for

00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:57,830
skews and then create whole batches of

00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:59,630
products at once manage them all

00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:01,460
together and then sort of put on each

00:45:59,630 --> 00:46:03,530
individual product you know it's going

00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:06,170
to point to its parent product so you'll

00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:09,170
always know you know what what what

00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:11,390
front and URL 2.2 now a product wouldn't

00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:14,000
have to have a front end product display

00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:16,609
you can still have this sort of the

00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:18,410
existing model of all of my products are

00:46:16,609 --> 00:46:20,060
defined on the back end and i use the

00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:21,680
node to actually reference and display

00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:23,900
the product but we actually want to move

00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,640
more toward just using the product

00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:27,800
entity type itself to manage product

00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:29,540
displays and not requiring the

00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,369
separation and certainly making it

00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:32,930
easier to manage group so that there's

00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:35,150
an existing contribute called the bulk

00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:35,950
product creation module and that

00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:37,660
facilitates

00:46:35,950 --> 00:46:39,730
creating a whole group of products at

00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:41,349
once and then using the SKU patterns

00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:43,210
based on your attribute fields to get

00:46:41,349 --> 00:46:45,700
all the different variations created and

00:46:43,210 --> 00:46:48,730
tied to one display we want to solve

00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:51,520
that in core and I don't think it's on

00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:53,680
drupal.org yet but we do have some white

00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,780
board diagrams of things and ideas to

00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:58,240
make this happen but obviously looking

00:46:55,780 --> 00:47:01,030
for feedback on that as we push to

00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:03,099
implementation we also want to put the

00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:05,170
customizable products module into core

00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:07,060
so right now there is the Commerce

00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:09,339
underscore custom underscore product

00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:11,200
module that facilitates creating

00:47:09,339 --> 00:47:13,060
multiple product line item types and

00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,800
having those the sort of anonymous

00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:16,839
customizations that don't require a new

00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,339
SKU so when you think about registering

00:47:16,839 --> 00:47:20,530
for drupalcon you have to tell them if

00:47:18,339 --> 00:47:22,780
you're a vegetarian or you eat eat

00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:25,420
kosher eat halal or whatever it is that

00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:28,359
was a field on your registration line

00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:30,010
item type same for for hearing impaired

00:47:28,359 --> 00:47:32,020
speech impaired etc all those things

00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:33,670
were just feels on your line item type

00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:35,470
and we're saying that the product itself

00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:37,089
was the register d at the conference

00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:39,520
ticket but there were these other

00:47:37,089 --> 00:47:40,900
aspects of your registration that should

00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:43,060
have been tracked and managed alongside

00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:45,130
of your registration but didn't result

00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:47,819
in a different skew they weren't they

00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:50,200
didn't need to track inventory of of of

00:47:47,819 --> 00:47:52,839
magazine yeah you know it's separate

00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:55,569
anyways that is that that customizable

00:47:52,839 --> 00:47:59,079
products will be a core a much more

00:47:55,569 --> 00:48:01,089
improved core feature and and the goal

00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:02,530
there again is to reduce the

00:48:01,089 --> 00:48:05,560
administrative complexity of managing

00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:07,210
these sort of product kits or product

00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:09,520
building scenarios like the computer

00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:10,960
scenario you know choosing my hard drive

00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,180
choosing my display all that without

00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,790
requiring administrators to use

00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:18,069
thousands and thousands of skews if you

00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:20,050
don't need to based on how your your

00:48:18,069 --> 00:48:22,240
side is built we want to improve the

00:48:20,050 --> 00:48:25,060
checkout form and the Add to Cart forms

00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:28,210
on they aren't I guess maybe they

00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:29,380
degrade right now if javascript is

00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:32,440
disabled but it's a very ugly

00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:34,240
degradation it's not it's not it's not

00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,950
really working that great and we think

00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:38,829
we have some ideas to improve the core

00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:41,020
Ajax system to make it easier to embed

00:48:38,829 --> 00:48:42,280
actual buttons to trigger the updates

00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:45,099
instead of always depending on on

00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:46,690
changes and all that stuff so that's

00:48:45,099 --> 00:48:48,460
listed in the roadmap they're very

00:48:46,690 --> 00:48:49,190
assemble appoint some Freddy is to

00:48:48,460 --> 00:48:51,319
improve that

00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:52,819
also the Add to Cart form itself has

00:48:51,319 --> 00:48:55,369
anybody actually looked at the code for

00:48:52,819 --> 00:48:57,020
the Add to Cart form yeah I see some

00:48:55,369 --> 00:48:59,599
grins two right here that's like a

00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:01,130
thousand lines of code or something and

00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,319
that's because the form builder itself

00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:04,970
actually builds in a lot of that that

00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:06,470
awareness of all right what are my

00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:08,680
attribute fields how do I group the

00:49:06,470 --> 00:49:11,150
products in this group together so that

00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:13,069
my dependent attributes work properly

00:49:11,150 --> 00:49:15,500
and all that stuff like all that should

00:49:13,069 --> 00:49:18,020
really be an API function that the form

00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:20,750
is using to say if I given this set of

00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:22,430
products and this maybe map of chosen

00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:25,250
options you know how would you build

00:49:22,430 --> 00:49:27,710
this form so we really want to improve

00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:29,030
the API there and drastically reduce the

00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:31,609
footprint of that form because it can be

00:49:29,030 --> 00:49:32,930
quite a bear to to customize her to

00:49:31,609 --> 00:49:37,609
alter so that's been a pretty common

00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:39,619
complaint and I'm sorry also with

00:49:37,609 --> 00:49:42,079
payment methods many of you would be

00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:43,550
aware that in Drupal commerce we wanted

00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,589
to make sure that any payment method

00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:47,690
could be insane instantiated any number

00:49:45,589 --> 00:49:49,520
of times so with uber card I had it so

00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:51,050
that you configured a payment module and

00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:53,599
that was it you could have that appear

00:49:51,050 --> 00:49:55,460
or not appear on the checkout form or on

00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:57,170
the order administration form but what

00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:59,089
if you needed two different sets of API

00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:00,890
credentials well at the time you just

00:49:59,089 --> 00:50:02,780
would have had to like copy the module

00:50:00,890 --> 00:50:04,250
rename all the functions and then sort

00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:05,420
of have a separate payment method that

00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:07,160
was really just the same thing which is

00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:09,020
kind of rename but here we've actually

00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:12,290
used rules to say you can instantiate

00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:14,510
any different number of paypal website

00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:16,910
payment standard instances so maybe you

00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:18,380
have one account for regular

00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:20,390
transactions one account for micro

00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:22,190
transactions you could actually use the

00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:24,140
rules module to decide which one appears

00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:26,089
on the checkout form so you can actually

00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:28,700
swap in API credentials based on any

00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:31,250
aspect of the order or even change the

00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:33,349
payment method entirely so we do this a

00:50:31,250 --> 00:50:35,150
lot in Europe where we have one payment

00:50:33,349 --> 00:50:37,490
gateway for France one for Germany one

00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:39,410
for the UK and then maybe 14 everywhere

00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:40,910
else in the world that kind of thing was

00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:42,290
facilitated through rules and through

00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:44,450
the way that we built the payment system

00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:46,670
but it turns out that storing your

00:50:44,450 --> 00:50:48,619
payment method configuration in rules

00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:51,619
actions makes it really difficult to get

00:50:48,619 --> 00:50:53,240
at so it's hard to it's hard to alter

00:50:51,619 --> 00:50:55,099
that stuff for example because there is

00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:56,480
no like real clear point where we're

00:50:55,099 --> 00:50:58,700
loading the data from the database with

00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,740
a natural place to invoke an altar hook

00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:02,359
so we want to address that and make it

00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:03,050
function more like the shipping module

00:51:02,359 --> 00:51:05,090
does

00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:06,920
so with my flat rate shipping module you

00:51:05,090 --> 00:51:08,960
define your flat rate services in one

00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:11,000
place and then you just use rules to

00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:13,580
turn on a particular flat rate service

00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:15,470
so we want to be able to say define your

00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:17,600
payment methods in one place and then

00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:20,510
use rules to turn it on so you can still

00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:22,460
have any number of instances but where

00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:25,580
and how you manage that configuration is

00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:27,560
one easier for merchants and then to

00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:29,810
also mom I guess better to work with

00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:31,400
from a data standpoint will address some

00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:32,690
currency and address formatting issues

00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,520
those are listed out in the road map

00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:35,870
will certainly address as I've already

00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:37,970
mentioned pricing rules and the

00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:39,170
complexity involved they're basically

00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:40,400
saying that if you aren't using pre

00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:42,980
calculation there's no reason you

00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,720
shouldn't have a hook to directly

00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:48,200
manipulate product prices so let's let

00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:49,910
that happen and then finally we'll

00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,010
actually finish our full revision

00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:54,260
support and introduce the concept of

00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:56,270
revision tagging so even though we have

00:51:54,260 --> 00:51:57,740
you know in order revision for every

00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:59,270
step of the checkout process it's

00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:01,010
actually difficult to come back at a

00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:02,630
later time and say when did this

00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:05,060
customer actually complete check out

00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:07,640
because you don't actually have good

00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:09,080
insight into the different revision time

00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:11,180
stamps and what changed from one

00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:13,430
revision to the next so it's hard to say

00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:15,920
well did the order status change to

00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:17,990
commerce or to check out complete and

00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,100
then depending and what was the time Sam

00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:21,560
from that and how do I get at that data

00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:23,720
that that's actually difficult to manage

00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:25,520
right now so we want to actually sort of

00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:28,070
evaluate the concept of tagging

00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:30,590
revisions so that we have just a sort of

00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:32,570
single abstract API to the tag product

00:52:30,590 --> 00:52:35,000
and order and customer profile revisions

00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:37,430
for use and an easy reference at a later

00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,600
point in time and so then the last

00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:41,060
question I'll answer is where do you fit

00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:42,140
in basically I'll say that if you're

00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:44,240
interested in contributing to

00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:46,730
development let's talk after the session

00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:48,110
whether in here at the booth I'd love to

00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:50,240
get your feedback I'd love for you to

00:52:48,110 --> 00:52:52,910
read the roadmap it's at Drupal Commerce

00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:55,400
org slash roadmap and see what's missing

00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:58,070
from your experience and see how we can

00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:59,510
better serve those for emphasis what are

00:52:58,070 --> 00:53:01,820
ways that we can make Drupal function

00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:03,530
better as a data conduit what a ways

00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:06,140
that we can build and use robust

00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:08,120
internal ap is how can we solve the

00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:11,180
common configuration and development

00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:12,230
sort of problems and then I can't

00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:13,319
remember the fourth but I'm sure was

00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:15,479
good

00:53:13,319 --> 00:53:18,119
so let's talk about how we can get more

00:53:15,479 --> 00:53:20,699
broadly apply those things more more

00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:23,339
more specifically take advantage of the

00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:24,509
Drupal 8 api's I only know so much of

00:53:23,339 --> 00:53:25,559
what's going on and I'm sure that there

00:53:24,509 --> 00:53:27,239
are many of you in the room that no more

00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:29,099
of different parts there than I do so

00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:30,959
I'd love to hear from you and then

00:53:29,099 --> 00:53:32,940
finally if you have actually used drupal

00:53:30,959 --> 00:53:34,469
commerce yet I'd love for you to give

00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:36,239
kickstart to a try so you can use my

00:53:34,469 --> 00:53:39,089
computer you can use the booth computers

00:53:36,239 --> 00:53:40,619
and just get to know you know how it

00:53:39,089 --> 00:53:43,469
works we'd love to hear what you think

00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:46,289
and certainly we'd love to see you using

00:53:43,469 --> 00:53:49,380
the marketplace to launch new stores you

00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:51,959
know quickly happily funnily whatever I

00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:53,690
intend to do it here soon for real milk

00:53:51,959 --> 00:53:56,910
cheese and then also some other local

00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:58,380
local merchants there in Greenville and

00:53:56,910 --> 00:54:02,430
you know I'm always on the lookout for

00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:04,619
my next ecommerce site idea so let's go

00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:06,839
on to Q&A time we do have a microphone

00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:08,759
here that you can use are there are

00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:10,619
there any questions about roadmap or

00:54:08,759 --> 00:54:15,170
about kickstart functionality or

00:54:10,619 --> 00:54:15,170
anything else that I may have mentioned

00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:25,339
if not it wouldn't hurt my feelings if

00:54:18,049 --> 00:54:27,959
so it wouldn't mean it hello hi hi um so

00:54:25,339 --> 00:54:30,569
I've taken a look at commerce kickstart

00:54:27,959 --> 00:54:32,940
I I really like the flexibility of

00:54:30,569 --> 00:54:35,339
Commerce and how it can apply to

00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:40,079
different business models I looked at

00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:42,390
kickstart as a means to sort of derive

00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:46,769
what the best practices are for commerce

00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:48,239
yeah and one thing and I think this is

00:54:46,769 --> 00:54:50,369
the first I've heard of the product

00:54:48,239 --> 00:54:51,839
hierarchies okay and so I think this

00:54:50,369 --> 00:54:54,630
question is going to pertain to that but

00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:58,979
one thing that struck me as odd was it

00:54:54,630 --> 00:55:00,690
seemed as though commerce was there was

00:54:58,979 --> 00:55:04,079
a lot of coupling between products and

00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:07,410
notes yeah and commerce was using nodes

00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:11,089
as a rendering engine for the products

00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:14,069
mhm and in order to facilitate that

00:55:11,089 --> 00:55:18,359
there was a lot of sugar that kicks

00:55:14,069 --> 00:55:20,190
start added to Drupal to sort of make

00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:22,650
sense of that process yeah so one

00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:26,880
example is if you go to look at node

00:55:22,650 --> 00:55:29,220
entities there is a column that is added

00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:31,859
product displays yeah with a flag yes or

00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:35,369
no yeah so you can sort of see you know

00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:38,309
their products are adding sort of a mess

00:55:35,369 --> 00:55:39,990
of entities too I'm not only looking at

00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:42,000
nodes and sort of also dealing we're in

00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:43,769
commerce and with products and so I'm

00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,170
just wondering if that's going to be

00:55:43,769 --> 00:55:49,170
addressed yeah that's that's gonna stay

00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:50,160
if hierarchies are involved or dealing

00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:52,380
with that if yeah that's that's

00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,720
basically why we decided to go with this

00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:56,970
concept of product hierarchies and using

00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,650
like the top of the hierarchy the top of

00:55:56,970 --> 00:56:00,180
the pyramid as the display directly

00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:04,019
instead of using a separate entity type

00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:05,609
was because kickstart it was our first

00:56:04,019 --> 00:56:08,039
pass at how to make it more

00:56:05,609 --> 00:56:13,470
understandable and it's resulted in more

00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:15,630
confusion because we we kind of erased

00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:17,640
the distinction between a product type

00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:18,809
and a node type within kickstarts that

00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,829
we were treating them very close

00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:21,359
together like you said it's just the

00:56:19,829 --> 00:56:24,089
sugar that that couples them together

00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:26,970
even to the point of changing the the

00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:28,829
admin UI of the content type screen and

00:56:26,970 --> 00:56:31,920
moving menus around and adding you know

00:56:28,829 --> 00:56:33,329
options to the form so our thought there

00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:35,519
was well maybe we can just erase the

00:56:33,329 --> 00:56:37,109
distinction entirely and make it easier

00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:38,730
for merchants because they'll just have

00:56:37,109 --> 00:56:40,680
to go create their new page or create a

00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:41,819
new product type or something and do all

00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,099
this stuff in the background but that

00:56:41,819 --> 00:56:46,289
that was like you know semi magic

00:56:44,099 --> 00:56:47,250
implicit behavior we're trying to get

00:56:46,289 --> 00:56:50,640
rid of that with the explicit

00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:52,019
configuration so I didn't prepare

00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:53,970
anything in the slides it actually shows

00:56:52,019 --> 00:56:56,789
how we conceive of the hierarchy working

00:56:53,970 --> 00:56:58,829
the configuration for that working but I

00:56:56,789 --> 00:57:00,509
do have that if you're curious to look

00:56:58,829 --> 00:57:05,190
at it afterwards some I am thank you

00:57:00,509 --> 00:57:08,009
great any plans for their bit of the

00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:10,140
ability to do one page checkout yeah so

00:57:08,009 --> 00:57:11,430
I mean I guess maybe I need to know

00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:13,319
something more from you and that is how

00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:15,539
does it not do one page checkout now is

00:57:13,319 --> 00:57:16,980
it not okay of this point I thought that

00:57:15,539 --> 00:57:19,440
you couldn't do it oh yeah no no you can

00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:21,450
so within drupal commerce you have a

00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:24,000
drag-and-drop checkout form builder the

00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:25,380
default yeah the default configuration

00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,839
is to use multiple pages but you can

00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:31,250
make it work on one page we use the sort

00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:34,140
of two step thing by default because the

00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:35,759
sort of like cart contents part of the

00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:37,990
checkout form doesn't update to show

00:57:35,759 --> 00:57:39,250
taxes like as you enter an address

00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:40,960
when the review page gives us that

00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:42,850
opportunity to show oh and taxes were

00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,290
added to order by the way and then have

00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:47,170
the point that a point of departure for

00:57:44,290 --> 00:57:48,400
payment but some so maybe there's some

00:57:47,170 --> 00:57:50,110
stuff that we can do to make sure that

00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,510
the checkout form is is updating itself

00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:54,490
as addresses are being entered but you

00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:57,040
know a good a good example that would be

00:57:54,490 --> 00:57:59,020
the shipping module does support like on

00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:01,000
page recalculation of shipping services

00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:02,530
as you put in your address so if we

00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,630
duplicated that perhaps for the cart

00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:07,540
contents and taxes you could have you

00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:09,130
know a fully one page checkout form but

00:58:07,540 --> 00:58:11,080
so it so it more or less does right now

00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:12,250
but depending on the type of things

00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:14,650
you're doing in the checkout process

00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:16,600
maybe it doesn't work for you so maybe

00:58:14,650 --> 00:58:21,310
we can do it better in my press mr.

00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:23,410
stain one point yeah thanks so a lot of

00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:24,640
the 2x features look great and they look

00:58:23,410 --> 00:58:26,020
like they're going to alleviate a lot of

00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:29,140
point out points of friction I've

00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:30,970
experienced with 1 dot x the inevitable

00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:32,619
question is what's the upgrade path

00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:35,230
going to look like is is there gonna be

00:58:32,619 --> 00:58:38,740
one or wednesday i'm trying to find

00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:41,320
something to field that question is the

00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:43,300
date or even is the data modeling

00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:45,340
structure gonna be really significantly

00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:47,950
different like what can you just comment

00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:49,540
a little bit to that yeah I mean I last

00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:52,420
I heard Drupal 8 wasn't even going to

00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:54,070
have like an upgrade path meaning

00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:56,560
instead of trying to do everything

00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:58,450
through update hooks let's start to

00:58:56,560 --> 00:59:01,270
treat updating from one major version to

00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:03,940
the next as a migration so in that

00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:05,440
regard I would view moving from a Drupal

00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:09,460
7 commerce site to Drupal 8 with

00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:11,290
commerce as a migration the the basic

00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:13,030
data model of we have these five entity

00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:14,890
types will actually have six and two but

00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:16,810
we have these entity types and they have

00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:18,970
certain properties and feels that's not

00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:20,290
going to change I don't know if the

00:59:18,970 --> 00:59:22,330
field schema has changed significantly

00:59:20,290 --> 00:59:24,520
for Drupal 8 or if it's just the API

00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:27,369
that has changed but but a lot of the

00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:29,250
the data storage should be very close to

00:59:27,369 --> 00:59:31,810
similar so the upgrade path could be

00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:33,040
easy but I but I don't even know what

00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:34,420
it's going to look like from Drupal 7 to

00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:37,450
Drew plate without commerce so I can't

00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:39,119
really say that the biggest the biggest

00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:41,230
departure of course is going to be this

00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:43,840
idea that you'll no longer have to have

00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:45,580
an ode to display a product but that's

00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:47,740
not to say you couldn't still do that so

00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:49,390
maybe what we end up doing is all of the

00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:51,770
stuff that we do now for product field

00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:53,720
injection I don't I don't see me

00:59:51,770 --> 00:59:56,000
for us to necessarily remove that from

00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:58,580
core so maybe maybe we still just

00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,950
support on Drupal 8 at the ability to

00:59:58,580 --> 01:00:02,510
embed product entities into notes and

01:00:00,950 --> 01:00:04,850
have all the field injection all that

01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:06,380
stuff work just like it did before but

01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:08,030
but then also introduced the new way to

01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:09,740
do it without deprecating the old way

01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:10,760
tight there's no reason we couldn't do

01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:12,620
that the codes already written it

01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,730
already works and I assume the data

01:00:12,620 --> 01:00:15,560
model is going to be similar enough to

01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:19,960
accomplish that and probably even even

01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:22,940
easier so I'm in through I'm a

01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:27,440
optimistic optimistic but I don't have

01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:30,620
any hard answers yeah yeah I know is

01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:32,990
Risa kind of briefly addressed but with

01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:35,420
the mobile application that you're

01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:37,550
you're talking about is that something

01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:40,190
where we are going to just say hey

01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:42,020
here's a connection into my my site and

01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:43,310
then just tell everyone hey go download

01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:45,410
this or is that something that we can

01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:48,560
take and customize on our own and extend

01:00:45,410 --> 01:00:49,610
further to then release yeah so yeah I

01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:52,190
didn't catch any of that yeah I mean

01:00:49,610 --> 01:00:53,830
right now commerce guys is basically

01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:56,780
functioning as the actual software

01:00:53,830 --> 01:00:59,390
publisher for the mobile apps so we have

01:00:56,780 --> 01:01:01,010
our Apple Developer account we control

01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:02,990
the code it's titanium appcelerator code

01:01:01,010 --> 01:01:04,250
and we will actually compile the apps

01:01:02,990 --> 01:01:06,680
and publish them in the App Store on

01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:08,480
behalf of the merchant all of the Drupal

01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:10,460
side code is on drupal.org so commerce

01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:12,110
services that the necessary

01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:13,790
configuration to make sure that the in

01:01:12,110 --> 01:01:15,680
points are there that the app can talk

01:01:13,790 --> 01:01:18,860
to all that stuff is on drupal.org

01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:20,150
itself but the the app itself wouldn't

01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:22,250
be something that you just go grab and

01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:23,360
compile and fiddle with but that is

01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:25,820
something to talk about it's just not

01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:31,010
something we've explored yet okay so go

01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:33,970
ahead eggs yeah two unrelated follow-up

01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:36,340
questions one the single page check out

01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:39,350
if you're using certain payment

01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:41,990
processors like say authorize net it's

01:01:39,350 --> 01:01:44,000
my understanding that you can't have

01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:48,950
anything that's going to throw a

01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:51,590
validation issue in any of the other

01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:53,420
forms besides authorize.net your daily

01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:54,710
exciting Commerce one not six but I know

01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:58,010
another problem you're talking about but

01:01:54,710 --> 01:02:01,130
I'm pretty sure that's been fixed so so

01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:03,170
you can have that exactly if there was

01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:04,880
an error of a validation error on one of

01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:05,670
the other check out pains then we no

01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:07,680
longer

01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:09,270
him to submit the payment pain so it

01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,549
actually looks informs that it tries to

01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:12,960
find any errors and in halts the one

01:02:11,549 --> 01:02:14,849
page checkout form submission if it

01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,710
finds something so you don't have those

01:02:14,849 --> 01:02:18,180
like bunk bogus transactions coming

01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:20,640
through anymore so is that is that a

01:02:18,180 --> 01:02:22,140
property of the authorize.net payment

01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:25,020
module no it's just part of core

01:02:22,140 --> 01:02:27,720
commerce itself now but this is pretty

01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:30,000
recent so it's not yeah we'll go back

01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:32,640
and make sure we got the latest and

01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,950
greatest cool um okay and then the other

01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:37,829
was I thought I remember from a year or

01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:39,809
two back the idea of one of the ideas of

01:02:37,829 --> 01:02:41,990
having no displays separate from

01:02:39,809 --> 01:02:45,180
products was that would facilitate

01:02:41,990 --> 01:02:47,250
multilingual sites yes is that is that

01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:51,089
something that developments in Drupal

01:02:47,250 --> 01:02:53,099
core has made a less of an issue or is

01:02:51,089 --> 01:02:54,660
that yes certainly certainly in Drupal 8

01:02:53,099 --> 01:02:56,339
it will be much less of an issue that

01:02:54,660 --> 01:02:59,460
the big reason that we did that was an

01:02:56,339 --> 01:03:01,020
uber cart we had products as nodes and

01:02:59,460 --> 01:03:02,160
if you want to do multilingual you

01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:03,329
actually ended up with a separate

01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:05,190
instance of the node and they were just

01:03:03,329 --> 01:03:06,599
sort of like related together and so

01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:08,010
since all of your price and product data

01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:10,349
was on the note itself you then ended up

01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:11,819
with synchronization issues because in

01:03:10,349 --> 01:03:13,410
duplicating the node to translate the

01:03:11,819 --> 01:03:15,420
title in the body you also duplicated

01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:16,890
all of the e-commerce data and so that

01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:18,990
was the initial impetus for separating

01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:20,280
out the product data from the point of

01:03:18,990 --> 01:03:22,619
display there are other reasons as well

01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:25,890
like stock control and and other things

01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:26,970
but but you know with with Drupal 8 and

01:03:25,890 --> 01:03:28,500
with the advances in the entity

01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:31,740
translation and field translation

01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:33,960
systems display exposing the product

01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:36,299
entity itself should no longer be an

01:03:33,960 --> 01:03:38,790
issue when it comes to the localization

01:03:36,299 --> 01:03:41,040
multi-currency and all that stuff which

01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:43,530
is good yeah well thanks yeah thanks for

01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:44,910
the question all right I'll do these

01:03:43,530 --> 01:03:49,099
last two guys and then we'll take out

01:03:44,910 --> 01:03:52,589
okay do you have if pricing is in

01:03:49,099 --> 01:03:56,250
client's ERP or if you don't know that

01:03:52,589 --> 01:03:58,799
is accounting system is there a API that

01:03:56,250 --> 01:04:01,140
I can take that information and bring it

01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:03,150
into commerce and then deal with that is

01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:04,829
there a separation between their

01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:07,740
database of their pricing and their

01:04:04,829 --> 01:04:09,240
products and the presentation and the on

01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:11,040
the website I mean honestly it just

01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:12,299
really depends on the system I don't

01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:14,160
know how to answer that at a sort of

01:04:12,299 --> 01:04:16,349
abstract level like it just depends does

01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:18,540
does the ERP system have an API that you

01:04:16,349 --> 01:04:19,140
can consume remotely are you going to

01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:21,330
have to push the

01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:23,250
to the site from the ERP system i mean

01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:24,390
that that stuff as possible and probably

01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:26,430
the best person to talk to would be

01:04:24,390 --> 01:04:27,390
Peter Phillip and I don't think I've

01:04:26,430 --> 01:04:29,190
seen him in here but he's the guy that

01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:31,200
built euro centers and they literally

01:04:29,190 --> 01:04:33,860
mansion about a they literally manage

01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:36,660
about a million products and 1600 rules

01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:38,670
remotely compile them into sort of like

01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:40,200
csv export and then put that all into

01:04:38,670 --> 01:04:42,000
the drupal site using feeds to keep

01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:44,310
those things synchronized so technically

01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,260
it's possible absolutely erp system

01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:49,260
provides that information yeah flow on a

01:04:46,260 --> 01:04:53,040
absolutely network okay yeah and last

01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:56,700
one and then we'll take on are there any

01:04:53,040 --> 01:05:01,320
plans or anyone working on a way to add

01:04:56,700 --> 01:05:04,770
coupons simpler Lee that's okay

01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:06,510
similarly um to commerce I guess the

01:05:04,770 --> 01:05:07,770
question is just like what we just have

01:05:06,510 --> 01:05:09,090
to know what's difficult about it no and

01:05:07,770 --> 01:05:11,720
how to make it easy I mean for instance

01:05:09,090 --> 01:05:15,330
if you wanted to add the ability to add

01:05:11,720 --> 01:05:17,640
coupons on particular products yes all

01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:20,070
four modules using people Ocalan rules

01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:22,410
and know that yeah the special steps on

01:05:20,070 --> 01:05:24,060
the coupon code by reference mom yeah I

01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:25,560
mean like what part of that was done via

01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:29,010
commerce kickstart in the Commerce

01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:30,420
discount module but it's not finished so

01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:34,040
it's actually actively being developed

01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:36,600
on drupal commerce deferred for Drupal 7

01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:38,010
and I don't I don't know exactly what

01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:40,350
needs to change about that for Drupal 8

01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:41,790
but the guy that maintains coupon is

01:05:40,350 --> 01:05:44,520
actually here he's from commerce guys

01:05:41,790 --> 01:05:45,750
his name is Pedro and he works out of

01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:48,090
our London office I don't think he's in

01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:50,670
this room not he's not in this room he

01:05:48,090 --> 01:05:51,630
had better places to be but come fine

01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:53,190
about the boost that I'm sure he'd be

01:05:51,630 --> 01:05:55,140
happy to talk about roadmap and how to

01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:56,280
improve it okay thinking all right

01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:58,370
thanks everyone for your time have a

01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:58,370
good
