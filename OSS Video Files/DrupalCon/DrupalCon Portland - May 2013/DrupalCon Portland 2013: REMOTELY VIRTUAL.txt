Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: REMOTELY VIRTUAL
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	Drupal runs on virtual teams. The Drupal project itself is a virtual team project. Many Drupal shops have at least some remote employees. Enterprises that want to bring Drupal in-house are finding that a good way to get top-notch Drupal talent is to allow employees to work remotely. Drupal sites everywhere are being constructed by virtual teams that include both in-house employees and remote contractors. In every possible way, Drupal runs on virtual.

But there are challenges to building effective virtual teams. Project stakeholders have to understand and overcome the challenges while taking full advantage of the benefits. Team leaders need different techniques to manage a virtual project. Team members have to learn how to work effectively in a virtual team. Nothing about it is automatic.

The goal of this session is to help project owners understand how to use virtual teams more effectively, and help contractors and employees understand how to benefit from and contribute to the success of a virtual team. If you are leading or participating in a virtual team now, or are trying to create a new virtual team, or you just want to make a case that you can be effective as a remote employee, this session is for you.

Some of the topics we'll cover:

Benefits of virtual teams, for both companies and team members
Potential problems with virtual teams
Building rapport when you're not in the same room
Staying in touch vs information overload
Mixing timezones, cultures, and languages
Tips for running virtual meetings
Tools that help make virtual teams effective
Stories and examples of making it work

I think we're going to go ahead and get

00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,870
rural in here I'm sure people are still

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,690
still coming in from lunch but we'll go

00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,880
ahead and get started so the session is

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,849
remotely virtual which is about remote

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,710
teams or virtual teams so if that's not

00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:20,490
what you thought you were coming to you

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:24,199
can leave if you want to I'm Karen

00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:29,310
Stevenson and let's let's go ahead and

00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:31,980
talk about this i am i'm a been involved

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:36,840
with drupal since well for about seven

00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:40,950
years and I in the co maintainer of cck

00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:46,920
and maintainer of date and calendar and

00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:48,539
a bunch of other things like that so

00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,120
that so that's how I got connected to

00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,120
Drupal I work for lullaby consulting

00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,210
we're a big Drupal shop we do a lot of

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,770
training we do a lot of consulting and

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,890
we do a lot of web development work

00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,619
front-end back-end design and everything

00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:06,479
else and lots of big lots of big sites

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:11,580
that we've worked on Martha Stewart and

00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:15,360
Grammys calm and WWE and lots of others

00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:17,220
as well so this man right here is my

00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,090
great-grandfather he's the first cat

00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,090
herder in our family

00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:27,830
burden cats don't let anybody tell you

00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:30,080
it's easy anybody can hurt cattle hold

00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:31,820
them together 10,000 half mile short

00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:34,040
hairs how about some other thing all

00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,050
together being a cat herders probably

00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,240
about the toughest thing I think I've

00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:41,920
ever done I got this one this morning

00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:45,200
right here and if you look at his face

00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,270
it is ripped to shreds you know to see

00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:51,770
the movies yet to hear the stories

00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:54,470
that's I'm living a dream not everyone

00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:57,440
can do what we do I wouldn't do nothing

00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:59,090
else it ain't an easy job but when you

00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,190
bring a hurt into town and ain't lost

00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:03,460
the one of them ain't no feeling like it

00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,460
in the world

00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:12,220
all right I love that commercial herding

00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:15,790
cats so does managing a remote team feel

00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:20,290
a little bit like herding cats yes it

00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:22,030
does so let's let's start people throw

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,410
around the terms of virtual and remote

00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,940
kind of interchangeably but they're

00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,860
really not the same thing so let's talk

00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:30,280
about terminology for just a second so

00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:32,110
virtual means something that doesn't

00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,910
really exist right something that's sort

00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:38,260
of simulating are pretending to be

00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:40,959
something else and remote means things

00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:46,540
that are far away something that's not

00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:48,220
close so for instance Drupal is the

00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,739
Drupal community is a virtual team

00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:53,410
they're a Drupal is not a company that

00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:55,630
you can join you can't you can't get

00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:58,930
hired at Drupal you can't get fired by

00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:01,330
drupal you decide to be a part of it and

00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:04,690
and Drupal can't do anything about it

00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:07,510
more or less so that's a virtual team

00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,579
and we obviously have remote members on

00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,200
this team they're very international

00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:13,600
it's all over the all over the world I

00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,630
used to when when people ask what I did

00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:18,670
I used to say I am a remote employee on

00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,560
a virtual company but that's not

00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,570
actually true because blow bud is not

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:25,239
really a virtual company it's it's a

00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,160
real company but we do have remote

00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:28,750
employees in fact that's all we have is

00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,329
remote employees so it's kind of unusual

00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:34,000
in the sense that we don't really have

00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:37,170
anybody who's not remote unlike a lot of

00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,660
teams where remote is kind of the

00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:45,239
exception at lolla but remote is is what

00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:47,680
everybody is and then low about intern

00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,890
participates in virtual project teams

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,170
with lots of other people so we we work

00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,510
with a client and we end up with a

00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,489
project team that is partly comprised of

00:03:55,510 --> 00:04:00,340
Drupal of our lull about people and

00:03:57,489 --> 00:04:02,500
partly comprised of people from the

00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,859
client that we're working with and in

00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,120
some cases another vendor is involved in

00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:10,030
some cases there are multiple

00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,000
departments from the other from the

00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,669
client or whatever so we end up on a lot

00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,120
of these virtual teams so again that's

00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:17,859
that

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,079
that's a team of people that's come

00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:21,940
together for a purpose but there you

00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,760
know that that's where the virtual comes

00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,530
in and and it has remote members so

00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:31,620
we've got a lot of kind of variations of

00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:34,990
all of this so who exactly is remote

00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,780
well the obvious answer is you've got an

00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:40,030
in-house team and you've got remote

00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,800
contractors so a company might have

00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,250
remote contractors that they bring in to

00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,690
do certain things like work on a website

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:48,550
you can have a company that has a remote

00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:51,160
employees so maybe there are individual

00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:55,120
employees in the company that work from

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,590
home or work from some place that's not

00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,229
the same place that everybody else works

00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,880
with you can have remote offices and

00:04:59,229 --> 00:05:02,320
remote offices are interesting because

00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,850
people a lot of times you don't think

00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,350
about remote offices when they talk

00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,330
about remote employees but a remote

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,979
office is sort of this in the same boat

00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,229
as a remote employee a lot of times

00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:14,139
they're kind of the forgotten stepchild

00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:15,280
that kind of is out of the loop and

00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:19,030
doesn't know what's going on at the

00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,800
mothership and i would i would say that

00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:22,389
it even goes a little farther than that

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,740
because if you've got people who are

00:05:22,389 --> 00:05:25,539
working while they're traveling you've

00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,580
got people who are temporarily remote

00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:29,590
and they need they need to be able to

00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,030
function and do their job but they're

00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,729
not connected they don't have the

00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:35,349
connection you can have people that are

00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:37,690
working from home during emergencies and

00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:40,450
that could be either the emergency of

00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,800
the employee you know my kid is sick and

00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,510
I don't have a babysitter I'm going to

00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,930
have to work from home today or it could

00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:49,780
be we've had a blizzard and and I can't

00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:52,330
get I can't get to work or it could be

00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:54,910
something's happened at work and I in

00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:58,720
work isn't there and I've got to work

00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:00,550
from home and you can have open source

00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,770
and joint venture projects which kind of

00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,110
where drupal falls in right that you've

00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:07,599
got this virtual community of people

00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:11,919
that's working together on a mutual

00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:13,840
project and I would venture I would

00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:17,169
actually say that you can even take it a

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,690
step further there is research now that

00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:21,039
says that even you know you've got

00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:23,349
you've got companies where people are

00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:25,570
working in different buildings and those

00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:27,909
people may be somewhat remote from each

00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:28,700
other there's actually research that

00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:30,710
says

00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,480
teams that have members in the same

00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:35,060
building but just on different floors

00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,610
actually have some of the same kinds of

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:40,220
problems that distributed teams across

00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,570
the country have because you know if

00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,790
you're not there if you're not right in

00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:48,800
front of everybody that's a little

00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:50,450
different so many teams have remote

00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,790
elements probably more teams than

00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:54,470
anybody really realizes because if if

00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:58,220
somebody says you know we don't we don't

00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:59,570
have remote in our company most likely

00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,370
you have one of these things the only

00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:03,440
people that really only companies that

00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:06,530
really don't have any remote employees

00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,000
at all would be a very small company

00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,280
where everybody is physically in the

00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,040
same location and you never work with

00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:16,730
anybody else and that's probably not

00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:18,920
that many so if you go back to kind of

00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:21,290
the traditional idea of you know remote

00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,990
means people are working from home they

00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:25,340
work from wherever they are of the

00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:27,500
benefits are obvious right you've got

00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,260
access to the best talent wherever that

00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:33,050
that talent maybe gives you a wider pool

00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:34,760
of employees your employees have more of

00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,890
a global perspective it's not just this

00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,350
narrow little group of people that work

00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:41,570
right where you do they may be more

00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:43,520
productive and more available because

00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,890
they're not commuting they're not

00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,780
wasting their time doing this that kind

00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:50,750
of thing and they may be less expensive

00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,550
because you don't have to pay for a desk

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:55,250
in an office building they're they're

00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:58,730
working from home so there's a lot of

00:07:55,250 --> 00:08:00,320
benefits what's coming into play more

00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,810
and more as employers are beginning to

00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,720
realize that having the ability for

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:07,100
people to work remotely is is actually

00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:11,150
kind of business interruption insurance

00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:13,910
a client that I work with you know the

00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:15,770
hurricane sandy how many businesses were

00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,350
unable to work in New York City after

00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:21,310
Hurricane sandy and those that were

00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:23,420
already set up with the capability of

00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:25,010
allowing people to work remotely were

00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:27,650
able to continue to do business as

00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:30,860
normal even though their offices were

00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:32,150
actually shut down so it turned out to

00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,380
be kind of business interruption

00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:38,960
insurance so there's some employers that

00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:40,670
don't embrace this idea of remote

00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,260
employees there's been a lot of

00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:44,540
discussion about what does this

00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,300
that yahoo said we don't want people

00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,560
working from home and I don't think

00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,780
personally I don't I don't see that as

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,420
any kind of like a smear on the idea of

00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,770
working remotely I think yahoo is just a

00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,670
special case they've got their own

00:08:54,770 --> 00:09:00,680
reasons for doing what they do and

00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:02,420
wanting to do what they want to do and I

00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:06,110
don't think in any way shape or form it

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,670
means that remote work is going away or

00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:09,670
it's not important or there's a new

00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:13,360
trend coming or anything like that it's

00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:15,500
it's just their particular situation

00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,420
there's a lot of things that employees

00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,920
love about it you got a flexible

00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,350
schedule you've got the ability to do

00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,140
some work life balance you don't have

00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:28,640
commuting you got fewer interruptions

00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:32,600
those things are great but it comes with

00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,610
responsibility so you can't just be a

00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,900
remote employee and just say you know

00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,660
I'm going to do whatever I want to do

00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,760
you be you have some responsibilities

00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,560
that come with it so I I've come up with

00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:44,150
like my five Commandments for team

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,090
members there's probably more than 5 but

00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:50,780
5 seems like a nice number so you will

00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:52,130
spend much time on the phone one of the

00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,450
things we tell people when they come to

00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,190
work for a lull about for the first time

00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:58,160
if they haven't been especially if they

00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:00,350
haven't worked remotely before is be

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,150
sure you get yourself a new phone plan

00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:04,100
because you are going to be on the phone

00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:07,250
a lot and I think almost everybody

00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:09,650
doesn't believe that enough and ends up

00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,000
with like a $500,000 phone bill the

00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:12,170
first month that they're working and

00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,870
then they're going oh my god you really

00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:17,440
meant it yeah yeah we really mean it

00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:20,890
you're going to be on the phone a lot

00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:24,230
you have to be visible and accessible

00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:27,080
you cannot just drop into a black hole

00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:30,110
and disappear that's that won't work and

00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:32,210
in fact when we have people like that

00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,590
and sometimes this happens you get

00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:36,140
somebody a remote team who just doesn't

00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:37,970
get how do you work remotely and they do

00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:39,620
just sort of disappear during the day

00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,410
and you know maybe throw some code over

00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,120
the wall every once in a while it

00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:46,910
doesn't work you can't you can't

00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,070
function that way part of the agreement

00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,810
for somebody to be in a remote employee

00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:53,360
is they have to understand that you have

00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,400
responsibilities so you can't and you

00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,890
can't disappear with

00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,020
explanation you can disappear everybody

00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:00,520
can't always be visible everywhere but

00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:04,780
you've got to let people know what's

00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:07,300
going on you must over communicate and

00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,400
that is everybody that is management has

00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,410
to over communicate and employees have

00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:19,330
to over communicate and you you can't

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:20,920
over-communicate and there is no way to

00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:22,270
do this successfully without

00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:25,930
understanding how to use the virtual

00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:28,350
tools so if you don't know or you don't

00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:30,430
want to learn how to use virtual tools

00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:31,870
you know people in this room probably

00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,880
don't have any problem with that at all

00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:35,860
but what we you do have teams where

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,510
there are people who are not comfortable

00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,710
with virtual tools and that can be a

00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:43,840
real problem I want it i want to

00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:47,820
reiterate commandment number one you

00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,820
will spend a lot of time on the phone

00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:54,910
now there are some potential problems

00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:57,340
that come with remote workers isolation

00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:59,350
you know people are not in a group of

00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,420
people they may not feel like they

00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:04,270
belong they may feel like they're kind

00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,310
of cut off from everyone else it may be

00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,530
hard for people who are working remotely

00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:13,000
to feel a sense of rapport with the rest

00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:15,730
of the team it's nice to work remotely

00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,470
to to have that work family balance but

00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,330
the work/family balance can kind of go

00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:21,640
the other way which is you can have them

00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:24,460
colliding into each other and you can't

00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:27,910
separate them enough and that can turn

00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:29,440
into a problem remote employees can have

00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:32,200
trouble seeing the big picture you know

00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,820
I'm just me sitting here at home doing

00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,620
my little piece of the work and I don't

00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,760
understand all the other work that's

00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,710
going on and I don't know where my

00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:42,160
little piece fits into the big picture

00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:44,410
and that can be a problem and I lose

00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,850
that casual contact that that you get

00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,610
when you're all physically in the same

00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:50,710
building you just don't have it but we

00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,880
can work around all these things so one

00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,170
of the things that we have to do is we

00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:58,300
have to have the right infrastructure in

00:12:53,170 --> 00:13:00,340
place so these are just some quotes from

00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,690
I've got some quote scattered through

00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,160
here from people that are working on

00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:05,170
virtual teams that kind of said you know

00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:07,089
what works and what doesn't work on our

00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:10,100
virtual team

00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:12,320
what what's the what what makes it

00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,029
successful or not and one of them is

00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,620
virtual teams are forced to be better

00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:18,830
organized and follow clear procedures

00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:24,620
and that is really true you cannot

00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:26,630
assume anything what we find is you need

00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,890
to have a team identity and a lot of

00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:30,800
times you need to have some sort of an

00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:34,430
internet or you know a point of central

00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,529
contact for the remote team or for the

00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:38,870
for the whole team right both both the

00:13:36,529 --> 00:13:42,170
remote and they virtue and the local

00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:44,089
ones you want to have an online team

00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:46,520
directory with photos of each person and

00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:48,290
contact information if you are not in

00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,820
the same room with these people you want

00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:51,500
to see their faces you want to know what

00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:52,880
they look like when you run into when

00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,050
you do have a chance to meet them in

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,339
real life you don't want them to be

00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:58,490
strained or you want to feel like you

00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:00,709
know who these people are you should

00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:02,899
treat adding a person to a virtual team

00:14:00,709 --> 00:14:05,630
in the same way that you treat adding a

00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:09,130
new employee to a company they need that

00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:12,080
same kind of orientation and inattention

00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:15,050
i would say that one of the things that

00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:17,000
drupal has been accused of having

00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:18,740
problems if you know is new people

00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,750
approaching the Drupal community and

00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:22,670
feeling like they you know they don't

00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:24,260
belong and nobody wants them and you

00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:26,450
know nobody wants to hear what I have to

00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:27,709
say that kind of thing it's that king

00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:30,140
it's that same kind of you know that's

00:14:27,709 --> 00:14:32,390
that sense that this new person who's

00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:33,740
trying to join this virtual team doesn't

00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:36,880
feel welcome doesn't feel like they're a

00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:38,779
part of something and that's important

00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,220
each team members you have an

00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:41,959
understanding of the what the others are

00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,970
doing and how each person fits in with

00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:46,790
the rest of the group and again it's

00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:48,560
easy it's easy for to miss this it's

00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:51,680
easy for this not to happen but it's

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,290
really important documentation invite

00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,790
and data sharing is vital you know this

00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:58,339
is all kind of a lot of the same thing

00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,690
we need to know what's going on we have

00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:02,750
to have ways of communicating with each

00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:06,770
other and so we kind of have like it

00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:08,870
Lola but we have i'd say like five kind

00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:11,000
of big buckets of things that build the

00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:13,070
infrastructure that i think are

00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,209
important to a lot of teams so first of

00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,250
all you need some sort of a team

00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:18,980
internet you need you need a central

00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,960
point of contact and that should have a

00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:21,520
directory on it

00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,250
you know who all the team members are

00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,270
you need a way to share files you're

00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,160
going to have to have a way to get files

00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:29,470
back and forth you need some way of

00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:32,830
calendaring and keeping track of events

00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:34,840
and that kind of thing you probably need

00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:37,210
a time tracking not it not every team

00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,340
needs time tracking but i would say that

00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:41,290
may be more of them need it then realize

00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,700
it and then you need lots of

00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,290
communication channels you don't need

00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:48,420
just one communication tender and you

00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:50,950
need multiple communication channels so

00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:54,280
for instance our low about internet

00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:56,200
super simple drupal site right nothing

00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,970
nothing really fancy we've got a place

00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,590
where we've got client information and

00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:02,500
documentation we've got a place where

00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:04,090
we've got our team directory we can

00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,070
bookmark we've got an ability to

00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:08,860
bookmark that's just flags this is just

00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,570
a super super easy drupal site and then

00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,910
you know blogging about things like

00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:14,640
birthdays and benefits and you know

00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:17,440
company news and all that kind of thing

00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,540
we've used open atrium in the past it

00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,580
wasn't a particularly good match for

00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:22,990
exactly what we were trying to do so we

00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,180
aren't using it right now but that's

00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:26,830
another alternative there's a lot of

00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:29,890
companies that use things like base camp

00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,630
for this purpose there there's a lot of

00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,550
tools out there it doesn't really matter

00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:37,480
what you use the point is that you need

00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:40,810
something and then how are you going to

00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:44,140
manage files we're using Dropbox and I

00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:46,300
think Dropbox is mostly pretty good it's

00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,740
not a perfect solution either I don't

00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:51,490
know if there is a perfect solution for

00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:54,100
sharing files but Dropbox is working

00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:56,170
pretty well for us I think what you need

00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:58,480
for file sharing that's important is you

00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:00,310
need a way to say we've got some files

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,690
that need to be kept private and we've

00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,490
got other files that we need to share

00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:05,980
with people so we need a way that that

00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:07,990
can happen you know if a client needs a

00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:10,209
file how can you get that file to them

00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:12,070
and at the same time you've got private

00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:14,830
files and you want your private files to

00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:16,390
stay private you probably want to have

00:17:14,830 --> 00:17:18,550
some way of doing some sort of

00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:21,459
hierarchical organization of your files

00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:23,860
Dropbox gives you that some people just

00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:25,660
put files into something like base camp

00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:30,040
and I don't know if you can do a

00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:31,840
hierarchical organization I did the ones

00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,980
I've seen it didn't but that doesn't

00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,690
mean that there isn't a way to do it

00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:38,850
cross-platform accessibility is really

00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:41,970
important like Dropbox I can get to from

00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:43,799
any machine than I'm on it's got its got

00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:45,900
an iphone app it's got an android app

00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:47,820
it's got lots of different ways that i

00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:49,650
can get to my files and I've got some

00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:52,140
revision history so all those things are

00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:54,830
really important and then you could say

00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:58,350
like github would be you know more

00:17:54,830 --> 00:18:02,370
another way is github for your code

00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:04,980
repository you need a calendaring system

00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:07,409
now we use google calendar and google

00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:08,760
calendar is pretty powerful and one of

00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:10,890
the things that's nice about google

00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,679
calendar is you can combine multiple

00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:15,270
calendars into the same one so when you

00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,400
see the two different colors here this

00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:19,230
this is an example of somebody that's

00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,270
got a couple of different calendars and

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:23,820
so what we do for instance that Lobot is

00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:24,990
we've got a calendar that is our regular

00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:27,059
you know everybody's got their regular

00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:28,919
calendar and then we've got a calendar

00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:32,220
that keeps track of who's out of the

00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:35,070
office so we've got no oh calendar and I

00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:38,760
can bring the oh calendar into my thing

00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:40,950
and I can see that oh yeah so and so's

00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:44,179
out today I'm not going to not going to

00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:46,409
find him he's out today we've got a

00:18:44,179 --> 00:18:48,750
conference call calendar so we got to

00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:50,070
set on another calendar where we keep

00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:52,020
track of all the conference calls who's

00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:54,510
using what conference call lines you

00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,370
could do a calendar for meeting rooms

00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,080
which doesn't apply in our situation but

00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:00,390
somebody might find something like that

00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,159
useful so you can have lots of different

00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:05,159
calendars that are used for different

00:19:02,159 --> 00:19:06,690
purposes and then everybody can bring

00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:11,490
them into their own calendars and see

00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:14,220
that information very handy time

00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:15,960
tracking I told I said I mentioned the

00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,059
idea that not everybody thinks that they

00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,350
need to track time or wants to attract

00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:21,510
time we're currently using something

00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:25,110
called let's freckle which is an online

00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:26,880
tracking system I like it really well

00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,409
periodically we had debates about

00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,059
whether it's the right answer whether

00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:31,860
there's a better way to track time and

00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:34,350
then we go look at other ways to track

00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:36,929
time and then a lot of times we end up

00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:38,580
back here again but but we do we do from

00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:40,980
time to time kind of revisit this

00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:44,159
question of what's the best way to track

00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,890
time but we can you can put projects in

00:19:44,159 --> 00:19:47,130
here when i started at all about a long

00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:51,180
time

00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:53,940
go way back when it was we didn't track

00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:57,120
time we actually the only time we track

00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:58,560
time as if we were billing time so if

00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,000
you were working on a project where you

00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,080
weren't billing time and materials

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,730
nobody tracked time and we found out

00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:08,340
over time we found out that it's

00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:10,230
actually useful to track time for

00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:12,030
everything even if it's not a billing

00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:14,010
situation if even if there's not a

00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:15,390
billing question so you can so what

00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:17,070
we've got is we've got buckets for

00:20:15,390 --> 00:20:19,380
things like internal time or we put a

00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:21,300
bucket in there for working on the

00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:22,770
company website and you can keep track

00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:26,870
of you know how much time are people

00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:29,520
spending on these kinds of things the

00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:33,990
tough part about that is getting people

00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,190
to actually do it right so you really

00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,750
have to keep up with those kinds of

00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:38,550
things once you have to get into the

00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,220
habit of tracking time and it's really

00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:43,220
useful when you're at home to be to know

00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:45,900
what it is you are spending your time on

00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,520
so there's basically two ways to do it

00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,960
you can use some sort of a timer where

00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,730
you're just constantly keeping track of

00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,180
what you're doing and then you click you

00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:55,560
know done and and and you post it or you

00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:57,060
do something where you kind of catch up

00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,710
at the end of the day that I tend to do

00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,360
the second because I do so much

00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,450
switching back and forth between things

00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,590
that I don't find that the timer works

00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:07,170
you can wait to the end of the week or

00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:10,110
the month but you will odds are have

00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:12,420
forgotten what you actually did do and

00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:14,940
like I said the important thing is that

00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:17,370
we're finding that this is kind of

00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,470
transcends billing it's it's really just

00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:20,820
time management this is this is keeping

00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:23,400
track of how you're spending your time

00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:25,860
and not just for management but for the

00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:29,370
employee as well so everybody knows you

00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:31,860
know where where's my time going but

00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:35,040
again trying to get people to actually

00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:36,330
do it sometimes requires some gentle

00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,870
reminders so we've come up with a

00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:41,700
freckle ferry and if you don't post your

00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:44,460
time you get an email from the freckle

00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,050
ferry and if she has to she might post

00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:50,340
it in a public place where you're going

00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:52,140
to be shamed so people are getting

00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:57,450
pretty good about now posting their arms

00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:59,460
their hours now so I we've got I'm

00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,720
quoting putting various people because

00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,740
we've we've had cover say

00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,390
shins about what are what are

00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,890
suggestions about working at home and

00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:06,750
one of them that Seth came up with is

00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:09,120
you know track your time you you really

00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,470
you you want to know if that you're

00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,510
spending enough time but you also want

00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:14,490
to know that you're not going you're

00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:16,440
spending too much time you maybe if

00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:17,610
you're spending too much time on

00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,020
something maybe you're spinning your

00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:21,049
wheels maybe you should be asking for

00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:23,640
help you know maybe there's a problem

00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:26,179
but the only way you to know how you're

00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,230
spending your time is to track it

00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:30,090
another thing that we use is called

00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,039
Yammer and Yammer if you're not familiar

00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:33,720
with it is basically Twitter but it's

00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:36,330
kind of a private twitter so it's not

00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:39,299
open to the public everybody can't see

00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:41,640
it it's it's something that's

00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:45,090
constrained so that week you we can feel

00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,620
free to like put names of clients into

00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:49,860
our Yammer's and that kind of thing

00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:52,590
we're using Yammer as sort of an

00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:55,169
announcement right okay I'm i just got

00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:57,510
done working on such and such a project

00:22:55,169 --> 00:23:00,059
and I'm or I'm getting ready to work on

00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:01,289
something else we do lots of things with

00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:03,419
Yammer we keep finding more and more

00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:05,789
ways to use Yammer we do something

00:23:03,419 --> 00:23:07,590
called the hive mind so let's say you're

00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:09,870
stuck on a problem and you say you know

00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:12,480
I feel like this is a problem somebody

00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:15,240
else is solved i'll post something and

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,850
i'll put hashtag hive mind and that

00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,110
means hey anybody know the answer to

00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:21,210
this question anybody got any good

00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:23,730
solutions and you know a lot of times

00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:26,640
somebody else does so we do the high of

00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:28,679
mine things and we we say you know like

00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,620
this is an example of I found this

00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:34,250
really great resource that we could use

00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:36,330
and you know we can share this resource

00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:39,659
so there's a lot of different ways that

00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:42,480
we use Yammer but what it all comes down

00:23:39,659 --> 00:23:47,070
to is you absolutely have to find good

00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,210
ways to communicate and one of the

00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:49,980
things that's important if you're going

00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,900
to be a manager and a remote team is you

00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,970
have to have good communication skills

00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:56,490
it's the manager's job to stay on top of

00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:58,620
everybody there's a whole bunch of

00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:02,340
things that we'd use for communication

00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:04,559
channels so email obvious email we use

00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:07,380
email lists all over the place so for

00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,929
instance we have an email list to team

00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,820
and that is all the people on the team

00:24:09,929 --> 00:24:13,260
so if you want to make sure that

00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:15,450
everybody on the team knows

00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:18,330
you just have to copy the team email

00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:21,360
list and then every project that we set

00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:23,010
up gets an email list and so if you want

00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,690
to send an email out to everybody that's

00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,400
involved on a certain project you don't

00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,840
have to go look up all their names or

00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,870
worry about whether you've left somebody

00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,210
out or anything like that you just copy

00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:34,830
you copy that email list it's really

00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,660
great for making sure that people aren't

00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:38,910
left out of the loop and I think that's

00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:42,480
one of the really valuable things about

00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:46,920
it obviously you want a mobile phone you

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:48,750
need a way to do conference calls we use

00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,860
something called turbo bridge there's

00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:51,570
there's a bunch of different services

00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:53,280
that you can use for conference calls

00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:55,650
but you have to think through how are we

00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:57,480
going to do conference calls and if

00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:59,550
you're the remote employee and and

00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,570
you've got the company set up they're

00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:02,610
going to have to figure out how are they

00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:04,260
going to conference call you in right so

00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:08,730
one way or the other there has to be a

00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:11,790
conference call solution IRC is like the

00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:14,070
mainstay everybody sits in IRC all the

00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:16,500
time and you're expected to and the the

00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:19,230
idea is first of all you're easy to ping

00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,300
and second it also lets everybody know

00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:23,730
that you're there you know it's you I'm

00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:26,370
here I'm available I'm working you can

00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:28,740
you can reach me if you need to so

00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:32,730
that's the idea with IRC we use Yammer

00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:35,370
for all kinds of things for personal

00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:37,290
things as well as business things and

00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:41,670
then skype and google hangouts google

00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:44,250
hangouts are great so the bottom line is

00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:46,530
all teams need good communication but co

00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:48,030
load co-located team so co-locate it

00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:50,610
would be the opposite of remote we're

00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:55,050
all in the same place have more chances

00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:56,250
to stumble across information I started

00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,720
a bunch of conversations with people

00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,550
about like what's good about working

00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,130
remotely what's wrong with it what works

00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:03,570
what doesn't work and one of the

00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:06,150
responses i was getting was they're

00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:07,440
harder to manage and i think it's

00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:10,290
interesting because there's nothing

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,870
about managing a remote team that isn't

00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:15,270
a good idea for any team it's just that

00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:17,520
you have to do it and with a with a

00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:19,800
co-located team you can get away with

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:23,270
not doing it but with a remote team you

00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,270
can't get away with not doing it

00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,750
and actually I was thinking about the

00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,490
grapevine right so what so some people

00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:31,809
say well you know the remote people they

00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:33,580
don't they don't hear the grapevine well

00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:36,370
you know the grapevine is really sort of

00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:38,230
a failure of communication you know it's

00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:39,700
sort of a response to a failure in

00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:41,950
communication somebody didn't tell

00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,230
somebody everything they needed to know

00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:46,840
and the grapevine tries to pick up the

00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:49,059
pieces so the fact that you don't have

00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,710
the grapevine is really just a signal or

00:26:49,059 --> 00:26:55,059
the grapevine is just a signal that

00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:56,370
there's communications not going on so

00:26:55,059 --> 00:27:01,049
then we get to talk about phone calls

00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:01,049
because there's going to be lots of them

00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:08,309
so now here my five Commandments for

00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:10,900
phone calls thou shalt use a headset

00:27:08,309 --> 00:27:12,429
this we have to kind of teach people

00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,169
this because if they're not used to

00:27:12,429 --> 00:27:16,210
being on a remote team or in a you know

00:27:14,169 --> 00:27:18,010
phone call that includes a lot of people

00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:20,440
they don't always realize this but if

00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:22,750
you have more than two people on a call

00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,340
and they don't have headsets on you

00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,960
start picking up background noise you

00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,840
start hearing somebody clicking on the

00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:32,650
keyboard all kinds of things it gets

00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:35,320
really confusing and noisy and it's just

00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:37,179
you just have to say people on a call

00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:40,570
with more than two people have to use a

00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:42,130
headset and the corollary to that is

00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:48,580
when you're not talking you should be

00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:50,610
muted thou shalt tada so so one of the

00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:52,660
things that happens when you've got a

00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:54,429
conference call or a call with a lot of

00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:56,260
people involved is sometimes you can

00:27:54,429 --> 00:27:57,790
have what some people like to call the

00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,440
Thunderdome thing right everybody's

00:27:57,790 --> 00:28:01,059
talking over everybody and you can't

00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,070
tell who's talking and when they're done

00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:04,570
and all that kind of thing so a couple

00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:05,950
of things that are really helpful first

00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:08,440
of all there should be somebody leading

00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:10,299
the call and we try to do that a lot of

00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,000
times it's the person that caught that

00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:15,220
called the called it right that set it

00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,280
up but somebody should be sort of taking

00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:20,650
control of the call and saying okay Jim

00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:22,330
what do you think okay wait a minute

00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:24,130
that's enough Karen let's let's hear

00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:26,410
what sue has to say you know that kind

00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:28,030
of things sort of doing that you also

00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:30,250
need a way to communicate that you're

00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:33,340
done talking so they can somebody knows

00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:35,320
okay now i can i can move in what we

00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:38,020
started doing at lolla bot and I don't

00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:38,930
even know who started this thing is when

00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:41,210
you get all done

00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:43,970
can you say tada so a bit of a ba ba ba

00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:46,100
tada and that means I'm finished and

00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:47,960
somebody else can talk now and it's

00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,910
hilarious because we bring other people

00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,680
in on our calls clients and things and

00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:53,420
they're all picking it up and so pretty

00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:55,460
soon you hear the clients are starting

00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,710
to do today on their calls its i think

00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:01,760
it's it's a lot of fun but it works it's

00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:03,890
very effective yet again you have to

00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,540
have a conference call system and and

00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:07,250
you have to think about international

00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:10,130
calls as well we're in a global

00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:13,070
community some people maybe we'll never

00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:15,680
ever ever have any reason to either need

00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:18,770
to have somebody international dial in

00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:21,920
or out in keeping in mind that even

00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:24,260
Canada is international you have to

00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:27,110
think through how are we going to do

00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:28,850
this if somebody from outside the US

00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:30,530
needs to dial in how are they going to

00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,820
do it do we have a number they can use

00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:34,700
is it going to cost them a million

00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:37,130
dollars how's this going to work and

00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:39,410
vice versa if we need to call them how

00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:41,060
are we going to call them Skype is

00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:42,830
sometimes an answer but not everybody

00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:47,570
can use skype and so you can't rely on

00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:50,350
that sometimes it works so now we're

00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:52,190
really really good we are commuting

00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:54,680
communicating the heck out of everything

00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:57,830
we are copying everybody on every email

00:29:54,680 --> 00:30:00,890
we are pulling people into a million

00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:03,200
phone calls we need to do that but the

00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:06,710
corollary to that is now we've got

00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:09,920
information overload so what do we do

00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:13,310
about that well we have to we have to

00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:16,730
balance the availability with a way to

00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:19,010
get away from it a little bit and so one

00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:20,840
way we can do that is well there's a

00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:22,880
couple of ways this is an interesting

00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,420
suggestion that I just ran across when I

00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,890
was researching this topic we actually

00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:29,810
haven't been doing this but it might be

00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:32,270
a good idea when you're when you're

00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:35,450
sending an email blast to you know

00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:37,040
everybody on a list to say the CC means

00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:39,080
I'm just letting you know but you don't

00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:42,980
have to do anything but the two means I

00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:45,950
expect you to respond I think that might

00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:47,900
be an interesting idea to try you want

00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:49,880
to schedule time to speak with us each

00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:52,160
other so the idea is you don't want to

00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,960
just like constantly interrupt

00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,490
nobody's going to get anything done if

00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,220
they're being constantly pinged and

00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:59,840
interrupted and stopping what they're

00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:02,570
doing to answer questions and that kind

00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:06,200
of thing so you ideally you want to

00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:09,640
unless it's an emergency say okay Jared

00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:13,010
I need to talk to you what's a good time

00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:15,170
I'd be available after 2pm today and we

00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:17,120
set up a time and we figure out when

00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:20,360
we're going to talk in it and we can

00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,760
both fit it into our schedule and ink

00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,860
and similarly you can schedule time to

00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:27,500
go dark so you can say okay I've got

00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:29,840
this project going on I really need to

00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,730
focus on this thing I mean I cannot I

00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,740
cannot have all this other stuff going

00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:37,130
on I need to just be heads down in this

00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:39,710
project and so what we've started doing

00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:43,190
a lot of us are doing is will Yammer on

00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:46,130
something like I've got this big project

00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:49,540
I am going to go offline for two hours

00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:52,100
um you know if you if it's an emergency

00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:53,990
try and contact me otherwise you know

00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:56,180
I'll be back in a couple hours something

00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:57,530
like that so you kind of announcing to

00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:59,660
people that you're letting people know

00:31:57,530 --> 00:32:02,060
what what what you're doing and what

00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:03,800
what to expect but you're giving

00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:07,570
yourself a chance to kind of step back

00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:11,390
and actually get something accomplished

00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:12,770
so then we have body language so one of

00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,330
the things that happens when you're

00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:17,810
dealing with remote team especially when

00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:20,120
everybody is not in front of you is if

00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:22,610
I'm hearing silence on the other end of

00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:24,440
the line am I seeing is is that somebody

00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:26,840
smiling and nodding their head or is

00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,700
that somebody looks like this and you

00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:34,150
don't know right you don't know which

00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:36,830
one silence is so this is an issue

00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:38,030
you're missing body language that's one

00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,950
of the things that happens when your

00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:42,410
remote is you don't get the body

00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:44,960
language clues and you have to be very

00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:47,090
conscious of the fact that you're not

00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,480
getting those clues and silence does not

00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:52,910
mean necessarily mean agreement it does

00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:57,920
not necessarily mean I understand it may

00:32:52,910 --> 00:33:00,260
be total confusion who knows so what we

00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:02,330
have to do is we have to find out you

00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:04,250
know how can we kind of solve for this

00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:05,100
problem that we don't have body language

00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:08,160
when where

00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:09,860
dealing with remote teams so first

00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:12,720
there's there's basically two solutions

00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:15,299
so one solution is you've got to

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,830
explicitly ask questions ok you get done

00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:18,630
explaining something you hear dead

00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:21,360
silence I mean if people are saying yes

00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:23,520
yes yes I agree you know you know you've

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,320
got agreement but if you're not hearing

00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:27,090
anything you don't know what that

00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,730
silence means so you've got to ask

00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:32,130
you've got to say does that sound right

00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:34,740
do you agree do you disagree did you

00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:37,440
understand what I was saying you have to

00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,730
do that and then the second one is you

00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,320
can use something where there is a

00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:42,419
visual element so you could do something

00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,909
like Skype or Google hangout or

00:33:42,419 --> 00:33:46,500
something where you actually can see the

00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:49,610
person that you're talking to and get

00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,809
some of those body language clues and

00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:53,669
again another quote from some of the

00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:55,770
research I had to totally change my work

00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:57,030
process process and be much more direct

00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:59,640
when asking people how they're feeling

00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:01,409
or acting I have to translate what I and

00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,789
I think what this was supposed to say is

00:34:01,409 --> 00:34:05,549
I have to translate what I would have

00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:07,140
picked up from body language you know in

00:34:05,549 --> 00:34:08,909
other words there is no body language so

00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,369
I've got to figure out a solution for

00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:13,500
that so we do things we do google

00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:15,869
hangouts and we have a lot of fun and

00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:18,179
sometimes when we have this really tough

00:34:15,869 --> 00:34:20,879
problem that we're dealing with the the

00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:22,200
best part is this I'll bet they were

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,810
talking about something really serious

00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:26,850
in and it was like they're all just

00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:28,109
going on you know and then you they're

00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:29,310
just going to have a little fun and

00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:30,810
break the ice a little bit and then

00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:34,320
they're going to get back and and solve

00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:36,600
the problem another problem that you

00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,970
have with remote is isolation so you've

00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:41,760
got people that are kind of out away

00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:43,350
from everybody else and again keep in

00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,830
mind that all of these things could be

00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:48,450
like a remote office just as well as an

00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:50,460
individual remote employee working from

00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:53,040
home so you've got isolation you've got

00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:57,840
this sense that you are separated or

00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:59,550
left out or missing out on things you're

00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:00,840
not a part of the mothership you're

00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:05,010
missing something you don't know what's

00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:07,290
going on so this came up over and over

00:35:05,010 --> 00:35:09,450
again as a potential problem you know

00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:13,650
well people feeling like they were left

00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:16,140
out so how do you get around this so

00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:17,550
this is an area where a manager can

00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,720
really make a difference so manager

00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,940
who's really kind of

00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:24,630
just the fact that this can happen and

00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:26,070
this does happen one of the things that

00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:29,220
some of the comments talked about was

00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:32,280
the idea that an employee or a team

00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:34,230
member might not be comfortable saying I

00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,599
feel left out you know they might not

00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:38,609
ever verbalize that and so that you need

00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:40,290
to man the managers need to kind of

00:35:38,609 --> 00:35:42,300
check in are you doing okay haven't

00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:44,640
heard from you lately things going all

00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:48,300
right you know you know kind of keep

00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,190
that thing going and the other thing

00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,960
that the managers can do that really

00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:54,240
helps is keep communicating the big

00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:56,490
picture how do how do you fit into the

00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,260
big picture what's going the reason why

00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:00,180
you got to do this crazy project is

00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,070
because of this you know here's the big

00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:04,770
thing that's going on here's your piece

00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:07,109
of it this is why this little thing that

00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:09,270
looks so screwy is really important and

00:36:07,109 --> 00:36:11,460
it's a you know it needs to happen and

00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:14,490
then confirming understanding again

00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:15,690
silence may or may not mean anything so

00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:20,700
you've got as you've got to do that

00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:22,560
check to see then we tap the things like

00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:25,050
the work/family balance we said you know

00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,020
working from home means it's nice you've

00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:29,970
got the ability to be involved in more

00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,530
things in the family but you also have

00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:34,650
the opposite you have the family

00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:37,050
everywhere right and and sometimes it's

00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,940
hard to get separated from them so what

00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:41,220
a lot of people are saying is things

00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,260
like you know my the way that I do this

00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:45,300
is when my office door is closed it

00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:47,940
means leave me alone I I need some quiet

00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:51,839
time I need to I need you to pretend I'm

00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:53,700
not here basically it's a rowboat it's a

00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,440
real risk I everybody that works from

00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,570
home i think would agree that there is a

00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:59,010
tendency for everybody to sort of assume

00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:02,250
you're here that means you're available

00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:03,960
and just ping you all the time and you

00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:07,200
have to you have to wait to communicate

00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:09,030
when you're not so I I just pulled out

00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,849
some pictures these are things that have

00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:14,040
been posted on Yammer of our team sort

00:37:11,849 --> 00:37:18,240
of balancing their work and family stuff

00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:21,330
and we all figure it out right

00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,750
eventually we all figured out I love

00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,750
that picture

00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:29,180
so another issue is time zones if you're

00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:31,250
if you're dealing with more than one

00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,900
time zone and if you're in a remote team

00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:35,570
mods are you are dealing with more than

00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:38,210
one time zone there's there's two ways

00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:40,280
to deal with multiple time zones a team

00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:43,340
that has multiple time zones you can

00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:45,860
either say we're going to pick out a

00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:47,300
block of time when everybody's going to

00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,800
be available we're all going to be

00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:51,140
working simultaneously we're going to

00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,670
have some overlap period and it's early

00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:54,410
for some people know it's late for other

00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:56,480
people but this is the period when we

00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:58,850
expect people to be around and we're all

00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,200
going to work together or you can say

00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:02,030
we're not all going to be working

00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:04,280
simultaneously what we're going to do is

00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:06,440
we're going to do these handoffs so you

00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,450
know team a is working nine to five and

00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,770
then they're going to hand off to Team B

00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:12,470
that's going to pick up and work from

00:38:09,770 --> 00:38:15,170
five to 11 and cetera et cetera so

00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:18,800
basically you've got one of those one of

00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:20,480
those two things going on it's really

00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,790
hard to figure out how to schedule

00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,490
meetings across time zones i found the

00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:27,220
neatest this is a really useful thing if

00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:30,650
you if you have to do this kind of thing

00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:32,000
this world time buddy calm basically

00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:33,650
what you can do is you can pull up a

00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,570
list of time zones that your team

00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:38,060
members are in and then you can pull

00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:39,710
your calendar into the top and then you

00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,720
can look down the list and say okay

00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:43,040
here's an opening on my calendar and

00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:46,220
here's what time it would be in

00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:48,710
everybody's time zone on the team and I

00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:50,060
could I can send an email and try to you

00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:51,800
know I could put it on my calendar and

00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:55,100
send an invitation out or whatever but I

00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,870
can see what this means you know and I

00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,250
could tell that oh that's three in the

00:38:56,870 --> 00:39:02,240
morning for somebody that's not going to

00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:04,250
work right another way to do it where

00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,260
the time zones are less obvious but I

00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:07,760
know some people like to use doodle com

00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:10,010
so this would be something where

00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,750
basically you don't ever see what

00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:13,010
everybody else's time zones are but you

00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:16,070
figure out some times that are good for

00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:18,050
you and then everybody else sees those

00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:20,660
times in their own time zone and they

00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:22,910
can respond yes or no to them the

00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:24,320
downside of this is you can't tell you

00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:26,360
know the thing that you know that you've

00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,210
just sent something that was two o'clock

00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:33,350
in the morning for somebody but this can

00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:36,290
be useful too if you're going to do a

00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:37,580
24-7 handoff

00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:40,550
one of the things you've got to keep in

00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:42,320
mind is that if you don't if you don't

00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:44,570
answer all the questions that need to be

00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:45,950
answered when you do that handoff you

00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:48,470
are basically going to lose a day of

00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:50,240
work because now that you know you hand

00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:53,060
it off and you go in away and you're not

00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,220
there anymore and now you your your

00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:56,510
twenty-four-seven team may be sitting

00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,160
there with twiddling their thumbs

00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:59,630
because they needed a piece of

00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,260
information they didn't get it so you

00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:05,000
have to be really conscious of that

00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:06,500
there are also cultural issues there's

00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,780
all kinds of things that you don't even

00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:10,670
think about because everybody is so sure

00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,020
that everybody else thinks the way that

00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:14,270
they do I mean it just doesn't even

00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:16,550
occur to us to think about this but

00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:18,470
there are cultures we're working through

00:40:16,550 --> 00:40:19,880
lunch nobody works through lunch and our

00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:24,200
cultures were of course you work through

00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:25,820
lunch when does the day start and end do

00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,510
you work on weekends do you not work on

00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:31,360
weekends what are the holidays who has

00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:33,770
holidays when you have to you have to

00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,750
explicitly call all these things out

00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:37,760
there are actually and there are also

00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:39,800
cultural differences on communication

00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,890
styles so here's a couple of examples

00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:45,140
and so this was one team that had Dutch

00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:47,180
members and US members and the US team

00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:49,930
said okay well it's meet next Thursday

00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:52,310
and the Dutch Dutch member said sure

00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:53,900
however it turned out that the US team

00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:56,390
thought that next Thursday meant the

00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,890
upcoming thursday and the dutch team met

00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:59,750
thought that meant thursday of the

00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:02,840
following week so you again you have you

00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:04,880
just you can't make assumptions and then

00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:06,230
another another example American faculty

00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,330
member said we'll tell the students to

00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:10,550
adopt a chosen procedure and then the

00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:12,710
Dutch faculty supervisor said we'll

00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:14,690
discuss this procedure with the students

00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:18,200
you know just just that different

00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:22,130
culture cultural response to how you

00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:24,290
communicate and on top of culture we

00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:26,930
have language so we can have multiple

00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:29,330
languages and one of the things that we

00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:30,770
have to be really conscious of is for

00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:33,350
those people who don't have english as

00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:35,000
their primary language you need to be

00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:37,970
careful because if you start moving too

00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:40,100
fast they may be thinking about how to

00:41:37,970 --> 00:41:41,900
respond and you've moved on to the next

00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:43,940
subject you completely left them in the

00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:45,350
dust and so you have to you have to be

00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:48,380
conscious of the fact that they may be

00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:50,860
they may need a little extra time to

00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:53,420
stay caught up with you

00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:55,480
all kinds of interesting things can

00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:58,040
happen they said the holiday schedules

00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:01,400
you want to let let everybody know what

00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:03,020
the holiday schedules are there were one

00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,450
of the things that came up was the idea

00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:07,310
that the people who are proficient in

00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:09,170
speaking English are not necessarily the

00:42:07,310 --> 00:42:11,690
experts on the team so this was an

00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:13,550
example where there was a team of people

00:42:11,690 --> 00:42:15,920
that spoke different languages and the

00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:17,510
experts on the team were not proficient

00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,390
in English so they sort of sat in the

00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:22,670
background and the people that that were

00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:23,960
communicating were actually the junior

00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:26,450
members of the team but they were the

00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:29,240
ones that knew English and so the the

00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:30,950
American team treated them as though

00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:32,660
they were the experts and they treated

00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:35,120
the experts as though they were the

00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:39,350
juniors and you know so these funny

00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:41,840
things happen the other thing that's

00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:44,780
interesting about this is one of the

00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:47,360
solutions for language problems is is

00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:50,660
that a lot of people are going to find

00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:53,630
it easier to write or read a foreign

00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:55,760
language than to speak it and so using

00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:59,570
text you know confirming things in

00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:03,020
writing writing things as opposed to

00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:08,690
trying to read and speak everything can

00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:11,330
be a way to help get across that yeah

00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:13,400
this was that example that the junior

00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:15,710
members and then this was an example of

00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:18,650
somebody who didn't speak English well

00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:20,600
who thought that they had somebody who

00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:22,010
was who made the team really successful

00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,510
and they said when I asked a question

00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:25,790
they didn't just say yes but they said

00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:27,260
yes you mean this and this they told me

00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:29,210
what I thought I meant then they then I

00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:30,500
could say yes you're right and then they

00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:32,060
would send a little story about the

00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,350
meeting went and what the outcome was so

00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:35,690
I could read this and look if it was

00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:38,030
right so the idea again of saying okay

00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:40,220
this is someone who's who's doesn't have

00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:42,110
english as their primary language we

00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:44,000
want to make sure that they understood

00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:49,100
what we thought they understood and

00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:51,160
confirm there so another thing we want

00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:54,290
to do is we want to develop rapport

00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:56,330
we've got a bunch of people that aren't

00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:57,980
in the same room but we want them to

00:43:56,330 --> 00:43:59,090
feel like they belong together and I

00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:01,850
think that's one of the things that

00:43:59,090 --> 00:44:03,500
Lowell about has has done really well at

00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:05,060
and so

00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:08,090
trying to figure out like how do you

00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:11,660
make that magic happen because it's

00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:13,580
important one of the suggestions i came

00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:15,050
up and we actually don't do this but

00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:17,350
this was a suggestion that came up was

00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:20,300
doing a virtual lunch went once a month

00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:22,490
trying to build rapport we use Yammer a

00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:25,850
lot I see ya mraz one of our things that

00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:27,770
kind of build rapport I love this one my

00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:29,810
mom has a mom and she's my grandma mom

00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:31,490
as a dad and he's my grandpa dad is mom

00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:33,500
dad as a dad there are many many people

00:44:31,490 --> 00:44:34,760
who love me and then Andrew says this is

00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:41,540
a great excuse to start teaching

00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:43,220
recursion all these things and all kinds

00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:45,560
of things like somebody will start a

00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:47,240
thread and they'll say everybody put up

00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:51,500
a picture of what it looks like out your

00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:54,170
window or somebody else will send in a

00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:57,310
radar map and a big X and say this is my

00:44:54,170 --> 00:45:01,250
house I'm going for cover you know and

00:44:57,310 --> 00:45:03,710
we have fitbit's and we got like a

00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:05,570
contest going to say you know who's

00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:07,070
going to do the most steps and Fitbit

00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:08,570
keeps track of that and then every time

00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:11,140
somebody comes up to the top of the list

00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:13,370
they post it and say hi I'm the winner

00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:15,350
and then somebody else beats them later

00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:18,170
but all of these are really great

00:45:15,350 --> 00:45:19,850
rapport or building things and we we go

00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:22,580
around sometimes because there's a lot

00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:23,870
of quote noise on Yammer because of all

00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:25,520
this stuff but I also think this is

00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:26,960
really valuable because if we didn't

00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:31,160
have that we wouldn't have that sense of

00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:33,560
rapport and then the baby pictures I

00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:35,780
mean we've got all these what like Lola

00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:38,000
kids now and we get so we got all the

00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:42,740
baby pictures posted all the time and

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,930
they're all they're all sweeties the

00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:47,390
other thing that you can do is you need

00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:51,170
to make opportunities to see people in

00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:52,550
real life so if you are literally remote

00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:54,950
you still have to make create those

00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:57,830
opportunities they have to be days when

00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:59,450
you're doing you could do co-working you

00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:00,980
can have retreats you can have on site

00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:03,500
meetings but you need to you need to

00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:06,100
have those periodically I'm not sure how

00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:08,390
possible it is to really have rapport

00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:12,200
with a group of people that you never

00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:13,760
ever ever see it is possible to have a

00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:15,530
good relationship with them but I think

00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:18,410
it's important to have those in real

00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:23,360
those real life things are real life

00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:25,190
opportunities and then we've got hybrid

00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,560
teams and these are really challenging

00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:29,500
so the team where most of the people are

00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:33,820
local but there's a few remote people

00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:36,530
one of the thing we had asked a question

00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:38,690
our mana it guess was Matt asked the

00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:40,490
question at one point about why do you

00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:43,160
how do you feel about working at a

00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:45,290
remote at a company where your remote

00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:48,560
and I think almost everybody that

00:46:45,290 --> 00:46:50,510
responded said it's so much better if

00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,430
everybody's remote then if like there's

00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:54,920
this one lonely person who's remote and

00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:57,860
you're it right because you you tend to

00:46:54,920 --> 00:47:00,380
get forgotten that's not an impossible

00:46:57,860 --> 00:47:01,670
thing to fix but management has to be

00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:04,970
really conscious in that kind of

00:47:01,670 --> 00:47:08,750
situation to not let that remote person

00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:13,030
get lost so that I think that's an

00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:16,300
especially challenging management issue

00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:19,520
we you need to have a feeling of trust

00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:20,990
you need to feel like you can trust the

00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:23,360
other people on the team and a lot of

00:47:20,990 --> 00:47:24,890
that comes back to you know if the other

00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,840
people on the team are doing all this

00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:29,450
communication if they're telling they're

00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:31,130
talking about what they're doing you you

00:47:29,450 --> 00:47:33,410
know what's going on you'll you'll have

00:47:31,130 --> 00:47:35,090
that sense of whether or not they're

00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:36,770
doing what you expect them to be doing

00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:39,290
and you know is so and so getting behind

00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:41,290
it only if they if they've gone dark if

00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:44,330
they've gone into a hole and disappeared

00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:47,450
you have no idea and and that's a that's

00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:50,090
a real problem for trust on the

00:47:47,450 --> 00:47:52,910
management side the idea is managers

00:47:50,090 --> 00:47:55,850
need to be really proactive right they

00:47:52,910 --> 00:48:00,110
can't just wait until a problem devolves

00:47:55,850 --> 00:48:02,810
into chaos they have to be like probing

00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:06,020
all the time if things okay everything

00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:08,360
going to write you need anything lots of

00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:11,150
praise public praise let people know

00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:14,150
what's going on let let people know that

00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:16,430
they're doing the right thing this was

00:48:14,150 --> 00:48:18,500
an example of a horrible manager the

00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:20,150
silent approaching included screening

00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,830
phone calls from remote colleagues not

00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:23,570
returning calls and emails leaving them

00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:25,760
out of the loop and avoiding working

00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:27,460
with them all together so you know this

00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,280
is the guy you don't want to work with

00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:31,350
so my management

00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:35,070
amendments thou shalt initiate

00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:36,750
communication the management is got to

00:48:35,070 --> 00:48:39,120
take the responsibility I think for

00:48:36,750 --> 00:48:42,210
creating a sense of identity for the

00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:44,190
team and making sure that everything is

00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:45,720
documented and documented in a place

00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:47,420
that everybody can get ahold of it and

00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:52,260
the end showing everyone the big picture

00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:53,730
I think that's really important so then

00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:58,050
the last thing I want to talk about is

00:48:53,730 --> 00:49:03,440
meetings so we have meetings so we have

00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:05,490
a remote meeting we've got in particular

00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:07,140
online meetings are easier than they

00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:08,640
ever used to be so we've got skype we've

00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:10,710
got google hangouts we could go to me

00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:12,840
used to be expensive and complicated and

00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:16,140
hard you have all this crazy equipment

00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:20,580
and it's so easy now to do to do

00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:22,020
meetings online meetings you can do

00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:24,450
mixed media we do this all the time

00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:26,280
where maybe we've got the same skype

00:49:24,450 --> 00:49:28,530
number but we're using something else

00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:32,220
for the video go to meeting or join me

00:49:28,530 --> 00:49:34,220
or something really important to make

00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:36,720
sure ahead of time that everything works

00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:38,880
there is nothing worse than a meeting

00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,350
where you've got you know a dozen people

00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,820
in the line and the person that's

00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:44,580
running the meeting is trying to figure

00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:46,740
out how to get the thing to show to you

00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:50,850
know to work you know I can't figure out

00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:52,790
how to get WebEx to work so you want to

00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:55,250
get that all figured out ahead of time

00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:57,720
practice makes perfect so I feel like

00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:59,460
it's crazy to keep jumping around and

00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:01,860
using different kinds of find a system

00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:03,900
that works for you and get really good

00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:09,390
at using it and know how to use it and

00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:12,270
keep using it I really think in I've

00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:13,950
seen a failure on this one a lot when

00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:15,930
you're on a remote meeting a lot of

00:50:13,950 --> 00:50:18,750
times it's it's very easy not to know

00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:20,310
who else is in the meeting I think it's

00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:21,750
really important for whoever's leading

00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:24,150
the meeting to make sure that everybody

00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:26,040
knows who's there who's in the meeting

00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:29,340
and not just who's there who are they

00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:31,020
right I don't know how many well it

00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:32,670
hasn't happened a whole lot of times but

00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:35,640
it's happened a few times where I

00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:36,810
thought somebody was a junior person and

00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:38,970
it turns out like they were really

00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:40,020
important person and I probably would

00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:41,940
have answered a question a little

00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:45,210
differently if I'd known that

00:50:41,940 --> 00:50:48,300
it's really important I think to make

00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:49,829
sure that gets communicated who are

00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:52,800
these people and then sending documents

00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:54,810
in the agenda ahead of time there's

00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,310
nothing worse I don't think than getting

00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:58,770
into a meeting where you're just sort of

00:50:56,310 --> 00:51:01,109
ambushed you know we're going to talk

00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:02,609
about what we're going to talk about

00:51:01,109 --> 00:51:04,109
what I had no idea we're going to talk

00:51:02,609 --> 00:51:07,470
about that I'm not prepared for that at

00:51:04,109 --> 00:51:11,240
all and ahead of time ideally means more

00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:13,920
than five minutes before they call and

00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:20,760
those are those of you on my team know

00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:24,810
who I'm talking about meetings okay

00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:27,030
again a meeting needs a leader in

00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:28,740
particular a meeting that have involves

00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:30,260
remote people needs a leader and that

00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:32,730
leader needs to be constantly

00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:35,760
paraphrasing making sure that everybody

00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:37,079
understands and you know trying to keep

00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,880
one person from dominating the

00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:41,040
conversation drawing other people in and

00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,390
in particular don't forget that you know

00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,390
not forgetting the people that are on

00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:47,970
the phone okay you know the people in

00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:49,560
the room a lot of times will dominate

00:51:47,970 --> 00:51:52,020
the conversation and the people on the

00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:54,030
phone will sort of get lost and you need

00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:55,680
a leader who will say okay let's hear

00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:59,550
from the people on the phone you know

00:51:55,680 --> 00:52:01,410
what do you think encourage personal

00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:03,510
conversation before and after I think

00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:06,690
that's wonderful but the meeting needs

00:52:03,510 --> 00:52:08,460
to stay focused I think one of the most

00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:10,140
difficult things is the hybrid meetings

00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:11,700
you've got you've got a bunch of local

00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:15,780
people and then a couple of remote

00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:18,660
people if you've ever been the one on

00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:20,730
the phone in these things how awful is

00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:22,470
it when you can hear people like talking

00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:24,480
quietly in the corners but you have no

00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:27,119
idea what they're saying it's just it's

00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,040
you know again you need the meeting

00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,470
leader that sort of keeps this stuff

00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,569
from happening make sure the people on

00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:35,490
the phone can hear everything make sure

00:52:33,569 --> 00:52:37,140
they understand what's going on don't

00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:42,540
use visuals that are not everyone can

00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:44,700
see this happens a lot we just decided

00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:45,900
we're going to pull something up on the

00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:47,430
screen and we're going to put it up on

00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,869
the wall and then the people on the

00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:51,630
phone or just out of luck because they

00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:53,220
have no idea what you're looking at the

00:52:51,630 --> 00:52:54,780
other thing that I've seen is sometimes

00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,160
that you send out materials ahead of

00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,900
time

00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,730
all looking at the same material like

00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,710
we're paging through a PDF or something

00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:03,500
like you have to keep saying okay now

00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:04,820
I'm on page 10 now I'm on page 11

00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:10,760
because the people on the phone are not

00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:12,230
going to be able to know that so we say

00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:14,360
it's hard to get your point across if

00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:15,830
you don't have virtual a whiteboard but

00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,750
there's again there's lots of good

00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:19,640
solutions for this now we've got skype

00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:21,370
we've got google hangouts gotomeeting

00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:24,290
join me you can share your screens

00:53:21,370 --> 00:53:25,310
there's so many ways to do this hack pad

00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:29,240
I don't know if you're familiar with

00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:31,550
hack pad but it's it's a document right

00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:33,740
it's a document that you can get several

00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:37,220
people in and you can all be writing

00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:38,930
simultaneously and like keep notes about

00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:40,850
what's going on in the meeting Google

00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:43,190
Docs which is the same same kind of idea

00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:44,960
you can you can share a Google Doc and

00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:46,850
everybody can see the same thing at the

00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,340
same time and you can have up you can

00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:50,990
have an audio call with a google doc so

00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:53,660
you're all looking at a google doc and

00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:55,100
you're listening on the call but because

00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:57,410
it's real time you can all see what's

00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:59,390
going on with the document so there's a

00:53:57,410 --> 00:54:02,740
lot of ways to fix that clarify the

00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:08,120
purpose of every discussion and

00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:11,270
summarize decisions that were made by

00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:12,620
minute okay so this is it so what do I

00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:14,540
want what are the takeaways that I

00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:16,610
wanted to get first of all the things

00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:19,580
that make remote teams work make all

00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:21,290
teams work better this is it's not that

00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:23,870
these things aren't needed for teams

00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:25,850
that are not remote it's just their

00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:27,470
critical for remote teams and they're

00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:29,120
also important for teams that are not

00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:32,030
remote you can't over-communicate

00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:34,280
there's no way to do it however much you

00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:35,960
communicate is probably not enough both

00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:37,790
members and managers have to be

00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:41,240
available invisible and the

00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:44,690
infrastructure has to be right so remote

00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:47,150
can work and I don't I guess we don't

00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:49,040
really have time for questions although

00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:52,100
I suppose I could take one if anybody's

00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:53,360
got a real quick question there's a mic

00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:55,750
back there you probably need to jump

00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,750
back there

00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:08,530
you should that slide on whiteboards

00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:10,960
which of those are competent in like

00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:12,730
collaborative marquette so you can

00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:15,730
actually truly collaborate virtually

00:55:12,730 --> 00:55:17,080
another question is how do you what are

00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:19,350
the special needs you need for

00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:21,340
presenting to clients in this situation

00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:22,720
okay I'm not sure I understood the

00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:25,480
question so hang on a second so the

00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:28,030
first question was whether the the tools

00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,920
were collaborative so the collaborative

00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:31,900
tools would be like hack pad or Google

00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,550
Docs those are ones that you can be

00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:37,480
working in simultaneously was that the

00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:39,370
first question you different different

00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,350
people write different people can can

00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:44,050
all be working in at the same time both

00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:47,250
of those will will do that I didn't

00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:47,250
understand the second question those

00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:08,930
okay so I'm going to take a stab at

00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:11,110
trying to rephrase that so you're saying

00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:13,690
when you're dealing with a client

00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:16,490
language or you talking about language

00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:18,350
by the Oh body language oh right right

00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:19,460
yes so Bobby you're missing the body

00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:23,660
language when you're dealing with a

00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:26,690
client we really do try to have an

00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:28,550
on-site pretty early on in most

00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:31,420
engagements so that we're not like this

00:56:28,550 --> 00:56:33,770
is nobody we've ever seen before that

00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:35,510
you'll you'll still have meetings where

00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:37,430
you know where you can't see the body

00:56:35,510 --> 00:56:40,130
language but they're the best you can do

00:56:37,430 --> 00:56:42,260
is just keep asking right did that make

00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:45,050
sense did you understand that does that

00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:47,810
look right to you you know and that's

00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:53,630
that's probably the best solution I can

00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:55,250
think of yeah so this one is potentially

00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:56,710
I suppose kind of a negative question I

00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:59,420
definitely don't mean it that way but

00:56:56,710 --> 00:57:01,910
probably one of the hard parts is for

00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:04,340
management with a fully remote team if

00:57:01,910 --> 00:57:06,770
you have examples from lullaby how have

00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:09,170
you identified underperformance and have

00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:10,880
you dealt with it okay dealing with

00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:12,530
performance on a meat on a remote team

00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,180
is it's probably really no different

00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:16,940
than dealing worth the performance on on

00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:18,800
any other team it the difference is that

00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:20,990
managers have to manage a little

00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:22,490
differently so to know what people are

00:57:20,990 --> 00:57:24,650
doing they have to be in communication

00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:28,010
with them and the employee has to be in

00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:31,360
communication with the manager so a lot

00:57:28,010 --> 00:57:33,110
of it is about everybody staying

00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:35,060
communicating with each other enough

00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:36,560
that that the employee knows what's

00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:38,840
going on and the manager knows what's

00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:40,550
going on you know beyond that it's it's

00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:42,800
probably the same as it would be

00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:46,070
anywhere else you have a review you know

00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:47,930
you talk through things in a review but

00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:51,860
the evaluation is the work that you've

00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:54,610
done and and you're you know the visible

00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:56,900
things that you have communicated I

00:57:54,610 --> 00:57:59,270
think I'll take that one question than I

00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:01,250
need to I know I need to end go ahead do

00:57:59,270 --> 00:58:03,620
you have ideas for virtual parties or

00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:07,940
virtual celebrations with remote teams

00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:09,830
virtual celebrations yeah the pig a

00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:10,289
small group could do a google hangout I

00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:12,269
guess

00:58:10,289 --> 00:58:13,650
but I that wouldn't work for a big group

00:58:12,269 --> 00:58:19,369
I don't know what you would do for a big

00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:19,369
group there's a blog post about that

00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,369
so there's he said there's a blog post

00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:32,980
about everybody takes a picture of

00:58:30,369 --> 00:58:37,420
themselves with a beer or something like

00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:40,270
that um yeah I don't know I don't have

00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:41,740
any good ideas about that all right I

00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:43,240
think I need to end because the next

00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:45,690
session needs to get in here but thank

00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,690
