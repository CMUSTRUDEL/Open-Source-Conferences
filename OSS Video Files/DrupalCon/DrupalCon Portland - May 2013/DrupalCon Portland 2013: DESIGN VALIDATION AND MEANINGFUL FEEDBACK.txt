Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: DESIGN VALIDATION AND MEANINGFUL FEEDBACK
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	There's nothing worse than discovering that the project you poured everything into is confusing or unappealing to the people who are expected to use it. Intranets, anyone?

How do you know whether the new Drupal site/app/distribution you are working on is indeed wonderful to your target audience? You need (meaningful!) design feedback.

There are many techniques and tools you can use, that depend on:

Stage of the project you're in
Type of feedback you need
Type of project
Who you need to collect feedback from
How quickly you need the feedback
In other words, you'll take a very different approach for a corporate site in the early development stages vs the redesign of a certain feature on a site/app.

I'll talk about how we work at Acquia (everything from clickable prototypes for Drupal Commons to how we use Acquia Cloud as a platform for some usability studies) and how others work.

REASONS TO ATTEND THIS SESSION

You're responsible (or want to be) for gathering design feedback
You're interested in a better design process
You're tired of seeing sucky designs
You're a visual designer, user experience designer, product manager, or project manager (developers welcome too!)
You should walk away with an overview for capturing, prioritizing and acting on feedback for your project's success.
