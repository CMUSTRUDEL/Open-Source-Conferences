Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: DESIGN VALIDATION AND MEANINGFUL FEEDBACK
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	There's nothing worse than discovering that the project you poured everything into is confusing or unappealing to the people who are expected to use it. Intranets, anyone?

How do you know whether the new Drupal site/app/distribution you are working on is indeed wonderful to your target audience? You need (meaningful!) design feedback.

There are many techniques and tools you can use, that depend on:

Stage of the project you're in
Type of feedback you need
Type of project
Who you need to collect feedback from
How quickly you need the feedback
In other words, you'll take a very different approach for a corporate site in the early development stages vs the redesign of a certain feature on a site/app.

I'll talk about how we work at Acquia (everything from clickable prototypes for Drupal Commons to how we use Acquia Cloud as a platform for some usability studies) and how others work.

REASONS TO ATTEND THIS SESSION

You're responsible (or want to be) for gathering design feedback
You're interested in a better design process
You're tired of seeing sucky designs
You're a visual designer, user experience designer, product manager, or project manager (developers welcome too!)
You should walk away with an overview for capturing, prioritizing and acting on feedback for your project's success.

alright so you're in the session on

00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:09,690
design validation AKA how to psy class

00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,030
that's what's printed in a schedule and

00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,000
it's it's actually kind of a working

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:16,619
title so i think meaningful design

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,250
feedback is more that approach i'm going

00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:22,650
for but anyway so you're here because

00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:25,650
you're interested in collecting designed

00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:27,390
feedback and maybe using it for your

00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,750
site and you know just ensuring it

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:33,120
happens in some form so in this session

00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,520
will define what design feedback is and

00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,300
how do you collect it how to use it that

00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,219
sort of thing and also i just like to

00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,320
thank these people they really helped

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,539
with my session i did a lot of like

00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,090
chatting with them and on the other

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:49,680
thing I did is I did I run through my

00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,379
session and they had some great feedback

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,539
and I'm big fan of feedback I asked them

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,980
to focus on the content and the flow and

00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:01,170
because i don't get terribly excited by

00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:03,390
fonts so the great feedback okay so my

00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:07,560
name is Lisa Rex I'm a user experience

00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,299
researcher Murdoch whea formerly a sort

00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,950
of design editor I've done front end

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:14,070
I've done some site through polite

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,540
building I thought was also a genealogy

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,790
researcher which has been a kind of

00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:21,950
interesting juxtaposition with my

00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:24,630
current role but some of my biggest

00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,159
failures in my design career husband

00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:29,909
because I didn't get the right design

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:33,270
feedback the story that springs to mind

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,250
is my first sort of like web design role

00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:41,280
I was tasked with building the internet

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:43,799
and it's hard and so my friend and I we

00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,659
kind of got together and we we ran down

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,790
to the kitchen we made toast and we you

00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:48,899
know we're all excited and we we built

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,290
the whole thing and then you know we

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:55,500
showed it to people and we kind of

00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,210
missed the mark on content and visuals

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:02,430
and yeah and the whole thing was

00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:04,979
scrapped so good lesson there so this is

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,780
the design team at aquia and we're

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,300
definitely focused on products things

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,250
like Acquia cloud aqua network commons

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,070
spark drupal gardens and

00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:20,110
you know our process this this is the

00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:21,550
story basically of our process and it's

00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,870
definitely our process as a work in

00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,700
progress but we're like we're growing

00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:28,210
we're learning we're adapting and it's

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:30,670
actually really quite fun so these are

00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,709
you X interaction designers there their

00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:35,290
focus is largely on sort of the visual

00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:36,850
and the interactive part of things there

00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:40,330
they do a lot of the design briefs and

00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:41,770
style guides and then they also do like

00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:43,120
the visuals and the prototypes and

00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:46,720
that's everything from you know

00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,410
wireframes to clickable prototypes so

00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,300
where we have lots of approaches to the

00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:53,860
way we do things and that's and we just

00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:58,090
decide based on the needs of the project

00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:00,220
in timelines and then there's the UX

00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,709
research team and there's three of us at

00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,410
the moment we are doing the research

00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:06,760
planning and conducting the studies we

00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:08,860
do a lot of like sort of more basic

00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,440
studies like kind of like click test if

00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:13,180
that seems appropriate and you know

00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,410
where we're actually talking a lot with

00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:21,070
our customer facing teams so support the

00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:25,560
account technical account managers so I

00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:28,110
mean this comes together with our

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:32,380
feedback processes pretty pretty broad

00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:34,450
we are mostly focused on the qualitative

00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,910
and not the quantitative so it's great

00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:38,260
to like use google analytics or

00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,549
clicktale or anything like that to see

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,140
where people are clicking but it doesn't

00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:43,390
tell you the why of things so that's why

00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:47,079
we're more focused on actually talking

00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:50,440
to people directly so design feedback is

00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:53,440
anything from you know written emails to

00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:56,920
tweets but actually we'd prefer like you

00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:59,709
know actual conversations with you know

00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:03,400
our stakeholders and users and potential

00:03:59,709 --> 00:04:06,970
users so yeah everything from gut

00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,350
reactions to really planned studies the

00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,120
reason for this is that we you know we

00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:12,700
recognize that we are not necessarily

00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,620
our users and and that's the same for

00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,090
everybody you know you can't know what

00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,450
your users need until you talk to them

00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:18,450
so

00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:23,000
lots of things you can learn from

00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,460
feedback one of the things i find really

00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,920
useful is the figure out the actual

00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:30,890
needs of your users so your brand new

00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,940
user he comes to your site things might

00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,460
be a little difficult to figure out but

00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:35,600
you know maybe over time it's learnable

00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,260
the next time you come to see is like

00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,180
whizzing through great and then we have

00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,890
the power users usually comes along and

00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,750
she's been using your site or your

00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,150
product for a long time and you know she

00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:48,920
doesn't need all this kind of like

00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:53,570
introductory stuff so it's working out

00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:55,430
like how their needs vary this is kind

00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:58,430
of a fun example from it's the

00:04:55,430 --> 00:05:01,370
drupal.org admin it's the user

00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,500
permissions page so it's not public

00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:06,200
facing but I think it's fun because most

00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:08,330
people don't get to see it you know

00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,190
obviously what works for like a few

00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:12,020
doesn't always work doesn't scale so

00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,570
that's what i mean by scalability i mean

00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,910
like in the UI you see this a lot on

00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:20,720
forums and other social sites

00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:22,340
occasionally but as you probably know

00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,380
that devel- all will let you like

00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,520
generate like reams of content and stuff

00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,160
of it into your theme and make sure

00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,970
nothing breaks so no it's and comments

00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,250
and users the other thing that you can

00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,900
learn is just whether your content is

00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,330
actually working this is a big deal

00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,070
that's the main reason people are coming

00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:43,490
to your to your site or coming to your

00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,960
project you know just figuring out like

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,090
what's the right amount and what they

00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,850
need is is the messaging right or they

00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:52,100
you know is the tone working for them

00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,540
you know maybe there I don't know maybe

00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,950
it's like you're talking down to them or

00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,830
you know there's all kinds of things you

00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:59,570
can learn and then the other thing is

00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:02,750
sort of like the UI text so that's

00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:05,120
things like on your forms and you know

00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:09,950
just labeling can be confusing unless

00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:12,910
you check with people so um I approached

00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:16,670
this talk like I did like I would a

00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:19,100
research project and I so I talked to

00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:20,840
nine different people seven of them were

00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,480
actual designers from around the Drupal

00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,580
community in and add aquia and I also

00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,570
talked to two product managers because I

00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,290
thought they would have an interesting

00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:31,100
take on things so yeah I did interviews

00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,390
with them

00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:38,420
I look for some common themes so here's

00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:40,250
here's well first first um some quote

00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:44,120
from my colleague who's just super smart

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:45,650
and he points out that you know feedback

00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,290
is like sort of difference between

00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:52,460
design and art so with that in mind I

00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:54,980
was like yep okay so common themes for

00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,330
my interviews with these people number

00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:58,160
one is that design feedback is

00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:00,260
absolutely essential and what's

00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,120
interesting is not all of them started

00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,500
off thinking that way you know when

00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,010
they're in your in your career as a

00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:09,680
designer you might think you got it all

00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:12,140
figured out but one of the one of them

00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,110
said like you know it's often as I think

00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:17,660
I'm right I'm usually not so it happens

00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:19,820
and then the kind of the main reason

00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:21,440
that feedback is essential is that it

00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,960
just saves time like the faster you can

00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,760
like uncover problems before you start

00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:27,440
getting other people involved like you

00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:35,180
know making putting stuff into code the

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:38,920
better talk talk is cheap it's not

00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:42,470
always what they say it's what they do

00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:45,320
so this major airline that you decided

00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:46,820
that they would survey customers to find

00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:49,460
a few know the passengers to find out

00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:52,370
how they could improve their long-haul

00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:54,530
flights and in a survey one of the

00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:56,840
questions was what sort of snack would

00:07:54,530 --> 00:08:00,050
you like amid flight and the

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:01,880
overwhelming response was fruit so the

00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,040
researchers thought well let's ask the

00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,110
flight attendants so they did and the

00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:10,490
flight attendants were like no no no no

00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:11,840
no they want cookies warm cookies so the

00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,830
researchers thought about this and they

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,480
think I think they realize that their

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:18,710
passengers were saying saying that they

00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,830
wanted fruit but they're probably at

00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:25,490
home surrounded by family thinking about

00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:29,450
being healthy and you know safe and it

00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:31,340
just it was interesting like how you

00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:35,680
want to be able to observe your users

00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,680
not just ask them so

00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:41,280
the other thing that we learned from

00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:42,570
these talks is that during design

00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,550
feedback sessions people don't know

00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:47,970
quite how to behave they don't know what

00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:52,650
to say they say too much so I'll talk

00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:55,910
about how we can deal with that okay so

00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:58,650
you may be familiar with this meme

00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:00,390
people see inspirational photos of like

00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:04,230
you know baking projects that

00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:08,790
professionals have done on pinterest it

00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:10,560
turns out it's harder than it looks so

00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,020
people tend to think themselves a

00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,770
designer and you know turns out it's

00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:20,100
really quite hard so if you're gathering

00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:23,660
feedback with people just a little tip

00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:26,580
on raining in the designer and everybody

00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,590
there's there's a few reasons like it's

00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,320
wonderful that they have ideas and I

00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:33,090
definitely take them all down but at the

00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,680
same time you know they probably don't

00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,870
have all the information they need such

00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,290
as like if there's been some existing

00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:44,370
research or design patterns or anything

00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:46,680
like that the other thing is that a flat

00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,870
design just like a drawing or something

00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:52,410
it may not it probably doesn't have all

00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:54,480
the interactions so that that you're the

00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:57,480
designer still has work to do even if

00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:58,470
someone hands over a drawing and then

00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,210
the main thing is that they could have

00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:04,410
found spend that time finding other

00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:06,120
problems so one of one of the people I

00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:07,620
talked to is she used the price monkey

00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,570
hands like design monkey hands don't

00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,850
make me think I'm like just these monkey

00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:15,450
hands so let your designer be the

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:17,640
designer okay so let's talk about

00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:24,000
actually getting meaningful design

00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:25,440
feedback okay let's say your client or

00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,200
your stakeholder says hey let's make a

00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:33,120
thing and for the purposes of this will

00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:34,740
say it's a homepage redesign so as I

00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,240
mentioned before everyone wants to feel

00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,970
like they're part of the successful

00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,640
design thing so it's great it's super

00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:45,150
great definitely definitely like it get

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:47,100
your team involved we encourage the

00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,360
support we get a representative from

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,720
support

00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,890
from QA definitely the designers even if

00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,720
it's not the lead designer I mean

00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:58,050
including the lead designer but the

00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,630
other their peers tech leads developers

00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:04,800
it's great get everyone involved and

00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:06,480
marketing to so one of the first things

00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,769
we do is we start with a creative brief

00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,060
and I don't want to spend a lot of time

00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:10,500
on this because you've probably seen

00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,959
these before but these are the headings

00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,420
in our creative brief so we talk about

00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,100
what the problems are like what you know

00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:20,160
what it is we're trying to solve and

00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:23,640
then sort of the goals of the project

00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,870
and that's super important get everyone

00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:29,070
aligned on those success criteria

00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:31,740
dependencies dependencies are things

00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:33,570
like if you're you know the one of the

00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:35,220
developers isn't available until a

00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:38,550
certain time so anything that could

00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:41,459
introduce risk to the situation and then

00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:44,310
and then kind of break down the aspects

00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:46,230
of this design or this new feature or

00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:49,920
whatever and the must-haves the should

00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:53,190
haves and whatnot so the must-haves this

00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:56,160
is interesting because the story or the

00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:58,140
the project can't be considered ready to

00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,480
ship until all the must-haves are met

00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:02,459
and the should haves are things that you

00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,000
could release without it but then you

00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:09,329
won't be done until you've done those

00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,769
also must not have so there's it

00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:12,540
probably instances where it just it

00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:15,779
shouldn't have something in in there so

00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:18,230
be sure to declare that up front we also

00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:20,699
talked about who our competitors are

00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:23,970
that's just so it was just an awareness

00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:28,079
thing and then any deadlines and who

00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:30,329
you're targeting and inspiration so I'll

00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,190
talk about that in a second and and then

00:12:30,329 --> 00:12:36,899
notes just you know people can take

00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:39,769
notes as you have these reviews so we

00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:41,880
recently released these notifications

00:12:39,769 --> 00:12:43,170
appear and like you know some are

00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,550
inspiration for these things we're

00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:49,380
looking at like Facebook and LinkedIn

00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:51,990
and JIRA Twitter you know the a

00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:54,029
well-established design pattern now so

00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:58,529
it's helpful to like look at that for

00:12:54,029 --> 00:13:00,720
inspiration and then I mentioned success

00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:03,569
criteria

00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,430
here's some examples you know starting

00:13:03,569 --> 00:13:08,459
with sort of like something vague like

00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:11,430
no higher conversion rate or you know as

00:13:08,459 --> 00:13:13,410
an example you know we like to say we

00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:16,439
like to make them like smart goals and

00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:19,949
that's like specific measurable

00:13:16,439 --> 00:13:21,480
attainable realistic and timely so here

00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:24,149
it's just like you know from two to five

00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:31,620
by quarter for and I've just made these

00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:34,560
things up but just as an example so now

00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:37,350
let's say you're working on your you

00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,550
know design brief in the same time you

00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:41,250
want to start looking and thinking about

00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:43,110
your feedback and research plan don't

00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:45,750
don't be tempted to skip this step it's

00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:48,420
really really important and so again

00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:50,370
these are headings from the document for

00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:53,040
the research planning we first talked

00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:55,199
about the goals these will match

00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:59,069
hopefully to the goals of the design

00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:00,990
brief then we take take input from the

00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:02,790
stakeholders and your stakeholders or

00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:05,879
you know remember the product owner is

00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:07,589
or the client and that input could be

00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:10,079
things like you know what they want to

00:14:07,589 --> 00:14:11,850
learn or you know what you know if they

00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,610
want something kind of validated in

00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:18,029
particular next thing is your

00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:21,209
methodology so that can be anything from

00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:23,759
a usability testing to one-on-one chats

00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:25,110
too if you just you know if you know you

00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,910
don't have a lot of time then you just

00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,079
want to do something really fast or you

00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:31,439
know do the quick and dirty testing

00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:33,569
absolutely fine then depending on those

00:14:31,439 --> 00:14:36,120
top three things then you'll decide who

00:14:33,569 --> 00:14:40,350
your participants are and how you'll

00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:43,139
recruit them and then lastly it's just

00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:44,910
like what what are you asking you know

00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:46,319
and its really helpful if you're you

00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,779
know talking to a series of people to

00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:53,100
have those questions written down I mean

00:14:48,779 --> 00:14:55,110
start with maybe a kind of Aang for the

00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,939
the participant you know just

00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:59,430
introducing the study to them and and

00:14:56,939 --> 00:15:03,059
then then all your questions and that

00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:04,769
sort of thing so I don't know if you've

00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:08,490
ever had a situation where people

00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:10,960
couldn't agree but possibly

00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,010
one of the one of the great techniques I

00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,860
just learned from my colleague

00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:18,100
Christina's this KJ method and it's

00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:21,910
really super for getting people all kind

00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:25,240
of to reach consensus so let's let's say

00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:27,550
that the you just wanted to find out

00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,990
like what research goals or what but how

00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:32,950
to focus the research for something so

00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:35,500
what you do is you get everybody in a

00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:37,360
group with this KJ method everyone in a

00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,220
group and you ask them the focus

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,150
question so for example we asked like

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,350
what would you like to learn about

00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:45,250
customers in the next quarter and

00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:47,260
everyone who's participating will write

00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:50,529
down all their answers on a sticky note

00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:52,930
and put them all randomly on the wall

00:15:50,529 --> 00:15:54,850
and then as a group they sort these

00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:58,810
sticky notes into like categories that

00:15:54,850 --> 00:16:01,270
could sort of makes sense and you know

00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:04,560
anything related and then the next step

00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:07,540
is they labels label these groupings and

00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:09,370
then they vote on them so they can have

00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:12,339
three votes so 3 x's for their number

00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:14,140
one and you know so on and then at the

00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:16,570
end you can just add up and see which

00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,650
groups one so and there there you have

00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:21,839
it like you know everyone worked

00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:24,279
together they had opportunities to

00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,520
change groups mix up groups and you can

00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:32,290
read more about it there's a link here

00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:34,660
jarrettsville wrote a great article also

00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:35,830
in your sort of recruiting methodology

00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,920
you want to think about who do you need

00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:40,930
to make happy so for people in the

00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:44,560
agency setting it's going to be probably

00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:46,120
heavily client-centric your your clients

00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:49,000
are the ones who paying the bills and

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,470
that you need to make happy they they

00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,680
have their business objectives and that

00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:57,010
sort of thing Paul bag is another

00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:59,140
designer who has written and he's

00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:02,800
podcasted and has an e-book about this

00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:04,689
client centric approach so I would check

00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,660
that out if you get a chance if that's

00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:10,150
of interest and then obviously there's

00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:12,040
the user centric approach and I think

00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:14,380
for most people it's going to be a mix

00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:16,120
of the two so you decide like you know

00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:19,500
what that makes is I mean Oh doc way we

00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:23,020
definitely we definitely do a mix

00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:24,750
so okay now let's say that you know the

00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:29,710
design of brief has been signed off and

00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:34,000
design begins again get everyone

00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:35,620
involved so in this example we we

00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,299
started off with like I think 12 people

00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:39,490
and we had we divided up into three

00:17:37,299 --> 00:17:43,809
groups and we started drawing making

00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:45,789
sketches and like sort of over a couple

00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:48,100
sessions you know it took several hours

00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:49,779
but we we got there and we distilled it

00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:54,779
down into two kind of quite robust

00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:57,309
drawings and I realized this photo that

00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:59,799
one of my colleagues put a bird on it

00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:01,809
and so if you watch Portlandia I think

00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:03,309
it's Portlandia and if you input they

00:18:01,809 --> 00:18:05,020
say in Portland if you put a bird on it

00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:10,210
you can just call it art so anyway I

00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:14,890
left that in put a bird on it calm in

00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:16,990
case you need to the emergency bird so

00:18:14,890 --> 00:18:19,929
now let's talk about the research

00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:23,260
execution so your designer has something

00:18:19,929 --> 00:18:24,250
to show you and show others so what we

00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,549
usually do is start with the

00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:28,870
stakeholders and you know these the

00:18:27,549 --> 00:18:31,600
stakeholders are the people that have

00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:35,590
like specific you know deadlines and

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,480
goals and so they're going to care about

00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,700
all these things any in any like design

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:42,520
changes that are going to impact

00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:45,549
timelines and budgets so we tend to do

00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:48,220
sort of three different things design

00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:50,590
reviews and design check-ins which are

00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:53,909
just sort of shorter and more frequent

00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:56,590
and then we use like commenting tools

00:18:53,909 --> 00:18:59,169
but first let me talk about design

00:18:56,590 --> 00:19:02,169
reviews so this is where this is where

00:18:59,169 --> 00:19:03,909
things can get go awry so the best thing

00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:06,100
is if you're the one who's like leading

00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:09,100
the session you want to set expectations

00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:11,409
up front so if you have an hour just

00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:13,570
like explained like we're going to spend

00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:15,520
ten minutes going through the design

00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:18,309
brief then we're going to spend 30

00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,809
minutes you know talk actually getting

00:19:18,309 --> 00:19:21,370
your feedback and then the lat the last

00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:25,390
time it will like think about like

00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:27,159
what's the sort of next steps so yeah I

00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:29,049
always think it's a great idea to go

00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:30,730
through the design brief together just

00:19:29,049 --> 00:19:32,640
to remind everybody like what the goals

00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:36,309
are you know that sort of thing

00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,960
and as the person who's collecting the

00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:40,510
design feedback you're going to sort of

00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,850
facilitate and take lots of notes and

00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:46,930
let the designer present his or her

00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:49,780
vision another quote from Matt he's

00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:51,910
really quotable he he said that you know

00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:54,880
a lot of you'll get a lot of probably a

00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:57,309
lot of talk coming at you in the session

00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,930
and you just have to like you know as a

00:19:57,309 --> 00:20:01,690
designer and as the facilitator you

00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:07,540
learn to kind of focus on what's

00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:12,910
important so actually actionable

00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:15,970
feedback sometimes there can be opinion

00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:19,059
Wars but what you want to do is just ask

00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:21,160
them to focus on on the problems and the

00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:22,960
goals and and not focus on any solutions

00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,970
or try not to jump to any solutions yet

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,410
because that comes later and actually

00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:29,860
that's really does like the designers

00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:32,559
job a good example is if you were doing

00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:34,330
a car design you'd want the feedback to

00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:39,030
focus on things like the brakes and the

00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:39,030
steering wheel and not the headrest if

00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:43,840
if the design review isn't working you

00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,760
know you can have like shorter more

00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,170
frequent check-ins like I think maybe

00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,970
every other day might be good and then

00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:52,120
have like one sort of mandatory session

00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:58,390
once a week just to get you know avoid

00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:59,800
any surprises the other thing we use is

00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:01,900
something called envision I think

00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,600
there's other similar products out there

00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:07,030
but it allows you just upload a bunch of

00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,920
static screens and link them together so

00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:13,150
you have a sort of clickable prototype

00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:14,920
and people can add comments directly to

00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:17,800
the screen so it's like nice and in

00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:20,920
context and this is well this is the

00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:23,100
sort of the back end view I guess you

00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:27,070
could say but we use it for Commons and

00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:28,690
because we also needed like public you

00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:29,530
know the community comment so we use

00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:33,540
this and it worked out really really

00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:33,540
great so

00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,380
so now I want to talk a little bit about

00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:43,539
actually talking to fusers Christine

00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:46,360
says that the best way to understand

00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:49,720
their goals and attitudes is to have

00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,970
people watch when I say people watch you

00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,740
know your watch people using your

00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:56,590
products so I mean getting like a

00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:59,980
developer in a room to watch and take

00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:02,020
notes it's really really powerful so

00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:06,159
yeah they'll definitely understand what

00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:08,110
people need so I think I've user

00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,880
feedback is like that harsh glorious

00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:11,640
feedback from the only people who can

00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,779
like really make your design better and

00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,679
they're in a really good position to

00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:18,880
tell you what needs improvement and

00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,039
users are always coming somewhere with a

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,279
purpose and you know that's what you're

00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:26,409
going to uncover the other thing is that

00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:29,740
I think most people are really happy to

00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:31,690
provide feedback I've never I've I

00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:34,779
always ask in person and I rarely get it

00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:36,610
no but people are motivated to help and

00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:37,750
they like to help and and if that's

00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,970
something they have to use frequently

00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:42,460
then they'll probably be really really

00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:44,950
happy to do so the Drupal community I

00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:46,480
know is just really passionate and it's

00:22:44,950 --> 00:22:49,029
just comes through in a lot of different

00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:55,330
ways also customer hugs are awesome i

00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:57,730
have to bathe in and so you gotta like

00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:59,649
need to find these people to talk to it

00:22:57,730 --> 00:23:02,500
can be people off the street but it

00:22:59,649 --> 00:23:04,149
really know it's like thinking about

00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:08,049
like what your goals are and ending in

00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:10,090
your your process you are also thinking

00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:13,539
about who you need to talk to and how

00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:16,539
you're going to recruit but that's why i

00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:18,669
mentioned asking a person thinking about

00:23:16,539 --> 00:23:20,380
if you need to talk just designers or

00:23:18,669 --> 00:23:23,710
developers or you know whatever type of

00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:25,630
person that is and also an offer

00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:29,919
incentives so it could be anything like

00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:31,330
we we do I amazon gift cards but you

00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:36,610
know maybe you just buy them lunch or

00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:42,220
coffee beer they all work and then just

00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:43,990
make it a conversation make it fun so so

00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:45,490
you have your users or you have your

00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:47,169
customers or whoever it is that you want

00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,080
to talk to that's not the stakeholder

00:23:47,169 --> 00:23:49,789
and

00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,669
the next thing is to think about whether

00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:55,340
you want to do in person or like remote

00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:56,840
I prefer in person just because it's

00:23:55,340 --> 00:24:02,120
easier to sort of establish like a

00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:03,500
rapport and it is a little more fun it's

00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,909
easier to communicate as well there's a

00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,590
lot of nonverbal communication that goes

00:24:04,909 --> 00:24:08,690
on when you're face-to-face with people

00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:11,120
and also it's a little easier to deal

00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:13,299
with interruptions I i had the doorbell

00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,980
rang once and it scared me a lot and

00:24:13,299 --> 00:24:17,539
they didn't know it was going on in the

00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:20,000
kept talking and so the app sort of

00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:24,320
thing the cons have time to do it in

00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,940
person are the logistics if if you're

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,380
not in the same place then there's going

00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:32,539
to be travel and that sort of thing but

00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:35,389
so remote we do a lot of remote I have

00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:38,899
to say so we use things like skype or

00:24:35,389 --> 00:24:41,299
WebEx and it's just it's just

00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:43,580
convenience you know only have to do is

00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:45,200
really schedule them and you know hope

00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:48,889
they have a everyone has like a good

00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:52,760
Wi-Fi connection but sometimes there

00:24:48,889 --> 00:25:00,710
there's issues with the audio and sort

00:24:52,760 --> 00:25:03,620
of things like that so but you know so

00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:05,889
what can you do with customers so aside

00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:08,120
from doing like usability studies and

00:25:05,889 --> 00:25:09,380
just like interviewing them and getting

00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,840
their feedback you can also do things

00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:14,149
like validating their priorities so we

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,179
did this recently we we showed them some

00:25:14,149 --> 00:25:20,539
roadmap items in a spreadsheet and we

00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:22,250
had them like record you know their

00:25:20,539 --> 00:25:23,600
responses I mean I think what we did is

00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:26,260
we said pretend you have a hundred

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,940
dollars how would you allocate this and

00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:32,210
we did that we just you know hid the

00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:34,940
previous participants columns and it was

00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:39,470
really really great and I think we will

00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:42,260
definitely do that again so usability

00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:44,740
studies and just a word ice is probably

00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:47,779
the area I know the most about but

00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:50,330
usability studies is roughly like you're

00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:52,220
sitting them down there using your site

00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,870
or your product and you're asking them

00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:57,529
questions it can be really open-ended

00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:58,909
you could start off with like I do

00:25:57,529 --> 00:26:01,370
whatever you would do normally a few

00:25:58,909 --> 00:26:02,150
first encounter a site and then you

00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:04,130
might

00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:06,050
them do a few specific tasks but what I

00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:08,600
well i think is great is just to have

00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:11,080
them like give them a goal and just see

00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,550
what where they go how they get their

00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:16,610
record all that sort of deviations and

00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:17,630
hesitations and that sort of thing what

00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,760
ya just definitely watch what they're

00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:21,590
doing I've observed people like clicking

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,060
in one spot even though they weren't

00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,890
saying anything they kept they were I

00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:26,780
saw this like clicking happening is like

00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:30,580
okay that could be a that could be a

00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:34,370
problem and then the other thing is to

00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:36,170
use measurable metrics so at aqua we've

00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:37,940
been doing everything on a one-to-five

00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:42,770
scale so one is poor and five is

00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:45,020
excellent so as I observe I'll come up

00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:46,880
with the rating from the effectiveness

00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:50,210
point of view and then I'll often ask

00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:52,790
the participant like kind of like how

00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:55,190
was your experience and what's funny and

00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:58,100
it's pretty consistent if I observe

00:26:55,190 --> 00:27:00,680
something to be like a three or four

00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:03,050
they'll be like oh that was a five so

00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:08,480
like oh that's nice but you don't have

00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:10,220
to protect my feelings the other thing

00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,760
also is just to communicate your

00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:16,130
findings visually reports are really

00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,860
boring and your stakeholders are likely

00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:20,210
not going to read them so I always I

00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:23,150
like to do is sort of annotated

00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:25,610
screenshots or or if you've been

00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:30,950
recording you can take video clips and

00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:32,390
that's awesome so if you are doing

00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:34,130
usability studies what's really great is

00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:37,520
just to start setting up repeatable ones

00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:39,860
so if something changes in the in the

00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,960
design you can run the study again and

00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,340
see how it alters like and it but if

00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,190
it's exactly the same as it was before

00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:52,220
you can just see if it would up

00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:53,960
hopefully went up also some of our

00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,300
studies where we have people like

00:27:53,960 --> 00:28:00,380
actually editing content on a Drupal

00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:02,450
site just to test things out and you can

00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:05,180
use something that if you have a Drupal

00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:06,470
site on a multi multi environment

00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:09,080
hosting provider you can use that to

00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:11,450
such like revert the database back so it

00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,790
just resets to where it was that's a big

00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,980
time saver

00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:16,260
and if you have any kind of studies

00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,520
where they're like actually altering

00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:23,430
settings on modules you can used rush to

00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:26,470
just revert back to the default so um

00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:30,160
couple pro tips always always keep your

00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:32,620
stakeholders involved and don't don't go

00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,000
it alone either I always think it's

00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,830
great if you can get someone else on

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,410
your team to come in and observe and

00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:40,450
take notes and you know then afterwards

00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:43,330
you can be like hash it all out and like

00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:45,910
what happened you know so and then

00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:49,150
always record record your conversations

00:28:45,910 --> 00:28:51,730
with your with your participants WebEx

00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:53,560
is what we're usually losing but if if

00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:55,300
you have to just use you know the thing

00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:58,120
on your phone or any kind of voice

00:28:55,300 --> 00:29:00,340
recorder the reason is that you know

00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:02,500
it's it's if for whatever reason your

00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:04,750
note taker you know can't capture

00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:07,210
everything and you're trying to like ask

00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:09,340
questions and listen and be able to come

00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:10,960
up with additional questions you can't

00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:13,030
also take notes at the same time it's

00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:17,860
it's hard I can't I wouldn't recommend

00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:19,480
it so definitely record a couple things

00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:22,870
if you're interested in learning more

00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,460
about usability testing or kind of UX

00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:26,760
undercover UX is another great one

00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:31,180
there's a couple books there and then

00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:34,510
this video the square weave it's called

00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:37,270
the user is drunk and it shows some

00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:38,860
examples of pretending if your users

00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:42,030
drunk then it'll help a little bit with

00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:48,370
like the design I think it's funny so

00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:54,820
and then in me Adam Connor and Aaron

00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:56,230
Irizarry they they talk about design

00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:58,300
critique a lot and actually they're

00:29:56,230 --> 00:30:01,000
presenting today at web visions and I

00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:03,580
saw them last night so there's a link

00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:07,540
there that i think is adam talking about

00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:08,890
critique but yeah they've done a lot on

00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:10,570
that so definitely look at that because

00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:15,190
that feeds in quite nicely to the whole

00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:18,130
design reviews and that's good thing ok

00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:21,160
so let's say you've got all your your

00:30:18,130 --> 00:30:22,600
research and you've got it and you're

00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,540
like happy you've talked to enough

00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,500
people that sort of thing now gather it

00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,570
all up

00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:30,580
and start like you know sort of

00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:33,880
synthesizing it like look for the high

00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:39,100
level themes and and then show these to

00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:41,110
stakeholders so what is it what you can

00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,880
do is like sort of group everything by

00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:46,090
like sort of the original questions they

00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,970
may have had and then as a group you'll

00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:50,380
decide what to act on I mean this

00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:52,750
process does take a little bit of time

00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:54,520
but if you focus on the big ones like

00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,320
you know forget about the things that

00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:59,200
maybe one person said or two people said

00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,240
but if like you know five people

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,760
mentioned something then it's definitely

00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:05,320
something that you want to focus on if

00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,060
you can't decide you can always run the

00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,710
KJ again to decide like you know well

00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:12,550
what are we going to act on so that

00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:14,110
works too so when you start gathering

00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:16,420
this information you can do things like

00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:17,950
develop these sketch personas and these

00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:21,490
really only come from having a deep

00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:22,330
understanding of who your users are sort

00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:24,520
of the difference between a regular

00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:27,130
persona is that these are in flight

00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:31,030
there never you know we're always

00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:33,400
learning so they're not final and how

00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:36,280
we've we usually start with like the

00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,540
person's name and what they do a little

00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:40,930
biography a little bit of their

00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:43,420
day-to-day life and we talk about their

00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:46,300
technical profile so something like you

00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:49,030
know how how well they know Drupal do

00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:50,170
they used version control you know are

00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:53,770
they comfortable in the command line

00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:55,150
that sort of thing and then task

00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:56,920
profiles so these are the things they

00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:59,130
actually do on your site your product or

00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:03,370
whatever and I've broken them down into

00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:04,390
sort of primary and secondary so another

00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:06,370
way you could break it down is like

00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:08,080
those sort of things that are crucial

00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:11,500
but less important and then the ones

00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,960
that they do all the time and then just

00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:17,400
generally like they're kind of concerns

00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,840
and challenges to do with their job

00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:23,830
security comes up a lot that sort of

00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:27,850
thing what is great though is I've once

00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:30,010
your team starts recognizing these names

00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:32,110
and these profiles they really absorb it

00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:35,590
then they've become like able to defend

00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:38,560
this person so I've seen that in it's

00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:40,130
really fun like well no Dave would never

00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:45,230
do that because Dave you know

00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:47,540
so when I and then I said mentioned like

00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:51,290
visually communicating this is like an

00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:52,940
example of a journey map and this is

00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:55,370
Anna you know it could just a map to one

00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:58,130
of your personas but imagine there's all

00:32:55,370 --> 00:33:00,590
these tasks on your site and you know

00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:04,810
after you've done usability testing you

00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:09,500
know that certain tasks are frustrating

00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:12,020
certain or happy usable so yeah just you

00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:14,210
know break them out so like um on the x

00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:16,910
axis we have the 125 rating and then

00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:18,440
across the bottom we have phases and

00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:21,950
these faces you know that are going to

00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:24,350
depend on your your project but you know

00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:25,940
phase one might be like brand new user

00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:27,860
the first time they encounter it and

00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:35,440
then like phase three is like you know

00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:37,790
they're like their everyday so so now um

00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,160
you've got your design feedback you've

00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:43,040
identified the problems and now you got

00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:45,260
to act on it so I think the hardest

00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,690
thing is like to actually just commit to

00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:49,700
a percentage of your time of the of the

00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:52,370
you know the development teams time to

00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:53,900
actually incorporate the feedback it's

00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:55,460
always tempting to for them to they're

00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:58,430
probably really excited to work on new

00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,960
stuff but it's going to be important

00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:03,830
that they kind of work on the things

00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:05,090
that making the site better too so that

00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:08,090
feedback you'll just want to translate

00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:11,899
it into just chunks of work again like

00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:18,940
you'll want to prioritize those and get

00:34:11,899 --> 00:34:20,840
them on the development schedule so I

00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:25,820
think it might be a little early here

00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:27,649
but your turn so I want I want to see if

00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:31,149
people have done any design validation

00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:37,450
has anyone done this before or feedback

00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:40,280
usability testing a few yeah okay good

00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:43,419
yeah so just think about a project to

00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,419
think the parts you're not sure about

00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:48,560
what you can do I loved I'd love it if

00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:50,149
people came up to me like some time

00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,820
later and they said that they they ran

00:34:50,149 --> 00:34:56,780
some feedback and got

00:34:52,820 --> 00:35:00,200
good information that'd be great we are

00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:02,690
also we're also doing ongoing usability

00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,990
studies on our products on Drupal more

00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:07,970
there's a greater sort of UX Drupal UX

00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:10,790
team so if you're interested in doing

00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:13,070
anything like that for the Aqua aside

00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:16,460
there's a URL there so that definitely

00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:18,560
sign up or come talk to me and then for

00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:20,780
the Drupal side we're actually having a

00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:23,950
ball today at two fifteen i forgot the

00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:26,570
room but it's on the board and you can

00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:28,340
learn if you want it like become part of

00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:31,730
the the team that's improving and

00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:33,770
growing up we as UX that would be great

00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:36,140
so we've we've identified a lot of the

00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:38,210
problems with the current process of you

00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,640
know contributing to Drupal UX and and

00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:42,500
now we're looking for people to help

00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:46,730
like come up with solutions and I think

00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:48,620
the answer is going to be like doing

00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:50,930
more work at the local level so if we

00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:52,790
can empower people who want to do you x

00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:54,800
like they could do like a run run a

00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:56,690
usability study at a camp or something

00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:58,970
that would be that would be amazing so

00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:02,890
but anyway I think we'll get together

00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:06,380
and we'll brainstorm some ideas there so

00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:11,950
that's all I have that if anyone has any

00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:11,950
questions you can come up the microphone

00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,960
can you explain the process that you go

00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:28,440
through when it comes to accessibility

00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:32,640
and people with visual impairments when

00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:35,850
you are you know trying to decide what

00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:37,260
your clients priorities are and what how

00:36:35,850 --> 00:36:40,109
to bring them down to earth that way

00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:42,840
it's more you know accessible okay so

00:36:40,109 --> 00:36:45,020
the question was how do we do

00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:49,560
accessibility feedback and balance the

00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:51,359
clients priorities versus do owe you

00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,070
what's your what's what is your clients

00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,200
parties like are they are they concern

00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:56,760
with accessibility or not yes of course

00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,890
they are they are concerned with it yeah

00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,619
we have it it's a pretty big deal at the

00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:05,690
University where I work at okay I'm for

00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:08,190
the visually impaired especially okay um

00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:09,690
yeah I mean I don't we don't I don't

00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:11,570
that's not a thing I work on at the

00:37:09,690 --> 00:37:13,770
moment but in previous roles we would

00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:17,910
you know just build in time to do

00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:19,650
accessibility testing and so that was

00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:21,390
you know just like making sure it could

00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:23,130
run on the screen readers I mean

00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:24,690
actually it was started off by just you

00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:30,840
know there's a lot of like online tools

00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:33,119
to to check it sure yeah i mean i would

00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:35,400
say just try to make sure there's time

00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,410
and and get the team I mean that would

00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:39,270
be part of the design brief I would

00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:42,990
imagine so did you guys ever have like

00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:47,820
or ever have actual blind people or say

00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:51,840
older folks trying or any testing one in

00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:54,630
that regards um we've so for well for

00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:58,080
drupal we have yeah definitely yeah this

00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:59,400
week good did you find that valuable yes

00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,380
yea though they uncovered a lot of

00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:03,330
problems um I know like right now

00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,850
there's a views issue right now about

00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:07,560
the I think it's about that something

00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:13,070
about the tables in the description so

00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:13,070
yes yeah yeah okay hmm thanks sure

00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:25,930
hi hi um so what would your advice be

00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:27,690
for dealing with a client that says we

00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:30,550
already do design validation we have

00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:32,140
four see over know those other you know

00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:34,450
pop-up things that comes up on your site

00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:36,040
that says rate the site experience from

00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:37,300
one to five how do you explain them well

00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,210
there might be something more to get

00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:42,400
from design validation than just sure 1

00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:44,230
25 ranking so the question is like if

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,820
the client says they already do design

00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:47,530
validation because they have something

00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:50,170
popping up on the screen and asking them

00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:53,440
to rate the experience well the first

00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:54,940
question is like what kind of what kind

00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,560
of responses are they getting you know

00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:59,530
what percentage of users are actually

00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,690
clicking you know all right why would

00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:04,150
they be motivated to do so and then the

00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:06,640
other thing to ask them is like what are

00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:09,520
you learning from that and they might

00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:11,800
learn they might learn that oh well you

00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:14,110
know it's getting a low rating but they

00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,910
don't know why so the whole thing with

00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:17,920
like this sort of qualitative design

00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:20,410
feedback as you can get out the why why

00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:22,720
things are why people feel why blue

00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:25,450
doesn't work or whatever so yes so just

00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:27,510
try to see if they say no I don't want

00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:33,820
to know why that's a problem then I

00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:36,670
don't know yes I have two questions the

00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:38,200
first one is what percentage of user

00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:41,170
testing do you do on the admin side

00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:43,420
versus like the non admin side and then

00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:44,770
also how do you incorporate feedback

00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,210
that you get from social media like

00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:49,240
Twitter and stuff like that into the

00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:51,730
design process okay so the question was

00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:55,270
don't run away I'm gonna just double

00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:57,010
check so the first question was the sort

00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:59,770
of public facing versus the admin

00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:03,070
testing ok so for something like Commons

00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:06,010
we we definitely need to test the admin

00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:07,360
interface because the whole like the

00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:08,980
people who are going to be downloading

00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:12,150
and evaluating Commons or the people who

00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:14,140
will have to set up the site so we

00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:15,880
haven't gotten into a ton of that yet

00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:19,980
but so I'd say for something like

00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:22,480
Commons it'll be some like I don't know

00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:25,680
6040 maybe forty percent admins sixty

00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,680
percent public something like that

00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:30,960
yeah and then for something like you

00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,700
know Acquia cloud it's all you know

00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,160
whatever the user interface is that the

00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:37,470
the lead developer whoever is using

00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,390
that's that's like we consider that

00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:40,670
public peace so what I'm hearing is that

00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:45,630
it all just depends on the project

00:40:40,670 --> 00:40:46,980
basically yeah yeah so I'm sorry what

00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:49,860
was your second question social media

00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:52,770
yeah okay so if someone like tweets and

00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:56,070
says something what like well we just

00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:58,440
keep track of it like you know we've had

00:40:56,070 --> 00:41:00,810
we've certainly had feedback that's come

00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,490
through in different formats comments

00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:04,350
and tweets and things like that but we

00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:05,970
want to kind of like make sure it comes

00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:09,810
into this greater pool of feedback

00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:11,730
because if it like if we start hearing

00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:14,220
things over and over again then then we

00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:16,920
know it's a it's a priority and if it's

00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:20,060
just like a one-off then you know we

00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,300
can't we can't do everything so just

00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,300
okay thank you

00:41:31,949 --> 00:41:38,609
how would you how would you handle a

00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:41,319
situation where you have someone a

00:41:38,609 --> 00:41:43,299
stakeholder probably a manager or your

00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:45,489
CEO or someone like that in your

00:41:43,299 --> 00:41:46,900
organization really wants things to be a

00:41:45,489 --> 00:41:48,789
certain way really likes a certain

00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:52,539
feature or wants it to work a certain

00:41:48,789 --> 00:41:55,690
way and your usability testing either

00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:58,089
goes contrary to that or isn't really

00:41:55,690 --> 00:42:01,049
indicate one way or the other so so how

00:41:58,089 --> 00:42:03,549
do you balance that out very carefully

00:42:01,049 --> 00:42:06,190
so the other question is like what

00:42:03,549 --> 00:42:07,660
happens if a CT like someone higher up

00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,940
in the organization or a stakeholder

00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:11,349
wants things a certain way but your your

00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:15,789
user testing and use your feedback

00:42:11,349 --> 00:42:17,079
doesn't exactly match that well you know

00:42:15,789 --> 00:42:20,529
you can go back to like what are the

00:42:17,079 --> 00:42:23,099
goals of the project think about you

00:42:20,529 --> 00:42:25,479
know what your success criteria is and

00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:28,839
you know if the user testing doesn't

00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:30,549
like play out with you know this is like

00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:32,170
success criteria then then there's

00:42:30,549 --> 00:42:35,709
that's there's that I mean the other

00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:37,959
thing is like you know they're not the

00:42:35,709 --> 00:42:42,910
end user so if you can gently remind

00:42:37,959 --> 00:42:44,349
them not you know so I I guess there's

00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:45,999
probably more you can do but that's

00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:48,190
where I would start just you know

00:42:45,999 --> 00:42:51,849
explaining like well we think it'll work

00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:55,180
better for these guys because so does

00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:57,099
that answer your question yeah as best

00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:58,900
as it can be answered I think okay if

00:42:57,099 --> 00:43:02,680
you have specifics we can talk

00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:05,619
afterwards sometimes they're just gonna

00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:09,779
say no you're sometimes they'll say no

00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:09,779
yeah it definitely yeah

00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:18,200
Hey hi um I wanted to ask how does all

00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:21,050
this fit into an agile process so when

00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:22,580
you do a design does the whole thing

00:43:21,050 --> 00:43:25,160
have to be completely finished by the

00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:29,240
time you go into the first sprint or do

00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:30,560
you undo parts of it and then implement

00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,430
some of it saying that in the first

00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,200
sprint and then the second question

00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:35,240
because I think I know the answer is to

00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,210
the first one how do you communicate

00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:40,400
that to the client and to make sure that

00:43:38,210 --> 00:43:42,020
they don't you know if they used to

00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:46,040
working with all more old fashions at

00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:49,040
waterfall methods how do you um just

00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:52,099
give them the was the word I had you

00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,089
give them the certainty that the whole

00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:55,250
thing is going to be finished by the end

00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:58,010
of the project without them actually

00:43:55,250 --> 00:44:00,800
seeing pretty much the whole finished

00:43:58,010 --> 00:44:04,040
projects in Photoshop or something okay

00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:07,780
so working with em agile well I'm glad

00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:09,980
you asked that's a good point i we I

00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:11,930
think you got it you've got it like sort

00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:13,310
of maybe set up some sort of milestones

00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:15,050
where you start showing them designs

00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:17,570
early so that there's again no nasty

00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:20,570
surprises first a lot of stakeholders

00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:23,960
it's hard for them to envision things at

00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:26,300
an early stage so you know maybe maybe

00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:28,310
you don't yeah because it depends on

00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,480
your stakeholders but I mean I would

00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:32,030
definitely like start showing them

00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,810
things earlier possible because then if

00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:34,990
it's starting to go in the wrong

00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:38,660
direction you can make that correction

00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:40,310
and you know in terms of like sort of

00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:42,020
hitting those milestones like that's why

00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:43,430
you have like in our design briefs we

00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:46,790
have the must haves and the should haves

00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:49,250
and then nice-to-haves so focus on the

00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:51,560
must-haves first in that way if you run

00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:52,760
out of time you're not like you know

00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:54,320
it's not going to be a disaster it's

00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,820
just you know good it'll be something

00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:57,380
that you maybe you just work on it do

00:44:55,820 --> 00:45:02,420
you work at a relatively early stage

00:44:57,380 --> 00:45:05,359
with like Photoshop designs or do you go

00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:07,700
to I go to the cook customer with wire

00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:09,589
frames or how do you do that and then

00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:11,990
happened then how do you communicate to

00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:14,690
them that some one thing is that I've

00:45:11,990 --> 00:45:16,130
personally experienced a bit and a bit

00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:18,790
of an issue with if you do if they do

00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:21,980
have properly layout its power

00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:24,170
powerpoint Photoshop designs how you

00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:27,140
kind of tell them all this bits

00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:29,180
finished this bit is kind of in the open

00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:30,859
and I fight I find it my different

00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:32,420
difficult myself by working with

00:45:30,859 --> 00:45:35,059
designers when you saw think hang on

00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:37,720
which bit of this is actually settled

00:45:35,059 --> 00:45:40,880
and which bit of it is still open yeah

00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:43,910
well I mean it'sit's yeah it's designs

00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,260
are always in flight I mean we we we

00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:48,710
have our stakeholders are all internal

00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:51,950
for the most part and we'll start off

00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:54,040
with well like like this recently we we

00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:56,420
actually had them drawing with us so

00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:59,390
that was that was actually pretty cool

00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:03,980
and then from there it gets translated

00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:05,869
into um where I started doing like kind

00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:08,500
of in parallel with two designers one

00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:10,790
person doing like the the photoshop or

00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:12,770
fireworks i should say you know really

00:46:10,790 --> 00:46:17,480
like detailed and then one person doing

00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:20,030
the the sort of a more interactive code

00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:23,420
prototype at the same time and then kind

00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:25,369
of like they come together so that was

00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:27,230
that it was tricky because people are

00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:32,740
like which part should i pay attention

00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:32,740
to so oh thanks that's really

00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,040
anybody else

00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:53,599
a quick question that maybe is related

00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:58,249
to the discussion just had and how do

00:46:53,599 --> 00:47:01,119
you how our customers and clients are

00:46:58,249 --> 00:47:03,410
ready to pay for usability how do you

00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:07,219
put that in your offers and how do

00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:09,019
prices sure I mean so that that that

00:47:07,219 --> 00:47:10,549
isn't a thing we do a talk we abut in

00:47:09,019 --> 00:47:13,880
previous roles we would annoy my

00:47:10,549 --> 00:47:17,569
previous job we would you know strongly

00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:19,759
encourage it because it was like you

00:47:17,569 --> 00:47:21,410
have a better chance of success this

00:47:19,759 --> 00:47:23,690
project will be more successful if we

00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:26,209
can take the time and show it to users

00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:29,719
you know take their feedback incorporate

00:47:26,209 --> 00:47:30,890
it and I don't know it's it's a balance

00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:32,989
I mean sometimes it gets cut from the

00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:35,779
budget but you know I don't I almost

00:47:32,989 --> 00:47:37,369
don't see how any sane person would want

00:47:35,779 --> 00:47:39,200
to cut that you know you might just

00:47:37,369 --> 00:47:41,420
scale it back but you can't I don't

00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:43,459
think it's a great idea to and a Takuya

00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:47,029
why didn't you do it differently there

00:47:43,459 --> 00:47:49,279
yeah at aqueous so it's it is part of

00:47:47,029 --> 00:47:52,940
the process it just is because it's the

00:47:49,279 --> 00:47:55,729
product you do the weird answer also for

00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:57,739
clients ya know we're only we're only

00:47:55,729 --> 00:48:00,199
internal we don't out to usability for

00:47:57,739 --> 00:48:05,170
clients but yeah so but yeah everyone's

00:48:00,199 --> 00:48:05,170
pretty accepting of that sure

00:48:08,859 --> 00:48:10,920
