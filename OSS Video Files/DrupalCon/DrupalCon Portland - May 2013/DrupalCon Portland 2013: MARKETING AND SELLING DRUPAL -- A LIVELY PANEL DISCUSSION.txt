Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: MARKETING AND SELLING DRUPAL -- A LIVELY PANEL DISCUSSION
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	Drupal is at an inflection point. While the recent adoption trends have been positive, the content management system (CMS) space is becoming more competitive. The proprietary CMSs are starting to take notice and the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt) campaigns against Drupal have just begun. In this panel discussion, we will explore and recommend ways to better position, sell, and market Drupal. We will share actual success stories of how large, enterprise-level Drupal deals were won.

We will address items like:

* How does a boutique, Drupal-centric agency win a seven-figure engagement and compete against the behemoth proprietary CMSs?
* How do we grow and evangelize Drupal outside of the existing echo-chamber (i.e. those that are already drinking the Drupal kool-aid)?
* When are request for proposals (RFPs) worth responding to?
* What kind of marketing activities are the most beneficial?
* How can someone get involved with Drupal at the local level?

The moderator and three panelists have a wealth of "in the trenches" experience they can offer. The highlights include:
* An employee of the Drupal Association that has cat-herded and organized numerous marketing activities.
* An owner of an award-winning Drupal agency since 2006.
* The author of a Drupal SEO book and presenter at multiple conferences.
* An organizer of a popular Drupalcamp for four years, two Drupal Business Summits, and one of the top-10 most popular Drupal user groups in the world (according to meetup.com).

We would like to hear from you! What other topics would you like to see covered?

yeah they're out there yep all right so

00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,450
our first question which we can ask each

00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:19,580
of the panelists is how are you going

00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:21,049
about marketing and selling Drupal so

00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:26,630
who would like to start us off on that

00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:30,320
one I will Glen great how are y'all

00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:31,820
doing thanks for being here so it's kind

00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,880
of it's a very broad question but our

00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:37,610
primary focus in marketing and selling

00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,580
Drupal as an agency has been to partner

00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,520
with other Drupal firms we made a

00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:46,340
strategic decision about six years ago

00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:48,440
to not develop Drupal websites and

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,540
instead only focus on the marketing of

00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,490
Drupal websites and that way we were

00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,650
able to partner with many different

00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:57,560
companies in the Drupal space without

00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:00,110
being a competitive threat and so that's

00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,460
where we focused focused our efforts is

00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,760
in building those relationships and

00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,710
partnerships and that's where we get

00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:11,750
over half of our customers come from

00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:13,940
referrals from Drupal shops so the

00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,160
drupal association is here to support a

00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,130
community a global community and we have

00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:22,070
over 900,000 drupal.org profile names

00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:25,850
and right now in terms of Association

00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:27,800
membership we have 3,000 members so we

00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,570
have a really big goal of reaching into

00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,360
the community raising awareness about

00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:34,310
the drupal association getting more

00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:37,220
participation in our programs that could

00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,960
range from drupalcon to bind a

00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,740
membership or supporting partner

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:46,190
partnership or even participating in our

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,870
sprints to upgrade drupal.org and even

00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,590
some of our marketing programs at global

00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:54,140
training days so we use a lot of

00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:57,890
community communication to achieve that

00:05:54,140 --> 00:06:00,650
and so you'll see different you know

00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:04,070
content strategies around blog posts and

00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,930
email campaigns trying to do a lot more

00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:09,230
by working through our channels such as

00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:12,320
the training companies as well as our

00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:16,660
hosting companies and really any way we

00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,660
can get the message out to the community

00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:23,500
yeah so at media current we believe

00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:26,290
almost entirely in an inbound marketing

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,970
strategy in an approach and we believe

00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:32,720
marketing really starts with effective

00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:34,760
positioning and the key for us we feel

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,860
like is positioning ourselves as experts

00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:40,430
in the marketplace and we feel like

00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:43,010
experts need to do two things we feel

00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,440
like experts speak and write a lot about

00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:48,070
their subject matter so much of our

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:51,050
inbound marketing is predicated around

00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:53,470
generating fresh relevant content it's

00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:57,290
really a content generation strategy and

00:06:53,470 --> 00:07:00,530
we implement things like eNewsletters

00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:03,890
case studies blogging webinars video

00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:07,820
interviews with customers in all of that

00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:09,860
creates a cumulative effect for lead

00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:14,270
generation which we really believe is

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:17,090
the is the lifeblood of any agency like

00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:19,400
ours and those leads then get turned

00:07:17,090 --> 00:07:22,520
over into sales one other quick thought

00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:26,240
a question I've heard before is if I

00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:27,860
work at a growing Drupal agency or even

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,430
if you're a freelancer or smaller

00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:33,890
boutique firm which should i hire first

00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,350
somebody to focus on marketing or

00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:38,800
somebody to focus on sales I would

00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:41,690
highly recommend you focus on marketing

00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,360
initially marketing is going to help

00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:47,060
position and align your sales and

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:50,210
business development to be successful so

00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,340
if you're having that debate I'm here to

00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,680
tell you that we've seen a really

00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:58,100
positive impact by hiring marketing

00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:02,900
first he's been able to generate a ton

00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:06,010
of content that is enabled our business

00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:08,690
development to be more successful

00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:11,450
excellent thank you very much so then

00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:14,300
the next question is when we're

00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:17,030
competing against other shops and

00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:19,310
sometimes not just other similar-sized

00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:22,040
shops but some very large proprietary

00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:24,950
organizations how do we go up against

00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,950
that competition and how do we win bids

00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:30,010
against competition that seems over our

00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:34,969
heads so who would like to take that one

00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:38,360
yeah so we recently announced last week

00:08:34,969 --> 00:08:41,180
a really big win the weather com the

00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,979
weather channel is migrating to Jubal we

00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:47,060
made that announcement along with Acquia

00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:49,520
our partner in that deal last week so

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,880
how does it deal like that come about

00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:55,520
just to give you guys a little bit of

00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:58,850
history I think one thing people have a

00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:01,250
major misconception around is that you

00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:04,460
know deals like that get closed in a

00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:07,250
smoky boardroom you know over a couple

00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:09,830
of hours a deal like the weather channel

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:12,470
is about a one year sale cycle I mean we

00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:15,190
literally started building awareness to

00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:20,150
the Weather Channel about a year ago

00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:22,670
it's a very thorough evaluation process

00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:26,540
so it really it starts with a where

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:29,420
pneus but I really believe that the key

00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:32,930
to sales is effectively pre-closing

00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:35,240
along the way so at media current we

00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:40,660
have four key criteria as part of that

00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:44,150
pre-closing the four criteria our budget

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:47,000
determining if the organization has an

00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:51,170
appropriate budget for what they're

00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:54,080
trying to do timeline is what they're

00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:57,650
wanting to do are they looking at it in

00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:00,440
a realistic timeline third and probably

00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:02,330
the most important what problems are we

00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,020
trying to solve what are their pain

00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:09,710
points how does Drupal align with those

00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:13,250
problems and forth is are we talking to

00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:15,080
the right people are we in front of the

00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:19,370
decision-makers who actually have

00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:21,020
purchasing decision authority and then

00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:25,480
what we did with the weather channel is

00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:27,770
really validating a lot of the

00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:31,190
perceptions that they had of open source

00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:33,620
and Drupal in the first place so we

00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:36,440
highlighted you know the benefits around

00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:38,690
cost savings we highlighted the fact of

00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:42,889
you know how innovative triple was

00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:45,109
flexibility all of those things and we

00:10:42,889 --> 00:10:49,029
and took it to the next level because

00:10:45,109 --> 00:10:51,920
the weather channel pushed back and said

00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:54,819
we hear your claims we want to actually

00:10:51,920 --> 00:11:00,589
see it so we went through a series of

00:10:54,819 --> 00:11:02,509
demos and proof of concepts with them we

00:11:00,589 --> 00:11:05,689
engage them in a discovery phase

00:11:02,509 --> 00:11:09,049
in-depth discovery phase and now we're

00:11:05,689 --> 00:11:12,980
moving on to the to the migration so for

00:11:09,049 --> 00:11:15,889
us that's how a large enterprise deal is

00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:18,290
one and i think you know it's important

00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:21,350
to note as well that you know everybody

00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:23,720
looks at aqua as you know the the large

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:26,329
800-pound gorilla and the aqua in the in

00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:30,730
the drupal space and in reality they're

00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:33,019
there 10 times smaller than sdl tridion

00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:35,869
they're much smaller than adobe

00:11:33,019 --> 00:11:38,359
Microsoft SharePoint so this is truly

00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:40,639
David versus Goliath stuff but as

00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:42,859
marketers as salespeople that's what we

00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:46,429
live for right and it's really exciting

00:11:42,859 --> 00:11:50,299
so anyway I could talk a lot longer

00:11:46,429 --> 00:11:52,009
about this but awesome thanks Dave so we

00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:54,019
got some feedback that just came through

00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:56,449
on the Twitter channel so Jaden says

00:11:54,019 --> 00:12:00,350
that we need to liven up this is

00:11:56,449 --> 00:12:05,110
supposed to be a lively discussion there

00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:07,489
we go Ben's back to his pushups nice and

00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:10,639
havior is wondering if this is being

00:12:07,489 --> 00:12:13,910
recorded and yes it is so moving on to

00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,529
the next question how do we grow and

00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:17,779
evangelize Drupal outside of the

00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:20,629
existing echo chamber so we come to a

00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:22,279
lot of camps and we sponsor these events

00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:24,769
and we do really good at promoting

00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:26,539
ourselves to ourselves but how do we get

00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:29,209
outside and really start to make a

00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:33,649
difference in marketing Drupal in the

00:12:29,209 --> 00:12:35,419
unavenged world of the CMS right well

00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:37,819
that's right we have an echo chamber

00:12:35,419 --> 00:12:40,669
here in the Drupal community and we all

00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:43,129
know how awesome Drupal is but we need

00:12:40,669 --> 00:12:45,289
to tell people outside of here outside

00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:47,419
of this community why they should be

00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:49,100
adopting Drupal and the drupal

00:12:47,419 --> 00:12:50,629
association is starting to take more of

00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,459
a role in this area and i'm really

00:12:50,629 --> 00:12:53,690
excited about that especially as we've

00:12:52,459 --> 00:12:54,980
hired

00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,380
someone with some great product

00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:00,970
marketing experience names Joe sailor I

00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:07,210
think he's in the audience today but

00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:07,210
there he is he's already waived so

00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:13,880
welcome buddy that's right so our Drupal

00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:16,700
shops have been doing a lot of work and

00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,470
investing in doing the marketing out of

00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,910
out into the ecosystem but they need

00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:22,040
some air coverage I think that's your

00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:23,390
favorite word right now we are here to

00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:25,790
provide that air coverage and there's a

00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:29,540
couple ways we do that so we want to

00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:32,900
grow the community focusing on really

00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:34,700
two major audiences developer naturally

00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,830
we need to keep getting more developers

00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:38,570
to come into our community and adopt

00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:39,980
Drupal because we have to keep

00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,540
increasing that talent pool I know

00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,070
everyone's looking for talent and so

00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:47,120
that's really important for all of us to

00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:48,710
scale and also to keep growing the

00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,200
contributions and innovation of the

00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:54,100
project also developers are convincing

00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:56,630
their bosses to adopt Drupal in-house so

00:13:54,100 --> 00:14:00,980
we have a developer marketing strategy

00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:03,650
as well as a business evaluator type of

00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:06,830
approach as well and obviously we need

00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:08,510
to talk to the cios the CMOS and get

00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:11,330
them to understand all the great

00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:13,700
benefits all the wonderful stories that

00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:15,710
we have here with Drupal and how they

00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,750
can bring that to bear their company as

00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:20,630
well so we have a couple things that

00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:22,190
we're doing drupalcon itself is a great

00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:24,910
marketing platform and something that

00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:27,050
we're going to be working on to to keep

00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,170
accelerating not just the project but

00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:32,900
accelerating the drop Drupal adoption

00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:35,600
reaching out more to the CIO CMO market

00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:38,030
through our media partners and press

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,970
releases and also oh my gosh a marketing

00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:42,230
budget that we could actually do some

00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:45,740
marketing spend to reach into other

00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:48,770
communities and and bring them in but

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:51,740
also the attendee base here is roughly

00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:54,260
fifty percent newbies so that means

00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:56,690
drupalcon is already attracting a lot of

00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,400
new developers and site builders into

00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,350
the community so that's one way that

00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,750
we're reaching outside and bringing

00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:04,370
people in and onboarding them but we

00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,580
also have sorry I've got a little list

00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,680
here

00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:09,360
so outside of the PR that we're doing

00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,820
we're also starting to look at

00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,620
drupal.org DRI's mentioned this in his

00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,390
keynote so we're going to be creating

00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:18,330
landing pages for these different

00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:20,310
personas and doing campaigns to using a

00:15:18,330 --> 00:15:22,710
content marketing strategy to attract

00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:24,570
people to drupal.org and giving them

00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,800
this landing page where they can get all

00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:27,300
the information that they need and pass

00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:29,030
them off to the market place where they

00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:33,180
can find a shop that they can work with

00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:34,350
and also global training days ille is

00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,910
all the training companies around the

00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,770
world on the same day reach into their

00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:39,870
local markets and attract more people in

00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:43,920
to learn drupal so these are a few

00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:46,920
different things we're doing so I would

00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,110
like to give you guys a practical tip

00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,790
for how you can grow and evangelize

00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,640
Drupal outside of the existing echo

00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:55,620
chamber how many of you in the room

00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:59,070
either yourself or somebody that works

00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:02,880
with you have contributed any lines of

00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:05,910
code to Drupal 8 core raise your hand

00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,650
it's probably 10 12 20 I don't know

00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:10,290
people in the room how many of you have

00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:14,250
did any testing or anything at all

00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:18,060
related to Drupal 8 okay more like twice

00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:19,440
as many so when Drupal 8 is is it comes

00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,910
out it's going to be a big announcement

00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,950
and there's gonna be a big press release

00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:25,110
and stuff like that and all you have to

00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:29,310
do is write your own press release that

00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:31,530
says Drupal 8 came out and we did this

00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:34,680
this this this and this to develop

00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:37,020
Drupal 8 and suddenly you have taken

00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:39,570
ownership of the new cycle in your local

00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:41,250
area in your region because because

00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:43,140
you've taken something that's big and

00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,490
global and impersonal and you've made it

00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,370
something that a local reporter can

00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:49,140
really you know sink their teeth into by

00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,480
offering up that person who's

00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:53,820
contributed some code to say oh well how

00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,320
are you involved in this in this huge

00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,660
piece of software that's coming out and

00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,130
what what you know our community and I'm

00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,380
from Austin in Austin is you know

00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:03,810
changing the world by contributing you

00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,880
know testing and patches to Drupal very

00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:08,070
very easy thing to do you could do it

00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,680
inside of a couple of hours you get lots

00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:13,830
of exposure and then we also get lots of

00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:16,220
exposure in in the Drupal community so

00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:18,929
that's just one idea that that you could

00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:21,929
that you could use to grow

00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:24,569
great I get Ben that's awesome so moving

00:17:21,929 --> 00:17:26,490
on to the next question our RFP is worth

00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:28,079
it should we would should we be

00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:32,549
responding to our FB so who would like

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:34,799
to take this one so yeah no I mean I

00:17:32,549 --> 00:17:36,570
think I've heard this come up quite a

00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,879
fit quite a few times there's actually

00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:41,580
sessions on you know why you should not

00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:44,580
answer RFPs and when people initially

00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:47,009
hear that they're sort of skeptical they

00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:50,429
say sure conceptually that sounds great

00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:53,309
but RFPs oftentimes are part of you know

00:17:50,429 --> 00:17:55,919
if you target a university a higher-end

00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:58,259
vertical or government and public sector

00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,450
you know rfps have been around 50 years

00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:04,950
I'm not going to be some huge change

00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:08,249
agent to to change the way they view you

00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:10,860
know an RFP process and sure that's

00:18:08,249 --> 00:18:13,590
that's a given I would counter that by

00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:16,879
saying you know you may be in the wrong

00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:20,460
vertical if responding to those rfps are

00:18:16,879 --> 00:18:23,429
not cost effective if your customer

00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:26,549
acquisition cost is so high because you

00:18:23,429 --> 00:18:29,659
have to dedicate resources to respond to

00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:33,929
the RFP you really need to evaluate that

00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:37,200
hard the basic notion is that you're

00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:40,440
much better off spending time on thought

00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,860
leadership and content versus responding

00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:47,970
to an RFP and what many times happens is

00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:50,789
people respond to an RFP that they don't

00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:52,980
have a realistic chance of winning they

00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:56,220
don't spend a lot of upfront time

00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:59,669
qualifying the RFP to find out what

00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:02,039
their win rate might be and they go in

00:18:59,669 --> 00:19:04,379
you know just like gangbusters because

00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:06,360
it's a high-profile you know accountant

00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:09,990
or a university that they may really

00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:13,190
want to work with so again the notion

00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:17,610
focus on thought leadership versus

00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:20,129
responding to rfps and we have seen and

00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:23,730
we're guilty of it way too much

00:19:20,129 --> 00:19:26,879
psychological investment in too few

00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:29,920
deals so you know everybody puts all of

00:19:26,879 --> 00:19:32,860
their energy and emotion in

00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,450
hoping that this one rfp comes to

00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,730
fruition at the end of the quarter

00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,100
rather than taking kind of a more

00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:41,530
diverse approach or strategy in

00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:45,310
spreading out responses among multiple

00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:48,250
verticals or markets they end up getting

00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:50,890
so narrow so much tunnel vision in just

00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,830
this one RFP that if they lose it it's

00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:56,470
just devastating and you know it may

00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:58,150
mean even downsizing or layoffs and you

00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:03,040
certainly don't want to be in in that

00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:04,960
position excellent good answer Dave so

00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,670
moving on to the next question I just

00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,890
noticed that we had our first question

00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:10,360
come through the twitter feed Ben you

00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:14,110
might want to do more push-ups for this

00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:17,080
one this is a Scott horn he asked on

00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:19,300
positioning yourself as an expert do you

00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,490
have all staff create the content or

00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:24,160
certain people dedicated and what

00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:26,170
percentages do you want to take that one

00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,470
or do you want to take that on bed at

00:20:26,170 --> 00:20:31,720
advil achi so we've actually made a

00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,820
shift recently we had certain people who

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:35,320
wrote a lot of content in the company

00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,850
and there's maybe three or four people

00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:40,480
that kind of produced all the content

00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:44,890
that we created and recently we decided

00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:47,100
that we are going to become a much more

00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:49,330
externally focused organization and

00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:52,720
everybody in the company had to produce

00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:55,660
content and not everybody can write well

00:20:52,720 --> 00:21:00,040
so some people do videos but everybody

00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:02,470
from our office manager to me produces

00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:06,550
content and our goal is to push out at

00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:07,930
least one piece of information about our

00:21:06,550 --> 00:21:10,390
company or about marketing or about

00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:11,920
Drupal every single day so we spread it

00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,920
out across the whole company i would i

00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,990
would guess that each person spends less

00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:19,810
than five percent of their time creating

00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:25,930
content but we had to really incentivize

00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:27,520
our team to make that happen so so the

00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:29,230
next question is what kind of marketing

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,910
activities are the most beneficial so

00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:32,860
obviously content creation dave was one

00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,660
of the activities you've already

00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:37,630
mentioned is there any others that come

00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:40,039
to mind we'd like to take that one you

00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:42,679
should submit your website too

00:21:40,039 --> 00:21:45,830
any kind of awards programs that you

00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:47,330
might have seen around because if you've

00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:49,340
built great websites then you know

00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:51,679
submitting your side is free or cheap

00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:54,830
and if you win then it's you know huge

00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:57,109
kudos for you and we have the the Blue

00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:59,809
Drop awards coming up here in a few

00:21:57,109 --> 00:22:02,419
hours actually at six-30 tonight where

00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:04,789
we're going to be handing out prizes for

00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:08,269
all kinds of different categories that

00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:09,409
is you know inexpensive and there's

00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:10,879
there's not a ton of them so it doesn't

00:22:09,409 --> 00:22:12,919
take a lot of time but i would i would

00:22:10,879 --> 00:22:14,960
chime in with Dave and say that if

00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:16,609
content isn't part of your strategy

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,649
that's probably the lowest hanging fruit

00:22:16,609 --> 00:22:19,789
is just writing really interesting

00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:22,669
things that people want to read and

00:22:19,789 --> 00:22:23,960
people want to do business with with you

00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:26,570
know companies that they respect and

00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,749
people that are interesting so so I keep

00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:31,729
doing push ups so so Ben you started the

00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:33,019
Blue Drop Awards what why did you start

00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:39,229
that and how is that part of your

00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:41,629
marketing strategy so it is the Blue

00:22:39,229 --> 00:22:43,220
Drop Awards yes I had a hand in starting

00:22:41,629 --> 00:22:44,720
it it was there were several of us that

00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,639
kind of came together and put that on

00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:50,539
the the goal for us is really to give

00:22:46,639 --> 00:22:53,049
back to the community by shining a big

00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:57,139
spotlight back on some of the best sites

00:22:53,049 --> 00:22:59,570
we're able to make the developers look

00:22:57,139 --> 00:23:01,639
good and so when we actually hand out

00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:04,580
the awards we give out two awards for

00:23:01,639 --> 00:23:06,830
each category one is there's only one

00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,869
website that wins so we give an award to

00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:10,879
that company that owns that website

00:23:08,869 --> 00:23:12,169
because you know it's their website but

00:23:10,879 --> 00:23:14,629
then we give an award to the developer

00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:16,429
and we give both of the awards to the

00:23:14,629 --> 00:23:19,309
developer company so that they can then

00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:20,720
go give the the the website owner the

00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:22,460
award so it makes them look good and

00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,970
that's that's our goal with Blue Drop

00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,080
Awards is to make Drupal look good and

00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:29,960
this year we opened up the voting

00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,599
anybody on the planet could vote so our

00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,129
goal is really to reach people outside

00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:35,479
of the Drupal community to get them to

00:23:34,129 --> 00:23:37,609
come and go oh there are some pretty

00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:40,369
interesting sites here some good stuff

00:23:37,609 --> 00:23:43,700
is being done with Drupal but for us it

00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:45,679
generates a lot of good will to to you

00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,299
know have created that program but you

00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,519
know all of our sponsors are part of

00:23:47,299 --> 00:23:51,679
that it's we do the we do the work but

00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:53,090
we're not you know particularly

00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,789
highlighted outside of the sponsorship

00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,190
area

00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:59,220
so anyway I hope y'all come it'll be fun

00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:00,779
we have a comedian and free beer so if I

00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:04,200
can just add to the marketing activities

00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:06,210
sure so um you know I think it's really

00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,710
fun to do vision and strategy but I

00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:09,059
think where you get your biggest bang

00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:11,220
for the buck is when you bring it back

00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,889
to the basics and that's with market

00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:16,409
research I think you have to really

00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:18,269
understand who your customer is even

00:24:16,409 --> 00:24:20,070
looking at all of your different types

00:24:18,269 --> 00:24:23,009
of customers and maybe even narrowing in

00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:24,359
on who you really need to focus on if

00:24:23,009 --> 00:24:25,590
you don't know your customer you don't

00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:27,269
know how to serve them you won't even

00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:29,009
know what kind of content will really

00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:31,409
resonate with them so I really encourage

00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:34,470
everyone to do that kind of take the

00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:36,479
time to do that kind of work and so talk

00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:39,989
to your customers find out what made

00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:42,269
them choose you and especially talk to

00:24:39,989 --> 00:24:44,099
the ones that decided not to go with you

00:24:42,269 --> 00:24:47,639
and have someone follow up that

00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:49,710
information is really helpful and so I

00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:51,629
know other things are you don't know

00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:53,789
what a SWOT analysis is or the four PS

00:24:51,629 --> 00:24:56,759
of marketing I highly recommend that you

00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:59,129
look that up and do it for your business

00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:03,330
the basics are really important and you

00:24:59,129 --> 00:25:05,879
build from there yeah I would just add

00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:07,739
you know unfortunately I we really don't

00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:10,739
have one I don't have one silver bullet

00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:12,720
to share in terms of you know there's

00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:16,019
one activity that's generating a ton of

00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,940
leads versus another personally in that

00:25:16,019 --> 00:25:21,450
media current we're very big on case

00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:23,639
studies a question comes up you know how

00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:25,919
do you differentiate there's if you're

00:25:23,639 --> 00:25:27,690
if you're the buyer there's ten

00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,849
different firms who all make the same

00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:33,359
claim we all do Drupal development

00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:35,879
design support so how does it how is a

00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:38,519
buyer to differentiate between all of

00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:41,220
those various claims we think the real

00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:43,259
key to differentiation is everybody has

00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:45,869
a reputation everybody has a track

00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:47,609
record in order to validate that track

00:25:45,869 --> 00:25:51,389
record you do that through case studies

00:25:47,609 --> 00:25:54,509
you show how you have solved similar

00:25:51,389 --> 00:25:58,679
problems for other organizations who are

00:25:54,509 --> 00:26:01,859
inquiring about your need so you know

00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:04,440
good one is we've worked in conjunction

00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:05,860
with with phase two and aquia on on

00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:08,950
georgia gov

00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:12,130
it was the first state government agency

00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:16,690
to really do a wide-scale adoption to

00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:19,120
Drupal that use case can be leveraged

00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:22,750
from a marketing standpoint to convince

00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:24,490
the 49 other states who have not adopted

00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:27,970
open source who have not discovered

00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:31,900
Drupal and that case study will help

00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:33,460
validate their decision so yeah if

00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,650
there's one that's been more beneficial

00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,330
I'd probably point to two case studies

00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:42,730
and that's what I'd really strongly

00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:44,830
advocate great I see another question is

00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:46,990
just popped through on Twitter it was in

00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:49,960
dollars what's the size of the Drupal

00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:51,460
market in the US that's that's an

00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,870
interesting one there i don't think i

00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,880
would have an answer off the top of my

00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:58,630
head i will research that and let you

00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:02,470
know yeah i don't know the answer on

00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:04,330
that one either moving on how can

00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:08,350
someone get involved with Drupal at the

00:27:04,330 --> 00:27:10,540
local level wants to take that one okay

00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:12,970
well I can start this one but these two

00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:15,340
are really the pros and kind of practice

00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:17,140
what they preach so there's a lot of

00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:19,660
ways to get involved mean obviously

00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:22,059
whenever you can contribute code back to

00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:24,940
the project reach out to your local

00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:27,730
groups see how you can provide content

00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:30,370
for their meetups and help them maybe

00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:33,460
even offering a space our sponsorship is

00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:34,870
a great way as well and what I just love

00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:37,690
about this community is the co-op

00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:40,059
petition so reach out to other triple

00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:41,950
shops ask them they have common pain

00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:43,360
points and how they're addressing it

00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,220
because everyone's just sharing this

00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,080
knowledge and I think through that you

00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:50,169
also find partnerships where you get

00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:52,299
this amazing what I called the the lead

00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:53,919
load balancer affect you know people are

00:27:52,299 --> 00:27:55,510
saying I'm have this niche and I have

00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,100
that niche and let's partner up and

00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:59,890
there's just this wonderful trust that's

00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:01,870
built up between companies and you know

00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:04,830
it's better that Drupal shop takes that

00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:07,000
lead versus having it just languish so

00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:10,390
those are just a few things oh and the

00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:12,549
other big thing is after you finish your

00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:14,650
client implementation please write it up

00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:17,650
we need case studies on drupal.org and

00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:17,880
if you do I will promote it and share

00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:19,710
what

00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:25,530
community we really need that content

00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:27,900
thank you appreciate it excellent yeah

00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:29,340
let's move on to the next one what are

00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:31,590
some of the latest advancements in

00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:38,610
marketing that Drupal shops can take

00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:40,920
advantage of so there is a so you've

00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:43,770
probably heard of a type of software

00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:45,920
called marketing automation and it's

00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:48,950
it's basically it's a method of engaging

00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:51,000
visitors to your website as individuals

00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:52,260
and so over the last couple years

00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,710
Falacci is actually been in development

00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:56,880
on a marketing automation tool called

00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:59,850
automator and you might have actually

00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,960
seen it out on the showroom floor or you

00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:03,060
can come by and take a look what we did

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,670
really is we try to make it as easy as

00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:07,440
possible for marketers to use Drupal to

00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:10,830
really get the data about what people

00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,170
are doing on a Drupal website and then

00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:16,260
tying that back to individual users you

00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:17,520
get really good visibility into exactly

00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:20,550
who's coming to your site and what

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,560
they're doing and this is not only

00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,580
something that you can use as a shop but

00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,500
it's something that you should be

00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,670
talking with your customers about if

00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,520
they're not already using marketing

00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:32,460
automation because it greatly increases

00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:35,670
the ROI of the dollars they're spending

00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:37,020
with you to build their site by giving

00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:39,930
them tools that help them make more

00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:41,130
money with their website so anyway

00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,960
that's what I do so I don't want to toot

00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:45,240
my horn too much but that's great

00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:51,060
anybody else want to pitch in on any

00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:53,520
other tools so approaches yeah ok so

00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:55,170
let's say you have a limited budget or

00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:57,270
you're just a real small shop and you're

00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:59,340
starting out what would you suggest that

00:29:57,270 --> 00:30:04,230
they would do and where would the focus

00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:07,580
their marketing attention so yeah I mean

00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:10,560
the obvious one again is is content

00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:13,920
focus on on generating content it's a

00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:15,930
big commitment like just somebody asked

00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:19,530
you know how do you go about

00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:22,170
incorporating kind of everybody to

00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:25,320
generate the content we a median set up

00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:27,810
and out an editorial calendar so it's

00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:29,670
based on a rotation but it's definitely

00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:31,049
a team effort we get everybody involved

00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:34,470
in blogging and

00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:37,169
case studies we also do webinars that we

00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:40,230
contribute back to the community but I

00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:41,759
think the obvious 12 is just you know

00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:43,529
the best way to get involved from a

00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,989
marketing standpoint is you know

00:30:43,529 --> 00:30:48,450
Drupal's a democracy get get involved

00:30:45,989 --> 00:30:50,759
with the community go to the meetups

00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:55,169
help organize them get involved with

00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:57,119
your drupalcamp you will get an roi back

00:30:55,169 --> 00:31:00,330
I think the biggest struggle that people

00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:04,830
have is their time constraint so you

00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:08,389
have to be able to incorporate the the

00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:11,999
community aspect into your schedule and

00:31:08,389 --> 00:31:13,590
you will the more you get back I promise

00:31:11,999 --> 00:31:15,210
the more you'll the more you give them

00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:17,999
more you'll get back in return from a

00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:20,009
from a community standpoint and you know

00:31:17,999 --> 00:31:22,320
it does a tremendous amount of job of

00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:24,960
just establishing kind of your Drupal

00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,090
street cred you know if you're involved

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,129
with the community if you're trolling

00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:32,330
the forums if you're answering questions

00:31:29,129 --> 00:31:35,909
your name will get out there I promise

00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:37,739
great alright so we had another question

00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:39,960
come through on Twitter this is from fit

00:31:37,739 --> 00:31:42,330
Alex her question is is there any

00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:51,119
specific techniques to sell or inject

00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:53,669
Drupal into government the question

00:31:51,119 --> 00:32:02,210
again is there any specific way to get

00:31:53,669 --> 00:32:05,070
into Drupal and government yeah mmm I

00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:09,450
there's nothing we don't really focus on

00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:14,190
public sector as much I think it a lot

00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:17,129
of it starts with just evangelism so if

00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:19,399
you're if the person works at a

00:32:17,129 --> 00:32:23,539
government agency and is trying to

00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:27,179
establish introduced Drupal to their

00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:28,499
organization I think just do the things

00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:29,700
that we were talking about earlier you

00:32:28,499 --> 00:32:31,259
want to make sure that you're you're

00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:33,470
talking to the right people more than

00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:33,470
anything

00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:54,020
great what's the name of the session

00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:58,130
Mike excellent thanks all right next

00:32:54,020 --> 00:33:00,080
question how much should you use Drupal

00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:02,000
in your company marketing materials and

00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:04,640
branding and and what should we be aware

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:10,520
of in terms of copyright wants to take

00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:12,100
this one I think you should use it when

00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:14,300
it gives you a competitive advantage

00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,830
when you can show additional value

00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:17,300
because you're a Drupal expert that's

00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:23,620
when you should use it in your in your

00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:26,450
company's marketing the I mean if you're

00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:27,830
if you're going up I don't know it's

00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,840
kind of hard to say it depends on the

00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:31,340
situation in general I think you should

00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,020
mention it I mean if you're if you're

00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,640
specializing in Drupal it should be on

00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:36,470
the home page of your website but i

00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,880
wouldn't say build a Drupal website that

00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:39,890
has your company brand on it I mean

00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:41,510
build build your brand as its own

00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:43,730
standalone thinks at the end of the day

00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:48,050
that's what you own but Meg Drupal part

00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:49,280
of your story and and mention it you

00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:50,660
know don't if you're if you want to sell

00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:52,700
Drupal websites don't go build your

00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,660
website in WordPress so that wasn't

00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:57,770
directed I didn't even in particular

00:33:53,660 --> 00:34:00,920
just you know and if you have questions

00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:04,190
about trademark the trademark for Drupal

00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:07,540
and the Drupal icon is owned by drees

00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:10,370
and you want to go to Drupal calm and

00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:12,620
really read that and understand it I was

00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:16,700
reading it last night to prepare for

00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:19,310
this it's kind of long so you can really

00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:20,750
use Drupal a lot more flexibly when it's

00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:23,030
doing something good for the community a

00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:25,070
program for Drupal but you need to be

00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:28,040
careful when it comes to a commercial

00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:32,360
entity so I just just go to Drupal com

00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:35,179
to check that out yeah just to piggyback

00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:37,520
off of what then was saying it I've

00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:39,919
heard some really polarizing views on

00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,429
this question like if you're an agency

00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:45,500
in you're designing your own website how

00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:46,040
much do you incorporate Drupal into the

00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,340
message

00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:53,240
so at media current we believe strongly

00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:56,240
in mentioning Drupal and it's definitely

00:34:53,240 --> 00:35:00,050
a part of our overall strategy one of

00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:02,630
the biggest mistakes I think I've seen

00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:04,340
agencies make is they position

00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:06,530
themselves too much of it as a

00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:08,990
generalist and on their website they

00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:10,850
laundry list a bunch of different

00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:13,610
service offerings you know they start

00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:16,130
off saying they do triple and then when

00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:18,920
there's a valley in demand or workload

00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:21,710
they then say they do joomla or

00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:25,540
wordpress or Java or other technologies

00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:28,040
or they may say they do SEO or hosting

00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:30,160
don't make that mistake if you're

00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:34,730
committed to positioning yourself as

00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:38,150
experts in Drupal Drupal should be at

00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:40,700
the foremost of the website so and

00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:43,100
you've really got to validate why it is

00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:45,410
you're making claims of being you know

00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:46,820
an expert on the site and that goes back

00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:49,070
to what we were saying about case

00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:51,700
studies and content and blogging and

00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:55,010
video interviews in all of those things

00:35:51,700 --> 00:36:00,260
making sure that they're on part of the

00:35:55,010 --> 00:36:01,940
website as well excellent all right so

00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,740
now we're going to move to open

00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:05,480
questions so if anybody has any

00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:07,940
questions actually one here from adam

00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:09,950
yeah Adams got one here on on Twitter

00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:11,270
and I'll just read that one out in a sec

00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:13,850
but if you have any questions please

00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:15,890
come on up to the microphone or send

00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:18,440
them through his tweets so let's start

00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:19,910
with Adams Adams question is what are

00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,820
some things companies should consider

00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:25,220
before investing in marketing automation

00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:27,610
hmm and thank you for the softball

00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:30,290

00:36:55,430 --> 00:36:59,360
on a website it also changes in a lot of

00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,880
ways it changes the way the

00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:03,620
at a company approaches the market it

00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:05,330
becomes much more focused on the

00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:08,510
individual and with what they need to

00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:10,880
read and see to change their minds so

00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:13,640
you've got to look at doing some prep

00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,100
work around organization who's going to

00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,150
be the primary user of the tool who's

00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:21,070
going to create the content and what

00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:24,260
kind of content needs to be created but

00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:25,610
my personal belief is that the sooner

00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:27,470
you can get the code installed on your

00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,180
site you can start collecting lots and

00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:32,060
lots of data and that can really help to

00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:34,640
inform a lot of those conversations so

00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:37,010
in one aspect you could say don't do any

00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:39,890
prep just get the code on your site and

00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:41,360
then over the course of you know the

00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:43,100
next couple of months you'll see a lot

00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,570
of a lot more information about how

00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,950
people are using your site what content

00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:48,830
they're interested in things like that

00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:50,660
and then that can direct where you know

00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:56,720
what direction you take your your

00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:59,990
content creation but you know I my stuff

00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,580
great thanks Ben all right trying to

00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:02,930
make it Lively it's got a question he's

00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:06,920
going to come on up and another

00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:11,690
gentleman is right there allocate for

00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:13,640
average blog post and or video post if

00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,810
you do those app head all right so I'm

00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,670
going to repeat the question the

00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:20,000
question was how much time do you

00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:22,180
allocate for blog posts or video posts

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:25,880
yeah I think this is a great question

00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:27,380
there was something what a personal my

00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:30,380
organization was was tasked with writing

00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:33,170
a blog post and and it was fantastic it

00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:34,490
was a fantastic blog post so much so

00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:35,900
that it was like you know it was

00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:37,670
probably like four times longer than a

00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,870
blog post ought to be and I asked her

00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:40,310
you know how much time did it take you

00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:44,000
to do this it turns out it took like a

00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:46,640
day and I was just gobsmacked I was like

00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,770
um don't spend a day writing blog posts

00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,690
I had to like you know take deep breaths

00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:52,430
and stuff but yeah I mean you've really

00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:55,700
got to kind of lock that down or people

00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:56,840
really will spend a lot of time we ended

00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,930
up taking that blog post and turning

00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:01,040
into a white paper and it's a fantastic

00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:04,310
white paper but it wasn't a very good

00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,590
blog post setting those boundaries are

00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:10,640
good for me I you know I just I write

00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:12,500
fast and so it I can do blog posts in 30

00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:15,200
minutes maybe

00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,610
but for my team I you know if they're

00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,530
having to do research and stuff I might

00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:20,960
I might say you know don't don't take

00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:23,120
more than an hour hour and a half to get

00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,880
that first draft get some feedback and

00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:27,740
then polish it and put it up but we it

00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,630
to me it's much better to go quick and

00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:34,340
dirty and do lots of content that's

00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:36,860
maybe not as you know perfect it's

00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:39,380
better to be consistent in deliver

00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:41,270
content regularly than it is to every

00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:44,410
once a while put some fantastic piece of

00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:46,430
content up Dave's going to disagree now

00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:48,160
no I think it's a really good question

00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:51,290
too and I mean I'm going to take it to

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:52,790
the next level and give more of a

00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:55,790
holistic view because I get this

00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:58,010
question a lot like we know we need to

00:39:55,790 --> 00:40:00,160
be investing in marketing but we have

00:39:58,010 --> 00:40:03,230
all of this client work how do i balance

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,970
non-billable and billable time if I'm at

00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:07,220
a Drupal agency so I'll just really

00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:09,440
quick tell you the media current model

00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:11,180
we have a seventy percent utilization

00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:13,640
target and everybody looks at me

00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:15,560
initially like wow that seems low so

00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:17,600
thirty percent of our week up to 12

00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:20,300
hours is dedicated to different

00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:22,610
categories the biggest thing I would

00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:25,340
emphasize to everybody is treat your

00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:27,740
internal work like marketing like you

00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,290
would quiet work so you have to do like

00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:31,580
what Michaels getting at assign

00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:33,890
estimates to how long a blog post would

00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:37,130
take for us it's we allocate up to four

00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:39,110
hours from the first draft to when you

00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:41,090
know Adam actually publishes it to our

00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:44,980
site and it goes through an accuracy and

00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:48,890
editing you know check but if you're not

00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:52,970
tracking that activity internally it can

00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:56,420
quickly go sideways so again make sure

00:40:52,970 --> 00:41:00,260
we have not only marketing we track how

00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:03,160
much time we spend on sales and rfps we

00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:05,420
track how much time we spend on internal

00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:07,970
distributions and products we track a

00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:10,760
much community time that we give back we

00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:12,860
have project managers I get to sometimes

00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:16,460
act like I'm a client and be able to

00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:18,650
approve and define requirements so you

00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:21,800
know that's part of our process that

00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:24,860
we've woven into into media current and

00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:26,380
I just again can't emphasize enough make

00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:29,480
sure that you try

00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:30,980
this the marketing activity time you

00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:32,930
need to know what kind of our away

00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,190
you're getting what kind of time you're

00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:37,310
spending on each of these activities

00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:38,660
that we talked about excellent so we got

00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:40,010
a couple more tweaks that came through

00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:46,430
and i believe is it gentlemen right here

00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:49,340
that had a question i had discussing

00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:52,310
that there are some use cases which

00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:54,830
drupal handles really well so there was

00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:57,830
this question in between that how do you

00:41:54,830 --> 00:42:01,460
compete against other proprietary CMS

00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:05,510
platforms so are there some occasions

00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:07,760
where you saw a project and you were

00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:10,790
analyzed it and said that oh no Drupal

00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,230
is not a good fit for that or did you go

00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:14,480
the other way and say that oh we are

00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:18,080
going to write custom modules do this to

00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:20,690
that and eventually make the make Drupal

00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:23,630
fit the problem like what is this

00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:26,450
balance so just to be sure we understand

00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:28,520
your question is do you always offer

00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:30,890
Drupal as a solution or is there some

00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:34,280
times where you say no this might work

00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:41,089
better okay that's another really good

00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:43,369
question so we only target organizations

00:42:41,089 --> 00:42:46,040
that are already drinking the Drupal

00:42:43,369 --> 00:42:48,650
kool-aid if they're you know platform

00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:52,790
agnostic they haven't selected a CMS we

00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:55,580
just we don't chase those I've heard

00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:57,740
this come up a lot to lately what about

00:42:55,580 --> 00:43:00,859
just recommending the right tool for the

00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:03,710
right job well for us our tool is Drupal

00:43:00,859 --> 00:43:08,720
so we are always going to recommend

00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:10,339
Drupal and if it's just we'll look at it

00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:13,640
if we don't feel like it's a good fit

00:43:10,339 --> 00:43:16,970
but Drupal is so flexible now there's so

00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:20,390
many modules we rarely encounter a

00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:22,670
project where somebody needs a content

00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:26,960
management system where we cannot make

00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:30,320
Drupal work so and then I think Teresa's

00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:31,790
keynote was great I mean he hit on a lot

00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:34,970
of what the differences are between

00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:38,960
Drupal and the proprietary CMS's and

00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:39,190
it's your job you know as the sales kind

00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:41,650
of

00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:43,690
to make sure that that messaging is

00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:46,270
getting through around what the the

00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:49,480
value proposition is of Drupal versus

00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:50,710
proprietary okay great anybody else want

00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:53,290
to tackle that one before we move on to

00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:55,060
the next question no all right Scott

00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:56,859
horn has another one he says for clients

00:43:55,060 --> 00:44:00,300
that require coding a new reusable

00:43:56,859 --> 00:44:06,520
module do you use the benefits of

00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:11,950
contributing code as a selling point who

00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:15,040
wants to take that one then I think it

00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:16,390
depends on the customer some customers

00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,859
are very you know they believe in the

00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:19,150
community aspect they believe you know

00:44:17,859 --> 00:44:20,380
hey I'm getting this up in source thing

00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:21,579
and if I can get your be back that's

00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,599
good for everybody because I'm getting

00:44:21,579 --> 00:44:24,220
the benefit of everybody else you know

00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:26,380
the whole story some customers really

00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:28,210
kind of believe in that and other

00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:29,770
customers are frankly just cut throat

00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:31,270
and like no you know I went on my own

00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:33,700
code if you write it for me I own it and

00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:35,680
blah blah blah so I think it really is

00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:38,200
it's really a you make the call at the

00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:39,339
moment but I would always ask obviously

00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,349
this community is built around

00:44:39,339 --> 00:44:43,869
contributing back cool things that we've

00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:46,119
all done so it should be part of the

00:44:43,869 --> 00:44:47,920
process that you ask for permission to

00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:50,069
contribute back anything that you're

00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:53,800
developing I think it's a great

00:44:50,069 --> 00:44:55,270
marketing message I think it's a great

00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,980
standpoint but you got to use it I mean

00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:58,329
let's be honest when the rubber meets

00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:02,790
the road you're trying to make a sale so

00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:08,619
use it when it helps and and it'll help

00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:11,349
great another question from Twitter from

00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:13,150
Kevin mol he says what do you find was

00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:18,220
the best way to get people to attend

00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:20,530
your webinars yeah I mean we're just

00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:22,869
starting to evaluate that ourselves and

00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:24,040
create a webinar program and when the

00:45:22,869 --> 00:45:25,839
first things we're doing is reaching out

00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,250
to our audience to understand what do

00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,810
they want to hear about right it's all

00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,890
about the market research and making

00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:32,050
sure you have the content that they

00:45:29,890 --> 00:45:35,260
actually want so I just always take it

00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:37,240
back to the basics and what we also find

00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:39,460
is if you just do something on just a

00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:41,890
case study it's it's just not

00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:43,839
educational enough so people are really

00:45:41,890 --> 00:45:45,730
looking to learn something so what is

00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:49,690
that educational hook that you can bring

00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:51,310
to the table also yes you want to make

00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:52,310
sure there's a nice schedule and you get

00:45:51,310 --> 00:45:55,910
it out there for

00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:59,180
to start registering but make sure you

00:45:55,910 --> 00:46:01,100
do a lot of alerts three days before two

00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:03,110
days before one day before people sign

00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:06,200
up at the last minute more often than

00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:13,640
not so just make sure your scheduling

00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:16,550
for the promotion is is really tight so

00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:18,410
one of the things that we did with sorry

00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:23,150
to do this again but with Automator is

00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:25,400
to integrate the GoToWebinar package so

00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:27,080
that if you've set up a landing page

00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:29,540
you've got a webinar it actually tracks

00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:31,430
sign ups and so it makes it really easy

00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:33,110
for you to target your house list

00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:35,630
against people who've shown interest in

00:46:33,110 --> 00:46:37,730
that particular vertical and then follow

00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:38,870
up with people who either you think

00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:41,300
things should be there and they haven't

00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:44,630
signed up yet or people that attend your

00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:46,100
your webinar so I mean it'sit's um the

00:46:44,630 --> 00:46:49,370
integration pieces are really important

00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:50,900
so I think that's the understand what do

00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:52,490
do good webinars and people sign up for

00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:59,590
I mean I think to me to me that's the

00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:59,590
main part excellent any other questions

00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:08,559
one right back there we got a tip coming

00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:10,779
up

00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:12,880
this goes this goes back to marketing

00:47:10,779 --> 00:47:15,130
Drupal within your organization I work

00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:18,400
at a government organization we're about

00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:20,439
1,400 people and very diverse and our

00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,449
department has decided I work in is that

00:47:20,439 --> 00:47:24,459
Drupal is a great solution but we can't

00:47:22,449 --> 00:47:26,469
just force everybody to use Drupal so

00:47:24,459 --> 00:47:27,849
I've been talking about Drupal I've been

00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:30,130
presenting it i presented at our

00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:32,439
internal technology meetings and we

00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:35,259
finally just stumbled over this concept

00:47:32,439 --> 00:47:37,269
where we have drupal fridays every other

00:47:35,259 --> 00:47:39,160
friday the organization will give you an

00:47:37,269 --> 00:47:41,709
hour plus your lunch you bring your

00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:43,509
lunch to a room and a lot of these

00:47:41,709 --> 00:47:46,209
people I've been talking to I had about

00:47:43,509 --> 00:47:48,459
10 people come up we're stunned when I

00:47:46,209 --> 00:47:50,769
had them install Drupal themselves and

00:47:48,459 --> 00:47:52,779
actually set up a content type and put

00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:54,670
in a field and make a view they were

00:47:52,779 --> 00:47:56,559
shocked they said this is what you've

00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:59,079
been talking about all this time we can

00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:00,789
do this and while we're not necessarily

00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:02,289
trying to push development out into

00:48:00,789 --> 00:48:03,999
those departments we just wanted them to

00:48:02,289 --> 00:48:05,799
understand that you know this is how we

00:48:03,999 --> 00:48:08,229
can build applications for you and

00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:09,339
everybody is very excited I think that

00:48:08,229 --> 00:48:11,079
we're going to have we just had our

00:48:09,339 --> 00:48:12,699
first one we're going to have a lot more

00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:15,219
people come in fact we thinking it might

00:48:12,699 --> 00:48:17,019
become kind of a problem so I'm telling

00:48:15,219 --> 00:48:18,880
some of the attendees you know that I

00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:20,469
spent quite a bit of time with that okay

00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,019
you know you need to pay me back by

00:48:20,469 --> 00:48:24,459
helping the next group that comes in you

00:48:23,019 --> 00:48:26,019
know you guys need to start mentoring

00:48:24,459 --> 00:48:28,299
and you know helping them with some of

00:48:26,019 --> 00:48:29,829
the simple steps but that was extremely

00:48:28,299 --> 00:48:33,039
effective and I was really really

00:48:29,829 --> 00:48:34,749
surprised after showing Drupal and after

00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:36,549
talking to people about it how they

00:48:34,749 --> 00:48:38,170
really didn't get it until they put

00:48:36,549 --> 00:48:39,640
their hands on it and actually did it so

00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:42,999
that's all I wanted to say thank you

00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:45,369
awesome that's great anybody else have

00:48:42,999 --> 00:48:49,019
any questions or contributions that

00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:49,019
you'd like to make Michael

00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:57,939
congratulations by the way you should

00:48:55,269 --> 00:49:00,069
get to do a proof of concept so where do

00:48:57,939 --> 00:49:01,719
you draw the line between kind of what

00:49:00,069 --> 00:49:04,839
you do for free as part of the sales

00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:07,359
process and when do you start charging

00:49:04,839 --> 00:49:10,660
for what you might need to do to

00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:12,910
actually win the deal you know and will

00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:14,799
they pay or not paid any that's a really

00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:17,349
big question in the design community too

00:49:14,799 --> 00:49:19,359
because a lot of times designers will do

00:49:17,349 --> 00:49:21,219
comps up and there's this expectation

00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:22,299
from the client that you'll do it for

00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:24,819
free

00:49:22,299 --> 00:49:27,279
and that's round upon in a lot of cases

00:49:24,819 --> 00:49:28,689
and so how how do you tend to deal with

00:49:27,279 --> 00:49:31,239
that Dave you want to take that one so

00:49:28,689 --> 00:49:34,269
yeah I mean the cliche ish answer is

00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:39,069
definitely it's a case by case basis you

00:49:34,269 --> 00:49:43,529
know if it's where we draw the line from

00:49:39,069 --> 00:49:46,239
estimating versus consulting is if we're

00:49:43,529 --> 00:49:49,630
providing them deliverables that they're

00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:53,140
going to be able to leverage internally

00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:56,410
then we consider that billable work so

00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:58,179
the proof of concept work with the with

00:49:56,410 --> 00:50:02,650
weather com with the weather channel was

00:49:58,179 --> 00:50:07,329
you know available engagement and it was

00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:09,609
beyond just doing a demo it was we want

00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:12,130
to actually validate how you know

00:50:09,609 --> 00:50:14,979
whether feeds aggregate in Drupal and

00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:17,859
how the services layer works and how so

00:50:14,979 --> 00:50:21,089
you know that kind of consultation is

00:50:17,859 --> 00:50:24,069
beyond providing you know an estimate

00:50:21,089 --> 00:50:26,319
but yeah it's it's it's a tough one I

00:50:24,069 --> 00:50:29,650
mean you know because you're trying to

00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:33,369
establish credibility with that prospect

00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:35,109
and show your depth of knowledge but you

00:50:33,369 --> 00:50:37,660
know at the same time you can't you have

00:50:35,109 --> 00:50:40,749
to draw on you can't give away your you

00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:45,009
know free advice despite who the logo is

00:50:40,749 --> 00:50:47,499
you know so just we're in a good

00:50:45,009 --> 00:50:50,170
position drupal the messaging the

00:50:47,499 --> 00:50:53,289
awareness is getting out the demand is

00:50:50,170 --> 00:50:55,779
high so i would just say don't get taken

00:50:53,289 --> 00:50:57,939
advantage of because of that your time

00:50:55,779 --> 00:51:02,019
is your most valuable commodity and you

00:50:57,939 --> 00:51:03,130
need to get paid for it yeah great I saw

00:51:02,019 --> 00:51:05,469
a couple of other people that were

00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:06,999
starting to get up if you have a loud

00:51:05,469 --> 00:51:08,709
voice you want to just stand up and belt

00:51:06,999 --> 00:51:10,719
it out I can repeat it back but is there

00:51:08,709 --> 00:51:13,059
any other questions that anybody has

00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:15,420
before we move on to the resources right

00:51:13,059 --> 00:51:15,420
back there

00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:36,749
right so how do you deal with the whole

00:51:34,799 --> 00:51:39,059
aftermath you've launched the site and

00:51:36,749 --> 00:51:41,609
then there's all of these updates and

00:51:39,059 --> 00:51:44,039
issues that a site can have and then

00:51:41,609 --> 00:51:47,519
also the upgrades after that how do you

00:51:44,039 --> 00:51:49,890
deal with that situation so if it's kind

00:51:47,519 --> 00:51:52,709
of how do you how do you sell that kind

00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:55,160
of the fact that the website is

00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:58,259
constantly evolving and it's not just

00:51:55,160 --> 00:52:00,719
the budget doesn't come to a hard stop

00:51:58,259 --> 00:52:04,619
after the implementation I think it

00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:08,489
starts with positioning the value and

00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:10,349
importance of support very very early on

00:52:08,489 --> 00:52:12,809
in the process I think a lot of

00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:16,650
prospects have you know a misconception

00:52:12,809 --> 00:52:18,900
around open source that it's free we

00:52:16,650 --> 00:52:20,759
never lead with cost when we're talking

00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:24,209
to a prospect and this has been

00:52:20,759 --> 00:52:27,359
validated in a number of studies by CIO

00:52:24,209 --> 00:52:30,630
CMOS who say the real attraction to open

00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:33,299
source in Drupal particularly is it's

00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:35,880
more its flexibility they don't like

00:52:33,299 --> 00:52:39,150
being held kind of hostage to a product

00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:41,519
roadmap and we're still going to win on

00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:44,549
the total cost of ownership battle when

00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:47,699
I was talking to prospect couple weeks

00:52:44,549 --> 00:52:50,219
ago and I said just let's let's do an

00:52:47,699 --> 00:52:52,140
apples-to-apples comparison on you know

00:52:50,219 --> 00:52:55,640
what a troop will upgrade is going to

00:52:52,140 --> 00:53:00,809
cost every three to five years versus

00:52:55,640 --> 00:53:02,430
licensing with Adobe cq5 you know and I

00:53:00,809 --> 00:53:06,150
would definitely recommend if you're an

00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:09,569
agency you should really incorporate

00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:11,430
post-launch support into your kind of

00:53:09,569 --> 00:53:13,979
overall package that you're selling I

00:53:11,430 --> 00:53:16,949
mean for us that's how we really feel

00:53:13,979 --> 00:53:19,859
like we're able to develop a long-term

00:53:16,949 --> 00:53:22,529
relationship and kind of a from a

00:53:19,859 --> 00:53:26,339
strategic standpoint allow us to kind of

00:53:22,529 --> 00:53:30,109
get embedded into that organizations web

00:53:26,339 --> 00:53:34,380
strategy for a long long time excellent

00:53:30,109 --> 00:53:35,519
so for the last portion of our session

00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,140
here today we're just going to walk

00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:40,140
through a few resources that the

00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:41,969
panelists have picked out so on the list

00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:44,609
and you guys can't see it here but we

00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:46,050
have a number of different books the

00:53:44,609 --> 00:53:50,160
e-myth revisited

00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:52,050
who recommended that one house me okay

00:53:50,160 --> 00:54:01,230
why don't you just give us a really

00:53:52,050 --> 00:54:03,000
quick tweak on how effective that is the

00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:05,160
e-myth revisited I think is the is the

00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,530
story of every entrepreneurs journey and

00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:09,450
it goes from where you're an expert at

00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:11,550
something and so you find yourself with

00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:13,410
lots of people winning your your

00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:17,130
business or wanting to do business with

00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:20,850
you and and how to handle that and in

00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:23,250
what what's typical in what's normal is

00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:25,440
that an entrepreneur ends up not ever

00:54:23,250 --> 00:54:27,320
doing the cool thing that they enjoy

00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:31,650
because running a business is complex

00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:35,100
and so I think it's for any entrepreneur

00:54:31,650 --> 00:54:37,770
to understand that aspect of building of

00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:40,020
businesses I think critical yeah highly

00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:43,860
recommend that book fantastic book

00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:48,180
raving fans band i think that customer

00:54:43,860 --> 00:54:51,690
service do it yeah managing web content

00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:56,310
by robert rose so we did that one was

00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:59,100
that you Dave yeah no I think just I'd

00:54:56,310 --> 00:55:01,590
highlight on the one of the last ones is

00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:04,320
on Blair ends he's actually somebody who

00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:06,660
specializes directly with web agencies

00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:09,840
he's not a real household name or author

00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:12,630
