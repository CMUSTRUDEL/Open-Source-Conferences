Kristen Anton she's the community

00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,020
builder for new tactics and we're going

00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:39,030
to flip back and forth to hear from

00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:40,890
Kristen so this session is looking at

00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:43,280
the new tactic it's a case study to look

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:48,050
at the new tactics website development

00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,910
and it's to look at the UX process for

00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:54,780
new tactics as a human rights activist

00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:57,000
website so I was that think shout and I

00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,820
did the user experience process and all

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,850
of the discovery I left to go to funny

00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,799
monkey and Brett took over and so he did

00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,780
he picked up from where I left off on

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,119
the user experience and he did all the

00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,640
front-end theming this site was in

00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,820
English and Arabic there are other

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,770
languages on this site but we focused

00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,340
for the first round on English and

00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:22,950
Arabic I have a background in developing

00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,280
sites for NGOs in English and Arabic I

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,470
don't speak Arabic I just have worked on

00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:30,329
a lot of websites that have arabic on

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,340
them I used to work for an organization

00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:33,840
called me Dan based in San Francisco and

00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,619
they do a lot of English Arabic

00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:42,030
translation on the web so to start this

00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:43,950
presentation out this is the site that

00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:48,840
we started with this is the original new

00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:52,680
tactic site and during a discovery

00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,710
process we went from this site into

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,380
wireframing in English then we went to

00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:00,030
wire framing and Arabic and you'll

00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,299
notice everything switch sides because

00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:06,630
Arabic is a right-to-left language into

00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:09,989
a design into a design and Arabic and

00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:12,690
then into mobile wireframes and a mobile

00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,680
design and so through this talk and my

00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,349
portion of the talk

00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,450
going to go through the user experience

00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:20,849
deliverables the process that we went

00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,590
through to go from the original site all

00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:25,799
the way up into the design and

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:30,019
implementation so I'm going to let

00:02:25,799 --> 00:02:33,209
kristen anton introduce herself now and

00:02:30,019 --> 00:02:35,069
have her introduce new tactics what what

00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,540
their mission is what their website

00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:39,329
needs where when they came to think

00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:46,530
shout and Kristin's role at new tactics

00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:50,099
so let me pull her up go for it Kristen

00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,930
thanks Andrea so new tactics and human

00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:53,519
rights is a program of the center for

00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,650
victims of torture which is an

00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,439
organization based in Minnesota I'm

00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:02,069
actually in New York so that made us

00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:04,139
have to figure out time zones and at

00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:08,219
least three different time zones at this

00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:09,780
point Oregon Minnesota New York we help

00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:11,189
human rights defenders work more

00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,349
effectively so that they can achieve

00:03:11,189 --> 00:03:15,480
their goals and better address human

00:03:13,349 --> 00:03:18,000
rights violations around the world and

00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,949
we do this by documenting and

00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,099
disseminating innovative Human Rights

00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:25,799
tactics we do training and mentoring for

00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:27,629
activists on strategic thinking and we

00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:28,859
build an online community of activists

00:03:27,629 --> 00:03:30,720
around the world to share their

00:03:28,859 --> 00:03:34,889
experiences and knowledge with each

00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,650
other and in 2011 we received funding to

00:03:34,889 --> 00:03:40,769
create a regional hub in the middle east

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,620
of north africa region this hub was

00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:46,319
meant to provide resources training and

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,780
community to activist in the region and

00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,229
in order to make this work we knew that

00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:55,739
we needed a new website so we went to

00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:57,810
think shout knowing that we needed a an

00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,370
Arabic version of our website which

00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:02,699
included all of our online community

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:05,729
features we knew that we needed a

00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:09,299
mobile-friendly website and a low

00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:11,209
bandwidth design we knew that a lot of

00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:13,290
our users in that region would be

00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:15,989
accessing our resources through their

00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:18,150
phones and we also knew that some of

00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,579
them didn't have very good bandwidth and

00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,590
then we also knew that we just needed an

00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,990
upgrade to Drupal 7 that this was an

00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:27,090
opportunity to get on to the next

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:31,139
version of Drupal

00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:33,600
and so my role with new tactics is as

00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:36,030
the online community builder i'm also

00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,680
the administrator of the website i

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,500
manage all the content and all the

00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,990
communications and i managed this web

00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:47,040
development process from our end at new

00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:49,650
tactics and i've managed our website for

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,169
years i moved it from Drupal five to

00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:54,960
Drupal 6 from and now we move to Jubal

00:04:52,169 --> 00:04:56,940
seven so I knew quite a bit about Drupal

00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,000
but this was actually my first time

00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:03,930
participating in a discovery process

00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,300
which andrea will talk more about and we

00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:09,000
were basically going to think shout

00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,070
build the site from the ground up so

00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,500
just to start from scratch and build

00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,760
what we needed and even though I hadn't

00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:16,950
done it before it was a really

00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,169
eye-opening experience and I learned a

00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:24,110
lot so I'll hand it over to you Andrea

00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:24,110
cool thanks okay

00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:35,989
so the first thing I'm going to start

00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:40,129
talking about is the project challenges

00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:43,639
so Kristin came to us and they had

00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:46,759
gotten funding I've worked on English

00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:50,569
Arabic websites before and I know from

00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:55,929
experience is really helpful to get as

00:05:50,569 --> 00:05:55,929
much user experience research data

00:05:56,019 --> 00:06:01,639
collected so that we know exactly what

00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:04,909
we're building so there was a fixed

00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:07,789
budget for this project so i had to a

00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:10,129
little bit secretly try to get in as

00:06:07,789 --> 00:06:11,539
much user as many user experience

00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:14,209
deliverables as I could so I could

00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:18,499
really understand who the users were and

00:06:14,209 --> 00:06:19,879
what they wanted exactly the other thing

00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:22,579
is that the stakeholders were across

00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:25,969
multiple time zones we're we're in

00:06:22,579 --> 00:06:28,279
Portland like Kristen said you know new

00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:30,439
tactics and the Center for victims of

00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:34,879
torture which is the parent organization

00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:36,499
there in Minnesota Kristen's in New York

00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,749
and then we also had a team in the

00:06:36,499 --> 00:06:42,139
Middle East and Jordan so we had a span

00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:44,119
of I think its nine or ten hours so

00:06:42,139 --> 00:06:48,259
there are many times that I was like on

00:06:44,119 --> 00:06:51,679
6am calls with Jordan to do stakeholder

00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:53,899
interviews and then defining the exact

00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:57,439
multilingual needs and preparing the

00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:59,990
translated content for those of you who

00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,029
have never worked on a multilingual site

00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,860
the first thing and I'll talk about this

00:07:02,029 --> 00:07:05,779
later and content strategy the first

00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,699
thing you have to do is figure out what

00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:10,699
your content is and start getting it

00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:15,079
translated because that takes a long

00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:16,969
time because you have many people in the

00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:18,589
role you have you have to you know

00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:20,149
communicate with a translator figure out

00:07:18,589 --> 00:07:22,519
what your content is in English first

00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:26,929
get that translated make sure it comes

00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:28,729
back but also figuring out exactly what

00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:33,529
the users need who are speaking

00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:36,499
different languages and I'll talk about

00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:38,419
this further you know drupal 7 deals

00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:40,430
with multilingual and a few different

00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:42,379
ways which we took a lot of time

00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,630
figuring out do we want to do you know

00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:48,050
node-based translation where the

00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:50,090
the nodes correspond to each other in

00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:52,760
Drupal 7 you can do entity based

00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:55,010
translation I won't go too technical but

00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,230
that's field level translation for this

00:07:55,010 --> 00:08:00,710
project we decided to go with the field

00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:02,230
level translation to prepare new tactics

00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:07,610
for the future so they could add more

00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:10,690
languages in my user experience process

00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:13,280
I always start out with the objective or

00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:16,760
think shall we we called it desired

00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,790
outcomes so what I do is I start with a

00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,800
stakeholder call I get everybody on the

00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,720
phone and we just go through and we talk

00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,610
about you know we talk about objectives

00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,860
we talk about target audience or

00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,960
personas and we talk about what those

00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:34,070
users those personas what their

00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:35,510
motivations are on the site and Kristin

00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:38,150
was a really great person to work with

00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:39,680
she was a client that gave a lot of good

00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:43,270
feedback and so we work together to

00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:47,050
develop these we had a lot of secondary

00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:49,220
objectives but these were our main ones

00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:51,230
the first was to create a global

00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:55,340
community of human rights practitioners

00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:57,770
and organizations that need a website to

00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:59,690
come to to share these tactics now what

00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:02,210
tactics are and this took me a while

00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:07,610
while I was doing the research tactics

00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:10,340
are basically actions or tools that that

00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:14,720
human rights activists have used in the

00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:17,630
past to get their message out to the

00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,840
people that they're you know trying to

00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:24,050
educate the other thing that we really

00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:26,690
wanted to do was have new tactics be the

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:28,400
online go-to resource for human rights

00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:30,590
activists there's a few other sites out

00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,900
there but we wanted to give it a new

00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:34,820
look and feel to make it really inviting

00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:38,060
to human rights activists that didn't

00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:41,030
know about new tactics to come there and

00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:43,670
just be like this is the place for for

00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:46,610
my tactics and then the other main goal

00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:49,370
because the funding was coming to build

00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:51,920
specifically this hub for Middle East

00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,720
North African users Human Rights

00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,200
practitioners we needed to create an

00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,390
Arabic site to enable activists in the

00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,330
MENA region to be more

00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:03,760
and their human rights work the next

00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:06,640
thing we did was we identified the

00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,650
target audience or the personas our main

00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,700
target audience was the human rights

00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:14,530
practitioners as a whole and mostly we

00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:18,040
were gearing its we figured out in

00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:20,430
research and talking to stakeholders and

00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,780
interviews that we really want to go for

00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:24,190
experienced human rights practitioners

00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:26,230
those are the people who are actually

00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:28,620
going to get on the site download

00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:33,640
resources participate in conversations

00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:35,290
and with those experienced practitioners

00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:38,650
on the site they're also going to pull

00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:40,600
new practitioners in other practitioners

00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:42,550
that fall under the human rights

00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:45,190
practitioners umbrella is experienced

00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:47,200
practitioners new tactics they do

00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,970
trainings all over the world so

00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,310
practitioners that have participated in

00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:54,640
the trainings practitioners that will

00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:56,470
participate and then the other users you

00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,880
always have to consider are the people

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,130
who are going to be adding the content

00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:02,920
which is the new tactics staff and the

00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:04,180
funders the funders this is an important

00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,480
lesson I've really learned in the last

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:09,610
few years part part of the website is to

00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,610
show the funders that their money is

00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:16,960
going to a good place and it's actually

00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:18,580
working so it's always good to keep the

00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:21,730
funders in mind they're not you know the

00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:23,680
number one user persona but we do need

00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:27,250
to make sure that our websites

00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,680
successful then to create empathy I like

00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:31,930
to come up with examples of these Human

00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,990
Rights practitioners and so this is just

00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:38,590
a list of different practitioners that

00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:40,180
the new tactics website serves you know

00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,800
and I've worked with some of these NGOs

00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:44,260
you know I'm friends with social media

00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,360
exchange and beirut so while I'm like

00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:49,390
building features designing this I can

00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,770
think okay my friend Jessica in Beirut

00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:52,390
she's going to need to get on the site

00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:54,550
she speaks English she speaks a little

00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:57,130
bit of Arabic you know how how is she

00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:59,080
going to walk through this so that's why

00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:04,090
I like to come up with examples to

00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:06,400
increase the empathy and then once I

00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,870
have the target audience I like to

00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:10,480
really understand what is their

00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,740
motivation that specifically helps me

00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,960
define what

00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:17,140
features are the most important and be

00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:21,360
able to prioritize those features we

00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:23,830
came up with a lot of motivations but I

00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,350
for this presentation I just wanted to

00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,820
show these three that human rights

00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:29,920
practitioners they want to collaborate

00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,380
and coordinate with other practitioners

00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,860
they want a space to reflect on their

00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:38,320
we're their work with their peers and

00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:40,300
they when they're implementing a

00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,420
campaign if they've been using the same

00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:45,850
tactics you know for their whole career

00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:50,890
they want to look for new tactics to and

00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:53,410
strategies to apply so because of the

00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:55,690
fixed budget and it was limited I was

00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,520
not able to do like you know I would

00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,410
have preferred to like you know

00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:01,350
interview at least five different

00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,960
practitioners of different types

00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:06,040
practitioners in the Middle East

00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:08,800
practitioners and other places in the

00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:12,460
world but since I didn't have the budget

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,920
for that I went ahead and did surveys

00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:17,080
using SurveyMonkey it was a way to get

00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,480
you know just numbers to look at so I

00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,310
could make some decisions off of this I

00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,860
went with SurveyMonkey because it's

00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,810
supported Arabic other you know I'd

00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:27,610
looked at like a Drupal form and others

00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:29,250
stuff like that but this was the the

00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:32,950
quickest thing out of the box that

00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:37,540
supported Arabic i'm just showing one

00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:38,920
question that I that we posed you know

00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,630
what kind of internet connection do you

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,700
have for the device you would most

00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:45,340
likely use to access an online community

00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:47,830
of human rights practitioners and you'll

00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,200
see the numbers aren't huge here I 10

00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:52,300
people answered this question but it

00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:55,360
still it gave me a little bit of a sense

00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:57,280
of who who were gearing towards and you

00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,070
know these are English speakers not

00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,980
necessarily all you know from the states

00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:04,960
so but you know we can see that

00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,030
everybody is getting connected through

00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:10,270
high speed but when we look at the

00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:12,100
Middle East in the Arabic survey we can

00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:14,110
see that we we still have some people on

00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,540
dial-up and so that was definitely

00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:18,640
something to consider also they're

00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:21,840
connected through high speed USB dongle

00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:24,550
I've been to the Middle East I've used

00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,580
those high-speed USB

00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,839
dongles and I just know from personal

00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:31,240
experience they don't always work that

00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,959
great so it's good to know that these

00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:37,180
are the people i'm supporting the next

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,070
thing i did and i really feel like this

00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:42,579
is one of the most important user

00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:45,010
experience deliverables is user

00:14:42,579 --> 00:14:50,019
experience mapping so what that means is

00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:53,170
I I create personas based off of our

00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:55,180
target audience and what I really like

00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:58,800
to do is come up with names for them and

00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:02,290
a personality for them you know and like

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:04,570
somebody's 40 years old and they work

00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:07,630
part-time at a grassroots human rights

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:10,360
organization they are able only able to

00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:12,010
get on to the internet from eight to ten

00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:14,589
p.m. after they put their kids to bed

00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:16,329
okay when are they getting on the

00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:20,200
internet so or when are they getting on

00:15:16,329 --> 00:15:22,089
the new tactics website to do this

00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:26,500
stakeholder call this was one of those

00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:28,899
6am meetings we used go to go to meeting

00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,029
I really like this tool because I was

00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:34,300
able to screen share I put I used

00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:36,790
omnigraffle I screen shared omnigraffle

00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:39,370
and then as they were talking to me I

00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:43,480
just typed up the notes I was moving

00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:46,720
these blocks around and you it's hard to

00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:50,440
see here but so the navy blue boxes that

00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,480
is the that's the user I'm walking

00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,990
through I'm saying where are they

00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:57,910
getting to this site they're coming from

00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:01,000
mostly social media sites that's because

00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:03,130
Kristen is posting new tactics that show

00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,620
up on the site on facebook on Twitter

00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:07,420
that's where these young human writes

00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,550
practitioners are seeing that they're

00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,890
linking to that okay where do they go

00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:14,320
from there and so they might you know

00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:19,360
participate in a conversation they might

00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:21,100
read a case study and then I like to say

00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,779
okay well how long are they going to

00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,510
stay on the site where are they going to

00:16:22,779 --> 00:16:30,250
leave from and what this actually helps

00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:32,410
it helps do is some I've done this so

00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,240
many times where we're like we need to

00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:36,579
have live chat we need to have all these

00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,900
videos on there and we need to you know

00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,970
have a disguise

00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:42,100
shun forum and all these things but this

00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:44,620
helps us really focus on what features

00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:46,390
are people actually going to use they

00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,370
want to look at their tactic they want

00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:49,780
to participate in a conversation they're

00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:52,840
not going to hang out and have a live

00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:55,450
chat at 9pm because people are all over

00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:58,600
the world who's going to be online then

00:16:55,450 --> 00:17:02,980
so it allows us to cut out extraneous

00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:05,140
features the next thing I do based on

00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:08,110
all of the research that I've collected

00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:12,040
at this point is create a site map this

00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:15,490
is just a small screen screenshot of a

00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:18,459
tiny part of one part of the of the new

00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:20,800
tactics website so i use the site map to

00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:22,780
define the landing pages where they're

00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,030
going to navigate to from those landing

00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:28,570
pages what content is going to be on

00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:31,480
those pages just a small summary and

00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:34,260
I'll take that further on and then you

00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:38,230
know iterative parts of the site so like

00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:40,870
you know if we have 200 tactics on this

00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:42,430
site you know from the example of

00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:48,220
tactics page you'll go into the

00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:52,450
individual tactics page so based on the

00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:54,880
site map we then define the content

00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:56,650
strategy now this hold this hold

00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,890
drupalcon we're talking a lot about

00:17:56,650 --> 00:18:03,070
content strategy I'm a little obsessed

00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:05,050
with content strategy I find I've been

00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:08,710
working on websites for 10 years I find

00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:11,170
that most websites the pain point the

00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:13,360
potential failure point is getting the

00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:15,100
content in and when I started working on

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,390
the web we we would just say oh we'll

00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,730
build the site you have to have all the

00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:21,400
content written and the site won't go

00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:23,470
live until it does well I've I've worked

00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,940
on sites that don't go live for six

00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:28,150
months after we're finished because the

00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:30,340
content isn't written so what I do for

00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:34,120
clients is create a Content matrix

00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:36,910
document I use a spreadsheet a Google

00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:40,510
spreadsheet the fields are the page name

00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:43,060
the URL this this for the new tactic

00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,650
site it's the language that that piece

00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:46,180
of content is going to be in what

00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:48,400
sidebar blocks are going to be on that

00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:49,930
page what content area blocks are going

00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,550
to be on that page are we going to have

00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:53,010
images

00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:56,370
we're gonna have video any other media

00:18:53,010 --> 00:19:00,060
files and then any notes that you know

00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:03,360
if you have multiple content editors

00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:06,450
working on this you can put notes in to

00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,320
figure out where you're at so i created

00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:11,670
a content matrix document for kristen i

00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:15,450
loaded her up with a lot of content

00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:17,430
strategy books I didn't you know I there

00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:19,380
was no budget for us to for me to

00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:22,320
actually sit down with her and really

00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,570
help do like a solid content strategy so

00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,930
we work together to get to get this done

00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:30,210
the other thing for a multilingual site

00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:32,820
so there's two parts of doing

00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:35,130
multilingual sites there's localization

00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,470
and then there's actually translation of

00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:39,390
content so the localization what that

00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:42,720
means is you're translating the

00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:45,840
navigation links you're translating save

00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,910
preview publish like anything in the

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:52,340
chrome that needs to be in the different

00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:55,890
language admin menus dashboard menus

00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:58,440
things like that so what we did first is

00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:00,930
we created a translation document for

00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,880
all of those user interface elements she

00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:05,970
was able to pass that to her translator

00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,830
and then while we're still you know

00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,690
developing features and doing the coding

00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:12,960
she's already getting that content

00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:14,580
translated after that once we've really

00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,560
developed the content strategy the

00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,760
content matrix document she knows

00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,830
everything that's going to be in the

00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,720
site then she's able to pass that on to

00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,520
the translator and I'm going to let

00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:28,050
Kristen say a few things about the

00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:31,620
content strategy Andrea when you first

00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:35,690
asked me if I had a content strategy I

00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:40,050
remember my response was like oh what I

00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:42,210
had no idea what it was even though I

00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:44,070
had been managing the site for years and

00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:47,820
it's embarrassing to admit it but it's

00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:50,610
true but all the resources that Andrea

00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:54,330
gave me we're super helpful and I've

00:20:50,610 --> 00:20:57,020
learned so much and I've really been

00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:59,550
involved in learning more about it and

00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:03,090
although I think that for this first

00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:04,200
round of web development I think we

00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:06,029
started really some

00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:11,100
full with our content strategy and

00:21:06,029 --> 00:21:13,799
basically just had this strategy of like

00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:17,220
let's figure out how to get our main

00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:20,039
core resources on the new site in a

00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:22,350
user-friendly way that makes sense to

00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:26,130
people and that can be translated easily

00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:29,120
and we've done that and now I can see

00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:32,100
very clearly how to take that forward so

00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,740
we're looking forward to the next phase

00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:36,419
of the project so that we can improve

00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,429
the information architecture and

00:21:36,419 --> 00:21:41,100
strategy and connecting the content to

00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:45,510
each other in a in a more thoughtful way

00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:47,159
um what else can I say about that I

00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:49,559
don't I remember when you first showed

00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:52,620
me that spreadsheet that content matrix

00:21:49,559 --> 00:21:54,840
and it was totally overwhelming and I

00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:57,960
don't think I ever actually filled it

00:21:54,840 --> 00:22:00,029
all out but it was useful at the same

00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,190
time to see all the different pieces

00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:05,970
that I had to actually figure out before

00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:07,700
we went forward and I know that things

00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:11,130
shout kept telling me over and over that

00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:12,720
creating the content is going to be the

00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:15,120
hardest part and it's going to take a

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,059
long time and I really honestly did not

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,600
believe you guys but it is so true I had

00:22:18,059 --> 00:22:23,669
no idea how many people would have to

00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:25,769
approve each piece of content and then

00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:28,590
to get it translated and the whole

00:22:25,769 --> 00:22:30,029
process took so long so thankfully we

00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:32,149
got started on that right away and that

00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:34,169
was definitely something that I learned

00:22:32,149 --> 00:22:36,690
yeah and I think one of the learning

00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:41,429
lessons there especially with when

00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:43,019
working on NGO sites nonprofit sites one

00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:46,250
thing I've gone to a few content

00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:51,059
strategy sessions here at drupalcon and

00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:54,929
it's we need to empower nonprofits to

00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:57,600
know to ask for a like a content

00:22:54,929 --> 00:23:02,399
strategy budget like a line item in the

00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:04,950
budget I think we also need to

00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:07,440
understand that like you know Kristin

00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:09,269
wears a lot of hats at new tactics she

00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,370
maintains the site she wrote a lot of

00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:13,559
the content and like figuring out how to

00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:15,929
support that I don't necessarily have

00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:17,760
the answers but it's like creating but

00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:20,600
one potential is creating but

00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:24,090
to actually have a writer come on board

00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:26,160
if that actually yeah if that's possible

00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:29,130
if there's money to do it I know that

00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:31,820
there's always limits but I just think

00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:33,930
it's it's telling the right story and

00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,840
actually getting the content written

00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:40,310
because I can do as much user research

00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:43,080
and user experience and make as many

00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:44,910
suggestions as features but it's like if

00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,430
we're not telling the right story with

00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:49,830
the right words it's not going to work

00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:53,120
and I mean with websites we do the best

00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:55,050
we can and and I think you know well

00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,580
step forward and show you the design

00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:58,560
that we came up with and I think we're

00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:01,080
doing a good job so that's I'm going to

00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:03,560
segue add a content strategy and back to

00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,560
the slides

00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:14,470
so the next thing I'm just going to

00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:19,030
quickly touch on the wireframes we chose

00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:21,550
to use a cure for the wireframes we did

00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:23,590
this because actua actually supported

00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:25,540
Arabic I could a lot of times with

00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:29,020
Arabic it's really hard to cut and paste

00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:31,090
into certain programs because of the

00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:33,790
characters but with actually I was able

00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:36,250
to do that I also chose extra because it

00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:38,650
allowed you to create mobile clickable

00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:41,170
wireframes and also desktop clickable

00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:44,170
wireframes you can do like different

00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:46,150
devices and so I'll just walk you

00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:47,830
through some of these wireframes we

00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:50,860
actually went through and did English

00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:52,810
wireframes Arabic wireframes for the

00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:56,230
home page and then we also did a mobile

00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:58,120
Arabic in English just because also

00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:01,720
doing the survey we found that a lot of

00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:06,280
the Arabic users there they're doing a

00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:08,830
lot of their reading on mobile so you

00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:12,010
know here these were all clickable we

00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:15,540
had like a URL to it so that new tactics

00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:18,520
and our developers could click through

00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:20,650
you know one thing that was really

00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:23,170
important is that we actually need to

00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:24,910
define what new tactics was when people

00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:27,040
came to the site so I really just wanted

00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:29,050
to have a big headline that said this is

00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,540
who we are we are community of human

00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:34,600
rights activists and then one another

00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:37,060
thing that we found is like people just

00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,010
were really confused about what to do

00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:41,650
when they got there so we have a you

00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:43,870
know get started right away and then

00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:48,550
because a lot of the funding for this

00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:50,650
redesign was coming to support the you

00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:53,200
know the Middle East North African hub I

00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:54,940
wanted to boom have arabic immediately

00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,540
on the page where you could see it and

00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:02,170
announcing the the MENA hub this is what

00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:03,910
it looked like an Arabic it just was

00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:06,400
really helpful to do it in Arabic it's

00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:09,160
helpful for the client who you know

00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,360
hasn't done a fair bit specific site to

00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,220
see this is how it's going to look like

00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:15,700
it's helpful for the translators to know

00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:18,520
what they're going to work on and then

00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:23,380
this is just screenshots of what it

00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:24,280
looks like on the mobile and you know so

00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:29,010
we we did

00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:30,820
good yeah we did this in mobile and then

00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:36,010
actually I don't know if we did an

00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:38,950
Arabic mobile wireframe but anyway the

00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:43,120
next deliverable I really like to do is

00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:45,640
style tiles what our style tiles you

00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,560
know style tiles are something that have

00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,330
been around a long time Samantha Warren

00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:51,520
who used to be a designer of phase 2 and

00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:54,700
now as a designer with Twitter she made

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,680
them really popular a few years ago so

00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:59,890
style tile is a design deliverable that

00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:03,720
references web face interface elements

00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:07,210
through font color style collections and

00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:09,490
so it's instead of doing a whole mock-up

00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:11,890
of the design I did three different

00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:14,620
mock-ups to define different colors

00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:19,390
different type treatments different

00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:22,540
styles so this was one with one specific

00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:26,160
color palette and specific fonts button

00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:30,010
styles and then here I'm just I'm just

00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:33,550
doing really quick elements design

00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:35,020
elements the next one is similar but

00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:36,940
we've got a gradient we've got some more

00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:40,810
textures in there and these styles are

00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:43,300
different we've got a serif font instead

00:27:40,810 --> 00:27:45,910
of two sans-serif fonts and then we did

00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:47,770
one in Arabic you know we've got rounded

00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:49,390
corners here but just just to show like

00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:51,100
what the Arabic is going to look like

00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:54,610
what arabic fonts are we going to choose

00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:59,800
and right around this time Google web

00:27:54,610 --> 00:28:01,870
web fonts put out Arabic web fonts and

00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:04,090
they also have they have a ton it's

00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:06,130
there still an experimental web fonts

00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:10,660
but you can still use them so that was

00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:13,060
the web fonts I chose to go with so now

00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:15,520
I'm just going to go to Kristin's

00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:20,400
feedback of the UX process do you want

00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:23,190
to go into that yeah just briefly I

00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:27,880
think that the biggest reflection

00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:30,880
hopefully useful reflection that I have

00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:34,450
as you are going through those sides is

00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:37,240
that as a non-profit and human rights

00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:39,370
organization we want to do

00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:42,250
everything and when we came to things

00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:44,170
out we had like this huge big beautiful

00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:46,390
idea of what we wanted for our website

00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:48,100
and we wanted our users to be able to

00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:50,050
participate in the conversations to

00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:52,810
their email and we wanted all kinds of

00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:56,290
crazy stuff and you guys did a great job

00:28:52,810 --> 00:29:00,430
of helping us to narrow down what we

00:28:56,290 --> 00:29:03,520
needed but I think that it showed itself

00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:05,140
through every step of the process when

00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,840
you were trying to get us to identify

00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,910
our goals when you're trying to get us

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,920
to identify the user motivations the

00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:14,860
audience's we came up with like 30

00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:16,630
things for every question that you asked

00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:19,900
us when really what I think you wanted

00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:22,360
was like one two three you know definite

00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:24,880
answers and that was a huge struggle for

00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,800
us I don't think we knew we didn't know

00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,170
what we wanted and we didn't know the

00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:32,980
answers to these questions so it was it

00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:37,950
was the process for us and I guess

00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:39,850
that's just a word of advice for future

00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:43,300
designers as you're working with

00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:45,240
nonprofits it's like some way to really

00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:48,940
Whittle it down and make it clear that

00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:51,100
having just a couple goals is more

00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,320
useful than coming up with 20 because if

00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:55,450
you have 20 goals how do you know you're

00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:58,390
going to actually reach them and then

00:29:55,450 --> 00:30:00,630
just the other piece something that I

00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:04,060
wish that I had coming out of this

00:30:00,630 --> 00:30:07,900
discovery process is something that

00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:10,620
clearly states what our goals were what

00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:12,880
came out of the user research and then

00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:15,880
the decisions that we made for the

00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,830
features so that it you know even some

00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:21,040
kind of like table that would clearly

00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:23,050
show like this goes to this goes to this

00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:25,960
so that I can go back to that document

00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:28,090
in two years and say the reason why we

00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:30,340
chose that font is because of this and

00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:32,200
the reason why we have that block over

00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:34,870
there is because of this remember we put

00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:37,620
all that thought into it but besides

00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:41,590
that it was a really useful process

00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:44,020
excellent thanks for that feedback pull

00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:49,090
up the slides here and I'm about to pass

00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:51,190
it over to Brett this and then this

00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:53,260
skreet this slide right here this is the

00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:56,890
final design based off of all of our

00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:59,050
research all of our wireframes and the

00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:03,580
style tiles choosing the colors this is

00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:07,300
what we ended up going with and then I

00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:10,930
left think shout and Brett came on and

00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:15,720
so he took everything that I had and he

00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:19,530
then went in to build the theme so we

00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,530
passed the baton off

00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:42,800
I think I need to raise the mic so I'm

00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:44,770
Brett and i'm the current user

00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:49,030
experience engineer at think shout and

00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:53,840
as andrea said I inherited this this

00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:58,010
this project when the idea of this

00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:03,110
session was first proposed I wasn't

00:31:58,010 --> 00:32:09,230
really sure that I really had much much

00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:12,679
to add of much value but after some

00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:14,600
reflection it occurred me occurred to me

00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:18,800
that there there were some really

00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:23,690
valuable lessons that I learned or or

00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:26,030
real earned throughout the process some

00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:30,770
more in the vein of relationship

00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:33,040
management and and others more practical

00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:37,790
tips coming from someone who had never

00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:44,990
executed a theme with that required

00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:49,840
right-to-left support so the first big

00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:54,770
hurdle for me was I'm not andreea Burton

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:57,350
there was a ton of work as as we just

00:32:54,770 --> 00:33:01,400
saw that the one into the discovery

00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:03,790
process a lot of conversation and

00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:07,520
discussions that even the most detailed

00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:14,150
discovery documentation can't capture

00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:18,920
all the nuances of and so the issue for

00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:22,160
me was you know day-to-day in my role

00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:24,140
that think shout currently I rely on a

00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:29,030
lot of the same methods that that uh

00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:31,730
that Andreea used in this project to

00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:38,909
figure out objectives organizational

00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:41,549
goals and you know the the primary

00:33:38,909 --> 00:33:43,200
the primary objective from a logistical

00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:47,099
perspective is to arrive at

00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:50,700
documentation that provides a roadmap

00:33:47,099 --> 00:33:53,669
for for implementation but almost of

00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:57,960
equal importance I've learned is that

00:33:53,669 --> 00:34:06,059
it's it's it's a wonderful platform to

00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:08,069
to begin building trust and so the the

00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:10,079
first hurdle that that and the first

00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:14,839
challenge that I was face to face with

00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:17,250
in this project was how to inject myself

00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:22,559
given where the project was at this

00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:26,010
point and how to start that relationship

00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:29,879
with with Kristin because there was

00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:32,539
still plenty of design decisions and

00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:37,710
user experience work to do as

00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:39,329
implementation progressed and if I've

00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:42,629
learned anything over the years of doing

00:34:39,329 --> 00:34:44,490
this it's that trust is absolutely

00:34:42,629 --> 00:34:48,450
essential it's the one thing that stands

00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:52,109
between a project that's moving forward

00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:57,480
efficiently towards success and one

00:34:52,109 --> 00:35:03,869
that's that's you know just there's a

00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:07,890
time drain going on so the first thing

00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:10,200
that I did was obviously I I reviewed

00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:12,359
all of the discovery documentation that

00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:17,160
Andreea put together and it was

00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:21,930
immensely helpful and what I was looking

00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:25,770
for was just that any opportunity where

00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:30,000
I could add value so I was really

00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:33,210
looking for a small win and what I chose

00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,720
to focus on was just an initial pass at

00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:39,920
the theme taking the work that was

00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:44,279
indicated in the style tiles and the

00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:46,500
wireframes what's what I've learned is

00:35:44,279 --> 00:35:49,920
so great about these these two

00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:52,250
deliverables is that what you arrive at

00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:57,930
after putting those in place is

00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:59,819
essentially just an underpainting the

00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:04,410
other the other thing I had to remind

00:35:59,819 --> 00:36:07,500
myself was I can't be afraid to ask

00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:11,190
questions I know that Kristin didn't

00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,930
expect that I would that that we would

00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:15,029
have just been able to transfer all of

00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:16,440
the knowledge that was inside of under

00:36:15,029 --> 00:36:20,520
his head when she was leaving the

00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:22,950
project at the same time I didn't I

00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:25,650
didn't want to ask stupid questions I

00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:27,510
wanted to be sure that I was that I had

00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:32,430
properly reviewed all the discovery

00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:34,440
documentation and the other thing that

00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:36,210
was really difficult for me is that

00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:40,289
something that I enjoy about the

00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:42,510
discovery process is that you know when

00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:45,470
when you first begin its it's all about

00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:49,160
these big ideas and and and then

00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:53,400
gradually becoming more and more focused

00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:58,619
based on what you learn and so I really

00:36:53,400 --> 00:37:00,839
had to leave that role behind because at

00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:05,450
this point the the minimum viable

00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:09,210
product features had been defined and

00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:12,089
implementation had begun so some

00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:14,220
features were complete and others the

00:37:12,089 --> 00:37:15,869
finer details about how they were

00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,079
actually going to be executed we're

00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:24,569
still being defined and worked through

00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:28,430
with the developers so you end up

00:37:24,569 --> 00:37:32,339
serving more as a guide and as those

00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:35,819
implementation issues come up and arise

00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:42,990
you you help to sort of navigate and

00:37:35,819 --> 00:37:46,710
find find the solutions so now I'm going

00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:50,819
to move into just a real brief overview

00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:56,010
of adding right-to-left support to a

00:37:50,819 --> 00:37:57,900
theme drupal does a lot of the heavy

00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:03,440
lifting for you if you've got the

00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:03,440
contribs that are necessary in play

00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:09,310
if you don't have a if you're working

00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:12,670
with a theme and you want to add

00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:15,820
right-to-left support and it doesn't

00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:20,710
currently support that you can take a

00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:25,960
look at inside of the root directory the

00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:28,150
modules / systems HTML template and what

00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:32,380
you'll see there is that Drupal is

00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:36,310
setting some language specific variables

00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:45,430
for you for this site we use the Zen

00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:48,690
theme and specifically in Zen what they

00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:53,339
do you can find in template dot PHP is

00:38:48,690 --> 00:39:00,220
set these that set these language and

00:38:53,339 --> 00:39:02,800
direction variables and then if you look

00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:05,920
inside the layout that won't necessarily

00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,859
be in your your theme if you use the

00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:12,520
starter kit unless you have some reason

00:39:08,859 --> 00:39:16,440
to override that HTML template but if

00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:21,089
you look inside the the base Zen theme

00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:25,089
you'll see that at the top of the page

00:39:21,089 --> 00:39:28,420
in the the beginning HTML tag that's

00:39:25,089 --> 00:39:32,380
where they're printing the HTML

00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:37,540
attributes variable that we set in

00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:40,470
template dot PHP and then the result if

00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:44,800
you want to take a look in Firebug is

00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:48,000
basically the printing of you know

00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:51,520
language english direction left to right

00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:58,119
versus language arabic direction right

00:39:51,520 --> 00:40:00,280
to left from there it's really just a

00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:05,920
matter of naming conventions in your

00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:11,890
style sheets so take food style sheets

00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:15,280
CSS add a dash RTL to it this works in a

00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:19,780
cascading style a cascading way so

00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:26,350
the stylesheet dot CSS will be loaded

00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:29,890
first and stylesheet dot RTL dash RTL

00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:34,510
will be loaded second so it's that that

00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:37,330
latter the last thought sheet is really

00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:42,850
just for overrides it's specific to the

00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:45,460
right-to-left version another great

00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:50,110
trick that I learned along the way was

00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:53,440
that using Zen grids which is not

00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:56,620
necessarily only possible using the Zen

00:40:53,440 --> 00:41:00,510
theme it's just a grid grid framework

00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:00,510
that could really work with anything

00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:08,650
he's got this really great function

00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:11,580
called Zen reverse all floats that's

00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:16,230
provided in the right-to-left theme

00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:22,270
style sheet once you set that to true

00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:25,990
and import the the the standard

00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:29,860
left-to-right lay out all of the floats

00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:32,410
will automatically be be reversed the

00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:36,310
only other best practice that I can

00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:38,530
recommend is that and this is was

00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:42,730
learned the hard way is that commenting

00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:45,880
your code when it's padding or margin or

00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:48,850
float styling specific to a particular

00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:51,310
language direction is absolutely

00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:53,530
essential unless you want to really go

00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:57,160
back and have to pick through your theme

00:41:53,530 --> 00:42:01,920
with a fine-tooth comb to to find all

00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:01,920
those language specific styles

00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:15,770
so now we're going to go into just

00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:18,260
lessons learned I'm going to let Kristen

00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:20,329
talk about some things that she learns

00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:25,849
and then Brett and I will add anything

00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:31,490
that we haven't added yet so over to you

00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:34,550
Kristen okay um I just have a couple

00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:36,710
things and maybe you all will have some

00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:40,339
good questions about our experience

00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:43,010
building this but there were a lot of

00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:48,020
tiny little frustrations when dealing

00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:51,380
with Drupal and Arabic a one very small

00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:55,940
example is that the autocomplete fields

00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:58,339
on the backend of nodes you have to put

00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:00,530
your cursor in the field in Arabic and

00:42:58,339 --> 00:43:02,420
then you have to use the arrow key to

00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:04,700
get the cursor to just the right place

00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:06,290
and then you can start typing and it's

00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:07,609
just not logical at all where you're

00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:10,760
supposed to put the cursor and it takes

00:43:07,609 --> 00:43:12,799
a lot of trial and error and then you

00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:15,079
can start typing and then the Drupal

00:43:12,799 --> 00:43:17,089
will pick up on what it thinks to your

00:43:15,079 --> 00:43:19,520
typing and this has been a big challenge

00:43:17,089 --> 00:43:21,650
for us because it just means that it's a

00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:23,450
lot more difficult for my staff to learn

00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:25,339
how to use these things they're supposed

00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:28,640
to be pretty simple in Drupal as a

00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:31,940
content management system something that

00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:36,500
is a really big frustration with Arabic

00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:41,059
is that currently you can't search our

00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:44,210
arabic site in Arabic it turns out or it

00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:47,240
seems that Drupal core the search in

00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:49,130
Drupal core doesn't support Arabic so

00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:53,089
we're going to have to completely redo

00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:54,530
that which is really frustrating and a

00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:56,299
lot of these things we just had no idea

00:43:54,530 --> 00:44:01,250
that you know this was going to be a

00:43:56,299 --> 00:44:03,260
problem and then for myself I've been an

00:44:01,250 --> 00:44:06,290
administrator of a Drupal site for years

00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:08,750
and walking into this role of becoming

00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:10,670
an administrator for an arabic website I

00:44:08,750 --> 00:44:13,700
wasn't I really wasn't sure what to

00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:16,280
expect and it's been pretty interesting

00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:20,000
I've had to add all

00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:22,640
the translated content not just the

00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:26,240
content but also all the blocks are the

00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:31,430
labels all the buttons all the menus the

00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:33,200
taxonomy terms and it's tough because I

00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:36,350
don't read any Arabic at all and so it's

00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:38,870
a lot of guessing and working with my

00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:41,120
team in Jordan and it was hard because I

00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:44,270
can't just train my staff in Jordan on

00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:47,930
how to add a translated taxonomy term to

00:44:44,270 --> 00:44:50,060
a Drupal 7 website I have to figure it

00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:53,450
out intimately so that I know exactly

00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:56,960
which button I'm pushing and it was also

00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:59,780
a lot of spreadsheets of translated

00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:01,820
terms so I would just go through page by

00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:04,490
page of the English site and write down

00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:07,100
every term in every phrase and then ask

00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:08,600
our translator and Jordan to translate

00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:10,280
it all in that spreadsheet so and i

00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:13,280
still have it and i still go back to it

00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:16,180
all the time so those are some of the

00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:19,820
lessons learned in frustrations so far

00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:22,910
sure there are a million more and and

00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:27,770
for me some lessons I learned is that

00:45:22,910 --> 00:45:30,560
like when I start on a website like I'm

00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:33,290
a user experience nerd I love working on

00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,580
multilingual sites I've traveled in the

00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:38,510
Middle East I've worked with a lot of

00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:40,730
NGOs in the Middle East and so and i

00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:43,040
work with ngos specifically because like

00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:45,860
that's my passion i want to see change

00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:51,860
in the world all of these things and i

00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:53,900
think on this project i I just wanted I

00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:57,980
wanted to do all of these deliverables

00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:59,660
we didn't actually have budget for so I

00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:05,840
had to I had to sneak them in a little

00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:07,730
bit and so I I don't know I guess the

00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,830
lesson is either get more budget ahead

00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:11,570
of time or I has to just like calm down

00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:15,490
and be like I can only do these few

00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:18,020
things and you know hope that I get the

00:46:15,490 --> 00:46:20,120
you know get the features and get that

00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:23,960
all of what I need but you know a

00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:25,730
website's never finished and it's going

00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:28,280
to take multiple iterations and like

00:46:25,730 --> 00:46:30,020
we've taken this new tactic site from

00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,850
you know the old design

00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:33,890
to the new design and like Kristen said

00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:38,360
before we're still learning lots of

00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:40,580
lessons so I'm going to wrap it up if

00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:42,620
there's any questions you can come to

00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:45,470
the mic I could just add one other thing

00:46:42,620 --> 00:46:47,330
sorry um just to tell you guys a little

00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:49,880
bit about the result the end product oh

00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:51,410
yeah um the English site was launched in

00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,120
december and then the arabic site was

00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:56,810
launched in February mostly because the

00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:58,940
translation holdups and so far we've

00:46:56,810 --> 00:47:01,520
hosted two online conversations in

00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:06,250
Arabic which is really the main event

00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:09,050
that we host through the website and

00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:10,910
those topics were on the strategic use

00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:12,620
of social media for human rights and

00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:15,380
then the second topic was on monitoring

00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:17,180
prisons we had a total of a hundred and

00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:19,970
seventy comments for both of those

00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:22,580
conversations and it involved about 25

00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:25,460
people from I think about six or seven

00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:28,190
countries in the region so it's been

00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:31,370
really positive we've had nine thousand

00:47:28,190 --> 00:47:33,770
visits at least that was as of like

00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:35,570
three weeks ago since the launch of the

00:47:33,770 --> 00:47:38,930
Arabic site and that's specifically for

00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:41,500
the arabic website and we can also see

00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:44,120
through our google analytics that the

00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:46,100
the number of visitors come into our

00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:47,840
site that have their browser set to

00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,700
arabic has increased by three hundred

00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:53,240
and fifty percent which shouldn't be a

00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:58,190
surprise but it I mean really we've

00:47:53,240 --> 00:48:01,580
broadened our audience by so much and we

00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:04,040
are offering so much two people two

00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:05,510
activists in the Middle East and it

00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,910
feels like there's a lot of momentum and

00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:14,500
excitement and we're really happy with

00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:14,500
the response so far any questions

00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:27,759
so I was wondering the difficulty that

00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:30,799
Kristen mentioned about arabic in the

00:48:27,759 --> 00:48:34,219
autocomplete fields if either of you

00:48:30,799 --> 00:48:36,729
know if that are things like that are

00:48:34,219 --> 00:48:38,559
being addressed in like the d8

00:48:36,729 --> 00:48:41,029
translation internationalization

00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:43,009
initiatives maybe you don't but I

00:48:41,029 --> 00:48:46,279
thought I have no idea yeah everybody

00:48:43,009 --> 00:48:48,319
else know i oughtta I honestly don't

00:48:46,279 --> 00:48:53,779
know I'm gonna guess that it hasn't been

00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:58,699
addressed yet I think I mean there's

00:48:53,779 --> 00:49:00,829
also an issue is that and I face this at

00:48:58,699 --> 00:49:03,709
me dan when I was working with Arabic is

00:49:00,829 --> 00:49:09,979
that neither Kristen or I speak Arabic

00:49:03,709 --> 00:49:11,589
and like so when I was having to add you

00:49:09,979 --> 00:49:15,799
know translations to different websites

00:49:11,589 --> 00:49:19,130
like I do read and speak Hebrew so I

00:49:15,799 --> 00:49:21,410
understand like right to left but and so

00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:22,940
I could like recognize the symbols but

00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:24,739
you have to like change your keyboard

00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:26,180
and like I work on a max you have to

00:49:24,739 --> 00:49:27,769
change your keyboard to Arabic you have

00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:29,299
to figure out what the key mappings are

00:49:27,769 --> 00:49:32,509
you have to like do all of these things

00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:35,059
and then like so I mean I really guess

00:49:32,509 --> 00:49:38,119
the lesson is and it's it's not it's

00:49:35,059 --> 00:49:40,279
nobody's fault it's just like um we need

00:49:38,119 --> 00:49:41,779
an Arabic speaker to really put you know

00:49:40,279 --> 00:49:43,160
like that's the user experience an

00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:45,170
Arabic speaker needs to be putting this

00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,869
content and but that's not the actual

00:49:45,170 --> 00:49:52,549
possibility I don't know if it's a

00:49:47,869 --> 00:49:56,449
javascript thing or if it's a UTF coding

00:49:52,549 --> 00:49:59,390
thing because like so I'll find out I'll

00:49:56,449 --> 00:50:03,019
look into that we got another course

00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:04,880
also an opportunity for us to engage the

00:50:03,019 --> 00:50:07,449
Drupal community in the Middle East

00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:10,519
because I know that there are a lot of

00:50:07,449 --> 00:50:12,999
really active Drupal contributors in

00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:16,309
Egypt and other countries there and

00:50:12,999 --> 00:50:18,109
maybe maybe this is the time for me to

00:50:16,309 --> 00:50:20,900
finally reach out to them and ask for

00:50:18,109 --> 00:50:22,729
their help and find out what they what

00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:25,039
solutions they've found to these kinds

00:50:22,729 --> 00:50:26,420
of problems yeah def more just sharing

00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:28,099
the problems that I'm having that'd be

00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:29,660
helpful too yeah there's a couple date

00:50:28,099 --> 00:50:31,160
me sorry go ahead i was like

00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:33,559
to me and you could potions post an

00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:35,270
issue and someone might try to reproduce

00:50:33,559 --> 00:50:37,010
it and help you figure out how to fix it

00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:39,559
okay I just wanted to address the

00:50:37,010 --> 00:50:41,030
translation management there's actually

00:50:39,559 --> 00:50:42,770
a module called the translation

00:50:41,030 --> 00:50:45,410
management tool I haven't personally

00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:47,690
used it but and this probably speaks to

00:50:45,410 --> 00:50:49,400
your running out a budget sounds like

00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:51,500
towards the end of the project but I

00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:54,020
would definitely recommend anyone doing

00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:56,210
international websites to spend a lot of

00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:58,309
time thinking about the administrative

00:50:56,210 --> 00:51:02,020
interface and plan for a tool like this

00:50:58,309 --> 00:51:05,630
yeah there are other options like

00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:06,619
exporting content to be translated

00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:09,799
professionally but that requires

00:51:06,619 --> 00:51:11,869
obviously a lot bigger of a budget the

00:51:09,799 --> 00:51:14,359
translation translation management tool

00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:16,579
allows for an innocent relized interface

00:51:14,359 --> 00:51:18,680
and you can assign drupal roles to be a

00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:20,750
translator and so you can actually just

00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:23,990
have it's sort of like an automated way

00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:26,210
of using that spreadsheet but it

00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:28,130
actually maintains the content in the

00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:30,530
context of the Drupal website so nobody

00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:32,900
has to go through and copy and paste

00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:34,789
that content back into Drupal it's just

00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:38,359
like a Drupal interface for translating

00:51:34,789 --> 00:51:41,779
the content in the website yeah I've I

00:51:38,359 --> 00:51:46,369
haven't used the translation management

00:51:41,779 --> 00:51:49,819
module for d7 I used it in d6 it's which

00:51:46,369 --> 00:51:51,950
namespace okay and I have never used it

00:51:49,819 --> 00:51:54,230
personally cuz what there was a company

00:51:51,950 --> 00:51:56,539
there was a I can localize it I can

00:51:54,230 --> 00:52:01,010
localize was doing it I used it at me

00:51:56,539 --> 00:52:02,569
Dan for Drupal 6 and it worked I think

00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:05,299
me Dan is actually working on their own

00:52:02,569 --> 00:52:06,890
translation management module the reason

00:52:05,299 --> 00:52:08,930
we didn't go with that on this project

00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:12,500
is because new tactics only has one

00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:14,900
translator and so to put a huge code

00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:17,140
base for one module for one translator

00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:19,670
it just was a little bit overkill and

00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:22,369
the user experience of that it's a

00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:25,849
little wonky and when I use it in d6

00:52:22,369 --> 00:52:29,500
it's like a big I can localize logo and

00:52:25,849 --> 00:52:33,980
I think their specific use case is

00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:36,260
hiring translators who you know there's

00:52:33,980 --> 00:52:38,990
there's a whole translator community

00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:41,539
where you can like you can just work

00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:42,870
online and make like two cents a word or

00:52:41,539 --> 00:52:44,940
something like that

00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:46,350
module there is there's a interface

00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:47,520
there's a few ways of doing it there's

00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:48,870
one where you can hire out your

00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,950
translations and then there's another

00:52:48,870 --> 00:52:51,600
one where you can just have an

00:52:49,950 --> 00:52:54,650
administrative interface within your

00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:57,960
site and assigned a user translator role

00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:59,640
so cool I'll check it out for d7 I just

00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:02,700
most of the projects I've worked on

00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:04,980
didn't have like you know the the

00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:07,740
translation infrastructure of like

00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:13,950
managers and editors and stuff but yeah

00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:15,510
thanks Jesse another question could you

00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:18,470
talk just briefly about your approach to

00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:21,570
the low bandwidth a goal or objective

00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:23,070
did you have a separate targeted site to

00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:24,720
cut down on images or did you just make

00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:36,420
the focus on making a whole site super

00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:37,980
low bandwidth so you know we knew that

00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:42,360
there was low bandwidth we knew that

00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:46,020
certain places in like so Jordan has

00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:50,640
really good high speed internet Beirut

00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:52,440
Lebanon has good I think it's download

00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:57,050
speed but the upload speed is really

00:53:52,440 --> 00:54:01,170
slow and so it changes everywhere I

00:53:57,050 --> 00:54:03,390
mostly tried to like just design it in a

00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:06,270
way that like didn't have like really

00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:09,720
really heavy background images for the

00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:11,460
body and that you know I had certain

00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:13,830
ideas about if I was going to do the

00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:16,580
theme but you know life happens I got a

00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:18,810
new job so I don't know Brett did you

00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:22,560
specifically build any of those things

00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:26,730
in um you know tried delivered sprites

00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:30,599
where possible but there's there's

00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:34,109
there's still a lot of enhancement

00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:35,940
yeah I mean the other thing to do is

00:54:34,109 --> 00:54:39,029
like you can do different kinds of

00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:40,739
different resolutions of images things

00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:43,769
I've done is on mobile sites you just

00:54:40,739 --> 00:54:46,019
don't show the images there's different

00:54:43,769 --> 00:54:47,940
things you can do to like be like you

00:54:46,019 --> 00:54:50,729
know you can test what this bandwidth

00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:52,619
speed is we didn't do that here but yeah

00:54:50,729 --> 00:54:54,479
okay thanks see I'm about to be working

00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:56,759
on a project and come see a lot of

00:54:54,479 --> 00:55:00,450
Africa so I have a huge issue another

00:54:56,759 --> 00:55:05,009
thing is like don't like web fonts adds

00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:07,619
extra extra download or anything that's

00:55:05,009 --> 00:55:09,749
going to like a jquery that if you're

00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:11,970
like pulling that in from google like

00:55:09,749 --> 00:55:17,069
external urls you just want to limit

00:55:11,970 --> 00:55:19,710
those kind of things like yeah yeah i'm

00:55:17,069 --> 00:55:21,599
working with the side and it's

00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:23,789
multilingual we have to translate the

00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:29,039
content in seven different language Wow

00:55:23,789 --> 00:55:30,960
and I'm having a problem like i have i

00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:33,809
figure out the way how to translate the

00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,609
menu items we did that we are just I

00:55:33,809 --> 00:55:40,650
mean we just launched the site as a beta

00:55:35,609 --> 00:55:43,380
version and we are working in a dev to

00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:45,029
translate the content can you tell me

00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:47,400
how do you manage the text on me like

00:55:45,029 --> 00:55:49,619
when you define a content type and

00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:52,170
reference the taxonomy on the content

00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:56,009
type like did you actually translate the

00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:58,619
content type sorry taxonomy term or did

00:55:56,009 --> 00:56:01,789
you did you add a different texture

00:55:58,619 --> 00:56:05,400
return for different language gotcha I

00:56:01,789 --> 00:56:10,469
think there's a taxonomy translation

00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:12,630
module I'm not sure Kristin did are you

00:56:10,469 --> 00:56:18,719
using the same taxonomy terms for arabic

00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:21,749
and english ah well hmm like are they

00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:24,059
are the terms you know if one term is

00:56:21,749 --> 00:56:31,650
strategy are you exactly translating

00:56:24,059 --> 00:56:33,989
that to strategy um I believe so but it

00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:37,109
there could be a few that we're set up a

00:56:33,989 --> 00:56:39,539
little bit differently like country for

00:56:37,109 --> 00:56:42,660
example that we're using a taxonomy term

00:56:39,539 --> 00:56:44,110
for country or vocabulary for country

00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:46,330
and so each

00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:48,610
tree has a direct translation into

00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:51,100
Arabic that was really simple but there

00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:53,170
were a couple vocabularies that we're

00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:57,340
using that didn't have that one to one

00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:59,440
where we wanted to allow for some Arabic

00:56:57,340 --> 00:57:01,210
terms that would exist just in the

00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:05,110
Arabic site and some English terms just

00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:06,970
on an English site but I'm pretty sure

00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:08,440
we implemented that way but I can't

00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:11,200
think of an example of how we're using

00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:14,980
that but another thing maybe to point

00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:17,830
out is that our site isn't a one-to-one

00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:22,060
translation for all of our contents we

00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:24,370
can have nodes conversations comments

00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:26,440
that are that just live on the Arabic

00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:29,020
site and we can have content that just

00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:31,450
lives on the English site that was

00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:34,930
something that we hadn't mentioned yeah

00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:37,180
and another thing I would say I mean

00:57:34,930 --> 00:57:39,280
this is where trip Tran multilingual

00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:41,470
sites get really really confusing I

00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:43,420
really like it because it's a challenge

00:57:41,470 --> 00:57:44,650
but a lot of developers I talked to

00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:46,960
they're like well I'm not even gonna

00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:48,850
mess with multilingual but I think it's

00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:53,710
really important to look at the use case

00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:55,600
like you know are your users bilingual

00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:58,750
do they speak multiple languages would

00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:00,670
it be helpful to show specific taxonomy

00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:03,700
terms in one language but also show the

00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:05,770
English or another language you know

00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:08,080
what would would that hurt the user

00:58:05,770 --> 00:58:10,540
experience if there is not a one-to-one

00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:12,400
translation like maybe there's one term

00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:17,370
in one language that actually doesn't

00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:20,580
translate so I don't know if Drupal does

00:58:17,370 --> 00:58:24,580
multilingual taxonomy terms that well

00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:26,860
but it isn't because if you set it up

00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:28,990
that way so there should be a one-to-one

00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:30,640
translation but you don't enter that

00:58:28,990 --> 00:58:33,280
other translation you'll see that

00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,600
there's an empty field if you're making

00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:36,850
if you're displaying that field on the

00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:39,270
node now that i think about it and we

00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:43,630
ran into that problem with the terms and

00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:47,620
you know at funny monkey we are thinking

00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:49,180
about doing we do educational products

00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:52,480
so we I really want to get into the

00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:54,400
translation world with the educational

00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,380
products and the way we're starting to

00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,730
think about translation is not the way

00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:00,790
that Drupal is thinking about

00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:02,410
it not a one-to-one relationship like do

00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:04,720
you have this piece of English content

00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:07,630
and then you've directly translated it

00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:10,930
to this you know Arabic content because

00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:12,700
they're both going to change and so the

00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:15,460
way we're thinking about it is you have

00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:17,740
this original content you clone it and

00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:19,510
then you say okay now I'm going to make

00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:21,790
the language arabic and now there are

00:59:19,510 --> 00:59:26,230
two different entities and they're going

00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:27,910
to exist on their own and so the entity

00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:30,250
translation like doing field level

00:59:27,910 --> 00:59:32,770
translation kind of helps that so that

00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:34,510
if you're looking at a page in English

00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:36,790
you can hit translate and you can see

00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:39,580
which fields have been translated but I

00:59:36,790 --> 00:59:41,680
still think it's like if I only speak

00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:44,140
Arabic I only want to see the content

00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:45,820
that's in Arabic I'm not going to look

00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:48,550
I'm not going to use the language

00:59:45,820 --> 00:59:50,320
switcher so I think like it just it

00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:52,960
really actually it's a content strategy

00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:56,440
thing again it has to be relevant to the

00:59:52,960 --> 01:00:00,970
users that you're you're hoping will

00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:05,230
read the content did you use any fall

01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:07,720
back cases like for example if we

01:00:05,230 --> 01:00:10,690
launched a site in English we put every

01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:13,869
content and we don't have a content

01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:15,790
ready on Spanish and somebody click on

01:00:13,869 --> 01:00:19,060
the Spanish language I mean it's

01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:21,910
partially translated to Spanish yeah so

01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:25,480
what will happen like that many many

01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:27,490
items and content is there with that we

01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:29,710
can if it's not translated to English

01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:33,340
Spanish can we just display in English

01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:35,410
yeah entity entity feel like field level

01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:37,180
translation will let you do that so

01:00:35,410 --> 01:00:40,480
let's say you've done the title and the

01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:42,480
body right yeah if you've done the title

01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:47,070
in the body in Spanish you can see those

01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:47,070
Spanish terms yeah

01:00:52,789 --> 01:00:55,789
right

01:01:15,849 --> 01:01:20,619
which I honestly i think is all kind of

01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,779
hacky like what does the user really

01:01:20,619 --> 01:01:25,089
want you know like let's say I only

01:01:22,779 --> 01:01:27,309
speak Spanish and I come to this page am

01:01:25,089 --> 01:01:29,259
I going to be satisfied to read a title

01:01:27,309 --> 01:01:32,019
and a description when really what I

01:01:29,259 --> 01:01:36,190
want is that PDF download you know so

01:01:32,019 --> 01:01:38,829
it's like is it even helpful to have a

01:01:36,190 --> 01:01:41,349
Spanish toggle on that page like

01:01:38,829 --> 01:01:43,900
probably shouldn't even have it you know

01:01:41,349 --> 01:01:46,869
unless you think your user might be able

01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:49,960
to read both languages okay my other

01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:53,140
question is did you use the like did you

01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:56,710
use the node translation or entity

01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:58,660
translation because I found that note

01:01:56,710 --> 01:02:01,660
into the translation you'd have to

01:01:58,660 --> 01:02:04,359
translate every field in the content

01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:06,930
type and they separate user interface

01:02:04,359 --> 01:02:10,749
for translating can't like every field

01:02:06,930 --> 01:02:12,489
so is that what you did or I I wasn't

01:02:10,749 --> 01:02:15,249
involved in the development I know that

01:02:12,489 --> 01:02:18,670
they used entity translation do you have

01:02:15,249 --> 01:02:20,349
an we don't have the person who did the

01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:22,569
bag and development here anyway when you

01:02:20,349 --> 01:02:24,700
add in content will you when you say

01:02:22,569 --> 01:02:27,489
that this is for English heading this is

01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:29,410
for Spanish ating this is for our big

01:02:27,489 --> 01:02:34,420
heading yeah do you have to say that or

01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:37,269
I mean Kristen when you're adding

01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:39,519
content so you have an English node when

01:02:37,269 --> 01:02:43,710
you want to make it Arabic you you're

01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:46,660
just translating via the fields right

01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:48,910
well there's a translation tab like you

01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:51,369
would expect and then you see the entire

01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:53,799
back end of the node just as it is

01:02:51,369 --> 01:02:56,019
Manglish actually and it's all in Arabic

01:02:53,799 --> 01:02:58,329
so there's the title there's the body

01:02:56,019 --> 01:03:01,180
there's the taxonomy terms there's the

01:02:58,329 --> 01:03:03,999
publishing options everything is there

01:03:01,180 --> 01:03:06,309
in Arabic so I don't know how that was

01:03:03,999 --> 01:03:08,140
built on entity translation because it

01:03:06,309 --> 01:03:09,489
looks like it's the entire node being

01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:11,259
translated but i'm not sure i think

01:03:09,489 --> 01:03:13,150
that's the node translation of the

01:03:11,259 --> 01:03:14,859
integers friends yeah when you say into

01:03:13,150 --> 01:03:18,700
the translation that phil has to be

01:03:14,859 --> 01:03:20,619
translated with the via translation

01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:22,239
interface yeah it does sound like it

01:03:20,619 --> 01:03:23,859
does sound like no translation I'm not

01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:27,009
sure because I wasn't there during the

01:03:23,859 --> 01:03:28,809
development but I can follow up with the

01:03:27,009 --> 01:03:29,650
developer and do you have any problem

01:03:28,809 --> 01:03:31,770
with the

01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:36,430
like translating views and different

01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:38,859
language because those yes yeah we have

01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:41,440
for the views on the peas how did you

01:03:38,859 --> 01:03:43,150
handle that like when you are the peas

01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:45,400
if somebody's check on different

01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:48,039
languages and you supposed to render the

01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:51,520
same pace and real different language so

01:03:48,039 --> 01:03:54,849
this specific website like the Arabic

01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:56,140
content didn't match up like is totally

01:03:54,849 --> 01:03:59,319
different content than the English

01:03:56,140 --> 01:04:00,819
content so they were different views but

01:03:59,319 --> 01:04:02,609
yeah you're right there is a problem

01:04:00,819 --> 01:04:05,079
like Drupal is not a perfect

01:04:02,609 --> 01:04:14,140
multilingual solution I think we do what

01:04:05,079 --> 01:04:16,480
we can and you know like yeah that's

01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:20,069
pretty much okay so there's a there's a

01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:20,069
module called views translation

01:04:35,769 --> 01:04:40,009
to have an experience with the source

01:04:38,180 --> 01:04:44,029
like what about SARS like we are using

01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:46,489
solar sirs and that has to be translated

01:04:44,029 --> 01:04:49,190
like we have 10 different micro sites we

01:04:46,489 --> 01:04:51,109
are combining into one side they are

01:04:49,190 --> 01:04:57,529
translating into different like seven

01:04:51,109 --> 01:05:00,380
different languages right no no no Fitz

01:04:57,529 --> 01:05:05,630
it's all real content and our landing

01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:07,970
pieces thank you yeah I sorry I don't

01:05:05,630 --> 01:05:09,950
have all the answers it's it starts to

01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:12,049
get really really complicated and like

01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:13,249
when you throw solar search in there and

01:05:12,049 --> 01:05:15,680
then you're supporting seven different

01:05:13,249 --> 01:05:22,519
languages and then you have to have like

01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:26,359
the i did a site in d6 with apache solr

01:05:22,519 --> 01:05:28,609
search and we had to get a bunch of

01:05:26,359 --> 01:05:32,359
add-ons to like support the specific

01:05:28,609 --> 01:05:34,460
language and with the database and to

01:05:32,359 --> 01:05:35,930
make sure that you know I'm not a

01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:38,539
back-end developer so I don't know all

01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:44,089
of the details but it was a process it's

01:05:38,539 --> 01:05:47,420
not straightforward and yeah so I feel

01:05:44,089 --> 01:05:49,880
your pain but I think it's possible and

01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:51,319
like I mean this is this is the great

01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:53,690
thing about the Internet is that like

01:05:51,319 --> 01:05:56,359
its global we're all speaking different

01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:58,599
languages you know it's possible like

01:05:56,359 --> 01:06:01,579
I'm really inspired by global voices

01:05:58,599 --> 01:06:03,769
website because they're doing a really

01:06:01,579 --> 01:06:05,119
good job of translation they're doing

01:06:03,769 --> 01:06:06,230
the best they can they're using

01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:13,039
WordPress I believe you're out of

01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:14,539
WordPress oh what's that yeah so I when

01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:16,609
i'm trying to think about translation i

01:06:14,539 --> 01:06:19,430
go and I'm like okay how are they doing

01:06:16,609 --> 01:06:24,079
it globalvoices on is it global voices

01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:28,430
or globalvoices online Oh globalvoices

01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:32,089
online globalvoices online yeah thank

01:06:28,430 --> 01:06:34,940
you thank you so much I actually had a

01:06:32,089 --> 01:06:36,710
question to Suzanne Kristin Kristin

01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:38,720
sorry oh I'm having a really hard time

01:06:36,710 --> 01:06:43,519
hearing yeah can you talk right into the

01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:46,819
microphone and Kristin when you refer to

01:06:43,519 --> 01:06:49,089
English side or Arabic site what do you

01:06:46,819 --> 01:06:49,089
mean

01:06:49,849 --> 01:06:56,579
okay because it's all one big site it's

01:06:53,099 --> 01:06:58,710
so interesting because with my team my

01:06:56,579 --> 01:07:00,630
new tactics team I always talk about it

01:06:58,710 --> 01:07:02,460
as if it's there's an English site in an

01:07:00,630 --> 01:07:04,530
Arabic site but really it is all the

01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:07,290
same site yeah what I mean is that

01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:10,589
there's a community of Arabic speakers

01:07:07,290 --> 01:07:13,440
are able to go to straight to the arabic

01:07:10,589 --> 01:07:15,359
website now if their browser is set to

01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:18,150
Arabic it will automatically show up in

01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:20,520
Arabic in their browser and they're able

01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:22,320
to search and explore all of our

01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:24,780
resources that are in Arabic and there's

01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:28,320
a lot and they're able to participate in

01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:31,740
a community in the Arabic language so

01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:34,619
it's like it's as if it's it's own thing

01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:36,599
it's like its own platform and then the

01:07:34,619 --> 01:07:41,180
English speakers would participate in

01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:43,770
the English community hmm thank you yeah

01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:48,240
sorry for the confusion it's all one

01:07:43,770 --> 01:07:49,950
site which was part of a you know a user

01:07:48,240 --> 01:07:51,780
experience problem we had to solve it

01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:54,089
was like okay we're gonna have arabic

01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:55,560
users going on to the same site but they

01:07:54,089 --> 01:07:57,750
only speak Arabic but maybe they'll be

01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:59,240
bilingual but we really just want them

01:07:57,750 --> 01:08:02,250
to participate in the Arabic

01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:05,010
conversations it's not like we're having

01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:06,329
one conversation that gets translated it

01:08:05,010 --> 01:08:12,440
was we're having two separate

01:08:06,329 --> 01:08:15,440
conversations any other questions yes

01:08:12,440 --> 01:08:15,440
yeah

01:08:22,609 --> 01:08:30,029
so the question was a timeline question

01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:32,489
she asked we we published the English in

01:08:30,029 --> 01:08:35,130
December and just and in and then

01:08:32,489 --> 01:08:36,779
recently the Arabic one we started

01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:40,980
develop or we started the user

01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:48,599
experience process can you refresh my

01:08:40,980 --> 01:08:52,589
brain may May in May for April and the I

01:08:48,599 --> 01:08:54,779
left think shout in October so but but

01:08:52,589 --> 01:08:57,179
development had already begun before I

01:08:54,779 --> 01:08:59,460
left so I was finishing up the research

01:08:57,179 --> 01:09:02,339
we had already started the development

01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:04,770
Brett came on and did the theming so

01:09:02,339 --> 01:09:07,679
from october to December they finished

01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:09,719
up the English site so yeah and by

01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:13,290
finishing up the English site I just

01:09:09,719 --> 01:09:16,500
mean that the website was live and we

01:09:13,290 --> 01:09:18,869
hid the Arabic button so it's not like

01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:21,569
we launched one site and then another

01:09:18,869 --> 01:09:24,779
site that's another confusing part on my

01:09:21,569 --> 01:09:26,940
and it's that we just didn't we just

01:09:24,779 --> 01:09:30,569
didn't make public the Arabic button

01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:32,429
yeah yep you're welcome well thanks
