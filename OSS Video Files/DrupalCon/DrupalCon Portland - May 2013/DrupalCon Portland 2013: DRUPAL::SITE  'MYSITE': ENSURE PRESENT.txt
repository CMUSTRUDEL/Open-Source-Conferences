Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: DRUPAL::SITE  'MYSITE': ENSURE PRESENT
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	Puppet is a configuration management tool used to automate and standardize infrastructures. I am developing a Puppet module that will simplify and streamline the management of a Drupal site.

This is particularly useful in the light of dev environments. It is useful to be able to describe the exact environment that a client is using, down to versions of apache and php. My modules will fully manage a drupal site and let you instantiate a new site with a given version of apache, php, a specified list of modules & themes, at specified versions, all within a few lines of code.

This means that your configuration can be checked into version control. It means that you can spin up a new dev virtual machine in minutes. It means that you could ship a puppet manifest with your new site and the client would have documentation as to exactly the versions coded for, or even use that manifest on their own network if they're also running Puppet.

This talk will likely be given in conjunction with collaborators at Metal Toad.

The talk is still in development as I was just invited to submit a talk a few days ago, so I don't have slides to share at this point.
