Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: DRUPAL 8 PLUGIN SYSTEM DEEP DIVE
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	The Drupal 8 plugin system provides a new set of options within Drupal for discovery, instantiation and invocation beyond what traditional hooks have provided in past version of Drupal core. The plugin system provides the underlying structure to allow classes to sit in place of what has often been multiple disconnected hooks. Many subsystems in Drupal have been converted to plugins including blocks, entities field widgets and more. We'll discuss many of these at some level and try to communicate what appropriate plugin system usage looks like, what tools already exist, how to leverage them, and where to get more information on building your own plugin types.

A larger discussion around plugin discovery and annotations specifically will be had including discovery decorators and their interactions with the Managers and Factory interfaces. This topic is quite nuanced and many details will be conveyed to the audience including a couple different points of view.
