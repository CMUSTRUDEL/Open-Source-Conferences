Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	Reinventing the wheel is always cumbersome.

There are already a vast amount of Drupal modules out there. Leveraging Github, PEAR, Packagist, and the PHP community, it's now easier to broaden the functionality spectrum of your Drupal websites even more.

This session will introduce ways of integrating Drupal with the Composer package management system in order to take advantage of some of the best PHP libraries out there.

so there's this is

00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,790

00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:46,880
so it doesn't

00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:28,109
it's gone too late when you have a bunch

00:36:10,589 --> 00:36:40,740
of different this is kind of mind

00:36:28,109 --> 00:36:49,880
calling because it's but it gives you

00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:49,880
hell purview of once you have the
