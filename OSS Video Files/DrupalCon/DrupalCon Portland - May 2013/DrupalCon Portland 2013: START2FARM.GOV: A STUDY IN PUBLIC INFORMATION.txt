Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: START2FARM.GOV: A STUDY IN PUBLIC INFORMATION
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	Start2Farm.gov was developed as a special information tool for the USDA's Beginning Farmer and Rancher Development Program. It has a public facing interface that includes a searchable database and a restricted access extranet with special functions for grant recipients. Challenges in this project include determining and meeting the needs of the grant program, creating tools and interfaces for diverse users, development of the database and the integration of external content sources. Successes include the creation of a comprehensive national resource for a specific user group and the implementation of an extranet function for grant recipients. This presentation will examine Start2Farm.gov in terms of its ability to meet the needs of the various end users including the grant recipients, the public users, and the federal grant program itself.

hooksett getting constant think it's

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,030
coming everybody my name is Greg lon

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,590
chay I'm the local track chair for the

00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:16,710
government education trailer from home

00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,600
so this smaller teacher talks really

00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,130
excited to have a recorder coming over

00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:34,969
the US Department of Agriculture and

00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:37,770
start program thank you very much

00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:39,629
drupalcon is really really excited oh

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:41,640
wow this is starting is a new

00:00:39,629 --> 00:00:43,739
opportunity and then I could have this

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,690
delayed reaction of oh my god I'm going

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:48,450
to speak with Drupal on earth I'm going

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,520
to talk about and we probably up spread

00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:53,489
apart which I'd love to talk about but

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,920
normally I talk to farmers and farm

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:59,430
educators about it so this is a totally

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,230
different audience so I hope that what I

00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,979
put together here will be a value to you

00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:06,960
I thought what I should start with is

00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:09,090
introducing myself or more specifically

00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:16,400
what I do is you see where I'm coming

00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:20,549
from it's project so I am a librarian

00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:23,820
and of course we all have specific ideas

00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,920
about librarians or what they do usually

00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:27,720
get one of two reactions eager to have a

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,520
librarian and they keep their eyes glaze

00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,520
over and they just go find something

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,740
else to do or I'll get really excited

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,470
and start talking with other wonderful

00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,570
times in the library so I talk to this

00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:43,110
one gentleman explained out the library

00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:45,119
and instead oh oh what up he says one of

00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,490
my first job my friends and I at lunch

00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,490
we're getting these debates over like

00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,320
trivia with movies and historical events

00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,460
and all these

00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:58,280
and they would bet each other over who

00:01:55,460 --> 00:02:00,890
got it right who said what after was

00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,200
right or whatever it was and the way

00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:06,440
they would settle it vet was they called

00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:10,250
the library down the street and he's

00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:12,080
like she knew everything he's a week he

00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,940
always answered our questions notice it

00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,200
perfectly if you guys just know

00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:20,450
everything and the truth is we don't

00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,459
know everything but in there just

00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:26,090
important part we do know where

00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:29,360
everything is so that's the trick we

00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:32,630
also know who put it there we know why

00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,480
it's there we know what for Madison we

00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:36,530
know who's looking for it we know why

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,090
they're looking for it and how

00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,160
frustrated they are trying to get to it

00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,010
and we know what format they wanted it

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:46,870
so we do have a lot of information to

00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:49,280
contribute to information my particular

00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,880
backgrounds are working data management

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,370
knowledge management gently by accident

00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,980
I quite love it sometimes gather

00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,709
information came from the far corners of

00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:03,980
the universe I also public service my

00:03:00,709 --> 00:03:05,840
brain so I have spent many long hours on

00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,380
the references asking for answering

00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:13,579
questions from people like the guy you

00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:16,519
call up his library like and I also work

00:03:13,579 --> 00:03:18,680
in information literacy so teaching

00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,690
people how to find information also very

00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,560
importantly how to evaluate the

00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,560
information they tried

00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:34,670
the program i'm going to talk to you

00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:38,150
about today is really to me very much a

00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:39,890
library and it's all about gathering

00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,140
information and making sure it's

00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,670
organized and very important leaders

00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:46,040
where the public information content

00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:48,859
making sure it's available to people who

00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:53,389
need it and I think that really put the

00:03:48,859 --> 00:03:58,340
whole thing you've got to so start to

00:03:53,389 --> 00:04:00,500
farm and this is our Gordon global it is

00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,120
part of a larger program within the US

00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,489
agency has State Department of

00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,889
Agriculture called the beginning farmer

00:04:04,489 --> 00:04:09,980
and rancher development program which we

00:04:06,889 --> 00:04:11,870
call the authorities if I say that I was

00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:14,060
tried very careful about the alphabet

00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,120
soup since I worked for the government I

00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,410
want to make sure I don't lose anybody

00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,049
but getting far right of development

00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,940
program and was set up by Congress

00:04:21,049 --> 00:04:26,990
actually an administered through the

00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:28,460
USDA to help create more farmers when I

00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,830
did the first presentation for my

00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:32,419
co-workers the kinda just said oh we

00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,720
need more farmers and their goddesses

00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:38,630
Rose you have to explain so so here's

00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,389
the situation farmers are getting older

00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:43,039
and Michael no problem everyone is

00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:45,240
farmers are getting older but no younger

00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:48,509
new farmers or replacing

00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,370
so we're actually losing our power so

00:04:48,509 --> 00:04:54,000
why do we need your farmers well there's

00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:59,009
lots and lots of reasons for that really

00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,930
quickly one of economic so farms are

00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:10,259
businesses they contribute to the

00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:13,919
economy locally international economy

00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:16,380
there's also secure an issue so it's

00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,889
food so let's take for example fresh

00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,810
produce most of our fresh produce is

00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:24,060
either going for overseas or it's just

00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:28,319
produced in very specific regions of the

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:31,319
country if there is a social or natural

00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,360
disaster and these areas were cut off

00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:34,979
from our food supply and there's guides

00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,889
the classic route of it drives

00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:43,099
availability down and this especially

00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:45,840
affects people on fixed income and

00:05:43,099 --> 00:05:48,870
society we're seeing is starting to slip

00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,030
down the economic scale it has becomes a

00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:54,449
bigger bigger problem we need food of an

00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:56,400
available at speed security and blast

00:05:54,449 --> 00:05:59,699
well I'm going to talk about it was many

00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,440
many more social so the last eight years

00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:04,050
a lot of people been very interested in

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:07,919
where their food comes from big thing

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:09,509
right now and it's very exciting what

00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,130
they slide was there an introduction of

00:06:09,509 --> 00:06:12,389
farmers markets and people actually

00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:16,110
being able to go out and meet farmers

00:06:12,389 --> 00:06:19,199
that they're eating healthier so they

00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:20,880
also are going out to these places and

00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,690
be more active so there's a lot of

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,690
benefits

00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:32,710
and i'm going to cover here i think i

00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:41,289
spent a whole session just talking about

00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:43,060
lighting evening farmers but before I

00:06:41,289 --> 00:06:45,069
move on to the next slide are actually

00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,919
work on a little bit about our program

00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:49,750
again is we have a partner which is the

00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,449
American Farm Bureau Federation that's

00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:55,120
part of our program requirement but we

00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:57,490
have an unofficial poker and they're all

00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,870
here in the front row so this is our web

00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:02,110
developers who designed and developed

00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:03,879
right sweetie media or local kids that I

00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:08,379
want to point out that our unofficial

00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:19,379
partner but definitely the reason the

00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:21,729
stud is here and it's so great in 2002

00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:24,669
Congress society definitely we need new

00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:27,669
farmers so they added some legislation

00:07:24,669 --> 00:07:32,680
into a total farm go and this is actual

00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:34,750
law secretary insists its capital X that

00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,150
means a secretary agriculture show

00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:39,279
establish an online hearing comes in

00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:45,250
clearing house just you know the

00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:47,020
database that makes available to

00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,729
beginning farmers and rip or ranchers

00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:51,009
education curricula and training

00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:53,440
materials and programs which may include

00:07:51,009 --> 00:07:57,629
online courses for directly particular

00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,740
most ranchers wonderful idea coryell

00:07:57,629 --> 00:08:01,400
information curriculum all these things

00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:06,990
to help training partners

00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:12,240
and a beautiful idea five easy lessons

00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:14,280
can be a partner realistic but was it

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,590
what happened that the course of goes to

00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:20,880
the secretary what should say this was

00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:23,100
putting a law 2003-2008 Congress

00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:26,790
actually gave it some life so this

00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:28,440
actually started in 2008 and extent it

00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:31,710
to Secretary of Agriculture and of

00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:34,680
course ESP responsibility it's making

00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:39,270
things happen so we're in the US

00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:41,280
theaters programs taking on the agency

00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:44,480
called visit the National Institute of

00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:47,310
Food and Agriculture and they don't

00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,410
administer all the rats that the USDA

00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:51,630
tivated administered quite a few of them

00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:54,690
so that's the way their function is the

00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:56,310
kind of you know get this these

00:08:54,690 --> 00:09:03,630
different programs or research or

00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:08,190
whatever it is the country and so I'm

00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:11,160
going to describe it will help you

00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:14,580
understand later on what we're doing but

00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,890
what happens is this event creates a

00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:20,490
document which is called request for

00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:23,970
application and they list everything

00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:25,770
that they want residents to do and then

00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,770
the grand pursuit of the grant

00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:30,150
applicants send a proposal battery and

00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:32,580
in their application saying what they

00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:35,170
will do so they live down if we get this

00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,300
money we're going to do this

00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:39,130
and then it's reviewed and then certain

00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:46,450
people get paid to make it for money and

00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:50,230
then you're kind of blocked it so we

00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:52,329
have this law saying we have found a

00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:55,870
clearing house and you don't see is it

00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:58,899
more to this law thing that fees there's

00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:00,790
other programs but us Kate needs to do

00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:03,880
to make sure that people are able to

00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:05,170
develop a curriculum and so since

00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:07,660
they're together there's kind of this

00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:13,449
assumption I probably should work

00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:15,459
together now that Nashville insisted

00:10:13,449 --> 00:10:17,430
started the natural Agricultural library

00:10:15,459 --> 00:10:20,320
even I get lumped in alphabetical

00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:22,630
perhaps for agricultural library at five

00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,610
towards the program so most of the

00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,680
grants under this program of your

00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:30,910
training and then there's one special

00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:33,940
one for this area so the National

00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:36,339
Agricultural library reply for it and

00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:42,130
doesn't and here's what we promise to do

00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:44,529
so I am I a man nal we promise to see

00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:46,360
what already exists did so beyond the

00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:48,010
credit program what is actually out

00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:50,350
there in the country for beginning

00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:54,430
farmers and ranchers we promised to

00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:58,000
build my existing house basically build

00:10:54,430 --> 00:11:01,630
the database online and then that's kind

00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,130
of rare that clearing house spectrum

00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:06,070
that I just showed you that congress's

00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:09,550
and then these rescue parts were refer

00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:13,769
to the other great so how grabs their

00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:13,769
pants communicate and provide outreach

00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:41,589
I'm going to go through and show you how

00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:48,640
we did before i get there there are

00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:50,040
certain assumptions project that i feel

00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,060
like i need to define and explain

00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,770
because those we look at the different

00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:56,620
parts i want to understand what I need

00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:58,570
when I refer to them and the reason I

00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,270
really want to take them in a positive I

00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:04,390
don't only see this project I see that

00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:17,649
every project network so i call them

00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:20,560
assumption the first it's a minute of

00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:22,750
universal ones estes idea that everyone

00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,790
looks for information as saying they

00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,010
react to information resources the same

00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:30,420
they use the same terms we mean with

00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:33,070
anything this is just wrong not true

00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,529
everyone there's a lot of talk here

00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:39,459
about multiple devices and multiple

00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:41,970
platforms there's a million ways that we

00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,970
all do

00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:51,390
and that's one of the if you build it

00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:52,890
this only works then filled with dead

00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:59,250
baseball players it does not work

00:12:52,890 --> 00:13:03,210
anywhere else at all this is my favorite

00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:05,460
one the myth of the hard-working so if

00:13:03,210 --> 00:13:07,590
you're familiar there's a European fairy

00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:10,170
tale for the elves and the shoemaker and

00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:13,200
the shoemaker visa chip a good man

00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:15,150
before and so at night these elves with

00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:18,180
um if you always work for him and

00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:20,040
eventually he's able to summers but the

00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:22,320
idea of the hard-working else is really

00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,180
pervasive especially when you're talking

00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:27,030
about public information to government

00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:29,190
education and nonprofit because they

00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:31,140
don't have any money so the wonderful

00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:32,670
things I else besides the fact that they

00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:36,750
have no constraints they are nothing

00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:41,220
stock stock plead to give you an example

00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:45,270
of hard-working elves in 2008 when we

00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:47,610
kind of minor on the downturn several

00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:50,070
corporations are looking for ways to

00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,660
save the life of a they're caught so

00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,190
they went and they looked at their

00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:55,050
library function within their

00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:58,560
corporation in whatever way that was

00:13:55,050 --> 00:14:00,480
manifested and librarians I am one I

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:04,860
love them they're not very good at

00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:06,300
explaining what they did so the

00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,210
corporation just said we'll get rid of

00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,770
this what is this an extruder but you

00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:13,380
remember what I said about librarians as

00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:14,940
we know where we can get so then they

00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,100
realize they need somebody who knows

00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,210
what everything is so they lived through

00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:20,520
the corporate and people they already

00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:23,310
tagged so once turn any lighting and a

00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:26,010
CIP and they're like oh they opened for

00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:28,230
ages another title they can do it that's

00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:29,950
the information out there to have your

00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,860
technology

00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:34,360
I was working another organization they

00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:37,150
wanted to build an institutional

00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:41,080
repository for research that was

00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:43,030
produced in the institution and so we

00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,800
start developing the plan on how to make

00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,390
this happen and there was some funds

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,570
that might come up and I saw the

00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:52,240
proposal go after the flood and under

00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:55,870
the list of personnel to build the

00:14:52,240 --> 00:15:00,910
repository it listed three student

00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:03,040
assistants that was the wisdom these

00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,650
student assistants and I'm sure they

00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,410
would have been just eager and do the

00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:10,630
best I can not qualified to do what we

00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:13,120
needed them see let's get knowledge now

00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:15,100
and I know that there are many people is

00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,370
room in this conference you are in fact

00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,390
Arabs so you're in an ironic

00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:22,510
organization of some kind and they said

00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:25,420
oh we need a new website you look for a

00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:30,760
little tricky you can care for it so the

00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:34,900
elders and probably one of many people

00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:37,980
here actually expert on me okay last one

00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:41,680
is the idea that everything is available

00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:43,030
you live in a consumer society so we

00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,500
tend to think of our information in the

00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:46,210
way we think of any other product to

00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,970
think I need some information i'm going

00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:57,670
to go to the information store and they

00:15:48,970 --> 00:16:01,780
go to however the reality is sometimes

00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:03,100
the information is split into theta that

00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,500
doesn't match each other and eventually

00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,830
hidden around the whole store all the

00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,830
different

00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:37,959
understanding is basis for assumptions

00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:39,700
and look at what we need so the first

00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:43,060
thing I promise to do is to find what

00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:45,399
already exists mrs. discovery honesty

00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:48,339
reasons we did it one is to find content

00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:50,320
for the database so we have this grant

00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:52,060
program and we have to work with that

00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,279
and they're going to produce materials

00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:56,500
that we're not limited to them so the

00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:59,170
starter farm database our job is to find

00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,700
everything in the whole country for

00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:03,670
beginning farmers and ranchers that's

00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:11,230
our challenge and then also to design

00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:13,270
this is what's happening so what did we

00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:15,550
get let me lift at what was out there

00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:18,189
and the first thing we did is we were

00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:19,569
able to set parameters to the project so

00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:21,160
when the first thing I did when I

00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:24,100
arrived on a standard in the various

00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,709
library I got down there wrote a

00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:28,690
collection development policy and what

00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:31,300
this does is says we will collect there

00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:34,720
soon knock course so basically giving

00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:37,140
shape to what we're going to do an

00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,140
example

00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:49,660
which part so we think of like a

00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,670
development is very rather than farming

00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:53,800
or the local food movement even is very

00:17:51,670 --> 00:18:06,460
roughed up and farming but they're not

00:17:53,800 --> 00:18:08,380
really about getting closed doors budget

00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:10,960
parameters that were able to classify

00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,810
what kind of database for content we're

00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:24,010
going to have design the structure of it

00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:27,760
and to develop our classification that

00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:29,350
done we said what do farmers need well

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,200
they need education and training they

00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:34,210
know how to do things they need

00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:43,030
financing so the number one first and we

00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:46,720
get is how do I get technical services

00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:54,100
so during your taxes as a farmer a very

00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:58,150
different than doing so many farmers

00:18:54,100 --> 00:19:01,090
really needs to gallop and then networks

00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,890
farmers need support networks they need

00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:06,180
other people to understand where they're

00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,180
coming from that they can talk

00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,719
we created constructor so we looked at

00:19:17,309 --> 00:19:24,719
these things we said you know some of

00:19:18,719 --> 00:19:27,029
these things are interested that's an

00:19:24,719 --> 00:19:29,070
activity we're gonna call those programs

00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:31,049
and then you have things you have

00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:33,450
manuals and worksheets or not intangible

00:19:31,049 --> 00:19:37,399
things like databases or going to call

00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:40,829
those resources and those are our two

00:19:37,399 --> 00:19:43,109
and then all of these programs and

00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:46,379
resources either created or distributed

00:19:43,109 --> 00:19:48,329
by organizations so this is our basic

00:19:46,379 --> 00:19:52,109
database structure these are our three

00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:53,549
content types within grupal and if you

00:19:52,109 --> 00:19:55,679
positive and they're not the only ones

00:19:53,549 --> 00:20:02,279
we use but you have to throw everything

00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:04,079
out this is just kind of foundation and

00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:14,249
then we developed an initial taxonomy

00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:15,839
and so what we did is we went through we

00:20:14,249 --> 00:20:18,570
looked at words that have a lot we

00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:21,089
looked at reference points that you get

00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:25,679
at the library we had several people who

00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:27,839
would contact us for many years after it

00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:30,950
started farming they look back through

00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:30,950
the questions they're asking

00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:04,150
so you can see things like cooperative

00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:09,130
there's all these things are topics that

00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:12,850
come up we take on training helping them

00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:15,490
learn how to join we're having an

00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:23,710
incubator way to go and actually start

00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:26,470
the farm so we develop this next army so

00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:27,910
this economy plus the green content

00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:51,070
types of showed you this is the

00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:56,440
foundation so the second thing we

00:21:51,070 --> 00:22:00,730
promise to do is to build and that put

00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:02,860
up a really big question so in content

00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:09,370
strategy of course the wisdom of

00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:12,370
published died you said you need to give

00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:15,400
everyone one narrow it down so okay no

00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:18,820
problem securing farmers and ranchers

00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:21,970
that's arriving I want to point out with

00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:23,860
this picture that these people are not

00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,510
be getting farmers and ranchers and

00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:29,190
there's a clever ins little way you can

00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:31,650
tell and that is that they're clean

00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:33,510
if they were farmers and ranchers they

00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:36,450
would be healthy and I don't mean that

00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:37,830
in a bad way a tough job and you have to

00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:43,350
get out there and you haven't really do

00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:45,570
it it's long hours hard work but people

00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:47,970
who love it will tell you this there's

00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:50,400
nothing there life and they they wear

00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:56,120
their dirt proudly I think they develop

00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:58,350
large but we just have this picture of

00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:01,950
her that you were going to come up this

00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:04,170
day ask me you know who was farming you

00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:05,850
said okay so are the people who are

00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:08,180
going into farming are they young people

00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:12,750
fresh out of college I say next

00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:17,000
yesterday they were retirees vs disabled

00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:19,770
people yes immigrants and refugees yes

00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,290
accused been ok well are they people to

00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:23,970
grew up on a farm yes the people who've

00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:27,600
never sit without other pretty ever in

00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:29,880
their ways yes and this is really

00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,640
something this is the basis of public

00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:35,640
information we don't have the luxury of

00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:39,740
really narrowing our group down if we

00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:42,540
were selling purses we could say this is

00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:43,830
just as buying purses and the people who

00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:45,330
are willing to buy them for what I'm

00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:49,350
willing to sell me for that's my

00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:52,350
audience no problem we have to take a

00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:54,960
full cross section of society when we're

00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:56,520
working with public image so farming is

00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,200
one of these things think about public

00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:00,990
health education and all these things

00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,780
affect everyone so when you're designing

00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:06,020
a spider or trying to bring these things

00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:22,880
together you have to

00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:27,950
I going to do and this is start to calm

00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:44,990
doctors our public facing site is

00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:48,970
gorgeous you know homepage really scary

00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:51,530
topic that I said okay so you have Alice

00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:53,780
she falls down the rabbit hole she ends

00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:57,110
up with a room with big doors and little

00:24:53,780 --> 00:25:02,500
doors I said need lots of doors and they

00:24:57,110 --> 00:25:06,350
may be different sizes and they all

00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:10,850
that's the idea and some of the little

00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:13,040
doors includes analogy over here we have

00:25:10,850 --> 00:25:16,090
the spotlight section gentle rain too

00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,090
great that's really

00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:32,299
but I'm real look at three big doors in

00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:33,829
the middle and we found with beginning

00:25:32,299 --> 00:25:36,079
farmers ranchers you can divide them

00:25:33,829 --> 00:25:37,789
into groups and one of the groups are

00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:40,729
people who have already started clapping

00:25:37,789 --> 00:25:42,799
so this is an official definition of

00:25:40,729 --> 00:25:51,829
beginning farmer which says 10 years are

00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:59,239
left already on the damn charming or

00:25:51,829 --> 00:26:01,309
info and then you have people who are

00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:03,769
really new to farming or just considered

00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:06,739
and we affectionately refer to these

00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:07,999
people with dreamers and for the

00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:12,099
dreamers who wanted to give them a

00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:16,629
special way into wonder so the first

00:26:12,099 --> 00:26:16,629
door near the thinking about farming

00:26:17,889 --> 00:26:21,069
this tutorial

00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:49,970
for harming their Christian eight copies

00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:56,600
before people take on a loan or spend

00:26:49,970 --> 00:27:09,410
their babies so we want them to not

00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:18,770
everyone is and then there are other

00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:22,490
programs that are listed and then our

00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:26,690
other tier doors and there is I mean

00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:30,490
there's a cure for the other two doors

00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:34,130
are basically two ways research

00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:36,530
superstars already farming and what it

00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:38,920
is in visit our classification together

00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:41,900
this is also the way to browse web site

00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:50,230
so these classifications learn how is

00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:52,400
the education training we have

00:27:50,230 --> 00:28:02,440
subcategories and these are based again

00:27:52,400 --> 00:28:05,530
on push where can we get the most on it

00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,530
there's a

00:28:39,129 --> 00:29:18,039
the veteran

00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:23,030
so if you go into any this is what our

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,920
efforts of so it's got a big nice pretty

00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:28,010
picture of the title we have a

00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:31,010
description of what it is for people

00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:34,400
have a chance to say here's what our

00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:43,280
program to do for you and then we have

00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:45,350
the contact information you know the

00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,830
idea that Congress below and you can

00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:51,800
talk to Les is on that's not realistic

00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:54,680
look back at our our user base a retiree

00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:57,200
who used to be an executive going to

00:30:54,680 --> 00:31:00,500
carving these many completely different

00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:09,190
things that someone who is a refugee who

00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:09,190
just arrived trying to create

00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:59,140
that's this one only has a couple but

00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:06,640
some like the arms for agency which

00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:08,350
administers a few and if you go to

00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:12,610
although they've done a much better job

00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:15,150
with their site but many times you go to

00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:17,920
a government spies very hard to find

00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:20,320
everything that applies to people so

00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,540
what this site does is that you say okay

00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,550
if you are going to your FSA office

00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:26,380
here's all the programs they have to

00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:28,060
offer it gives you this Christian foot

00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:30,220
they are you can walk in there and say

00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:32,250
what about this what about this what

00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,250
about

00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:54,110
searching of the site we're going to be

00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:56,419
making some more developments for this

00:32:54,110 --> 00:33:00,740
definite yet I'm in progress those

00:32:56,419 --> 00:33:07,840
include we're going to add it Solar we

00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:11,539
also have that anyhow we have the source

00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:13,340
but its 80,000 terms long and bilingual

00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:16,340
I mean you can't you have to lower

00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:18,950
floors but but what we did we trimmed it

00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:22,009
down and so we're going to be working on

00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:26,690
it to the tongue as well and this will

00:33:22,009 --> 00:33:28,850
help improve the search the other thing

00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:31,340
that we're working on to get into this

00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:33,799
site is to help people find these by

00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:37,610
where they're located so current

00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:40,519
geolocation pinpointing for the map and

00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:43,700
if your arrest arcane that's fantastic

00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:48,350
but many of our programs are spread over

00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:51,350
huge areas of service the breakfast is a

00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:53,990
program that is headquartered in

00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:56,299
Colorado that's called building farmers

00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:59,240
in the West but they also work in

00:33:56,299 --> 00:34:01,879
Washington State and Idaho and Utah and

00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:09,649
Wyoming and there a beach state all the

00:34:01,879 --> 00:34:13,690
time to give a pinpoint of the math so

00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:13,690
we're looking for models or working

00:34:54,020 --> 00:35:05,490
and so we promised to help them we also

00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:07,619
promised to provide outreach and I'm not

00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:09,720
going to go into outreach but I will say

00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:13,980
this is one of the hardest thing there

00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:16,290
is to do we again this is the universal

00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,490
oneness assumption everyone isn't

00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:22,410
looking in the same place for

00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:28,260
information everywhere and there is a

00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:30,720
digital diverse part of that nature

00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:35,720
provides getting information to gravity

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,720
is so fragmented stand up on the digital

00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:36,450
our back and the primary function of the

00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:40,170
back end is the first six options here

00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:42,120
are all evacuated and you see the second

00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:44,040
one is their search here first I name

00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,840
from that because it's a reminder don't

00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:51,450
put something in the databases for it in

00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:56,490
there does it work completely booked it

00:36:51,450 --> 00:37:01,260
records all the time for the

00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:09,480
communication develop these called UI

00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:11,910
library so for example i have written

00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:14,160
instructions on how to do gain entry for

00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:18,050
the data is a 24-month i do online

00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:18,050
trainings to train those grantees

00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:47,780
we also we also have

00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:28,460
you can see the tumble weeds growing

00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:31,530
through this website so you know this is

00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:35,210
50 cent assorted serious emotional

00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:38,400
upheaval for me be very frustrating

00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:40,200
primarily because kind of the message

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,300
you get permit for the administrators

00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:45,390
inside you know obviously didn't build

00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:48,450
it so we go back over and everything

00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:50,280
they asked for we did they said they

00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:53,100
wanted a way to communicate online with

00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:56,850
each other to stare files you can add

00:38:53,100 --> 00:39:05,700
files then wanted get emails from the

00:38:56,850 --> 00:39:10,200
interception when there's a new post so

00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:17,730
it's there so why and there's lots of

00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:21,540
reasons why has to do with kind of five

00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:24,660
think of the right word to kind of just

00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:27,570
the way the management of the system so

00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:29,100
he saw the federal law and I said that's

00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:31,740
right nested in with the other law

00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:33,780
saying that they will also do this grant

00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,190
program kubota recipient so they're

00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,710
right next to each other's the business

00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:40,230
palmistry matter that they're going to

00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:42,210
work together but there's nothing

00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:44,130
written down not alone not in federal

00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:46,440
law and not in that are offended nipper

00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:51,080
room that says that anyone who received

00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:51,080
a grant is required to contribute to

00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:59,920
so there's two schools of thinking one

00:39:55,990 --> 00:40:06,480
is that if it's not written down and the

00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:06,480
other is we're giving these people and

00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:45,070
we have a diversity within the grant we

00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:47,110
have programs recipients for coming from

00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:49,270
Ivy League school you know then how to

00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:51,460
fix Brent writers on staff that have

00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:55,750
their own IT people so they'll build

00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:57,670
their own internet and then you have

00:40:55,750 --> 00:41:02,220
people who really have little to no

00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:02,220
access to and they need

00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:22,530
and we keep going after the materials of

00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:25,860
course we have no sticks talk to them

00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:35,490
spirits we have one carrot left and

00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:39,660
that's her verification I remember

00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:45,420
people from to do certain things someone

00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:48,540
has to sit down and currently and let me

00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:50,910
stay real quick there's a new reporting

00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:55,340
system within the earth vehicle report

00:41:50,910 --> 00:42:00,200
it came up so I'm talking about

00:41:55,340 --> 00:42:00,200
reporting system that has been in played

00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:09,600
the current courting system is called

00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:11,760
Chris and what it is is type if the

00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:22,980
rumors are true it was developed before

00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:28,410
the internet it's huge and people just

00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:30,600
stop massive enough they go in and they

00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:32,940
put in text but it hasn't cut off the

00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:35,660
limited so if you did all this amazing

00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:38,430
stuff you only get to report half of it

00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:41,280
so it has a lot of limitations with a

00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:43,080
lot of difficulties but basically people

00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,609
just go in and they put the paragraph or

00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:50,240
two and we promise to assist with

00:42:47,609 --> 00:42:50,240
recording

00:42:53,349 --> 00:43:00,160
and so what she's done every year for

00:42:56,650 --> 00:43:02,319
this entire gram-positive pine and go

00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:04,119
through the crew supports first of all

00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:06,819
declined where people come today which

00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:09,549
is not clear and then to find out if

00:43:06,819 --> 00:43:11,769
they didn't each year and she created

00:43:09,549 --> 00:43:14,410
her own database for that and I'm trying

00:43:11,769 --> 00:43:18,309
to track of everyone what they what they

00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:26,619
did and just came through line up a lot

00:43:18,309 --> 00:43:28,329
and issue that she ran into it if that

00:43:26,619 --> 00:43:31,809
some people were reports that they would

00:43:28,329 --> 00:43:34,450
say this many people showed up to our

00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:36,819
courses and then the next person or

00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:40,900
according to say this percentage of

00:43:36,819 --> 00:43:44,680
people finished religious so to go

00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:47,680
through all of this really been spread

00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:50,940
and come up with apples and oranges and

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,940
then she's supposed to mix them together

00:43:51,089 --> 00:44:00,089
so our attempt this is our development

00:43:57,089 --> 00:44:00,089
this

00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:07,230
you

00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:44,700
so what they can do that is each year

00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:46,590
they can open up to new they went near

00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:57,240
the reporting for and then they find

00:44:46,590 --> 00:45:01,800
their gold exam recording then they have

00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:03,480
their chance so if they want to sit down

00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,350
and say they don't feel that they can

00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,350
explain it

00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:27,390
then you're able to go in

00:47:04,970 --> 00:47:20,510
they're going to do if you're starting

00:47:17,970 --> 00:47:20,510
in the middle

00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:30,390
we're going to try and then the future

00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:37,349
is one of the reasons so it will we're

00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:39,839
also looking at once we create what we

00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:42,200
finished our search function sorry that

00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:45,300
we want to fill but also the

00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:47,430
verification system wants to go we want

00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:49,740
to use this visit model we kind of want

00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:52,079
to try to drop it around the u.s. do you

00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:55,230
know what there's a better way to get

00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:59,160
information people talk so much about

00:48:55,230 --> 00:49:01,190
the the overwhelming amount of data out

00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:01,190
there

00:49:29,250 --> 00:50:58,270
it should be presented to organize what

00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:59,860
the expectation one of the issues with a

00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:01,720
lot of the directors that come out of

00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:03,880
the government they can be in so many

00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:06,730
different things and until the real

00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:09,420
guidance is very fruitful and my opinion

00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,420
start the car business

00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:17,520
and we do our best the records in the

00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:18,839
public site also registers on the very

00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,869
case histories to make this in the

00:51:18,839 --> 00:51:25,500
structured data so ideally it would be a

00:51:21,869 --> 00:51:27,210
real more structured around that's what

00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,520
I would love to see it on the government

00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:32,940
unfortunately and mrs. the issue is this

00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:35,339
data management problem is that there's

00:51:32,940 --> 00:52:09,180
no one saying this is how we're going to

00:51:35,339 --> 00:52:11,309
manage usda organic certification so the

00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:14,760
next question is you find other tracks

00:52:11,309 --> 00:52:34,200
and USDA and programs like that eff bb

00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:35,900
or organic certification so I come to an

00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:38,539
event like this I hear about other

00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:42,829
programs that are going on in doing

00:52:38,539 --> 00:52:45,509
there several people within the USDA

00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:48,449
working very hard to stop them

00:52:45,509 --> 00:52:51,869
to start talking to each other like okay

00:52:48,449 --> 00:53:45,029
what are you doing what are you doing my

00:52:51,869 --> 00:53:47,699
question is whether we should do it and

00:53:45,029 --> 00:53:54,389
what about and specifically answer that

00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:57,829
question were you searching during work

00:53:54,389 --> 00:54:01,049
for certain a certain grades now has

00:53:57,829 --> 00:54:03,929
exert some modules for that call lasted

00:54:01,049 --> 00:54:08,089
six this stuff will the models that are

00:54:03,929 --> 00:54:08,089
doing things like we ready girls

00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:16,150
hi I also work for government government

00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:20,320
websites and I'm curious how do you

00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:23,620
measure success that is a good question

00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:27,520
and this is I think another thing that

00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:30,610
is really Universal how do we sit down

00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:35,350
say how how did we you know how did we

00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:37,180
do it's hard for us with under probably

00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:39,940
claim the paperwork reduction act and

00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:41,830
what that is is that controls all of the

00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:44,110
data gathering for the entire federal

00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:46,330
government and it actually stops us from

00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:48,550
doing things like putting up a feedback

00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:50,800
form right away and things like that so

00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:54,250
that's a little bit difficult we are

00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:59,950
using google analytics and we see we

00:54:54,250 --> 00:55:03,430
bike some clothes or not and for me

00:54:59,950 --> 00:55:04,960
personally i am able to travel around to

00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:09,040
different conferences and talk to people

00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:12,190
and i do measure quite a bit of success

00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:14,800
from that do they know about me and me

00:55:12,190 --> 00:55:18,460
start to farmers not just for the stupid

00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:24,340
or something but you know do they know

00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:26,230
about us and our computing us and again

00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:28,900
another data management issues we need

00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:33,760
to know are you till you're successful

00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:35,860
but we are anything analytics do sir

00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:38,580
psycho is great or a music but I

00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:38,580
couldn't find anything

00:55:44,190 --> 00:55:48,310
great well i'll be around and you can

00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,690
