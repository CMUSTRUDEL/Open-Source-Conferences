Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: LESSONS IN SPARK UX: PROTOTYPE, USER TEST, ITERATE
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	This session is an overview of the work the Spark team undertook to validate our development process on the Edit and Layout modules as well as the new administrative interface. We'll talk about how we accommodated the fast-moving nature of the product and synthesized community feedback. We'll discuss our prototyping process in conjunction with our usability research and testing, which yielded important findings for user experience and addressed development issues from the outset of the design process. We'll also present some ideas generated by our work on Spark that might be useful for general community contributions and future projects.
