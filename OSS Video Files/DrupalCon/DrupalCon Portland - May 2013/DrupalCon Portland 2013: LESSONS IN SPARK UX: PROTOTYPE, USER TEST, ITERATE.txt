Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: LESSONS IN SPARK UX: PROTOTYPE, USER TEST, ITERATE
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	This session is an overview of the work the Spark team undertook to validate our development process on the Edit and Layout modules as well as the new administrative interface. We'll talk about how we accommodated the fast-moving nature of the product and synthesized community feedback. We'll discuss our prototyping process in conjunction with our usability research and testing, which yielded important findings for user experience and addressed development issues from the outset of the design process. We'll also present some ideas generated by our work on Spark that might be useful for general community contributions and future projects.

Spark in Drupal 8 core: An overview
Why user testing was necessary for a newly mobile-oriented Drupal
Spark and the Drupal community
In-place editing: Design considerations and technical limitations
Mobile WYSIWYG: Mobile touch affordances, icon fonts, and accessibility
Responsive menus, toolbars, and admin UI
Responsive layout building
Overall considerations and questions: Implications for Drupal
How to get involved in the Spark project: Testing and contributions
Questions this session will answer:

What did we consider most important while working on Spark?
What findings during testing were the most enlightening for our community?
What ideas from Spark might be inspirational for the community at large?
What were the big takeaways from this approach?
You should attend this session if you are interested in design and UX processes, Drupal 8 and how Spark was built.

already so thank you so much for coming

00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,710
to our session this is my CDs mark you

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,030
exporter type user testing iterates if

00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,259
you're looking for the LAN party it

00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:15,030
might be in here if you're not going to

00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:23,430
touch it but it's not yet this is less

00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:24,660
popular so just to I can start here just

00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,029
a brief outline on what we're going to

00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,279
talk about we'd like to start off with a

00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,349
little bit of a description that spark

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,300
is as a team I know that many of you may

00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:34,980
have schemes are sort of in the Drupal

00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,469
sphere without really seeing the dates

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,540
behind it we talked about the vision of

00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:43,890
spark and what Mark is is is my tool

00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:46,680
we're going to talk about our design and

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:50,010
us processes as well as speech with

00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,449
focus design hair testing will talk

00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:53,670
about two key takeaways from our

00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:54,719
approach nice work and we'll talk a

00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,500
little bit about how you can get

00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,020
involved just as a disclaimer preface

00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,180
the session this isn't this is going to

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,970
be a conversation about our processes

00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,220
and about detecting and prototyping not

00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,350
about teachers themselves so we will not

00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:13,470
be talking about sort of what you know

00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,990
sparkers what the business part is

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,310
missing or things of that nature we'll

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:19,700
be talking slowly without our modern

00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,700
presence

00:01:22,020 --> 00:02:14,989
I and my other

00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,769
so how many people here have already

00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:01,560
tried out smart car dealers use fire and

00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:04,590
look that a little bit downloaded it all

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,989
right so we got a lot of people who are

00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,610
new despite what you might not know much

00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:09,810
mark is that we have a very large team

00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:15,120
of people who are working behind the

00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:21,260
scenes to make possible we have a pretty

00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,260
large team I think the audience and

00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:33,780
starting with we have come to very clear

00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:40,950
the audience who is widely and bases in

00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:44,099
the Drupal so what is sparks vision last

00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:46,680
year at Google cart Denver during his

00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:48,989
State of Drupal presentation Greece

00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,360
actually you've mentioned being actual

00:03:48,989 --> 00:03:54,150
force part to become so the press flow

00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,459
of carbonyl three in trouble it's meant

00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,850
to improve the experience all across the

00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:03,420
board in Drupal for cotton authors and

00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:05,730
cite religious law so what are some of

00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,400
the goals that were that we're going to

00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,920
achieve with the spark well the first

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:14,040
thing is that you know as always not all

00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,630
goals to be met so we put together at

00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,940
northstar vision which is sort of our

00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:21,060
writing white but not necessarily sort

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,229
of the ultimate end result because

00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,430
obviously there are a lot of things that

00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:28,080
are flux and change so what is part is

00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,400
worth garbage we have in my netting

00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,160
which i'm sure many of you have heard

00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:36,030
about we have a dragon throughout

00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:37,740
content layout tool and we have implants

00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,050
cost equation all of us before every one

00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,520
of our edit pages and salsa those

00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:45,419
listings have all been approved than

00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,430
very very graphically we also hope to

00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,889
include some useful dragons useful

00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:53,930
dashboards for topic leaders and the

00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:56,789
most important i think the theme of the

00:04:53,930 --> 00:05:02,789
last year is mobile content authoring

00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:08,280
and responsive on support or for working

00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:10,080
within so spark actually began as a

00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,990
collection of contributed modules that

00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:15,840
were intended to be part of google seven

00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:20,190
and then eventually we shifted our focus

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,960
over to enhancing existing features in

00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:27,090
core and adding these contributed

00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:29,099
modules into you for for jubilee and so

00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:30,570
again you know this that list that you

00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:32,219
don't particularly count what we hope to

00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:35,280
accomplish but necessarily what we will

00:05:32,219 --> 00:05:37,169
accomplish in the end so what are some

00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:44,190
of the user experience whole spark these

00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:45,630
are sort of goals that we the first

00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,510
thing is to improve these astray of

00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:51,050
wolcott and that means all interaction

00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:55,560
patterns all workflows need success

00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:59,599
anyway we also have to simplify stating

00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,599
very compact because of something that

00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:07,440
while still distinguishing the

00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,690
operations and then we also are to do

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,169
toolbar and that work that force of the

00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:22,830
netflix one of the biggest makes about

00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:26,270
the box and of course fall formal you

00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:29,880
have support including our support

00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:32,940
integration just as important as you

00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:38,370
experience is the interesting part which

00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:41,450
is including basically sort of all that

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:54,289
for all people who need extra resources

00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:54,289
so that includes at any place tomorrow

00:06:55,550 --> 00:07:01,009
that sort of dives uses through changes

00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:08,460
that are perfect age when they are

00:07:01,009 --> 00:07:11,069
artists just argue a little bit about

00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:13,319
the traditional processing and how we

00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:17,249
modify that process to fit article

00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:20,339
strains traditional conference goes like

00:07:17,249 --> 00:07:22,889
one fault we identify a problem and we

00:07:20,339 --> 00:07:24,990
design it prototyping we tested and we

00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:27,509
develop it a lot of these cases what

00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,459
further also happened is that we are

00:07:27,509 --> 00:07:31,800
going to probably skip the prototyping

00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:33,389
test and just go from design to develop

00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,129
but I think in a lot of these

00:07:33,389 --> 00:07:37,649
organizations now we are seeing in

00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:40,229
especially neutral organization value

00:07:37,649 --> 00:07:42,629
user experience design that we go to the

00:07:40,229 --> 00:07:46,680
process of usability testing as well as

00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:48,899
a key point to validate your designs

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:53,369
before you put it out in front of your

00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:55,589
audience what is important what happens

00:07:53,369 --> 00:07:57,270
in an ideal waterfall traditional model

00:07:55,589 --> 00:07:59,309
is that we are going to do an interval

00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:02,039
review every step during this process

00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:04,289
we're also considering that we work with

00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:06,809
the community we want to review that

00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:16,499
process to district use understand that

00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:20,099
we're getting the community feedback so

00:08:16,499 --> 00:08:23,789
the waving modify the process is kind of

00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:25,949
difficult to grasp the idea is it some

00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:28,949
more of a cyclical process and the

00:08:25,949 --> 00:08:31,680
process network by the what I mean is

00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:33,300
that we always identify a problem so for

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,409
example when we start talking about

00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:39,180
content creation over the period my

00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:41,159
tachycardia the top of our enterprise

00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:43,380
customers are affecting the customers

00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:46,019
and understanding the thing that they

00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,630
have with content creation because site

00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:51,389
builders they are different audience the

00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:53,880
one more actually writing the content is

00:08:51,389 --> 00:08:56,120
a different their organs you need to

00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,339
make sure that if we want

00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,529
win the right market trend director we

00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:03,080
have to accommodate of this content

00:09:00,529 --> 00:09:05,060
creators so we identify that that is the

00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,589
problem and we are going to sketch the

00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:08,779
problem we will be coded eyes the

00:09:06,589 --> 00:09:11,510
problem we are going to catch the

00:09:08,779 --> 00:09:13,820
problem and then develop it and then it

00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:16,040
kind of goes to other process what's

00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:19,130
interesting is that at any point during

00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,890
this cycle it might be a sketch step or

00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:25,190
it might be encoded I as really will

00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:27,410
come across like hey this is not really

00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:30,440
working well I think this is missing

00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:32,630
that or it's not going back to the goal

00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:35,120
that we started with so we again go back

00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:37,130
to the identifying the problem try to

00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,560
sketch it again if I can go through this

00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:41,930
process again and again and again till

00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:44,600
we come to a point that we all agree

00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:47,720
that it's right the same happens at

00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:49,250
custom civil in your testing sometimes

00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,070
we are testing for interaction patterns

00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:54,500
sometimes we'll just before we do a lot

00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:57,529
of contextual inquiry to understand is

00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,720
that how it is the mental model working

00:09:57,529 --> 00:10:02,480
with the prototype is it working

00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,540
instinct or it's against the models of

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,740
you show you some examples of fur

00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:10,000
something that we did we're all some

00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:12,320
things that can go wrong and of course

00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,240
throughout this process we are going to

00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,430
go to the internal review process and

00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:21,260
also the process of getting to the

00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:24,410
community the other dimension that is

00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:27,290
interesting here in this part is is the

00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:29,390
point of claw where we start with the

00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,640
design and where we want to go with the

00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:33,980
designs are special mention earlier the

00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:36,850
North Star is just like the guiding like

00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:39,589
that where we want to be at it's not

00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:42,650
necessarily the end goal of the process

00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:44,959
and what is happening is that we kind of

00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:47,360
have to I don't want to say the word

00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:50,810
compromise what we have to settle for an

00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:53,060
actual design and that actionable design

00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:56,150
comes from a lot of constraints that we

00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:58,580
are found with that would be in flames

00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:59,730
from technical point of view or the time

00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:02,579
limitation

00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:04,709
or the code three deadlines what we want

00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:09,420
you if we want to build a tin Teufel

00:11:04,709 --> 00:11:12,060
form and and this actual design step is

00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:14,490
actually it's not necessarily going

00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,470
towards thoughts are always sometimes

00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:18,660
what happens is that we are moving with

00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:21,000
a digital design we come to a national

00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:23,550
design in closer to the north star

00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,310
design we come across a photo we have to

00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:29,360
go back row back for few steps and then

00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:32,940
see that we have to make this balance

00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:36,389
comfortable design the two important

00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:39,570
things are on the slide are the way we

00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:43,050
did our co driving and usability testing

00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:45,769
is through envision and alpha delta

00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:48,720
prototypes but I what I mean is that

00:11:45,769 --> 00:11:51,120
envision is an at this sort of allows

00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,430
you to stitch together a few images and

00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,120
then there are hot spots you can click

00:11:53,430 --> 00:12:01,139
through them and then provide son of a

00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:04,920
pseudo experience of what that prototype

00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:06,540
would eat there the pros and cons of

00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:09,269
each of these processing you and

00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:10,920
fertilizer plus we'll talk in a bit but

00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:14,010
I'm also going to show you what is

00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:16,860
anything vision at all right how does

00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:19,769
that look like the other project that we

00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:22,079
do is a high fidelity excited we need

00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:25,350
you're not doing all the charities and

00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:28,139
little things that I don't but it

00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:30,930
provides a rich interaction interaction

00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:36,360
that is true when it's going to be

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:38,430
developed and both of these pieces that

00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:42,089
two dimensions I spoke about earlier

00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:45,860
they all work in a Doyle respect the way

00:12:42,089 --> 00:12:48,810
we do it harder we are force part and

00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:52,410
alcohol I feel familiar with it it comes

00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:55,910
with its pros and cons pros is that it

00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:58,940
is a multiple I traded mark

00:12:55,910 --> 00:13:00,860
used to be hydrating as we move on one

00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,220
of the interesting things are wats part

00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:07,400
is that the designers change so rapidly

00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:09,530
like them if you it's like if you miss a

00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,440
it's like oh whoa whoa what happened

00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:14,600
like this is a time change because we

00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,360
are going to that process of identifying

00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:19,850
crawl on it every step to anyone in the

00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,130
design team or anyone involved in this

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:24,170
party and say okay there's a problem

00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:26,360
let's stop it let's go back to the

00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:29,960
process of identifying it's catching it

00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:33,500
again so that's one of the advantages of

00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:37,580
natural and dope because the bottleneck

00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:39,590
that it introduces is populated the good

00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:42,770
point of a drought is also acting

00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:45,650
enhances for useful he researches might

00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:47,990
mean is that it cancels the floor doing

00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:51,940
usability testing the way we do use it

00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:54,590
as a plastic first part has been evolved

00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:56,480
from running sessions which would

00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:58,340
probably make take two or three days to

00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,470
run exceptions in four hours and getting

00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:04,850
the reserves are so that we can hydrate

00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:09,400
it faster community feedback we always

00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:12,950
provide I always provide our approach to

00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:20,270
potential that would harm you can always

00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:22,400
just to spark I just want to talk a

00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:25,850
little bit more about the disadvantages

00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:28,310
in terms of the constraint team that we

00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:31,160
have so he's of the party and go out

00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:34,670
there I'm a centralized these videos or

00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:37,280
so I don't get to spend all my time on

00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:39,920
sparling and in that case what happens

00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:42,800
that this census process is moving so

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,780
fast it becomes really difficult to keep

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,810
up with it and when you have to make

00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:50,090
sure the community

00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:52,430
always totally documented in one way or

00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:59,360
the other to make sure that everyone is

00:14:52,430 --> 00:15:02,360
on the same page and we'll talk a little

00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:08,540
bit more about what it means to driving

00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:10,700
the invasion act so the two approaches

00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:13,850
that we take prototyping are I really

00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:16,370
quite interested in English nap you know

00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:19,220
we have a set of postcards that really

00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:20,900
are good for quick turnaround you know

00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:22,760
we want to introduce prototype that's

00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,430
going to be testable within a day in the

00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,710
few hours indigenous really the most

00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:29,690
popular voice obviously the little

00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:31,790
depart partner it's visible means you

00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:35,000
really close something out pretty

00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:36,620
quickly that can be tested and the good

00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,830
thing about envision is that you can

00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,930
actually directly put in and insert the

00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:44,780
profits that have introduced so any of

00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:47,180
the things that that that work for these

00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:50,660
in the design already pretty much

00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:52,730
exactly and an initial prototype and

00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:54,910
additional feature i was in addition

00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:58,910
which is which is one that we've used to

00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:01,490
fight race that is input acknowledging

00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:04,910
where you can actually go in and click

00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:06,980
on an area which which this is a comment

00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:09,760
that actually focuses in on that

00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:12,770
particular part unfortunately the

00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:14,240
biggest problem with indigenous and the

00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,860
biggest weakness that we target basis

00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,630
that there is no possibility for compost

00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,960
directions we really can't do anything

00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:22,640
such as i standing covering anything of

00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,410
that nature thanks for dragging and

00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,540
dropping all of those things really

00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:30,130
cannot take place because it is sort of

00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:31,850
an image-based motivating tool

00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:33,560
additionally the photo texts are not

00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:36,590
based on code which means that this adds

00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:40,460
an additional layer sort of setback but

00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:42,380
other latency to the processed image we

00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:44,390
have a prototype but none of that

00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:46,040
prototype is reflected in code which

00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:48,010
means that we still activate to the

00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:51,950
coding process

00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:53,240
and our one final weakness the condition

00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:54,740
that we have found is that there is a

00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:57,140
great deal of confusion that we've

00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:59,180
encountered the testing because of the

00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:02,660
simplicity interfaces because of house

00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:05,689
or a straight for the workflow is in the

00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:08,510
engineering process it doesn't really go

00:17:05,689 --> 00:17:10,939
to work out to display data layer

00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:16,790
complexity that really is sort of the

00:17:10,939 --> 00:17:19,400
key elements on the can I fully

00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:22,189
protecting which is sort of my my

00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,020
private area of expertise relies on

00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:27,380
these complex knives it relies on

00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:29,330
country relies of our focus and that

00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,280
nature of people that nature to really

00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:33,799
display how these interactions are by

00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,040
now just like how anyway how do you I is

00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:39,380
going to actually take pics thing and

00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:41,750
once again you know because of our

00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:43,720
division is solely image-based there is

00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,860
there is no code and with high fidelity

00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,740
driving only review as we can put

00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:50,660
together code that even you know as fate

00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:52,280
might be ready for development it might

00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,049
need to be ready just look straight at

00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:56,360
sephora and we actually had one of us is

00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:58,460
that we're a little bit of fur coat

00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,210
bathroom was just pretty much more

00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:03,440
footwork place to the court oh and

00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:04,970
there's a fall in browser testing

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,000
environment which which means that

00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:10,580
there's none of this sort of extra fluff

00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,530
around page there's there's no comment

00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:14,150
in basically any a title you test

00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,919
something in from you want to have a

00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:17,690
great contestant very clear test

00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,590
environment that people are going to use

00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:25,040
as a sort of default tool is close to

00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:28,640
the quiz hot spots or guys you for the

00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:31,040
process unfortunately you know the

00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,559
foetus I think that we've adopted does

00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,650
your sis lower turn around Pilates you

00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:43,910
to sort of traffic rot picture it into a

00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:45,620
grid in one day another big problem is

00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:47,120
that because of the fact that needs to

00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,700
produce things very quickly and achieve

00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,160
high school high velocity sometimes the

00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,600
interactions really

00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:55,730
we can't really have the full breadth

00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:59,150
possibilities because we will drive

00:18:55,730 --> 00:19:00,530
between we are so tired slave and you

00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:03,080
know what that does mean is that you

00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:04,970
know something doesn't work but honestly

00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,800
the code doesn't doesn't really work

00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:11,990
that same way it sicily magic than just

00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:14,030
sort of carpets and the final tweak this

00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:15,740
is that prototypes are not necessarily

00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:16,930
based on design office focused and

00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:21,440
sometimes there are limitations

00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:23,720
sometimes there are problems that sort

00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,620
of preclude the protest equal percent

00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:31,970
accurate upon us and we address those

00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:34,190
pretty much every step process one other

00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:38,630
thing I want to talk about yes sliding

00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:41,270
in terms of what it means to just like

00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:43,040
of you if your usability researchers

00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:45,410
like when do you want to test something

00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,990
to the envision apples and when you want

00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:49,970
to do a high fidelity prototype it

00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,470
always comes back to the question of

00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:55,130
what is that we're trying to accomplish

00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:57,050
with this flight testing and lark ankle

00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:59,540
rather trick the most of the times I

00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:01,940
always go to the redesign and what is

00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:03,920
the goal and then we talk about it that

00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:06,050
is the goal of it you just go through

00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,540
the workflow and verify and validate the

00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:11,060
workflow or is it also to understand the

00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:13,520
subtleties of every interaction that is

00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:17,540
necessary to complete the world for I

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:20,650
understand so that's just one of the

00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,650
interesting things about

00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:28,060
so one of the books or findings that we

00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,340
found sort of through betting our

00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:33,420
process and the evolution of the process

00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:35,890
was that sort of phenomena known as

00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:38,200
designing a browsing was really sort of

00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:40,030
revolutionary for a process one of the

00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,740
things that we discovered with that

00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:43,780
overly religious sort of linear process

00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,930
really didn't work out the way that

00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:49,360
musical and traditional processes are

00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:51,430
sort of overly rigid because you take a

00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,650
product you have an input and you do

00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:55,720
something to it passed on as outlet and

00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:57,430
there's no sort of collaborative process

00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,560
in that there's there's very little

00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:04,570
opportunity to sort come together say

00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:05,800
well you know this is this distance you

00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,520
know what are the one of the best things

00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:11,920
obviously about to the small widget

00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:14,620
visual approaches that you can pay very

00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,360
close attention to the details and you

00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:18,520
know oftentimes design attribute are

00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:21,310
very easy to substitute like you iterate

00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,690
on the design but you know the issue

00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:24,400
that that is that there there's this

00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:26,380
provocative slow turnaround for the

00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,700
piping is sort of even later in the

00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:33,010
process and and inter actually obviously

00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:34,630
has that we've mentioned is those things

00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:39,550
very difficult to commit to a sign and

00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:43,660
display so one of the things that that

00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:45,550
we came up with was you know in you know

00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:48,190
in mypos heavy processes as I was

00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:50,470
floating there were oftentimes instances

00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:52,330
where we discovered an issue in the

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,270
design or issue that was pitiable that

00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:57,370
really needed a new design solution and

00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:59,620
and and what that meant is that you know

00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:02,470
being a designer the prototype a really

00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:04,690
forge a partnership at the stage to fix

00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,580
any of the technical issues if possible

00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:09,060
in an inground context so anything that

00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:11,050
that that is sort of quality can be

00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:13,390
immediately rectified it from browser

00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:15,760
just with a few changes of a code and

00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:17,080
these sorts of things are art are meant

00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,690
to be collaborative is meant to be part

00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:22,270
of this simple process that that isn't

00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:25,320
necessarily devoted point iteration but

00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:27,429
also to this collaborative

00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,259
approach and so what's what's what's

00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:31,330
really great about this there's a very

00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:34,059
fast turnaround anything anything that

00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:35,980
that are immediately implemented and any

00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:39,009
interactions that do change can't be

00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:42,749
sort of as a collaborative process place

00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:44,679
it to the side as thinking of course the

00:22:42,749 --> 00:22:45,999
weaknesses are that you know there's

00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:48,159
there's a little bit much attention to

00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:50,980
detail some time to design that was

00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:53,409
initially finalized might have you

00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:56,590
followed on the other side and I

00:22:53,409 --> 00:23:08,740
off-time solution its attributes such as

00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:11,769
color or so as a result are sort of new

00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:13,149
modified process entails and put that

00:23:11,769 --> 00:23:17,710
expansion including the designer

00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:27,090
browsers part of the quick job is sort

00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:30,009
of so that was about the overall

00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:33,549
prophecies that we followed in each

00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:35,460
other we are where we are at pitching to

00:23:33,549 --> 00:23:38,350
what to my goal that we want to be

00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:39,970
aiming what we going to do in the next

00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:42,999
part is that we are going to focus on a

00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:44,470
few teachers focus design and test by

00:23:42,999 --> 00:23:46,629
that what I mean be able to talk about

00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:52,629
the problem space released in the

00:23:46,629 --> 00:23:54,279
technical design you will go to these

00:23:52,629 --> 00:23:56,289
slides you will realize that some of

00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:58,539
these things have been implemented in

00:23:56,289 --> 00:24:02,700
Sparky's I have not been implemented

00:23:58,539 --> 00:24:02,700
sparking somehow then just be

00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:11,240
so one of the problems facing the

00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:14,930
biggest concerns you all once part try

00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:17,120
to address is is that users do not know

00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:19,490
the context of what they are editing the

00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:22,910
preview in content or editing content

00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:27,230
has been a big thing for very long time

00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:29,510
and and you don't see the content what

00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:32,390
all that happens is that the new user is

00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:35,420
going to it takes too much effort and

00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:37,670
you really take down to that specific

00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:40,240
content make changes to the content

00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:44,800
especially if it's like a symbolical

00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:44,800
possible the content listing pages

00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:52,160
experience those kind of things fennel

00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:54,620
in exaggerated the problem area right

00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:57,200
now what we have also when you go on the

00:24:54,620 --> 00:25:01,090
content creation page of content editing

00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:05,420
there is a lot of information there

00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:07,850
exactly a lot of vertical tabs and other

00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:11,750
fields thinks that you may want things

00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:13,790
we don't walk so think about the drop

00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:18,760
space what we call is that what you want

00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:18,760
to do it in order to experience

00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:46,820
but this is an invasion Patrick where I

00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:56,360
was long ago just bunch of the greater

00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:58,990
that are stitched together with pops of

00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,990
color

00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,820
I

00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:55,360
so so that was in line everything that

00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:57,730
we're talking about during this process

00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,820
what I think is also important to talk

00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:03,640
about what happens to say them published

00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:05,620
because of the fear of times when doing

00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:10,450
research google garbage we found out

00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:12,130
that save and publish is really and it's

00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:14,200
a very interesting problem that we face

00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:16,390
would say it publish this because the

00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:18,910
experience you will users understand

00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:21,910
what is there in public but what the new

00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:23,650
users are coming from different CMS if

00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:26,080
they do not list and what is say that

00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:27,940
they publish let's take not published we

00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,040
also wanted to make sure that as we are

00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:33,190
going to this process of inline editing

00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:35,500
we make sure that you are absolutely

00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:37,210
sure what you are doing if you are

00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,130
editing that pocket and if you are

00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:41,500
getting that same water and publish what

00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:43,180
is that going to do so there has been

00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:48,280
one big problem that we are trying to

00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:50,820
solve and because it still on the

00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,820
solution

00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:01,820
so one of the other things that we

00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,190
decided to approach was sort of how do

00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,899
we let users know which areas of the

00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:09,409
site which areas of the page are

00:29:05,899 --> 00:29:12,049
actually mediated and one of the initial

00:29:09,409 --> 00:29:14,509
approaches that was sort of reciting

00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:16,249
space setting transmission where every

00:29:14,509 --> 00:29:18,080
single editable field was sort of

00:29:16,249 --> 00:29:21,499
highlighted with them with a blue border

00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,909
and then faded out now you know one of

00:29:21,499 --> 00:29:24,230
the one of the biggest problems that we

00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:26,299
attempt with this though is that you

00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:28,480
know it's it's a very dear affordance

00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:32,600
because it really make much sense to

00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:34,519
sort of display it only one time wow you

00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:37,879
just sort of clear out what's going on

00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:39,919
so in this case the Edit archive but I

00:29:37,879 --> 00:29:42,649
think you didn't really eat all the best

00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,899
results because you know first of all

00:29:42,649 --> 00:29:46,820
the you know being the forces need to

00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:49,700
persistent in a sense that uses know

00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:51,169
exactly what fields competitive and also

00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,850
you know the sort of accessible

00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:54,529
component which is that you know those

00:29:52,850 --> 00:30:04,639
sorts of positions are very accessible

00:29:54,529 --> 00:30:06,499
and can't be both of you time you've

00:30:04,639 --> 00:30:08,809
done a lot of either you're testing on

00:30:06,499 --> 00:30:13,879
inline editing and I'm just going to go

00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:17,320
to the latest results that girl you want

00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:19,700
to inline editing at we see

00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,950
overwhelmingly positive response from

00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:25,820
the users and you can use some of the

00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:28,249
code strips which tell them Howie is a

00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:30,350
delightful experience to do something

00:30:28,249 --> 00:30:34,309
like that and that's something that they

00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:36,289
did not expect however there's from is

00:30:34,309 --> 00:30:39,950
that we still need to work on you need

00:30:36,289 --> 00:30:43,129
to still define what are the sabres is

00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:45,679
published what happens is that as I was

00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:47,299
talking about the three-step process of

00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,610
initial design into active all the time

00:30:47,299 --> 00:30:52,340
to an ox are exactly that when we

00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:55,369
started adding revisions to it it became

00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:58,330
complicated as to what does that mean is

00:30:55,369 --> 00:31:01,210
that is it the revision going to

00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:03,549
in terms of field is it going to be

00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:06,940
collapsed together where am I going to

00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:09,220
go to find my delusions how does that

00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:11,110
interact with Satan public so it's a

00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:13,480
classic example of how you add another

00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:15,279
future and then everything you have to

00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,620
make changes to it in order to

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:20,320
accommodate that the experience is still

00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:23,110
very solid so religion is still

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,419
something that we want to watch out in

00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:28,750
the near future but the bigger problem

00:31:25,419 --> 00:31:30,429
was say versus published and also that

00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:33,130
the transitions that we had were to

00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:35,200
suffer I would think the transitions we

00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:37,630
need to follow is more of a minor or

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,970
visibility problem because that is

00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:43,960
something that you're going to learn or

00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:45,850
the fear of time tomorrow babe oh I get

00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:50,950
it now what's happening with this it's

00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:54,309
also it's not we wrote blocker probably

00:31:50,950 --> 00:32:00,100
in the text but it is just an answer to

00:31:54,309 --> 00:32:03,220
do understand the other thing that we

00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:04,750
had was the unsaved changes so in the

00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,880
further ayat what would happen is that

00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:10,029
if you make some changes to your content

00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:12,880
it will give you a sign and take 2-3 and

00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:14,830
say keep on list if that is things these

00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:16,870
are the number of changes that I made

00:32:14,830 --> 00:32:19,330
but what happened with the prototype

00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:21,519
that it will not tell you that what will

00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:22,840
change is work you can go like okay

00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,149
that's great that you're telling me that

00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,980
I have made three changes but kind of

00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:28,389
that's not needing help me is you not

00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:31,539
telling me what those figures are

00:32:28,389 --> 00:32:35,399
because i have been seven seals in my

00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:35,399
content type and it just

00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:43,850
so so that was just about the climb

00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:47,299
editing the other thing that we wanted

00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:49,220
to solve it spark is is the notion of

00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:54,190
the two bottom toolbar is a clue that

00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:56,779
goodness everything together is it is

00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:58,789
besides of terminology problems that we

00:32:56,779 --> 00:33:01,669
have a clue for understanding the mental

00:32:58,789 --> 00:33:03,559
models with blocks and use this is what

00:33:01,669 --> 00:33:08,480
it is actually going to bring everything

00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:11,419
together and since 2011 you are visible

00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:14,539
to stories understanding comes with the

00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:16,460
Drupal 7 cool bar and the biggest

00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:19,879
problem with the toolbar is that is too

00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:22,370
busy is too convoluted even a lot of

00:33:19,879 --> 00:33:24,860
experienced users you will see that they

00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:27,409
hold is that in psychology that

00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:29,179
implanted where is what you don't

00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:32,240
remember there are a lot of these

00:33:29,179 --> 00:33:33,950
options you see the lot of these people

00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,230
what they do is that they just given

00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:38,769
don't bother going to the you so the

00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:41,570
toolbar they just want to put the URL

00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:43,909
forward so what we want to do with this

00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:45,649
approach with this problem that we want

00:33:43,909 --> 00:33:48,169
to make sure that we are at least

00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:50,899
helping just a little bit just a little

00:33:48,169 --> 00:33:55,789
bit more to the new user to make

00:33:50,899 --> 00:33:58,639
learning curve easier of course it's

00:33:55,789 --> 00:34:00,879
also unresponsive so what we try doing

00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:00,879
it

00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:31,580
I work together thinking about this

00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:34,970
toolbar is that those horizontal and

00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:38,270
vertical it is what it's trying to do is

00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:40,940
that it's suppose to how the new user

00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:42,859
get into where they need to put it at

00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,990
the same time also telling the

00:34:42,859 --> 00:34:47,510
establishment that we are not going to

00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:51,290
compromise on your efficiency using this

00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:55,070
tool bar things I want to mention about

00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:56,780
the toolbar is I still think that we

00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:59,480
still need to work on the information

00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:05,570
architecture but if what we have right

00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:07,670
now this is very much similar IA we know

00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:12,369
that there are a lot this is with the

00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:12,369
high so that's something that we want to

00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:33,220
so I'll go when we did the instability

00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:35,470
testing on the toolbar and what we did

00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:38,170
is that would be studied by that what I

00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:40,660
mean is that mean so let's say if they

00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:43,540
are a twisting that we show for it spins

00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:45,490
the new toolbar and then show the front

00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:48,210
cool bar and then we kind of flip the

00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:50,950
order so that there is no y to the

00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:53,770
viewing order in which how people think

00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:56,350
and we found that what had positive

00:35:53,770 --> 00:35:58,840
response to the truth toolbar because it

00:35:56,350 --> 00:36:01,450
was coming at nice icons the visually

00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:03,670
appealing but it had some trouble

00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:06,190
discovering of using so the drop-down

00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:09,310
arrow which kind of eliminates potato

00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:11,470
bread was not very clear it was too

00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:13,870
small they did not know that that will

00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:16,750
enhance the experience for an

00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:19,690
experienced user they had problems

00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:22,330
discovering how to do oh I did not know

00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:24,940
I can move the to go from horizontal to

00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:29,860
vertical vertical to horizontal so there

00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:35,670
was an icon takes the Edit structure

00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:35,670
cannot do that it was a good feature in

00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:54,640
so how many people here have experience

00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:57,280
with which way and all the processes in

00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,130
with it yeah part of this experiment

00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:03,700
with google well you know one of the

00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:05,440
inversions that we took you a little

00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:08,640
while ago we actually excited with dot

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,289
see here has four

00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,500
and part of the reason for that means

00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:17,680
not only to certify be ridiculous buxton

00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:20,799
group but also the catering what we

00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:30,039
users doing a lot of good work over that

00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:32,349
between two are the current problem with

00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:35,619
busy wit and for example in seven

00:37:32,349 --> 00:37:39,160
instead with it really does not cater to

00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:40,660
mobile users eating contest and you know

00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:45,609
if you're a mobile user and you're going

00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:47,319
into a and a page to make one change

00:37:45,609 --> 00:37:49,329
let's say you won't face a word or you

00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:51,579
want to add a small tank or something

00:37:49,329 --> 00:37:53,410
like that that's very very difficult do

00:37:51,579 --> 00:37:56,859
our mobile device even though it should

00:37:53,410 --> 00:38:01,150
be something that really especially what

00:37:56,859 --> 00:38:02,980
are you focused on our momentum there

00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:05,980
are too many 12 buttons the corpses

00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:12,700
aren't there there's really just can't

00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:14,289
for me I really just can't so the

00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:19,660
solution that we came up with was a

00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:27,970
mobile wysiwyg solution that a boxy

00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:31,750
editor and right now this is this is

00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:34,390
white folks there's a lot of fighting

00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:40,349
point on about this right now but if I

00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:40,349
just really very quickly in one of our

00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:52,550
and one thing that you'll notice here is

00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:54,619
that we have we simplified number of

00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:56,630
bunnies we simplified little buttons in

00:38:54,619 --> 00:38:58,040
a prototype and we also made it so that

00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:01,190
whenever you scroll on mobile devices

00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:03,200
the toolbar engine is fixed with the

00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:05,000
project see they are constituted because

00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,530
for the biggest problem editing any sort

00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,780
of paint on all devices that you have

00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:10,940
control all of the down front instead of

00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:13,069
buns earlier but it looks like once

00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:16,760
again responses were so this actually

00:39:13,069 --> 00:39:21,470
makes the rasta like you so this product

00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:23,119
right is correctly not but it did for

00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:24,890
you a lot of import considerations that

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:26,839
have actually made it waiting for and

00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:29,210
this is sort of part of that over RT

00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:31,220
overarching theme of well you know even

00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:33,079
though we haven't reached the North Star

00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:35,569
design for this process we have reached

00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:37,670
the vision that can be sort of

00:39:35,569 --> 00:39:40,040
applicable to the right of it ended in

00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:44,630
violence so one of the one of the

00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:46,640
biggest things that we wanted to make

00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:49,210
sure that you know mobile affords this

00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:56,260
needs to be there but they also need to

00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:58,190
make sure that loading crime is not and

00:39:56,260 --> 00:40:02,839
we'll talk a little bit about some of

00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:04,849
these I think for the last few use cases

00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:07,760
that was spending all good things about

00:40:04,849 --> 00:40:09,380
todd has been tested positively so now

00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,670
i'ma say somethin that big test positive

00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:15,460
vision one of the research that we did

00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:18,589
with usability testing with the mobile

00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:20,329
we're doing this is is kind of a very

00:40:18,589 --> 00:40:25,010
complex problem that we're trying to

00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:27,230
solve here is is understanding that the

00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:29,809
two big problems within one is the user

00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:32,630
behavior the iOS behavior and the

00:40:29,809 --> 00:40:36,230
provider data so the user behavior was

00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:38,690
very they were very rigid about making

00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:41,880
changes they wanted to not make any

00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:44,790
changes to their content on the phone

00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:46,590
of course we need to do more research

00:40:44,790 --> 00:40:48,600
and more contextual inquiries with a

00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:50,220
bigger sample size to see how that

00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:53,220
affects what you're trying to achieve

00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:56,100
the other problem was the iOS behavior

00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:58,230
so what happens is that iOS has its own

00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:01,320
behavior functionality is like select

00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:05,490
and copy and when the time use it with

00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:07,860
the WYSIWYG it just kind of blocks and

00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:09,270
overlay enough thing and then it becomes

00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:12,630
way that because we make those changes

00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:15,510
so there was another problem that kind

00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:18,540
of resulted in this negative experience

00:41:15,510 --> 00:41:21,200
and of course there were some life

00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:24,230
changes that we made because its

00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:27,600
vitality but it's still not there so

00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:30,090
people sometimes get confused what is a

00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:34,230
bar and what is actually a problem with

00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:37,380
the prototype so we also thought there

00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:39,420
were some design I will take time

00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:41,520
constraints and understanding that what

00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:45,930
we want to achieve where we want to go

00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:53,070
we did not take this to the next at

00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:55,050
least I'm so so ultimately the results

00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:57,810
of that work is a positive book but they

00:41:55,050 --> 00:42:00,180
did actually yield very good aspects

00:41:57,810 --> 00:42:04,890
sort of icons in general that we have

00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:07,860
incorporated to rate them in four icons

00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:10,860
which is the way to produce icons in a

00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:15,420
minute accessible way that doesn't

00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:17,280
require you to basically what it comes

00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:25,950
this is a custom farm is filled with

00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:27,930
bunch of us so this Quraan right whether

00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:32,310
you see here is are you discouraged will

00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:35,520
take to every from the hydrology now and

00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:38,520
off your curve but it does show you

00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:40,200
how easily we communicate the icon and

00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:42,780
basically any sort of the trailer

00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:44,670
everything here can be replaced and this

00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:46,710
is actually part of setting the code we

00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:48,990
can actually get out take pic and ipod

00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:50,760
and then insert its partner farm and

00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:52,920
this actually a business process that's

00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:56,190
been used by several other applications

00:42:52,920 --> 00:43:01,260
but we've adopted it for the toolbar in

00:42:56,190 --> 00:43:04,050
addition to our customers so as you can

00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:09,420
see just a little bit more code here we

00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:11,040
take a hockey school and what we call

00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:18,960
spark microns which is sort of leading

00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:23,550
russian department and what happens CSS

00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:25,620
here's that we use you contact to

00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:36,620
actually insert the attribute back into

00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:51,900
you have a background image with no text

00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:54,120
required so another big aspect of able

00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:55,830
to interface that we want to address was

00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:58,430
a dashboard and one of the biggest

00:43:55,830 --> 00:44:00,480
problems that new music coming to you

00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:02,520
drupal really don't understand how the

00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:05,940
dash book works but that board is insane

00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:07,650
is sort of this amorphous box area where

00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,890
you can insert different you know sort

00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:13,230
of columns which which which content

00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:15,060
what have you but a new user is really

00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:16,910
going to walk a more useful dashboard

00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:21,030
that is really cute or their their

00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:23,190
personal and so our solution was a

00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:25,550
responsible as part of this global

00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:25,550
approach

00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:36,270
so we should see our other streaming is

00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:38,160
on the website you see sort of a desktop

00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:40,680
version of that was initially created

00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,839
and then the operational right side as a

00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:45,359
ccd black borders the polite plants that

00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:47,609
are very simple and very to rats for

00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:49,319
Mountaineers moving instantly access a

00:44:47,609 --> 00:44:52,130
sort of half that they might need to

00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:55,770
wait without really knowing the jargon

00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:59,040
and ethical see there are icons out

00:44:55,770 --> 00:45:01,859
there which were if let it using my ipod

00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:03,480
once again and so you know one of the

00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:05,880
really great things about I tokbox is

00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:09,480
that you can actually use CSS to change

00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:12,859
some of these attributes and a bike text

00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:16,829
shadow of background apply a variety of

00:45:12,859 --> 00:45:17,790
CSS to change harder items actually look

00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:21,359
and that's because they're being

00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:24,480
displayed of text and not as engine this

00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:26,640
is a great for an important part of our

00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,230
birthing process i yielded a very big

00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,430
result that was affordable to a variety

00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:40,170
of different aspects of google and yes

00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:42,930
think you know went ahead and last thing

00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:45,420
that we want to talk about is is the

00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:47,369
problem space for responsibly actually

00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:50,609
we thought that means what we don't

00:45:47,369 --> 00:45:52,380
allow our users like now is what is

00:45:50,609 --> 00:45:55,500
happening with the current market trends

00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:59,520
the ability to create these layout and

00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:02,700
great points for tablets or mobile or

00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:06,030
desktop slipped inside whatever you want

00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:07,859
to do you want give that flexibility to

00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:12,710
the user which we don't currently

00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:15,710
provide in a very simple going fashion

00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:19,250
so the way we wanted to do this is to

00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:21,710
the break point could you so you just

00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:24,349
been a major what it does and what it

00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:26,359
does is that you can create Adam add a

00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:31,160
breakpoint to it you can also minimize

00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:32,690
and maximize the pixel sizes of it just

00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,310
in the interest of time I'm going to run

00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:36,619
to this but one of the interesting

00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:39,619
things that we found from this office is

00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:42,050
that it is time to do too many from the

00:46:39,619 --> 00:46:43,310
user experience testing that we found is

00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:47,240
that it's trying to do too many things

00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:49,339
at the same time and kind of confuses or

00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:51,230
it goes against the mental model of the

00:46:49,339 --> 00:46:53,060
user so what happens is that being

00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:57,230
actually created and add a breakpoint

00:46:53,060 --> 00:47:00,560
you will expect that that's if I hit are

00:46:57,230 --> 00:47:02,480
at a point where I would expect that the

00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,240
new great conflict between phone and

00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:06,740
gather what it was doing these rows in

00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,230
creating the break point between

00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:11,540
khabidam standard which was against a

00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:13,580
mental model of the user so we wanted to

00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:16,099
make sure that in the next version of

00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:19,670
the design fix that mental model design

00:47:16,099 --> 00:47:21,710
change the other also problem is that

00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:25,339
you have had to move the heartbreak on

00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:27,770
to the standard or to form in order to

00:47:25,339 --> 00:47:32,780
make changes to the min/max so we want

00:47:27,770 --> 00:47:35,060
to make sure that we provide how I said

00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:37,040
is it's like it's trying to do too many

00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:40,280
things at the same time and especially

00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:42,260
because this is a new concept the users

00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:47,630
to the wire to you at the stent what was

00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:50,869
going on so very quickly we just wanted

00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:54,440
some key highlights as to what all this

00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:57,700
means to us and down how do you think

00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:59,630
that is part of the community at large

00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:01,580
what are the key things that we've

00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:05,210
learned so far is that we have to work

00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:09,310
with what we've got we all we are all

00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:09,310
trying to be professionals in heart and

00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:20,240
resources the balance you are time

00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:22,610
constraints so this is probably it took

00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:24,050
me a while to really like no we don't

00:48:22,610 --> 00:48:25,940
want to do this we need to get it better

00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:31,790
you need to get a better look like no we

00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:34,430
don't have time to do that and you know

00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:36,890
one other key highlight that that week

00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:38,540
photos that you know prototyping and hit

00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:40,160
rating of art design was very

00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:42,410
importantly early stage and even

00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:43,940
actually a process as well because you

00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:46,190
know a photography attack to your sort

00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:50,030
of all our process to really feel

00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:53,090
depressed results and so trying to

00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:55,610
repeat repetition is still great you're

00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:57,410
useful but you know sometimes you need

00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:59,210
to move and that's and I thermoset

00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:01,370
iterating constantly and climate of

00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:02,750
students but you know sort of harry

00:49:01,370 --> 00:49:06,560
potter perfection is not going to really

00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:08,420
work in a very time to stream content so

00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:10,580
one of the approaches that really sort

00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:12,200
of functions well for this is the design

00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:14,360
the Grouse collaborative process between

00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:16,400
design prototype yields really the

00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:18,740
results because most require iteration

00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:21,140
that really delayed the project and it

00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:27,410
actually moves it ahead and bring the

00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:29,390
product to the code another very

00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:31,670
important gateway is that sometimes you

00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:33,020
have to leave the Google context to make

00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:35,660
it better and this is something that you

00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:38,510
came across time and time again is that

00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:40,520
you know worth trying to prototype

00:49:38,510 --> 00:49:42,400
interval is one of the hardest things in

00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,620
the world trying to do you know

00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,790
implement some sort of the new future

00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:50,000
you might as well be developing our

00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:51,440
people and it's you know with this sort

00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,270
of excessively modified functionalities

00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:54,680
11 with a great book that hurt that was

00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:57,050
apparently I develop that was entirely

00:49:54,680 --> 00:50:00,670
house Tyrell because it simply has been

00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:00,670
there was no way to really easily

00:50:00,749 --> 00:50:10,930
so you know xml CSS is really entities

00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:13,299
for PETA marked up so one of the other

00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:17,109
problems is that you know they

00:50:13,299 --> 00:50:19,420
complained about the ethical vegetable

00:50:17,109 --> 00:50:20,559
is that it's very basic president we

00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:24,460
have a lot of precedents that are

00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:26,769
established 6 foot 7 50 65 I really

00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:28,960
stuck in Google kind of really well and

00:50:26,769 --> 00:50:31,509
so what we really strove to do in a

00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:33,519
process is few exile ourselves

00:50:31,509 --> 00:50:35,829
extrapolate ourselves out of this

00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:38,559
paradigm at this present publicize post

00:50:35,829 --> 00:50:40,720
met with it has any preference because

00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:42,460
off prior to get our current context the

00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,380
response context the global context

00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:49,359
these paradigms really just ripped out

00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:51,249
its title and so by taking away starting

00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:53,200
our art or preconceived notions of what

00:50:51,249 --> 00:50:57,130
is thought to be because of the fact

00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:58,710
that was the plan 586 we decided well we

00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:01,509
need to completely move ourselves

00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:03,339
promising safe what is it that actually

00:51:01,509 --> 00:51:14,920
extra mate what is it that you know how

00:51:03,339 --> 00:51:18,249
is the structure ideal how I think is

00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:20,980
something that we need to I think there

00:51:18,249 --> 00:51:29,739
is some room for how to continue life

00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:32,440
that is a really good time but it is for

00:51:29,739 --> 00:51:35,230
open source projects I think we've done

00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:44,069
a very good job of engaging community

00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:46,660
every step and to the point is also that

00:51:44,069 --> 00:51:50,289
engaging the community is using

00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:52,660
beneficial it come up we have so many

00:51:50,289 --> 00:51:54,290
times that we haven't discovered issues

00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:57,000
that

00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:58,859
like Oh what about this use case what

00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,290
about that Tuesdays and that really

00:51:58,859 --> 00:52:04,500
helped us to make this thing better for

00:52:01,290 --> 00:52:06,780
everyone I I would want to say that

00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:08,849
there is still a lot of room for that

00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:13,050
what we have right now the habitat is

00:52:08,849 --> 00:52:14,970
not give you enough in terms of people

00:52:13,050 --> 00:52:18,030
got all these reviews because it's more

00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:19,710
of a developer focus workflow and not so

00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:22,099
much as it designed become focused

00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:24,420
through workflow so that's something we

00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:29,430
can probably talk about it some other

00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:33,240
fun things that we talked about in the

00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:35,160
project so first you know I know that if

00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:37,440
you have not tried out spark right I

00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:38,849
invited my ass party invited to look at

00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,270
some of these new pieces that we need

00:52:38,849 --> 00:52:44,190
for a try to you and the best way to get

00:52:42,270 --> 00:52:46,680
involved with sparkle its limitations

00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:48,869
use handbook in some of these nobody

00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:50,910
knowing will be finish this discussion

00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:52,800
is going on about the future part the

00:52:50,910 --> 00:52:55,800
future the wake are telling you work in

00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,420
trouble so we watch the product page and

00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:59,670
look at some of the issues that are

00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:03,240
there you know it is very very well

00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:05,390
curated q that has sold the amount the

00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:08,339
dish is that that that are really useful

00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:11,609
and we're hoping that sorted in the

00:53:08,339 --> 00:53:13,440
context of the property we face are you

00:53:11,609 --> 00:53:15,690
know we're open to find a little bit

00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:17,910
more improvement in the issues queues

00:53:15,690 --> 00:53:19,619
for design related issues as opposed to

00:53:17,910 --> 00:53:22,710
two thousand renovations but one of the

00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:25,020
biggest comes up we faced is is is that

00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:30,109
design focused problems are not being

00:53:25,020 --> 00:53:30,109
addressed in a very very intuitive way

00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:36,429
so we'd like to thank all of you for

00:53:34,989 --> 00:53:37,869
coming to our session we'd also like to

00:53:36,429 --> 00:53:43,420
thank all of the key contributors to

00:53:37,869 --> 00:53:46,449
smart who is diamond work shelter what

00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:47,679
are covers and you know all the other

00:53:46,449 --> 00:53:49,239
peoples of contributed you know

00:53:47,679 --> 00:53:51,849
countless hours to be issued to eat

00:53:49,239 --> 00:53:55,929
countless hours to make this bargain at

00:53:51,849 --> 00:54:00,099
a so far and we thank you so much for

00:53:55,929 --> 00:54:13,749
our session we might you know how we did

00:54:00,099 --> 00:54:18,579
and get the best of any questions I was

00:54:13,749 --> 00:54:20,589
interested in what mobile use these

00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:22,660
cases you have for Sparkle did you do

00:54:20,589 --> 00:54:24,729
personas and like specific people that

00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:28,509
were going to be editing on mobile and

00:54:24,729 --> 00:54:30,130
is on the iPad or tablet are you going

00:54:28,509 --> 00:54:33,729
to have the mobile experience it's

00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:36,029
touch-based yes so we access it both the

00:54:33,729 --> 00:54:38,949
reading had the time to fit it into our

00:54:36,029 --> 00:54:42,549
presentation but we did tests on the

00:54:38,949 --> 00:54:45,039
ipad and iphone so when we does the

00:54:42,549 --> 00:54:47,709
person that we were trying to aim was

00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:49,989
the content editor the marketing person

00:54:47,709 --> 00:54:53,709
and one of the things that we try doing

00:54:49,989 --> 00:54:57,249
is to really fast in the turnaround time

00:54:53,709 --> 00:54:59,529
we had you do a lot of in houses wasn't

00:54:57,249 --> 00:55:01,809
testing as well so we would have someone

00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:03,989
from the marketing team who is like a

00:55:01,809 --> 00:55:07,359
project manager needs to quickly edit

00:55:03,989 --> 00:55:09,519
content on a fair calm but how would you

00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:12,160
do it why would you invent that we do it

00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:14,589
so we focus on that use page I want to

00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:18,449
say that the experience on the iPad was

00:55:14,589 --> 00:55:22,209
more it was significantly better than me

00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:24,579
iphone one but it also that's something

00:55:22,209 --> 00:55:26,849
that we really need to understand and I

00:55:24,579 --> 00:55:28,110
not sure at this point in time is that

00:55:26,849 --> 00:55:30,270
do

00:55:28,110 --> 00:55:32,220
leave my personal problems I'm not

00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:34,500
really depressing convince that people

00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:39,840
do want to edit so much content on the

00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:43,080
mobile phone on iPads yes but and I

00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:45,210
worked on a lot of international sites

00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,950
and a lot of research I've done there

00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:49,080
are a large amount of people doing work

00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:50,790
on their mobile phones in different

00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:53,400
countries that just happens to be like

00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:57,270
what they have to access the web sites

00:55:53,400 --> 00:56:00,000
but there is one useless there and then

00:55:57,270 --> 00:56:05,130
I had another question about did you

00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:08,520
modify ckeditor like the JavaScript no

00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:11,820
no we just posted it skinned it yeah

00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:13,800
okay cool oh can you disable the lazy

00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:18,390
way can you just do Clint exciting from

00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:21,500
oh thank you so much i'm not i'm not

00:56:18,390 --> 00:56:25,710
sure to sting the yesterday's keynote or

00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:28,590
care criticize the use of the wig and

00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:30,450
your identity and it was a selection or

00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:34,190
what's your opinion about it if you

00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:36,780
accept the criticism and what new global

00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:38,730
so i think everyone who's on this

00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:41,700
parking and contributed to this

00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:45,390
conversation I think my personal view

00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:47,940
point is that that we either usefully

00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:50,250
research I love feedback and I

00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:51,930
appreciate the feedback and as I

00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:54,420
mentioned earlier in the session that

00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:58,050
the session is more about the focus of

00:56:54,420 --> 00:57:01,170
the process not about why we did what we

00:56:58,050 --> 00:57:03,630
did necessarily and I think there is a

00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:05,640
lot of room for discussion as to what we

00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:09,330
can do to make this a better experience

00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:14,400
for the content editors that being said

00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:17,250
hi I'm not either convince entirely as

00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:19,470
to the criticism that we've got but I

00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:21,570
think I'm having a lot of hallway

00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:25,230
conversations with people which kind of

00:57:21,570 --> 00:57:27,900
is helping me understand what we need to

00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:31,580
do to get this vellum and nailed down

00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:31,580
maybe we need to do something else

00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:40,600
these guys just an awesome fork on the

00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:46,120
spark project and I want to commend it

00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:48,970
and you know speak to karen said

00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:51,340
yesterday I spoke about this in my own

00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:54,160
stature in the community tried to loop a

00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:55,660
little while ago and you know when women

00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,790
I went up and who spoke to Karen after

00:57:55,660 --> 00:58:01,000
her keynote and and we were really

00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:04,540
interested in hearing more because you

00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:06,460
know I think both of us in Iceland are

00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:08,490
mixed as well I've really followed her

00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:11,110
work and that really excited about it we

00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:13,260
people are really all on the same page

00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:15,720
in terms of giving the user

00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:18,490
understanding of the different contexts

00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:20,950
different from Texas that there that the

00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:22,840
content is going to appear in and I

00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:26,410
think one of the things is that Karen

00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:28,570
wasn't really good clear on what we're

00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:31,510
really doing with wood in place editable

00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:33,240
which is actually quite unique even

00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:36,630
going beyond what's in head right now

00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:39,250
where you're editing individuals feels

00:58:36,630 --> 00:58:42,100
the contextual experience that we give

00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:43,810
the user in in the latest version of

00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:46,930
employees editing that that we're

00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:48,580
working on actually first shows the user

00:58:46,930 --> 00:58:50,850
that they're heading a note and then and

00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:53,020
then once they click inside the node

00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:55,330
atomizers out all of the fields and

00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:56,410
individual about into individual

00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:59,110
container so you're actually

00:58:56,410 --> 00:59:00,880
illustrating to the user that there that

00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:03,610
they're creating content in a structured

00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:05,770
way so we're showing the user the

00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:08,410
structure content of Drupal and a very

00:59:05,770 --> 00:59:10,630
clear and unambiguous way of indian

00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:12,310
place editing that no other content

00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:13,900
management system is really doing the

00:59:12,310 --> 00:59:15,940
one thing that we do still have to work

00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:19,090
on that which he made a fair point about

00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:22,090
is that we need to give the users a much

00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:23,440
better understanding of how the content

00:59:22,090 --> 00:59:26,680
that they're editing in the desktop

00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:28,690
experience is not exactly what to do in

00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:30,370
public spirited they don't want it to be

00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:32,380
the same of the mobile experience but

00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:35,590
providing better afford this is for the

00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:38,340
Newton's between these are full content

00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:38,340
and

00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:45,660
so push and pull between innovation user

00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,130
experience design and futures right so

00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:52,950
we have to try to balance it out

00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:58,650
everything in a very in a red coat is

00:59:52,950 --> 01:00:00,060
attraction it's always not easy all

00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:01,980
right I think we're at a time but thank

01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:03,240
you so much for attending and we'll

01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:05,960
stick around us for a few minutes to

01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,960
