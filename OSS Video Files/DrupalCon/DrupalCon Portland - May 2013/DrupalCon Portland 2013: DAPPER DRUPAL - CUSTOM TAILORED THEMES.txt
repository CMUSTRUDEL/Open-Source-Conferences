Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: DAPPER DRUPAL - CUSTOM TAILORED THEMES
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	Base themes are a great place to start when you're first getting into theming. As you grow as a front-end developer, you'll find your old standby base theme no longer fits. You're a grown up now; it's time to dress to the nines.

Why build a base theme?

By necessity, base themes make assumptions about how teams and individuals work. By rolling your own, you'll become much more comfortable and informed about the Drupal theming layer, and have a better launchpad for your front-end projects.

In this session, we'll talk about creating a custom base theme tailored for your development process; one that enhances your team's strengths and minimizes its weaknesses, offering clear advantages over contributed base themes. We'll identify common front-end problems, and demonstrate how a custom base theme can solve them in a reusable way. We'll look at how others are using base themes to improve their development process and share what we've learned developing Center and Prototype, an evolving pair of themes we've created that enable us to quickly build a front-end that fits our workflow.

GARRETT DAWSON

Garrett is a front-end developer who has been working with Drupal for the past several years, and has built many productions sites using popular contributed themes, like Zen and Tao.

JOHN FERRIS

John has been building websites since 2000. He has developed Drupal themes for a wide range of clients including M.I.T., The Smithsonian Institute, The United Nations, and Examiner.com.

my name is John Harris

00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:51,319
based in colorado Garrett said we do

00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:51,319
good work a lot of journalism education

00:01:54,740 --> 00:02:02,220
so we're going to talk to you today

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:08,250
about custom tailored teams what we mean

00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:10,799
by that not necessarily a custom theme

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,959
for specific project like every project

00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:15,930
that one of those but more about the

00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:20,850
tools that you use to start a project

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:22,859
with so in Drupal there's off triple

00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:27,030
threats cutting all different shapes and

00:02:22,859 --> 00:02:30,150
sizes as do the teams that those legs so

00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:32,840
your team might be I don't know dozen

00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:36,180
people you might have a designer

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:39,060
information architect content strategist

00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:42,750
sysadmin and back-end developer

00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:45,569
front-end developer we might just be one

00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:48,870
person sitting in the basement doing

00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:53,000
work attendee play but to take this

00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,000
presentation will call your teeth

00:02:53,710 --> 00:03:01,420
so we'll be able to do today is just

00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,420
encourage you to kind of

00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,860
a lot of different

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:54,850
so figuring out what what what to build

00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:57,430
your tool there's a ton question do you

00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:00,640
want to ask yourself listed a few here

00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:04,440
but everyone will be what type of

00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:09,610
projects need those are you working in

00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:12,090
journalism sites learning platform you

00:06:09,610 --> 00:07:13,150
go commerce site for that retail

00:06:12,090 --> 00:07:15,480
intercompany locals are just so talk a

00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:23,110
little bit about Stanford University

00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:30,490
didn't want her to open framework we

00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:37,650
have chance to talk with Miller so

00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:37,650
Stanford University the team within

00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:47,180
and in Stepford work web services

00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:51,220
provides services and it just kind of

00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:55,720
great two different departments and

00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:59,710
senior Stanford related organizations

00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:04,300
but as one of their services they have

00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:06,979
call the sacred sites Stanford sites

00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:11,060
basically in kind of think of it I guess

00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:16,669
is a protocol garden specific for

00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:19,970
Stanford basically it gives a free site

00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:25,120
to any students or faculty new

00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:27,860
apartments that Nina Drupal site and

00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,039
it's basically a Stanford web services

00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:35,029
it is seven staff members but they're

00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:38,779
managing over 900 sites right now I'll

00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:43,039
maintain my mistake so that is so

00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:45,410
there's a lot of challenges but asian

00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:49,070
feeling of security it wouldn't spin up

00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:54,130
a free side but they can't add any

00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:57,560
custom go to it so handle that on the

00:08:54,130 --> 00:09:02,180
demon they built was called open

00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:07,970
framework / framework is a series of a

00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:10,330
set of themes in which people can build

00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,330
their site

00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:19,709
so open framework itself is a nice thing

00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:22,259
kind of the bottom line base theme it's

00:09:19,709 --> 00:09:26,610
based on Twitter bootstrap basically

00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:29,130
provides some of the basic functionality

00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:33,560
that one would need to order within the

00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:38,069
standard size a lot of layout features

00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:39,630
of the big selling point of that and on

00:09:38,069 --> 00:09:43,259
top of that they have another base with

00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:46,709
you about Stanford and essentially what

00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:52,589
that students understand for branding on

00:09:46,709 --> 00:09:55,920
top of open framework and then on top of

00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:57,360
that they're the digital themes to

00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,579
choose from I think they have three

00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:04,589
right now and those just add additional

00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:06,769
kind of customizations to the theme

00:10:04,589 --> 00:10:06,769
itself

00:10:54,899 --> 00:11:00,459
so another company where we had an

00:10:58,779 --> 00:11:49,089
opportunity to speak with front and

00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:51,899
elder these guys are they not only is a

00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:57,839
distribution that's based all around

00:11:51,899 --> 00:12:02,049
panels it had some some layouts a lot of

00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:15,119
that bacon functionality that sector

00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:15,119
distributions with a lot of that so

00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:29,330
so they built kalafina on top of them

00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:31,970
luckily there's actually is art

00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:39,680
dependency we can start there looking

00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:40,910
exactly Decatur that specifically to one

00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,790
of the really interesting things that

00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:47,720
they're doing to one of their their

00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:52,300
challenges or their focus has been

00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,300
traditionally being more back in focus

00:12:54,460 --> 00:13:02,090
working to add in more design resources

00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:11,810
113 so for for back and developers would

00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:13,310
want to focus on the actuality they have

00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:16,250
also chosen to use Twitter bootstrap

00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:20,170
which turned out to work great for them

00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:20,170
because they don't

00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:31,430
so not my work examiner big ass and

00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:39,430
their attitude their crops work sources

00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:44,950
right return to the user driven so with

00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:44,950
what the site that dies you can imagine

00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:55,760
security code quality and so when I was

00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:19,420
there which was a little over a year ago

00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:23,980
I was single spikes three there now so

00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:33,550
so yeah it had very specific workflow

00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:39,340
very strict standards theme side of that

00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:39,340
they had a stack of themes in the base 1

00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:43,870
i'll step

00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:53,019
top here and here is basically we like

00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:55,889
to call it a utility thing like it

00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:59,350
doesn't it doesn't have any CSS

00:15:55,889 --> 00:16:02,470
templates repair / eyes will you totally

00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:07,029
theme is one and just an extended basic

00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:12,820
function so what Pierre is doing is it

00:16:07,029 --> 00:16:15,370
up Susilo Tate that we need to divide

00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:19,000
define uniquely directories and you're

00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:31,360
good with that HP so you can spread

00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:36,190
out probably no large site so with this

00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:39,310
allows and break out there dot eat files

00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:43,209
into separate folders and the way that

00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:47,860
is organized is do you have basically a

00:16:43,209 --> 00:16:49,920
module or custom module with written /

00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:53,949
certain things that are functionality

00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:57,130
whatever then theme there's a folder

00:16:53,949 --> 00:17:02,230
that specific do that module that hold

00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:04,780
on to the SS alter go figure out those

00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:07,419
projects that are specific to that our

00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:10,390
goal and that comes in really handy then

00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:14,949
you have this big sites and you're on a

00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:18,669
two week for recycle you know say code

00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:21,040
it something like that then alert for a

00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:23,709
special event that's going once that

00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:26,559
alert is done and they send set that

00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:30,220
module just what then the femur can go

00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:40,860
in and just close down that this will

00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:40,860
include that folder or so just wait

00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:49,400
basically keeping your CSS your coat you

00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:54,070
want to know more about that stuff right

00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:56,720
there becomes pretty cool stuff with it

00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:59,810
again like business in distance where

00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:02,870
this wouldn't approach a new dress

00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:16,690
really specific needs they have really

00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:16,690
tailored does our team work in power

00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:46,190
we're trying to us from developers I

00:18:28,250 --> 00:19:00,410
seem like a lot of us another team that

00:18:46,190 --> 00:19:03,740
is that's like really strong they had

00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:13,670
this approach where they like

00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:17,150
prototyping HTML CSS with in Drupal so

00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:21,340
what they've chosen to do is use handle

00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,340
tub approach dream of doing

00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:42,490
they're there Brian Julie they if you

00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:45,710
haven't seen this talk who's getting it

00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:52,280
London this year I believe it frontend

00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:55,370
United but video on YouTube very

00:19:52,280 --> 00:20:01,550
interesting essentially what they're

00:19:55,370 --> 00:20:08,030
doing is kind of facilitating more

00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:15,500
traditional front-end developer know so

00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:17,300
the HTML and CSS but if we pointed out

00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:19,040
earlier it comes out the femurs

00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,559
front-end developer that needs to know

00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:25,309
office other junk adorable just to make

00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:27,110
that stuff work so this approach kind of

00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:30,230
eliminates that by allowing in front end

00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:32,720
developer to focus on the CSS folks that

00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:35,300
HP though and then they can use a site

00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:42,940
builder and whether to tools like panels

00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:50,660
and place to meet everywhere basically

00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:53,540
to crap that markets are all through the

00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:56,740
what they really like a lot of these

00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:56,740
people themselves

00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:18,440
so one of the things that we can talk

00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:24,460
about faith from how we do this attack

00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:24,460
we have a sort of set system that we use

00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:32,480
internal team that works in a particular

00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:59,150
way we as chronic t have approached the

00:21:32,480 --> 00:22:00,890
problems with wherever we can we're

00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:04,180
using staffs that we standardized around

00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:06,530
a scheme that really leverages sassing

00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:09,800
sort of gives us a good starting point

00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:12,950
so we have sorts of clients that were

00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:14,120
always like be nice and everything in a

00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:16,400
certain sort of project that was

00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:21,440
everything doing and we created this

00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:23,330
custom kick which is a great idea you

00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,430
find stuff like cutting and pasting a

00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:27,530
lot of code from other projects that

00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:32,480
you've done why don't you just like roll

00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:40,580
that into so are our teams that works

00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:44,060
like this you start this utility sitter

00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:47,600
is basically begin it it does sound to

00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:50,530
put overrides but it's ok to use we

00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,670
brought house pontoons to add classes

00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:57,500
various things with a certain things

00:22:52,670 --> 00:23:01,510
with templates it functions within

00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,510
triple board where you just can't

00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:15,380
so this basically a little bit further

00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:19,770
starting point for us go solo built-ins

00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:30,780
various you know custom like fielding

00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:34,370
functions custom to suggestions red

00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:38,880
Center it's basically what it does

00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:42,410
strips out some CSS as well I've been on

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,380
top of that we have Carlos one more

00:23:42,410 --> 00:23:48,540
darter theme I guess we prototype

00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:53,480
prototype this move to be you know we

00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:53,480
don't want to worry about how prototype

00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,700
some some things

00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:09,480
we know we use display sweet so that

00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:11,700
kind of like sideways to how you should

00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:15,000
approach you're interested in empowering

00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:17,430
yourself to have more control and exert

00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,160
more influence over your friends you

00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:23,850
really need to evaluate yourself 15

00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:27,330
approach what if you want to do so get

00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:30,180
your measurements when we say that

00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:33,270
that's just like all these companies all

00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:54,210
these running developers they become

00:25:33,270 --> 00:26:05,190
really examiners kind of create

00:25:54,210 --> 00:26:07,530
something that super isolated yeah so

00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:09,780
there's no gate your measurements take a

00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:15,600
look at your team what are your

00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:23,510
strengths like rust we want we want to

00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:23,510
write JavaScript so

00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:35,399
you know think about it was going to be

00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:38,080
maintaining the site as you launch it

00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:41,860
support is one of our offerings and even

00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:45,820
maintaining the site's more often and

00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:48,549
not that we interlock so we have that

00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:59,289
benefit of you know that we don't have

00:26:48,549 --> 00:27:00,789
to worry about Stanford has you know

00:26:59,289 --> 00:27:05,620
people containing their sites around the

00:27:00,789 --> 00:27:14,679
site builders as a graduate student who

00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:16,720
doesn't necessarily skills you know

00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:19,240
maybe they built it so that in catering

00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:23,529
student of those they can just start

00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:26,230
with a good framework and add CSS and

00:27:23,529 --> 00:27:30,779
again have custom code so they they use

00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:33,100
their first ESS Gregory module which

00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:36,640
would probably frown on that and a

00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:45,220
normal situation but that that fills

00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:47,559
their kind of evaluate your you know

00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:52,919
your goals as a team or the goals of

00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:52,919
your projects or you know

00:28:33,410 --> 00:29:18,720
we know what we want handle those

00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:30,150
continue as we're working with the

00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:33,690
project these buttons have too much

00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:39,960
styles that we let's go back and strip

00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:45,030
that I'm doing the same thing that I

00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:49,890
just didn't so a lot of times we'll just

00:29:45,030 --> 00:30:00,710
put my top over to the protec directory

00:29:49,890 --> 00:30:00,710
directory other time don't have time

00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:08,559
just log in right quick get you and then

00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:12,580
that way we were starting the next

00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:16,120
project we kind of started that vary

00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:19,540
based again take a little bit a little

00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:22,570
bit of time at the beginning just kind

00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:25,390
of go there are some of those issues we

00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:33,040
don't always get home but just

00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:40,600
continually on your base your workflows

00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:45,490
change in red then adjusted from you

00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:57,940
become more efficient know where things

00:30:45,490 --> 00:31:03,220
are getting generated so yet to conclude

00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:04,900
nobody knows you like you so you know

00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:15,960
take your take stock in your situation

00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:21,790
takes doctors makes me get out there

00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:25,300
reuse it iterate great cool ideas that

00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:27,100
you run in developers cranking spike

00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,540
something together we're just really

00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:30,809
we're talking about it like a custom

00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,809
front

00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:27,580
you guys that responsibility separately

00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:31,300
yeah so part of it we have a router

00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:35,170
responsiveness has a lot to do with

00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:38,740
layout and purposely not started with

00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:41,560
too much too many layout engines are

00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:44,890
themed but as far as Astros we

00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:59,380
automatically included right fine art

00:32:44,890 --> 00:33:03,870
meters there in 20 yo me is a image he

00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:03,870
started from or

00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:38,820
the only so I remember correctly the

00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:41,220
only actually media queries break points

00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:46,820
that we have your starting prototyping

00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:49,529
scratch is just basic type our first

00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:52,140
position so it's off to the side and

00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:55,529
that's it because every time is

00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:58,380
different and that's them then that if

00:33:55,529 --> 00:34:00,690
we are still too much with that in

00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:05,570
prototype except we're going to strip

00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:08,190
out and over ends up creating more work

00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:12,200
so the idea is just to put those tools

00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:12,200
in their place that we can just get in

00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:35,820
so whenever things done classes on truck

00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:39,990
you know we talked to training what is

00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:53,580
the line where you do like a process how

00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:55,260
much of how much do we change yeah but

00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:57,740
we know that we use is like certain

00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,740
possible

00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:02,570
you know it really

00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:18,840
we've tried several different techniques

00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:20,970
for putting together front end and one

00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,920
thing we found like promega for example

00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:25,170
we were using for a while but we found

00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:27,750
just it would include all sorts of extra

00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:29,280
CSS and God is good and sing with other

00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:32,280
methods and so what we're doing these

00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:34,650
days we're going to the custom theme and

00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:37,320
we're literally stripping out everything

00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:40,140
as far as CSS and JavaScript and rupal

00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:42,570
and only including the stuff we want and

00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:44,850
we get huge performance boosts but what

00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:48,240
my question is have you guys consider

00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:54,510
doing that approach and if so why why

00:37:48,240 --> 00:38:05,550
not happy that's definitely a dream for

00:37:54,510 --> 00:38:20,550
us like as far as the CSS those out and

00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:22,890
we copied over so it will get included

00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:26,760
when it beats do as far as JavaScript

00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:29,430
goes that's definitely something we

00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:31,590
wanted to do something that Garrett's

00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:33,070
been working on we're not there yet as

00:38:31,590 --> 00:39:28,380
far as

00:38:33,070 --> 00:39:41,260
I think that also comes down to the

00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:44,670
video there thank you you use that you

00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:47,080
are doing that yes and part of it is

00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:49,210
basically that we don't doubt your

00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:51,490
including is the contextual links to let

00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:53,380
me go two blocks on a page and we

00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:55,060
basically decided anywhere we're going

00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:57,640
to use Ajax is going to be custom it's

00:39:55,060 --> 00:40:00,160
not going to be the people side and

00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:02,950
maybe it's a pipe dream we haven't

00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,480
totally used it a lot of our is pretty

00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:08,080
new for us to still work we're still

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:09,940
kind of learning but we've just started

00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:13,690
to spend a lot either we don't have some

00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:15,580
weird you know CSS specifically in there

00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:17,940
that except we're doing to fix some of

00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,940
the other

00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,560
but we found a cleaner solution that way

00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:34,630
bags I'm not sure if it's the best work

00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:39,270
but left i'm about to thunder living

00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:42,760
earth because i found at this i started

00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:46,480
building a simple site from scratch by

00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,890
downloading the Acquia bundle it was

00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,930
kind of like set you up with the

00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:55,329
fundamentals and it came really great

00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:58,770
and awesome and then the debug before I

00:40:55,329 --> 00:41:02,140
wanted to use this long press theme it

00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:07,180
presented like a bunch of limitations

00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:10,180
and so it's worrying about yet they

00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:13,980
really need that you guys are talking

00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:17,349
about did you do that through

00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:21,240
downloading or a CLIA brundle and then

00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:27,220
just adding modules and customizing it

00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:31,200
that's all yeah your demons look at

00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:36,490
examiner day I was there for I think

00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:45,160
three months before ever saw everything

00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:46,750
they do again comes down there like

00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,960
putting your resources includes on your

00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,960
team

00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:14,040
I just want to head on said for many

00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:18,839
years and when I specific top 15 we're

00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:20,630
writing tabs or adding pagination video

00:42:18,839 --> 00:42:23,910
efficient that you carry another CSS

00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:27,599
override it and stuff Steve brutally but

00:42:23,910 --> 00:42:30,270
it'd be the graphics on them so i

00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,890
recently did this so much happier for it

00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:33,240
because i know now it's getting even

00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:36,089
without longer standing in the theming

00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:42,570
layer and I know exactly everything is

00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:43,589
and it's copied over start start playing

00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:50,520
with it when the first convicted

00:42:43,589 --> 00:42:53,070
whistling set the ton of for those

00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:58,640
finals until so pretty like system best

00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:58,640
guess there's that said that copied over

00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:51,900
so what do you think about come on here

00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:54,300
some people you talk to you but what is

00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:56,100
the reason for a contribute in bed yeah

00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:59,280
like is it really practical for other

00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:23,040
people but everyone's creating face

00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:25,580
things for their specific not reusable

00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,580
code that

00:44:26,490 --> 00:45:32,780
a lot of people

00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:36,180
those sandbox projects and school

00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:42,840
still actually like said we've been

00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:57,119
working on you know terminator a sandbox

00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:59,330
project it began redsnow started

00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,330
