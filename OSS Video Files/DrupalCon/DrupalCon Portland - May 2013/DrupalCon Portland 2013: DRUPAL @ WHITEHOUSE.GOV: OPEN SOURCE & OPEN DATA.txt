Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: DRUPAL @ WHITEHOUSE.GOV: OPEN SOURCE & OPEN DATA
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	Last year, President Obama launched an initiative encouraging federal agencies to take part in and contribute to open source communities and requiring them
to make government data freely available in machine-readable formats. The White House is working to meet these expectations, using Drupal for WhiteHouse.gov and the We the People petitions system, contributing code, releasing APIs for important datasets, and working to build communities around these products. At this session, we'll discuss how the We the People system works, it's future, and the lessons we've learned about open source and open data projects in the federal space.

all right let's uh let's get started I

00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:07,020
think we'll let folks keep starting to

00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:09,450
trickle in I know it's a sort of the

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:12,570
five o'clock slot i'm i'm the guy

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,880
between you and your beer so try to try

00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:18,300
to keep this moving along so thanks

00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,800
everyone for coming really quickly my

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,510
name is lee haim and i am the director

00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:27,900
of new media technologies at the White

00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:30,300
House folks who saw Greece's keynote

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:32,610
yesterday probably heard make and

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,770
mentioned me basically I run all the

00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,600
technical platform all the development

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,969
and operations of whitehouse gov and

00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,890
about a dozen or so other sites run by

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:43,770
the website and pretty much everything

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:45,539
except for the content itself so i'm

00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,930
basically again to Macon's yang he's

00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:52,739
content on platform that's kind of how

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:54,870
that all rolls down so i always really

00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:57,300
get excited to come to an event like

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,469
this to talk about what we're doing what

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,210
we're doing with open source software

00:00:58,469 --> 00:01:02,520
user engagement and stuff like that

00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,010
because I think when folks think of

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,290
government websites and government use

00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:09,210
of you know online technologies they

00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,070
don't typically think of the things that

00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,540
that are that are getting talked about

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,280
at the conference this week and instead

00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,020
you know my guess is if you think about

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:17,549
a government website you're probably

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,990
thinking something a little bit like

00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:24,240
this and a little bit less like that and

00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:26,610
I'll I'll come back to those those sites

00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,240
a little bit later I just kind of want

00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:32,250
to run you through some ideas of how

00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,810
we're how we're approaching things here

00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,610
there's probably two main themes I'm

00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,430
going to talk about today and the first

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,900
one sorta again timing back in with a

00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,220
lot of the stuff that dress talked about

00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,450
yesterday is about engagement about

00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:49,100
engagement with the users of your site

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:52,920
in particular for us its citizens it's

00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:54,390
you know folks who have business before

00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,649
the government as it were and so I'm

00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,560
going to talk kind of run you through

00:01:55,649 --> 00:02:02,369
today sort of how we've evolved our

00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,140
platform how we came to be using Drupal

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,500
and open source software and how we've

00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,539
even how that's enabled us to kind of

00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,340
change the status quo within the

00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:12,050
government in terms of the use the

00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:14,540
engagement as well as the development

00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:15,940
methodologies for these tools that we

00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,470
use and really talk to you today about

00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,090
kind of our marquee platform right now

00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:23,510
which is we the people you saw a bit

00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,650
about this yesterday and and go through

00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:26,720
and actually talk about the role that

00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,860
that were sincerely hoping that the

00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,260
folks in this room and at this

00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,750
conference are going to play as we take

00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:36,050
this forward so our story starts in

00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:39,350
October of 2009 does anyone know what

00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:42,100
happened in 2009 in October why it's

00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:46,520
important here today anyone go ahead

00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:48,739
White House stock up what about it on

00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,630
Drupal thank you prior to that yeah so

00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:53,600
whitehouse.gov was launched on Drupal in

00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:55,459
October of 2009 this was obviously sort

00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,770
of a pretty exciting moment for us at

00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:00,500
the White House but also in the open

00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:03,080
source community in fact I don't know if

00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,640
folks were here last year my my

00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,190
predecessor guy named Tom Cochrane was

00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,320
on the same stage talking about the

00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:11,630
process of getting getting whitehouse

00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,709
gov on to Drupal and you know he kind of

00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,030
raised the interesting point that this

00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:16,820
is the only second time in the history

00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:19,130
of the country that a presidential

00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,380
transition also involved building a new

00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:22,940
website and so they actually they built

00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,470
it wasn't the site the Drupal site that

00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,530
you saw initially but their first past

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:31,760
they did it from you know conception to

00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:33,140
to production in about 70 days so but

00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,060
you know you heard make and say this

00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:38,390
yesterday when we talked about why we

00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,829
went to a platform like drupal you know

00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:43,130
the folks who'd come off the campaign

00:03:39,829 --> 00:03:45,980
and that you know the folks who sort of

00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:48,260
been using web technologies prior to

00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:50,000
coming to the White House sort of had a

00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,970
new understanding and wanted to kind of

00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,130
change the status quo of what was of how

00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,049
the White House would use the web and I

00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,280
think sort of previous administrations

00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:01,760
had much more of what we would all

00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:05,019
consider a a one point 0 method you know

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,489
mentality and in terms of just true

00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:09,620
production of content without real sort

00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:12,380
of you know we speak you listen kind of

00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:14,329
mindset so we wanted to change that

00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:16,910
status quo with respect to engagement

00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:19,130
but also you know relevant to this group

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,239
here it meant a sea change in our

00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,400
ability to develop

00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,610
and a platform like drupal sort of

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,590
change the model to where we kind of you

00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:30,500
know the things like the modularity and

00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:32,300
the ability to reuse goddess sort of

00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,910
developing and implementing faster and

00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:38,000
changing the model of how we develop so

00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:39,470
after we got whitehouse gov online we

00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,360
started launching more sites and with

00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:43,720
Drupal we were allowed to iterate faster

00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,340
get stuff up online in rapid succession

00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,080
keep accelerating and now we have you

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,669
know over the course of the next two

00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,020
years we launched at least four more

00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:53,569
sites there's actually more than I'm not

00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,340
highlighting here each one because we're

00:04:53,569 --> 00:04:57,680
on a platform like drupal because we

00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:59,150
have the modularity and the ability to

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,150
sort of not have to build from scratch

00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:04,190
each time we keep accelerating you know

00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:05,509
each iteration and so we've sort of the

00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,729
thing we used to joke about is like

00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:11,120
before Drupal we had to this is you know

00:05:07,729 --> 00:05:13,940
write an RFP for every new web form and

00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,340
it was a bit like that because there's a

00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:21,889
lot of sort of that what we do here that

00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:24,139
is in a certain sense different a new

00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:25,250
status quo from from how things were

00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:26,630
done in the government and so the other

00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:28,039
theme I actually want to talk a little

00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,419
bit that you'll hear me kind of

00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:32,780
repeating on today is that there are

00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:34,759
some concepts that are probably pretty

00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:36,889
well established in the room here and to

00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:38,659
the community that we deal with that are

00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:41,479
still young concepts in the government

00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:43,550
and in the government web space and one

00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:44,780
of those is just a simple sort of debate

00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:47,539
between you know folks would call

00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:49,550
waterfall vs. agile methodology and I

00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:51,919
see folks nodding heads IC folks

00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:54,349
understanding and a lot of the

00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,639
government procurement and sort of as it

00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:57,979
bleeds into the development

00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:00,139
methodologies are very much focused on

00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:01,699
waterfall and I know there's a lot of

00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:04,159
people in the room here like we're like

00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:07,460
super bearish on waterfall I imagine

00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:10,060
most most web developers sort of have a

00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:12,199
very dim view of it but I will say

00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:13,729
having spent time in the government and

00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:15,800
sort of really conceptualizing this

00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:18,770
there is a value to it it's just not

00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,819
here for us in the room and and even in

00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:24,500
the software space in the days of like

00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:26,539
you know shrink wrap software etc stuff

00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:30,169
when you had to like burn things out to

00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:32,240
tape or to fpgas things like that I mean

00:06:30,169 --> 00:06:33,830
let's think for a second what is sort of

00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,870
the big feet

00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:39,590
waterfall where does waterfall work best

00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:41,510
right it's in a situation where the cost

00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:45,440
of post-launch changes are very

00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:46,670
expensive and if you think about sort of

00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,200
the majority of the government

00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:50,660
procurement and the majority of the

00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,910
government projects this is actually a

00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:56,480
good thing right I mean I don't know

00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:58,490
about you guys but I kind of want my

00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,100
f-22 to be feature complete before it

00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:03,140
takes off right so that's a good thing

00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,060
but we all know in this room why it has

00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:07,220
a bad rap with us and our colleagues is

00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,980
because it doesn't work well in the web

00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,540
space because we know that's not you

00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:14,600
know not the best way for us to work

00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:16,430
because we know that the cost of you

00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,740
know the cost of post launch changes is

00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,750
relatively low in comparison and in fact

00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,100
there's value to this and so sorry you

00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,510
know that previous slide that I had

00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,370
their these are slides that I used to

00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,440
evangelize about agile development

00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:30,590
within the government because it sort of

00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,020
takes along the x-axis sort of you know

00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,880
time and along the y-axis the amount of

00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,850
value features etc that we're building

00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,830
into the application and so by use of

00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:41,780
Drupal and by demonstrating over those

00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:44,450
two years that evolution of how we kept

00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:46,190
building faster and faster getting more

00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:48,890
and more return on the initial

00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:50,570
investment on in Drupal and an open

00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,180
source we were able to show that

00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,950
actually we don't need to like have all

00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,480
of the requirements written in stone and

00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,120
that we can actually go to sort of a

00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,580
more minimum viable approach get some

00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,470
features out and start you know

00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,990
iterating through and continuing to add

00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:08,720
value as we sort of clip along that x

00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,740
axis and why that's important today and

00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,380
we're going to talk to you about is

00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,820
because now it enabled us to do one

00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:16,760
thing that had really never been done

00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:19,640
before beyond just using open-source

00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,590
software it opened up our space both are

00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:24,110
our engineering resources and our

00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:27,110
financial resources to start no longer

00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,820
just simply being users of open-source

00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,180
software and Drupal but actually

00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:33,770
starting to produce something and here's

00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:37,280
what kind of I want to talk about today

00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:40,960
which is as folks know probably by this

00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:42,830
point September of 2011 the president

00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,840
speaking to a group at the United

00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:47,780
Nations General Council announced

00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:49,700
new big new application and it spoke

00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,920
about two things obviously it's an

00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,240
online petitions platform and that means

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,930
that people can petition the government

00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:59,630
and but he also said we want other

00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:01,640
people to use this he announced to a

00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:03,620
group at the United Nations General

00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,540
Assembly that we would share the code

00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,330
that we would open source the technology

00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,860
and this is a huge day for us and it was

00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:11,630
essentially marked the change from

00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:14,420
simply being consumers to being

00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:15,890
producers so September shortly after the

00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,760
president makes that speech we launched

00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:21,530
We the People most folks probably were

00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,140
at Greece's keynote yesterday and he

00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:25,490
talked about sort of this this platform

00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:27,080
and I'm gonna run you just quickly a

00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:29,570
little bit deeper through it and talk

00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:32,990
about what it actually does Jews mention

00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:35,180
it's an online petition platform but

00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,770
this is something that's been around for

00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,150
a while and he sort of said kind of

00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:40,910
amusingly that he was never really sure

00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:43,760
how we petitioned the government before

00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:45,830
this platform came along the truth is it

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,500
actually it goes goes much deeper than

00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:49,580
that and even predates the internet does

00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,540
anyone know what the Olive Branch

00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:55,970
petition was no not history majors in

00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,530
the room no all right so the Olive

00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:59,810
Branch petition was actually certainly

00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:02,180
last last thing that occurred before the

00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:04,640
the American Revolution and it was a

00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,860
petition to the king of England at the

00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,680
time so this idea of petitioning

00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:12,350
government is not new and even the idea

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,570
of petitioning governments or government

00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:16,220
groups online is not new it's been

00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:18,380
around for quite a long time and there's

00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,470
a lot of platforms out there that

00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:23,870
already exist so why would we do this

00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,940
when the space like already exists well

00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:27,710
we decided we could actually change the

00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,510
social contract we came into the White

00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:32,780
House and decided that we wanted to

00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:34,220
change the role and so we committed and

00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:36,590
we said if you get a set number of

00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,000
signatures in a given amount of time you

00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:39,620
know I meet all the other terms of

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,040
participation you are promised you are

00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,510
guaranteed a response to your petition

00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,550
from someone within the administration

00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:49,790
and even a couple of places it's been

00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:51,320
the President himself and so those sites

00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:52,990
that kind of what changed is that those

00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,820
sites that already exists you know I've

00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:58,010
spoken to people at those organizations

00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,640
who equated the experience a little bit

00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:01,220
too

00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,000
writing a letter to Santa Claus because

00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,830
what they would do is they would take

00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,080
the petition they'd gather up all the

00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,430
signatures bundle it all up and toss it

00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:09,950
over the wall but what happened to it

00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:11,540
after that you know they really had no

00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:14,270
control over and so now we have that

00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:15,260
that that new engagement piece and so

00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:18,800
that's sort of like we're shifting

00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,210
initially now from simply just content

00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,030
production to an actual engagement

00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:24,740
experience and then when we develop that

00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:27,380
too is that we took that same new

00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:30,290
concept of agility and and an iterative

00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:32,180
development to the application itself to

00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:34,040
where sort of when we first launched we

00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,650
had like the first iteration of the user

00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:39,160
experience and over time over the course

00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:41,690
of like the next year so we started

00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,030
iteratively improving the user

00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:46,700
experience this sort of classic cycle of

00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:48,320
get it out there look at the change in

00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:50,960
the user behavior let your users tell

00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,610
you how they want to experience this to

00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,740
the point where we get the slow build

00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:57,110
and linear growth in participation until

00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,460
late last year we turn the curve of the

00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,160
hockey stick in terms of participation

00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:03,230
and now actually even since this slide

00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,780
was put together we've crossed 13

00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:08,390
million signatures and roughly around

00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:10,280
nine million users at this point also

00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:12,920
the hockey stick metaphor maybe it's me

00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,810
I play I play hockey I play left-handed

00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,700
so the hockey stick always looks like

00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:21,440
upside down to me I don't know am I the

00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:22,970
only one who feels that so it's been so

00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,280
successful you know as folks know

00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,830
probably now that we have probably we've

00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,540
caught we've upped the threshold for

00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:33,860
signatures it now requires a hundred

00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:35,180
thousand signatures in 30 days we think

00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,860
that's a good problem to have and

00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,350
interestingly enough we have not seen a

00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,940
massive drop-off in the number of

00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:43,490
petitions that have crossed that

00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:46,550
threshold so I think we really have this

00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:49,880
sort of upward trending continuous user

00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:50,810
experience and so folks who have

00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,030
experienced that have probably

00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:54,710
experienced this one you folks obviously

00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:59,260
saw this a bit yesterday I was telling

00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:59,260
Therese last night but

00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:10,900
yeah seriously there we go all right my

00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,640
fidget apologizes so yeah now it's

00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:14,650
telling Theresa last night that you know

00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:17,470
he stole my material but yeah I have to

00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:24,040
go with this doing that or is that just

00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:25,690
me it is okay it's just me all right van

00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:27,490
morrison can't play a concert without

00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,110
playing moon dance like people will

00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:30,339
throw stuff at him I can't talk about we

00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,650
the people without putting up this

00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:34,810
petition but there's actually a lesson

00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:37,330
here there are a lot of petitions that

00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,680
are sort of not necessarily meant you

00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,420
know we would get some of them using

00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:44,710
petitions like this how many folks

00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:46,150
actually have seen this alright so for

00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:48,580
like the three of you who haven't raised

00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:51,910
your hand I strongly recommend you go to

00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:54,670
your preferred search engine do a search

00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:56,680
for White House Death Star petition it

00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:59,200
will be the most interesting eight

00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:01,150
minutes of your day I promise you but

00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,160
actually folks who have seen this before

00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:07,030
please please raise your hands again

00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:08,620
let's get him up again and now how many

00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,839
folks actually signed this petition give

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,890
him up give him up come on I know it's

00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:13,870
good laying the day and let's stick with

00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:15,580
it all right hands up again if you've

00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:19,390
seen this now how many folks who saw

00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:20,830
this learn something new I asked Greece

00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:23,230
this question last night he said he did

00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:25,930
too in fact we're not quite singing here

00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:28,720
but we have data so half of the folks

00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,980
who saw this petition at least half said

00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,440
they learned something new who saw this

00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:33,820
response and here's the point that I'm

00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,100
making which is that even though this

00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,020
petition was sort of meant kind of

00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,360
tongue-in-cheek humorous and so forth

00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:42,220
it's sort of proof positive that we are

00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:44,650
committed to this endeavor that we took

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,209
it you know in an in-kind and in

00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:48,270
seriousness and even though it was

00:14:46,209 --> 00:14:50,530
humorous and we got to sort of like show

00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:52,420
show some interesting things which is

00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:53,880
you know not the least of which that the

00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:56,500
White House has a sense of humor about

00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:59,740
you know space and I'm not talking about

00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:01,690
the Jedi mind-meld comment but I am

00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,190
talking about about this so this is fuse

00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:04,900
with metaphor but all these numbers that

00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,190
you're seeing on the screen and I get

00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,870
this because Greece doesn't get to have

00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:09,490
this but he will I'll talk to that in a

00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:12,310
minute these are actually click through

00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,660
rates for the various links in

00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,980
in the response and so these are

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,440
conversions these are actual people

00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,360
clicking out learning new things that

00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,670
they wouldn't have otherwise known if

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,070
they hadn't signed this petition and so

00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:26,230
we do these post-petition surveys to

00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:27,850
folks who who sign petitions that get

00:15:26,230 --> 00:15:29,380
responded to and this number holds up

00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:31,660
and this is like whether we're talking

00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:35,200
about petitions about you know gun

00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:37,600
control marijuana secession etc you know

00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,220
to each one we're seeing rates in the

00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,940
forty to fifty percent range of people

00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:45,490
who sign this petition and regardless of

00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,990
the results of that response have

00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,760
learned something new and have actually

00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:50,290
gotten some level of engagement from the

00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:54,460
White House that they wouldn't have

00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:55,960
already had so we consider that

00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,370
something of a success and you remember

00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,320
the president kind of made those those

00:15:57,370 --> 00:16:01,330
those two two promises right the first

00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:04,120
was that we would be able to petition

00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:05,980
the White House but now we also jump in

00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,050
august of last year to the next big

00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:09,540
exciting thing which was the second half

00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:13,060
of that promise that the president made

00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:14,589
and so i'm going to show you a picture

00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:17,980
of something that happened in why is

00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:21,880
this keeping me alright i asked for a la

00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:22,750
wireless mic but they said no so august

00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,680
two so i'm going to show you a picture

00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:31,870
of something really exciting which is

00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:33,310
software developers wearing ties some of

00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,380
the folks in this picture are here at

00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:36,490
drupalcon they are in disguise you know

00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,500
they're in disguise because they're not

00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:40,180
actually wearing ties but tap them on

00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,320
the shoulder if you see them and thank

00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,880
them but know what you're actually

00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,610
seeing this picture is the moment that

00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,970
the White House issued its first github

00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:50,500
commits his first public github commit

00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:52,210
that was the day that we took the source

00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,800
code 44 we the people and put it online

00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:55,720
it was a really exciting day for us we

00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,290
had our first pull request within six

00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:01,959
hours we were the number one trending

00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:04,360
repo that week and you know it was such

00:17:01,959 --> 00:17:05,560
a success and so much support we very

00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,920
quickly with the next couple of weeks

00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:12,209
released a bunch more at least two more

00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:15,250
two more repos these are our mobile apps

00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:17,709
android and iphone and here we are today

00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:21,699
we've actually got now seven public

00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:24,189
repos we have merged in about a dozen

00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:25,990
pull requests and by that i mean pull

00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:26,270
request from from outside developers not

00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:28,220
our

00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:29,780
and we have lots of pull requests from

00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:32,210
our own developers it's part of our

00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:35,180
process but actual sort of bona fide

00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:38,630
open source community pull requests four

00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:42,710
hundred or so forks and now of course we

00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:45,320
have petitions live as a salt profile on

00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:46,670
on drupal.org as well and actually the

00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,620
truth is this is not even the beginning

00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:51,410
of our open source story at the White

00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:53,270
House there are several modules these

00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:54,410
all showed up some of these showed up

00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,930
and one of the slides at three said

00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:58,790
yesterday as well this is just a

00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:00,500
sampling is about a dozen or so modules

00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:01,490
and I think I was talking to someone

00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,430
there's another one that's actually

00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:06,350
about to go up in the next week or so so

00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:08,540
these the ones with the red stars are

00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:09,740
stuff that even predated our petitions

00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,040
work and these are modules that have

00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,850
been sort of in use on the white house

00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:18,710
and have them for quite some time

00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:20,360
contributed maintained etc so the point

00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:24,020
here that I'm getting at is that this is

00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,190
not just us checking off a box of open

00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,930
sourcing and just saying all right

00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:28,400
here's the source code we're done we

00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,260
kept the president's promise it's like

00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,990
proof you know evidence that this is

00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,730
this is a an engagement level that we

00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:35,930
are committed to within the developer

00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:38,390
community within the open source

00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:39,860
community itself and we want to talk to

00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:42,410
about some of the lessons the experience

00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:45,200
of open sourcing you know what was it

00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:47,210
the experience about open sourcing we

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,040
the people specifically because you know

00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,230
we like I said we had some modules

00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:54,410
already gone live but it was our first

00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:58,610
major application and the first lesson

00:18:54,410 --> 00:19:00,470
yet another sort of topic that is sort

00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:02,150
of probably well established in this in

00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,920
this room at the very least I don't

00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:06,560
think it's fully established or taken as

00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,240
a priori even in the corporate space yet

00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:11,360
which is that you get better software

00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,500
when you build for open source even if

00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,660
you're never going to actually release

00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,370
the code and we've come to kind of

00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,300
recognize this because petitions itself

00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,560
I don't know if this is one of those

00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,420
cases when the president made that

00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,890
promise if it was like you know what I'm

00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,360
talking about when the sales team

00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:24,560
promises something to the customer

00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,350
without actually checking with the

00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:28,760
engineers first I don't I wasn't there

00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:31,700
at the time so I don't actually know how

00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,260
it came about but I do know that the the

00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:35,360
platform itself was and there was never

00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:38,420
initially the intent of releasing at his

00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,039
open source and so what the code looked

00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:41,570
like as a result sort of

00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:42,649
you know was different from what it

00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:44,419
looks like today and what it will look

00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:46,759
like tomorrow etc as will continue to

00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:48,379
evolve because we took that same same

00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:50,840
approach but we know now that we get

00:19:48,379 --> 00:19:53,239
this better better platform because of

00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,470
like we get flexibility modularity and

00:19:53,239 --> 00:19:56,840
that means that the way that we

00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:58,190
developed the code you know because we

00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,509
know it's going to get reused and

00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,919
because it's going to get adapted for

00:19:59,509 --> 00:20:03,139
certain things the things that we

00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:04,669
require developers to do is very

00:20:03,139 --> 00:20:06,440
different you have to be more strict

00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:08,629
about your abstraction barriers about

00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,669
keeping your markup separate from your

00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:12,440
logic things you know sort of basic

00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:14,899
engineering principles making sure that

00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:17,419
you kind of are disciplined and rigid

00:20:14,899 --> 00:20:19,789
about the interfaces to your services

00:20:17,419 --> 00:20:21,769
etc and so we get that out of the box

00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:25,090
with open source but also you just get

00:20:21,769 --> 00:20:27,619
better code because there's a guy at

00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:28,999
github now a guy named Ben Balto used to

00:20:27,619 --> 00:20:31,669
be a presidential innovation fellow

00:20:28,999 --> 00:20:33,470
wrote this great blog post about why you

00:20:31,669 --> 00:20:36,580
should open source and he opens it with

00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:38,359
Justice Brandeis a--'s famous quote of

00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,849
sunlight is the best disinfectant

00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:42,830
because it's a simple fact that when you

00:20:40,849 --> 00:20:44,359
are writing code or doing anything

00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,909
really that you know someone else is

00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:48,559
going to see not just the end result but

00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:49,729
the inner workings of it you behave

00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,739
differently and even if that person

00:20:49,729 --> 00:20:54,259
might just be five years old are you

00:20:51,739 --> 00:20:56,539
going what the heck did I do well you

00:20:54,259 --> 00:20:57,710
know why did I do this choice the the

00:20:56,539 --> 00:20:59,330
way that you're going to code with that

00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:01,539
expectation is different and it ends up

00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:04,609
with a more stable more scalable

00:21:01,539 --> 00:21:06,590
application so by default and this is a

00:21:04,609 --> 00:21:08,809
message that we're now trying to

00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:10,249
evangelize throughout the government and

00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:13,489
we have other folks on board with us

00:21:10,249 --> 00:21:15,710
there's a consumer protection financial

00:21:13,489 --> 00:21:18,649
bureau which is sort of their the latest

00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:20,539
start up space in the you know in in DC

00:21:18,649 --> 00:21:23,359
and they've already published a open

00:21:20,539 --> 00:21:25,309
source policy which is it's really more

00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:28,940
procurement focus than than engineering

00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:30,710
focus but it basically it encodes this

00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:33,320
into an actual government policy that

00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:34,729
says you get better code and so anytime

00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:39,259
they're doing a competitive procurement

00:21:34,729 --> 00:21:40,940
for for software they are essentially

00:21:39,259 --> 00:21:43,039
committing themselves saying if there is

00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,960
an open source option we're not

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,759
requiring that you go that route but we

00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,559
are at least requiring that you consider

00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:50,690
the open source option in your

00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,310
competitive bid process and so little by

00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:54,680
little we're starting to make that known

00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:56,360
and so again this is a this is this is

00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,490
an endeavor an engagement that we're

00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,260
super committed to and excited about and

00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:02,000
you know like I said the president said

00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,890
we were going to do this and what was

00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,990
the second thing he said which was that

00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:07,970
other governments would would get to use

00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:11,230
it and so this is actually a petition

00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:13,400
site that's that's been being built in

00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:14,480
Bulgaria I believe it is and so I don't

00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,330
know if it's online yet but they're

00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:18,710
working on it so so we consider this

00:22:17,330 --> 00:22:20,210
something of a promise kept at this

00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,710
point we have checked off all the boxes

00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:24,710
that the president said we were going to

00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:26,420
check off you know we can go out drink

00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:27,650
our beer or go home and done and you

00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:31,160
know I know you guys want to get to your

00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:32,690
beer but the truth is that's really just

00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,550
the beginning you know we all know this

00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,200
is really just the beginning we kept the

00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:38,750
promise and we went to the next step

00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,610
where do we take it next so I don't know

00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,930
if folks know this but just over a week

00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,880
ago the president issued an executive

00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:46,040
order this was all very exciting in our

00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:49,220
space here that basically says that all

00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:54,650
new government applications platforms

00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:56,510
etc that use big data stores are on the

00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:59,180
president's orders required to have

00:22:56,510 --> 00:23:02,600
those datasets open and machine readable

00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:04,400
by default this the statement goes on

00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,630
longer it obviously addresses a lot of

00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,760
issues like privacy and stuff like that

00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:09,950
but we're legal where you know where

00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,320
feasible we are required to do this

00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:13,850
frankly it's something we've been we've

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,610
been doing you know already for quite

00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,690
some time but why is this important why

00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:19,730
is this important for government

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,680
websites why is this sort of a big deal

00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:25,190
for us to sort of commit and require

00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,300
this machine readability so well for

00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:29,390
that I'm going to go back to the slides

00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:31,100
I showed you earlier now I first of all

00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:33,980
I don't want you to think I'm beating up

00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:35,090
on on these guys from from Hawaii in

00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,920
particular and you'll see why in a

00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:38,360
minute but there's a lot of government

00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:40,160
websites out there like this I'm just

00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:43,900
chosen Hawaii because you know the

00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:43,900
president is totally from there

00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:49,130
but here we have sort of i think what

00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:50,850
you guys would think of as a particular

00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,980
particularly compelling government

00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:55,530
website you know we've got our org chart

00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:57,210
across the top we've got our just our

00:23:55,530 --> 00:24:01,200
hideous font at the title and then we've

00:23:57,210 --> 00:24:05,310
got this giant block of text that tells

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:07,530
us nothing it tells us what the folks

00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:10,860
who wrote this page want us to know

00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:12,030
about the Honolulu DMV it tells you sort

00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,350
of but it but but it doesn't address

00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,210
sort of it doesn't answer the one

00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:17,520
question the one question that you're

00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:19,620
asking right why am I here why is a

00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,570
person going to be on this page why do

00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:23,760
they navigate through sort of customer

00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:25,980
service to licensing and permits

00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,170
division to get to this page of our

00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,370
drivers licenses what wouldn't it be

00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:32,310
great if we kind of could answer that

00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:34,350
question turns out we can it's all right

00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:36,840
there the data you know if we actually

00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:39,270
look at sort of search data for example

00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,340
figure out what is driving people to end

00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:44,070
up on pages it tells us right there why

00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,630
are you there hey here's a hint you're

00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:47,550
on the DMV website on a page about

00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,380
driver's licenses you probably want a

00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,760
driver's license and there's nothing on

00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,530
this page here that really tells you how

00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,450
to get a driver's license it tells you

00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:57,510
what that the only link in fact in here

00:24:54,450 --> 00:25:00,720
is a link to a PDF of a picture of a

00:24:57,510 --> 00:25:01,980
sample driver's license when you get

00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,710
your driver's license users to look like

00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:06,120
so now we shift this and we turn to like

00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:07,920
sort of a more data-driven user

00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,290
experience driven model and it's like we

00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,330
do away with the you know with it with

00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:13,710
the name with the chart across the top

00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:15,300
as it were and it's no longer the

00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:17,490
government essentially saying this was

00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,110
actually done as a partnership with the

00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:21,060
code from America brigade and so they

00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:23,190
took that search data and started to

00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:25,500
simplify it in looking at pages to

00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:28,290
answer the question to address the user

00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:31,080
experience to address why is the person

00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:33,090
on this page to engage with the person

00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:35,160
who needs something from the government

00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:37,800
and that's sort of like a big change you

00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,300
know for them and sort of again like I

00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,010
said I'm not beating up on the folks in

00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,630
Hawaii because they are taking this even

00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:46,560
a step a step farther and this is the

00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:48,180
new hawaii gov site to take them off the

00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,280
hook here this is i know it's got a very

00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,810
kind of windows metro look and feel to

00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:54,120
it but what it does is it goes right to

00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:56,140
our sort of like user user driven

00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:58,360
experience no longer government-driven

00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,070
but citizen driven you live here you

00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,150
have services that you need we're going

00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:02,530
to get you right to them and we're going

00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:04,600
to do it in a way that's easy for you to

00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:08,410
use responsive design it's going to work

00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:10,270
on your phone etc etc so but you know I

00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:12,340
don't know folks saw Jeff Eaton's talk

00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:14,080
yesterday but he was also talking about

00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:17,620
kind of the way to do this is to get

00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:19,690
sort of using api's to abstract your

00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:22,810
experience the user experience from the

00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:24,400
content itself so that really gets us to

00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:26,770
sort of like the next really interesting

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:29,950
question that that should be asked here

00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:33,520
today you guys get pumped up now what's

00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:36,010
the what's the next next big thing api

00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,900
is for white house doctor api's for

00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:44,080
whitehouse.gov what in the heck does

00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:45,970
that mean glad you guys can share that

00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,620
moment the president wants to know you

00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:49,810
know so I'm glad you asked mr. president

00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:53,350
that is an excellent question I'm glad

00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:55,510
you asked that question so folks who

00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:57,280
don't know you probably this is a really

00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:59,470
exciting day for us in the government as

00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,240
well probably don't know this but today

00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:03,250
is the one year birthday of the digital

00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,800
government strategy now the digital

00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:09,760
government strategy was launched by the

00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:12,100
federal CIO and CTO a year ago today and

00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,800
what it is is it instead of as a set of

00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:17,740
directives for government agencies how

00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:19,660
they should approach use of online

00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:21,160
technologies the web open data it was

00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:22,960
essentially the precursor to the

00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,580
executive order that I showed you

00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,230
earlier but I wanted to call it out

00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:28,660
today because the first two directives

00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:29,950
the very first two directives in the

00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:32,890
government strategy digital government

00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:36,250
strategy speak of web AP is not once

00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:37,870
twice twice because Web API is we

00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:39,780
realize our sort of the key to getting

00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:42,640
that space where we can start separating

00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:45,430
the content from the user experience and

00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,440
start looking at the user user activity

00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:49,510
and the user needs to start tailoring

00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,150
that experience to them you know and so

00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:55,120
with that in mind on may first of this

00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:57,460
year we launched an API for White House

00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,400
com this is excuse me for petitions

00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:02,440
Whitehouse gov and this is our first you

00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:04,090
know opening up the data high-value data

00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:07,420
sets within the petitions platform

00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:08,890
itself to let people start start sort of

00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,850
going through that data to actually like

00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,950
start changing and

00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:13,570
agent models engagement experiences

00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:15,250
where we actually take the government

00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:17,380
sort of a step back and release that

00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:19,150
experience let it go out into the

00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:22,600
community itself and let them dictate it

00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:23,890
so this is a you know an API right now

00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,910
would you get with it is you can get

00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:29,049
data on signatures on a given petition

00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:31,059
you know data on all the different

00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:34,000
petitions themselves there's a bulk down

00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:37,090
download functionality we are working on

00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,890
getting response data out as well like I

00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,450
showed you earlier so Greece can now

00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,220
actually have a slide that shows the

00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:44,320
level of engagement in the Death Star

00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,539
petition but before we started building

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,460
this this API it took us quite a while

00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:51,460
because we realized this was like our

00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:53,530
first step into the space of api's with

00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:55,990
a major application at the White House

00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:57,820
we wanted to talk about well as with

00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:59,980
sort of the open-source approach we also

00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:01,570
want to look at what we do is going to

00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:03,669
set a standard for other government

00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:05,440
agencies and we want to like lay it out

00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:07,840
and we knew that the API that we had to

00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,150
build had to be really well thought out

00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:11,650
and really sort of approached properly

00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:13,419
before we could get started to it so we

00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:15,700
came to this notion of a facade pattern

00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:18,070
which is a written about by a guy named

00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,900
Brian Malloy who talks about it it's

00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:23,440
basically sort of the three steps to

00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:26,169
building a usable a really effective API

00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,990
is first you essentially design your

00:29:26,169 --> 00:29:30,490
ideal API in terms of like specking out

00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,650
the space that you want sort of you

00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:35,470
imagine like what you want your URLs to

00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:37,030
be in your query strings etc and then

00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:39,159
you start building against using mock

00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:40,210
data so you can actually start figuring

00:29:39,159 --> 00:29:42,280
out what the experience is going to be

00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:43,870
like and then the third step finally is

00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,940
through like connected into the back end

00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:47,620
and start start building out that way

00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:50,230
that was sort of our first idea to have

00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:52,600
that to have that abstraction barrier

00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:54,130
going in that made it's sort of a little

00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,520
more independent so we're not tying all

00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:59,140
the methods too deeply into the back end

00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,429
and we also talked about something else

00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,100
that Brian Malloy spoke of which is

00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:04,659
called pragmatic rest and I don't want

00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,880
to start any holy wars here into the

00:30:04,659 --> 00:30:11,140
conversation about whether whether rest

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:13,299
is a architectural style or a or an

00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,830
explicit standard or not but we do sort

00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:17,440
of deviate a little bit from what folks

00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:18,760
would consider a fully rest compliant

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,030
standard which is that we put our

00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:24,370
version numbers in the path and we allow

00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:26,750
for dot notation so that

00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:29,060
so that users can kind of tell us you

00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,230
know we honor sort of dauntless notation

00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,360
as well if you put stuff in the header

00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:34,340
but this is much easier because the idea

00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,990
and this is where sort of the pragmatic

00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:38,270
rest and the facade pattern comes in is

00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:39,950
that what we've been talking about a lot

00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:42,500
of folks are talking about at this event

00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:44,000
is user experience right but there's

00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:45,680
also a question here especially at a

00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,090
place like drupalcon which is the

00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,690
developer experience and so if we

00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:52,970
measure the quality of an API by how

00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:54,950
fast and how easy it is for developers

00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:57,020
to to start using and start building

00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:58,280
against and I mean developers outside

00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,440
developers we're going to you know use

00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:02,720
it not not the folks building the API

00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:04,370
itself and so with pragmatic rest we

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,230
give developers these sort of intuitive

00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:09,050
tools to get started where you can even

00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:10,520
sort of like test your methods you know

00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:12,470
just as something as simple as a browser

00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,720
and so we came to these sort of like

00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:19,040
standards that we wanted to use to

00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:22,670
prioritize the developer experience we

00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:24,680
have we have very explicit rules about

00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:26,720
the paths and methods that we use and so

00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:28,910
we we separate essentially nouns from

00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,540
verbs and we say that verbs may never

00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:34,760
ever exist in in a path that the only

00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:36,320
thing in the paths are nouns and like

00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:38,270
filters and those filters all go in

00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:43,690
query strings right and all the verbs

00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:46,070
happen in the HTTP p HTTP methods and

00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:47,180
that's sort of the first thing that we

00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,010
said and kind of I'll just give you kind

00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:50,900
of a counter example which is like this

00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:53,000
is sort of what not to do with our API

00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:55,100
which is to start here you've got like

00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,410
you've got singular nouns you've got you

00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:59,180
know a filter in that third third third

00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:02,780
string there and then of course we have

00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:05,540
we have a verb down there in a path and

00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,760
so why is this bad because you end up

00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,930
with sort of this vegetable soup

00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:11,480
vegetable soup alphabet I'm going with

00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:16,850
vegetable they're not with a vegetable

00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:18,830
soup of URLs like this that not only are

00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:20,330
hard to maintain but it diminishes the

00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:22,370
developer experience you're essentially

00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:24,560
prioritizing your own developers because

00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:26,360
in essence you're sort of making it a

00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:30,350
little bit easier for the folks building

00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:31,970
the API to do that but the folks paying

00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:33,650
the price or the folks are your users

00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:35,810
are your your outside folks who are

00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:36,890
going to be building against this API

00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:38,450
because first of all there's nothing

00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:40,700
intuitive here and you remember we said

00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:42,530
that the measure of an API is how easy

00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,320
it is for outside developers to use it

00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:46,940
you know I every single method have to

00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,250
go and sort of figure it out find the

00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:51,410
documentation etc whereas when you have

00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:53,390
sort of a very explicit straightforward

00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:55,520
standard I can start making inferences

00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:57,680
about other methods from from the

00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:59,900
methods I already know so it just this

00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:02,000
becomes confusing unmaintained and

00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,950
frankly unscalable because you sort of

00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,530
also from a QA perspective have a hard

00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:10,670
time knowing when certain API changes

00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:12,590
will affect other other methods so so we

00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:14,720
took these standards and we we put them

00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:16,130
on github we are evangelizing them as

00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,540
well within governments but it's

00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:19,430
definitely not something that's

00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:21,590
exclusive to the government so we

00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:24,350
welcome you please for kit if you go

00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:26,870
through it issues it's on our github

00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:29,870
page please send us your issues your

00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:33,170
pull requests etc so we put together

00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:35,030
this great API standard and started

00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:36,560
building it and we thought we'd take it

00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:39,020
out for a spin so in February of last

00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:41,780
year something else really excited

00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:45,230
happen we opened up some applications

00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:48,620
and invited a group of engineers to the

00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:50,600
White House for a hackathon now let me

00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,910
just stop for a second and ask you to

00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:55,460
imagine what the experience is like of

00:33:52,910 --> 00:34:02,570
trying to organize an event at the White

00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:04,760
House called a hackathon once we got

00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:06,410
over that hurdle we invited a bunch of

00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:10,100
folks down and the way it went down was

00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:12,410
we like I said invited folks we gave

00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:14,120
them early access to a private data they

00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:16,280
had about nine days of access to the

00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:18,350
documentation the methods itself gave

00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,150
them out keys and essentially got folks

00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:23,000
together in the room to see what could

00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:24,080
start being built with this API and so

00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:27,170
I'm just going to kind of run you a

00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:29,630
little bit through some of the stuff

00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:32,990
that we found things that we thinks

00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:34,520
things that were built this is a just a

00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:37,310
simple kind of thermometer widget that

00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:39,380
folks built that allows you to sort of

00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:41,090
track progress so if I am if I've

00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:43,880
created a petition and I want to promote

00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:45,920
it on my website on my you know my

00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:47,750
Facebook etc I can throw a widget like

00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,920
this up and let's show my friends and

00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:50,900
users etc

00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:53,360
how that petition is doing obviously

00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:54,800
something quite compelling for for folks

00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,440
who want to drive this sort of

00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,120
engagement we also sort of have some

00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:01,010
demographic breakdown stuff so this is

00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:03,290
stuff folks we have I will tell you i'm

00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:05,690
just showing your small sample we

00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:07,070
actually i'm going to give you a URL at

00:35:05,690 --> 00:35:08,960
the end here that you can hit there's a

00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:11,270
whole gallery of the different projects

00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,840
that happened at the hackathon but again

00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:15,800
folks who deal with engagement

00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:17,050
operations folks who actually have

00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,760
campaigns and things like that

00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:21,050
demographics matter you know because you

00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,550
want to know sort of like what your

00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:24,080
constituents you wants we can actually

00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:26,450
use things like this to sort of

00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,130
essentially take the temperature of the

00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:29,930
folks in the dairy various spaces so

00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:32,570
this is you know we got a lot of ideas

00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:34,400
like this for like mapping you know like

00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:36,560
mapping regional behavior to kind of see

00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,680
sort of what you know what issues were

00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,540
important in various spaces word cloud

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:45,230
of issues it's set again this is sort of

00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:46,850
folks taking on the idea of sort of

00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:49,280
pushing out to their own organizations

00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:52,160
their own constituencies sort of how to

00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,290
find new ways to sort of garner

00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,450
participation in the platform get folks

00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:59,150
to sign petitions get movement get

00:35:56,450 --> 00:36:02,960
action call folks to actually engage and

00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:06,170
iterate with us so that was the

00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,750
hackathon and you know like I said we

00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:10,730
launched it live public may first this

00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:13,040
year you can go check it out you can

00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:14,570
start writing you know writing your apps

00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,450
against that your ideas we are actually

00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:18,680
having another hackathon next week in

00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:21,530
fact for the National Day of civic

00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,790
hacking they are getting a little more

00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:26,300
comfortable with the term around the

00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:27,740
White House now unfortunately the

00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,360
application period is closed for that

00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:32,060
but we promise you there will be many

00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:33,860
many more including sort of the part

00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:35,840
that is really the best to come and make

00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:37,520
and mention this yesterday during

00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:39,350
Greece's keynote but the best part is

00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:41,750
really yet to come we have all right

00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:43,070
excuse me our read methods in our API we

00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:46,400
have the ability to start querying the

00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:48,470
data downloading the data etc but the

00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,720
game changer we think is that we are

00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:53,150
launching going to be launching right

00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:55,610
methods for that API we're starting work

00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:57,320
on the beta for it this summer we will

00:36:55,610 --> 00:37:00,020
do a very similar thing to what we did

00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,980
last time open up applications let folks

00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,330
kind of send us in there

00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,550
ideas what they think they'd want to do

00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:06,560
with it and then invite folks to come

00:37:04,550 --> 00:37:08,480
down to the White House to start to

00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:11,690
start sort of playing getting hands-on

00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,130
with this with this API but why it's so

00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:14,450
exciting what is like the big deal here

00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:16,280
this is the role this is where you guys

00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:18,230
come in this is where the folks at

00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,840
drupalcon come into the game here

00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:23,720
because with this with the right methods

00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:25,100
added to the API those folks that i

00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,540
talked about you remember the letter to

00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,609
Santa Claus metaphor that I gave a

00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:31,760
little while ago this is where that

00:37:28,609 --> 00:37:33,740
changes ok we have said ok this you have

00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,420
a platform you already have your own

00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,520
petitions platform you have a

00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:41,150
constituency that you want to talk to a

00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:42,740
user base established well we're going

00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:45,440
to extend the social contract that we've

00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:48,530
already made out to you that if you with

00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,240
your platform and your user base again

00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:53,510
following a certain set of guidelines

00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:58,369
and rules connect your link in your

00:37:53,510 --> 00:38:00,590
platform to our AP is now you get to

00:37:58,369 --> 00:38:01,910
provide for your users the experience

00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:03,500
that you've already established that

00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:05,150
they want and that they're used to and

00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,369
yet their signatures will still come

00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:09,230
into our database so when this goes live

00:38:07,369 --> 00:38:12,500
folks will be able to build applications

00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:16,640
that will you know create signatures

00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:18,470
against our petitions again pass through

00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,660
you know what ever want to do whether

00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:23,540
it's an existing platform today or you

00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:26,180
start wanting to build a new one this is

00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:28,490
taking the user experience essentially

00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:30,710
out out of our hands you know we are no

00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:32,210
longer saying ok where the government we

00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,950
are going to decide what your user

00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:36,109
experiences we were going to say and

00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:38,600
acknowledge forthright that you know

00:38:36,109 --> 00:38:41,119
that folks who were passionate about you

00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:44,690
know social issues economic issues

00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,490
ecological issues you know may desire a

00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:48,260
different user experience from folks who

00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:50,359
you know are passionate about you know

00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:53,450
animal rights issues or gun control

00:38:50,359 --> 00:38:55,310
issues etc and so you know that space is

00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:58,250
already established folks have

00:38:55,310 --> 00:39:00,200
constituencies and user experiences and

00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:02,990
then what comes next because this isn't

00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:06,290
simply just about necessarily existing

00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:08,000
online petitions platforms you know but

00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:10,880
what's next you know we have ideas you

00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:12,619
can you know sign petitions maybe

00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,109
straight out of out of Facebook or

00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:15,400
whatever the next

00:39:14,109 --> 00:39:18,759
she'll networking sites going to be

00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,339
linked in what have you you know and

00:39:18,759 --> 00:39:23,259
then sort of even beyond that like you

00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:24,970
know mobile stuff or in real life I mean

00:39:23,259 --> 00:39:27,819
we're talking about changing user

00:39:24,970 --> 00:39:30,279
experience for folks you know folks of

00:39:27,819 --> 00:39:33,400
the demographic who signed petitions

00:39:30,279 --> 00:39:35,739
online now we're talking about you know

00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:38,829
changing the user experience of going

00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:40,630
shopping right what if we change the

00:39:38,829 --> 00:39:42,279
folks standing out in front of your

00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:44,739
supermarket with your clipboards and

00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:46,299
pens nagging you for your signature what

00:39:44,739 --> 00:39:48,489
if now they have tablets in their hands

00:39:46,299 --> 00:39:49,869
you know and when you're assigning this

00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:51,730
they're nagging you for email address

00:39:49,869 --> 00:39:53,950
instead of your signature but all the

00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:56,380
same now those signatures are going

00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:58,390
straight into straight into a platform

00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:01,119
where there is a commitment there is a

00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:04,960
social contract that that signature that

00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:06,400
email is not going just in blindly over

00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,200
the fence a letter to Santa Claus it's

00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,660
actually going to folks who have

00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:13,239
committed to engaging with the folks who

00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:15,400
sign that petition so what comes next

00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:17,230
they're really that's up to the folks in

00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,970
this room that's up to the folks at this

00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:20,710
conference that's up to the folks that

00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:22,660
we want to engage with and we are you

00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:24,970
know excited and committed to see like

00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:26,529
stuff we haven't even thought of yet you

00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:28,119
know stuff that maybe you haven't even

00:40:26,529 --> 00:40:31,269
thought of yet the stuff that we can do

00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:32,890
with this you know I still get chills

00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:34,989
when I talk about it I think we think

00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:38,230
this is the key to the longevity of the

00:40:34,989 --> 00:40:39,730
platform you know so to kind of tie it

00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:42,819
all together this is an evolution that

00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:44,529
we've been through from that old single

00:40:42,819 --> 00:40:47,289
big block of text with the hideous font

00:40:44,529 --> 00:40:50,980
you know around to actually shifting

00:40:47,289 --> 00:40:53,319
away from from simple content production

00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:54,880
and simply us driving the experience

00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:56,410
driving the content I mean it's still

00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,749
there we produce a lot of content all

00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:01,359
day long on the website but it's just

00:40:58,749 --> 00:41:02,980
this is changing to say okay looking at

00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:05,710
it from the perspective not of the

00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:07,690
government saying here's what we feel we

00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:08,980
want to say to you here's what we feel

00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,960
the experience should be like and

00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:13,089
shifting it away from us and each

00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:17,650
iteration along this step you know

00:41:13,089 --> 00:41:19,480
through that that improved development

00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:21,579
methodology through reuse through these

00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:23,950
improved applications each step along

00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:25,359
the way we're increasing not just the

00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:26,570
quality of the experience but we're also

00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,310
increasing

00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:30,770
return on taxpayer investment frankly

00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:34,700
that this this is you know this is your

00:41:30,770 --> 00:41:37,130
tax dollars being spent on on evolving a

00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,840
process that's actually like you know

00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:41,000
not simply that you're paying for code

00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:42,470
to get reused which is awesome you know

00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,690
in and of itself because you're getting

00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:47,420
you know extra extra value for that

00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:50,360
dollar but actually this is being spent

00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:52,820
to add value to the experience that you

00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,140
have when you when you interact with

00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,910
government services and this is

00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:58,640
something obviously like I said we are

00:41:55,910 --> 00:41:59,930
committed to we are we are pushing you

00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,880
know and evangelizing throughout the

00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:03,680
government and you know like I said you

00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:06,970
guys play the role in this so please i

00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:10,190
welcome you check out our github page

00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:13,250
follow us on twitter it's wh web White

House web these are our developers pages

00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:20,170
whitehouse gov developers shows sort of

00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:22,700
the broad span of of our open source

00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,990
stuff we've committed to that raised

00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:26,150
where you can see all of the different

00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:29,780
modules we've committed on drupal org

00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:31,940
all of the repos in github and then if

00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:34,340
you want to know stuff specific about

00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:35,750
the petitions API you can check out

00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:37,430
petitions that whitehouse.gov /

00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:39,530
developers that's where all the

00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:41,920
documentation is that's where the

00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:45,590
gallery of the different projects are

00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,760
etc so honestly and also email me I mean

00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:48,920
I want to know I want to hear from you

directly if you know if it's like what

00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:52,220
if you have ideas if there's things that

00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:54,770
you want to do you need help fork in the

00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:58,430
code please like us you know let us know

00:42:54,770 --> 00:43:01,430
so with that I really thank everyone for

00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:04,520
for their time and today hope everyone

00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:06,980
is having a good drupalcon hope you guys

00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:08,390
get the things the food in the drink

00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:10,490
that you're after this evening so I

00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:15,130
think we've got about 15 minutes here

00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:15,130
folks want to want to have any questions

00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:30,430
first of all thank you because it was

00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:32,470
white house using Drupal that enabled my

00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:33,880
team to bring in Drupal to the federal

00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:35,650
agency that we support so thank you very

00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,350
much for that can you say which agency

00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:39,820
you're not allowed um DHS Oh fantastic

00:43:38,350 --> 00:43:41,560
all right the other thing is we're

00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:44,320
working on AP is there so I was curious

00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:46,270
about how or what technology you're

00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:47,800
actually using to run your AP is and how

00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:51,370
you manage data governance like

00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,870
identifying your high-value data sets so

00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:55,690
that's still something will work in

00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:57,900
progress we are you know the technology

00:43:55,690 --> 00:44:00,070
itself is stuff that we've built into

00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:01,120
built into the platform itself i'm

00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:02,620
getting sneakers because we've got

00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,990
engineers up front who actually know the

00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:06,840
answers to these questions but in terms

00:44:04,990 --> 00:44:11,050
of like identifying the the high-value

00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:12,880
data sets for the petitions platform

00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:15,570
specifically it was actually sort of a

00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:18,480
lot more just intuitive because it was

00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:21,040
you know the folks that we would see

00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,450
sort of asking us questions and sort of

00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,940
a lot of the press that we were getting

00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:27,700
around around the application was

00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:29,500
essentially folks doing things that you

00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:33,100
can do with the API but doing it by

00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:34,900
scraping scraping the the site itself so

00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:36,940
it was very pretty easy to identify the

00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:39,130
high value having value data in

00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:40,690
petitions as we go forward I think a lot

00:44:39,130 --> 00:44:42,550
of that is we're going to be looking at

00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:44,590
things like what are the you know what

00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:45,940
are the content types that folks are you

00:44:44,590 --> 00:44:47,710
know content that folks are after the

00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:51,010
most often what are they like I showed

00:44:47,710 --> 00:44:52,420
you in that in that that Hawaiian site

00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:54,640
is to like look at your you know first

00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:56,710
step is just look at search search data

00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:59,410
look at what people are looking for why

00:44:56,710 --> 00:45:01,870
are they coming to your site sure and I

00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:04,900
can ask me more later about the specific

00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:07,630
technologies hi thank you for a

00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:09,430
presentation a bad question essentially

00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:11,200
just a bad question I don't believe you

00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:12,640
yeah what happens when the

00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,490
administration a new administration

00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:18,210
comes in that is not a bad question at

00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:20,290
all thank you for asking that question

00:45:18,210 --> 00:45:22,840
it's one of my favorite questions I get

00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:25,570
it every time I you know I always hope

00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:28,330
that someone will ask it it's a great

00:45:25,570 --> 00:45:30,220
question it is this is my answer is the

00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:31,870
API this is the question we get pretty

00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:34,200
much more than anything else the answer

00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:36,380
is is the API and the right API so

00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:39,119
typically because it's our belief that

00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:41,400
when an ecosystem builds up around this

00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:43,349
when when folks like you know the NRA

00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:45,390
and you know the Sierra Club and so

00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:48,270
forth start building you know investing

00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:51,510
their engineering resources into this

00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:52,530
platform like it's not going to be

00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:54,960
something that the next administration

00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:56,820
can just turn off right there's this

00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,550
social contract has to pervade because

00:45:56,820 --> 00:46:01,680
people are committed to it on now once

00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:03,089
we get these api is out and rolling it's

00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,040
not just the government being committed

00:46:03,089 --> 00:46:07,320
to it but it's actually folks in the

00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,270
open source space you know committed to

00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,880
it and it's there's too much investment

00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:13,589
to be able to just turn it off without

00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,690
without serious consequences so my

00:46:13,589 --> 00:46:23,430
answer to that is the API so please

00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:25,230
start building ass thank you hi can you

00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:27,690
talk about the biggest point of

00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:30,119
resistance that was maybe encountered

00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:36,210
with the either the API or the petitions

00:46:30,119 --> 00:46:38,819
project uh yeah I mean I can say there

00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:40,589
was very little resistance to to the API

00:46:38,819 --> 00:46:44,069
it's the the only resistance really to

00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:44,880
the API was that we had a lot of you

00:46:44,069 --> 00:46:47,250
know there was still a lot of

00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:51,000
functionality in the site that we wanted

00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:53,160
to to to fix and and and revise and

00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,319
improve so it was the only real

00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:57,180
resistance in the API was sort of the

00:46:55,319 --> 00:46:58,950
kind of ever constant sort of debate of

00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:00,540
like which feature to reprioritize and

00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:02,400
there were a lot of features that we

00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:04,140
wanted but we kind of committed to the

00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:05,250
API itself part of the reason like I

00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,619
said is that there wasn't much

00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:10,079
resistance to building an API is because

00:47:07,619 --> 00:47:11,849
you know we have directives from you

00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,200
know from the administration to start

00:47:11,849 --> 00:47:15,210
building ap is and that's a very

00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:17,670
compelling a compelling tool to have in

00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:20,660
your back pocket in terms of resistance

00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:23,099
to the to the petitions platform itself

00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:25,440
it's the responses honestly it's like

00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:28,470
folks were really worried about what

00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:31,230
sort of things we're going to get get

00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:32,579
petitions and get you know what what

00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:34,680
will essentially what were they agreeing

00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:36,180
to and they foresaw a lot of a lot of

00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,040
situations and frankly some of those are

00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:40,410
situations that that have transpired but

00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:43,140
folks you know are committed to that

00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:45,119
engagement and you know and are taking

00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:47,069
it sort of with the with the import as

00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,970
expected and so you know I think it's

00:47:47,069 --> 00:47:49,349
okay to

00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:51,810
so worried about being called out on the

00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:53,460
mat on some specific issues and you know

00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:55,890
frankly I think that's our obligation to

00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,420
call call folks out on the mat and so

00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:59,190
it's been and I think the folks who've

00:47:57,420 --> 00:48:01,020
been in the administration responding

00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:02,970
these petitions as well I've actually

00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:04,830
find in a really positive experience and

00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:06,960
we've had at least a few you know a few

00:48:04,830 --> 00:48:09,150
instances where these petitions have you

00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,230
know have changed changed minds here and

00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:12,000
there and you know there's been at least

00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:16,109
a few small policy changes that have

00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:19,080
that have come from them anyone else

00:48:16,109 --> 00:48:20,849
yeah okay do you mind you know here's a

00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,780
mic here and I know they're recording

00:48:20,849 --> 00:48:30,090
they want to get the camera the

00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:37,170
questions on this one yeah thanks don't

00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:43,290
throw that goes same as me all right

00:48:37,170 --> 00:48:45,560
it's not just me ask the question I'll

00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:45,560
repeat it

00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:56,180
you mentioned looking at search data as

00:48:52,460 --> 00:49:00,740
a way to get started tell me more about

00:48:56,180 --> 00:49:03,020
how the big ideas come about just like

00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:09,610
what else do you look at besides search

00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:11,480
data for instance you know I wish I I

00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:14,240
wish I could give you a better answer

00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:15,920
it's not not really the part of the

00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:33,650
project that I'm involved with in fact

00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:36,500
is yet yeah there's also a great site at

00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:38,120
data UK British and they actually talked

00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,500
about kind of design principles and sort

00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:42,470
of they look at some ways to help

00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:44,900
because it's really also can be very you

00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:47,240
know site centric specific in terms of

00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:48,710
how you know what your methods for

00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,600
identifying high-value data but they

00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:52,190
they talked about some concepts of how

00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:55,220
to how to look at those high-value data

00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:59,090
sets to identify apologize i can't give

00:49:55,220 --> 00:50:02,390
you a better answer for that have you

00:49:59,090 --> 00:50:05,330
guys considered publishing the revision

00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:08,000
logs of like whitehouse gov because I

00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:09,080
think for historical research years down

00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:13,310
the road that would be really nice to

00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:16,100
see the the progress of the narratives

00:50:13,310 --> 00:50:19,550
like the White House would regret like

00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:22,430
show on its website and right now it's

00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:24,590
up to libraries and digital archives to

00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:25,700
basically scrape sites and and find out

00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:27,470
what that is but they only get small

00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:29,530
snapshots of that and i would think

00:50:27,470 --> 00:50:32,270
that'd be a really good model to for

00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:34,190
like legislation to do like even like

00:50:32,270 --> 00:50:35,540
post legislations our github so that you

00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:37,220
can see revision models and stuff like

00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:39,950
that of the actual documents themselves

00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:44,180
who touch them whatnot thank you that's

00:50:39,950 --> 00:50:46,190
a great question um I'll sort of try to

00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:48,560
take it in order when just really

00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:49,520
quickly when you said revision logs you

00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,700
actually mean the revision of the

00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:55,370
content right okay unfortunately I can't

00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:58,100
sort of say too much about that like I

00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:59,250
said on the platform guy the decisions

00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,860
about sort of how that

00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:03,840
and is the guy with the you know you saw

00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:05,520
on stage or on the screen yesterday um

00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:07,200
but no I do agree with you but the

00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,830
question about sort of like things like

00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:13,040
like putting putting them you know

00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:16,350
putting legislation on github that is a

00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:19,080
pretty much constant like I can't think

00:51:16,350 --> 00:51:21,720
of a meetup I've been to especially like

00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:23,670
you know in the DC space of like that is

00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:25,560
a wouldn't it be awesome if idea that

00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:27,210
we've had and it's out there actually I

00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:30,930
don't it's not at the federal level but

00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:32,370
i think that they the city of the

00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:36,240
District of Columbia actually just put

00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:38,760
its code and code sorry in the in the

00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:40,470
legal sense not the software sense so

00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:42,660
the actual like laws of the city of the

00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:44,370
District of Columbia I think are now on

00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:46,620
github or at least there in the public

00:51:44,370 --> 00:51:50,220
space and so as they evolve I think

00:51:46,620 --> 00:51:51,780
that's going to happen so I we all want

00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:54,840
to see that happen and I think sort of

00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:56,100
if I had to sort of i really don't sort

00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:58,200
of like no like the feature of that

00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:01,950
content directly i think those are great

00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:04,050
ideas there are also sort of there are

00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:06,210
laws that sort of require certain things

00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:08,160
and prevent other things the

00:52:06,210 --> 00:52:10,860
presidential Records Act I can tell you

00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:12,840
is not not an easy burden to shoulder

00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:14,850
and that's sort of every every piece of

00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:17,790
communication that i have is governed by

00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:19,320
that so it's not an easy question but it

00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:20,880
is i think there are a lot of what i

00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:24,060
will say is that there are a lot of

00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:26,820
folks sort of in this technical space a

00:52:24,060 --> 00:52:28,710
lot of really really smart folks in in

00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:30,450
DC working in the government sort of who

00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:33,810
do have these ideas and are committed to

00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:40,050
to to to iteratively getting to places

00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:42,240
like that thanks everyone i really

00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:43,480
