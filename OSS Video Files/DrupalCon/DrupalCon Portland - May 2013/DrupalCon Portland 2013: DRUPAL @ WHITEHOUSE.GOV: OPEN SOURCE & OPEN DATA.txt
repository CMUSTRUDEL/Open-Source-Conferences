Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: DRUPAL @ WHITEHOUSE.GOV: OPEN SOURCE & OPEN DATA
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	Last year, President Obama launched an initiative encouraging federal agencies to take part in and contribute to open source communities and requiring them
to make government data freely available in machine-readable formats. The White House is working to meet these expectations, using Drupal for WhiteHouse.gov and the We the People petitions system, contributing code, releasing APIs for important datasets, and working to build communities around these products. At this session, we'll discuss how the We the People system works, it's future, and the lessons we've learned about open source and open data projects in the federal space.
