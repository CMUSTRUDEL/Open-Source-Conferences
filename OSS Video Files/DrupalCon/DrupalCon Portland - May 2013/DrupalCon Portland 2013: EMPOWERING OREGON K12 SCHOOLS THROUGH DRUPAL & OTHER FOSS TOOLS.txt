Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: EMPOWERING OREGON K12 SCHOOLS THROUGH DRUPAL & OTHER FOSS TOOLS
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	The Oregon Virtual School District (ORVSD) is a learning platform that has been developed in collaboration with the Oregon Department of Education and the OSU Open Source Lab starting in 2005. In its core, ORVSD is a free resource for online teaching and learning designed to promote the use of technology in Oregon classrooms. Its platform is primarily driven by providing Drupal and Moodle sites for nearly every K12 school in the state of Oregon.

This session will cover a brief history of how it started, explain the infrastructure behind the program, some interesting lessons we learned along the way and finally briefly mention how we plan to scale the services in the future. Our hope is that this platform can be useful for other organization and proven to be a huge value to teachers and students alike.

so you notice there's four names on the

00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,240
here and there's only two people up here

00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:10,559
yeah the joys of being in operation so

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,880
we had an operational issue so lance and

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,559
Rudy are going to be off dealing with

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,570
making sure the systems stay up rather

00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:16,949
than talking to everybody but we've got

00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:19,109
other information then we know all the

00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:21,270
goodies so you probably won't even

00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:23,760
notice I just wanted to see didn't wanna

00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:31,309
confuse anybody on that Greg is at least

to keep you guys waiting on board good

00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,480
afternoon happy Thursday hope everybody

00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:48,739
had a good lunch my name is Greg lon

00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,989
chay um this is ken let over here hello

00:00:48,739 --> 00:00:54,870
i was up until recently part of the open

00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:57,300
source lab team and I'm kind of the

00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,890
person who started this whole project

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,340
and then handed off to can and the rest

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,049
of the team lance and Rudy at the OSL so

00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:07,500
we're going to talk a bit about this

00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:09,570
project and tell you where we were where

00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,070
we have we got started where we went and

00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:13,320
then kind of dive into the technology

00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,790
stack a little bit and then talk about

00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,100
where we're going or where they're going

00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:21,030
i should say i still think we have my

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,650
project still I guess so before I really

00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,030
get started how many folks here so I

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,400
show of hands are involved in education

00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:31,409
in some way high road k12 right on I

00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,780
love it okay I my people are here this

00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:39,750
is good um second question is how many

00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:43,860
you are not from Oregon yeah oh good new

00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:48,479
people all right it's gonna be fun um so

00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:51,000
just a quick outline um so at lance and

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,460
Rudy are the two gentlemen that aren't

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,259
here they're the operations team lance

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,350
manages the open-source lab down at OS

00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,340
Oregon State University so he and I were

00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:01,049
the ones were kind of the leadership

00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,189
team of the lab during my tenure there I

00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,899
handed everything off to him and he's

00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,610
doing a great job with it rudy is what

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,819
is one of our system administrators down

00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,259
there ken heads up the software

00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,140
development side of the open-source lab

00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:17,100
so I just kind of give you a scope

00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:18,209
on that and I was the program manager

00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,300
and founder of the virtual school

00:02:18,209 --> 00:02:23,190
district project that came in designed

00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,480
the initial system that these poor guys

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:29,250
now I have to go clean up the mess that

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:31,560
I made which we'll talk about later so

00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,620
actually before I even get this far I

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,740
just two guys give you all kind of some

00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:41,600
scope and scale here Oregon has roughly

00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:45,180
three million people in it we have 200

00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:49,170
198 school districts about 1,200 schools

00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:52,620
in the state 550,000 students so we're

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:54,060
not a big state heavily rural we have

00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,050
you know very strong concentration of

00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,410
people here and put the Portland metro

00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:01,950
area and then lots and lots of very very

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:03,750
small school districts so just can you

00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:05,459
give you an idea this is so it's an

00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,590
interesting mixture we have some large

00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,690
urban districts and we have some very

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:14,280
rural districts and so it's kind of an

00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:16,769
interesting challenge um so back in 2005

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,090
I keep stepping away from the mic I like

00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:22,459
to walk when I'm talking I wish I had a

00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:24,959
laugh so back in 2005 a study was done

00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:28,170
that made it up way its way up into the

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,760
legislature that ranked Oregon 46th in

00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:32,579
the nation for a technology adoption in

00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,220
the classroom now the study i think was

00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:36,930
flawed because they did things like they

00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,049
dinged the state for not having a

00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,730
central online virtual school when in

00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:44,220
fact they were like nine of them around

00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:46,829
the state so you know I think the

00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,420
metrics were flawed but regardless these

00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:51,329
made it to the legislature and the

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:54,000
legislature you know oh my god we can't

00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:59,370
have this happen and completely flipped

00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,959
out there we go so they did what

00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,079
legislators like to do they pass the law

00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,160
um and you're welcome to look this up

00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:08,519
it's very simple it's actually really

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:10,590
easy to read um basically just said the

00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,769
State Department of Education shall

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,959
build a virtual learning online school

00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:18,959
infrastructure to improve technology

00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:22,800
adoption in the classrooms interestingly

00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,910
enough that's all they did so this was

00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,350
very different this is kind of a

00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:27,240
surprise to us

00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,610
and that they didn't actually dictate to

00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,500
the department education how to do that

00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,270
they just said here's 2.2 million

00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:37,650
dollars for the next biennium go make

00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:39,660
some magic happen which I am eternally

00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:41,370
grateful for because this could have

00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:44,040
been a much very very different project

00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:45,630
if that had been the case so the

00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:48,510
department so this created the Oregon

00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,920
Virtual School District now we were

00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,330
given that name by the legislature

00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:53,280
what's actually written into the law as

00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:54,840
I'll talk a little bit later 8 is

00:04:53,280 --> 00:05:02,850
neither a school nor a district but

00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:04,830
that's okay so turn vacation suddenly

00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:06,570
had this huge lump of money and you know

00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:08,640
the part of education is primarily a

00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:10,290
regulatory and research agency you know

00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,150
they generate statistics they make sure

00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,770
you know statewide standards are up to

00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,690
date they manage testing systems things

00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,070
like that they don't do a lot of

00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,170
technology other than some data

00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:22,320
warehousing you know and reporting and

00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:23,810
things like that so they're kind of

00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:26,040
scratching their heads a little bit gone

00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:28,890
okay we need to do this but we're not

00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,420
quite sure how unfortunately there was a

00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:32,670
visionary in the Department of Education

00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,110
a fellow named Steve Nelson who

00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,550
unfortunately is a very uncommon name

00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,570
and good luck finding him but if you

00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,690
want to know why I know how to get ahold

00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:41,730
of him up happy didn't put you in touch

00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:43,490
was aware of the activities at the

00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,750
open-source lab he was aware of the

00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:46,770
strength of open-source he had actually

00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,060
been working in state government and

00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:50,370
other groups dealing with open source

00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,800
stuff and realized wait a minute we need

00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,960
open source to do this and I think this

00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,660
is key because he came to the open

00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,200
source lab and said okay we have this

00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:06,330
need can you guys help build it yay

00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:07,860
geeks to the rescue so he came to me he

00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,420
and I had had a previous relationship we

00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,670
knew each other we we'd work together in

00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:13,140
the past he said I need your help can

00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,340
you help me build this and I've been

00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,700
working with the community colleges and

00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:18,900
the universities here in Oregon I'm

00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,880
working on some distance learning

00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:23,370
applications things like that and I said

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,870
ooh this sounds like fun yeah let's

00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:32,310
build some fun stuff so let's get to a

00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:33,720
few definitions here first as I said at

00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:37,490
the Oregon virtual school district as

00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,490
neither a school nor district

00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,190
doesn't employ any teachers doesn't

00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:42,870
grant any credit doesn't have any

00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,690
classrooms anywhere and they feeling the

00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:48,090
bricks and mortar sense and this is one

00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:49,199
thing I heard a lot when I initially was

00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:51,330
getting started on the project now I was

00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,250
out talking to teachers and schools I go

00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:54,479
out there and I say hey I'm Greg I'm

00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,620
working with the Oregon Virtual School

00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,949
District I've got all this great stuff

00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,919
for you what do you need and they said

00:06:58,949 --> 00:07:06,780
oh great another unfunded mandate and

00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:10,590
I'm like what do million dollars what

00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:13,590
you talking about so no actually it is

00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:15,060
it's a funded unmanned eight it's here

00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:17,639
one of the things that was actually

00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,199
included in law the law said you may not

00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,289
charge the schools for the services

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,710
provided by these systems okay open

00:07:22,289 --> 00:07:27,719
source great no problem we got at so it

00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:29,400
has actually funded it still is funded

00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:32,210
so this though it was originally funded

00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:35,250
in 2006 it's still being funded today

00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:36,569
I'm about six months out of date on the

00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,770
current budget status of it but I

00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:40,080
believe it's been funded for the next

00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:44,909
biennium to guess it has okay thank you

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:46,560
again and so we realized okay we're

00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:48,900
geeks throw technology at it's going to

00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,400
work right no no no no no we these are

00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,990
teachers were dealing with these are

00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,240
human beings as you know talking about

00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:56,639
the keynote this morning you know these

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,590
these messy humans you know they mess

00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,909
everything up we knew that we couldn't

00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:02,849
just throw a bunch of technology at it

00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:05,099
and make it work so we also engaged with

00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:06,629
the local education service districts to

00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:10,229
say we need a training team we need a

00:08:06,629 --> 00:08:12,870
help desk we need support we need

00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:14,759
content you know we can't just throw a

00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,940
throw a website up there and expect them

00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:22,560
to just use it um that's out of date

00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:25,110
there should be six school years but

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,960
it's grown just a little bit we started

00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:32,010
out with it's just a few and it's kind

00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,270
of exponentially virally expanded and I

00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:35,940
can kind of I'll talk a little bit later

00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:38,579
about how that happened and some of the

00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,539
things that worked and didn't work and

00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:41,039
actually I think then hundred eighty

00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:42,060
thousand users is about six months old

00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,550
too so I think it's quite a bit higher

00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:48,510
than that now probably over 200,000 now

00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:51,150
no no these are user accounts there's

00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:52,440
some squish in those numbers

00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:53,490
these are both staff and students we

00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,100
didn't eliminate between staff and

00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:57,330
students there and also there's a it's

00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,680
kind of a sliding window because

00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,910
students you know may come in for a

00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,590
corridor and then not being there four

00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:10,110
quarters so that's the aggregate number

00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:12,000
of users so Ella Bache XKCD sorry I have

00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:13,260
to use it in all my stalks whether you

00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,610
guys like it or not so feel free to

00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:19,590
throw things at me um we did a lot of

00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,150
thinking actually the sandwich shop

00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:22,650
right over here I'm turned around on my

00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:26,250
question rhetorician just a block from

00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:27,450
here so a friend of mine and I sat down

00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,520
and we actually sketched down on a

00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:31,890
napkin what we wanted to build so you

00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,770
know I got its start you know 100 yards

00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:36,360
from here I've and we started thinking

00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,860
about okay who are these people who are

00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,360
we going to be talking to and who do we

00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,800
knew who are the key stakeholders we

00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,050
need to get on board with this to make

00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,520
this thing a success so that we can

00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,780
really make a fundamental difference

00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:50,340
with what's happening in these

00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:51,570
classrooms out there in the world so we

00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,310
knew we had to get the administrators on

00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:54,600
board I mean without the administrative

00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,740
support the teachers are going to be

00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,340
able to do anything because they're

00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,450
they're not going to you know we had to

00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:03,120
get the teachers out there and we know

00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:05,310
teachers are incredibly busy people we

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,690
know that if I don't hand a teacher a

00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:08,730
tool that they can use in the classroom

00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:10,950
tomorrow they're going to go oh how nice

00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,840
and walk away you know it needs to be

00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:14,790
something that is instantaneously usable

00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:16,020
and intuitive enough that they don't

00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:19,890
have to spend a lot of time learning how

00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:21,990
to use it and then we acknowledge that

00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,760
okay district IT especially in school

00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:27,120
districts are perennially horribly

00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,470
underfunded and we knew that if we did

00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,580
anything that made more work for them

00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,560
they were going to come after us with

00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:33,650
torches and pitchforks so we knew that

00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:37,500
these are kind of our key stakeholders

00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:40,410
and the last bit here is in education

00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:41,610
especially six seven years ago open

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:45,270
source was not particularly well known

00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:47,820
at the k-12 level so you know they had

00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:49,620
this kind of him if they even knew of it

00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,240
at all it was some you know long haired

00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,880
bearded hippy and their coding Lee in

00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:57,090
their basement wait oh yeah they're

00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:58,320
right it's fine really so we needed to

00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,090
have a little bit of Education about

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,830
what is this kind of fuzzy wonky a weird

00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:04,130
hippie open-source thing that we're

00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,130
dealing with

00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:13,260
so this is what we used I love this

00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:15,510
slide its alphabet soup only yummier so

00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,250
most of these tools are pretty standard

00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,900
stuff you know Drupal is a major

00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,730
component of it we built of the central

00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:24,540
portal on Drupal that linked out to

00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:26,670
everything else Moodle everything was

00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,830
built on originally on Apache Mahara

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:33,510
which is a variant of Moodle that does

00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:34,860
eportfolio work wordpress PHP Linux that

00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,940
funny little blob in the middle later is

00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,670
good Eddie which I'll talk about in a

00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:40,110
little bit and jenkins so that's kind of

00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:42,510
the stack we built it started very

00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:44,400
simple with just moodle and drupal its

00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,560
kind of accreted other things as

00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:51,990
requests have come in for this that and

00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:54,570
the other thing so I'm going to dive

00:11:51,990 --> 00:11:56,220
into some of the technology details here

00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:58,290
first of all how many folks here are

00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:00,540
kind of you know technical administrator

00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:04,590
or you know in the IT department type

00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:05,850
people okay great so I wasn't sure what

00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:07,950
the audience was going to be so I wanted

00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,750
to have some tech details and we can I

00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:11,310
have plenty of time for questions and

00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:12,900
things like that so we can dive down

00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:15,000
into the guts of it if you want to know

00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:17,070
how the gory details of how this was all

00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,980
built so I'll start kind of at the high

00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:23,570
level and then if we if we need to dive

00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,570
down i can i'll be very happy to do so

00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:31,020
so since of the open-source lab at osu

00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:33,480
we specialize in hosting that's what we

00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:37,140
do we host virtual machines and physical

00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:40,350
hardware for open source projects this

00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,850
is not too different so we did what we

00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:45,360
knew you know we fired up a

00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:48,570
virtualization cluster using ganeti if I

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,800
fired up a few blade servers started out

00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:52,170
I should we start out with two physical

00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,720
servers which frightening Lee enough are

00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,980
still in service and still grinding away

00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,070
they're happy I'm not going to touch

00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,170
them I throw through some blades into

00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,330
the mix got some back-end database

00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,610
servers going and then just started kind

00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:10,200
of growing that cluster as the as the

00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:12,540
project grew originally we were doing

00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,800
local storage as the system grew we

00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,740
needed to start getting into network

00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,840
file systems things like that so we

00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,340
gluster for that it's been a mixed

00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:22,310
blessing it's worked well it's easy to

00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:25,040
configure performance not the best but

00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:27,080
you know with some tweaking it was it

00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,490
was again good enough which a lot of

00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,790
this a lot of what I did especially

00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:35,450
early on was good enough and that's kind

00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:37,670
of key I think running everything on

00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,950
originally in gentoo newer systems are

00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:41,300
now running on centos doesn't really

00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:42,440
matter it's agnostic you can throw but

00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:46,100
if I heck we want in there it's all

00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:49,280
Linux doesn't matter and then last but

00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,810
absolutely not least is as configuration

00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,030
management originally using CF engine

00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:55,570
did some stuff in puppet and are now in

00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:57,860
the process of migrating into chef and

00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:00,500
without that we never would have been

00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:02,840
able to go this far because you know I

00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,610
was literally a one for one person

00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,260
project for the first four and a half

00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:07,760
maybe five years of the project I was

00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,500
doing everything I was doing a coding I

00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,300
was doing this administration I had

00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,490
assistance from the team of the OSL for

00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,350
supporting the physical hardware but I

00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:16,370
was doing everything including you know

00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:18,650
some of the training and things like

00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,090
that so I just did not have time to be

00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:21,920
messing around with boxes so

00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,120
configuration management I can write the

00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,610
config once and push it out to all the

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,780
boxes was the only way I could possibly

00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:36,320
not have more gray hair than I already

00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:37,640
do so we started small two boxes there

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,700
were decent boxes they weren't huge you

00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:43,480
know quad cores nothing huge they're

00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,740
still grinding away frighteningly enough

00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,180
but it was it was sufficient for what we

00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,800
needed we just had a few vhosts we had

00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,770
to know a couple of databases nothing

00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,360
fancy but very quickly we started

00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:54,590
getting some big sites on there we had a

00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,260
large school district or friends from

00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,220
salem-keizer over here came in third

00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,810
largest school district in the state

00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:03,290
wanted to put their website on the

00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:06,440
system fantastic great suddenly we were

00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:08,060
getting 20,000 30,000 40,000 hit today

00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,540
where we were had been getting you know

00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:12,890
a few hundred so immediately we had to

00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,680
start figuring out okay I wouldn't me to

00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:17,630
do through some caching in there started

00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,060
going to multiple back-end studied going

00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:21,410
to you know network file system brought

00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:24,440
up a nice cozy appliance which I'll talk

00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:25,640
about in a little bit and so we started

00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,170
segmenting things out a little bit

00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,680
because we wanted each district has

00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,810
different needs each school

00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,100
different needs and so we started wanted

00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:34,350
to separate things out so that we could

00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,810
customize things per district so that we

00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,160
could match we could sink to their

00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:39,029
particular single sign-on environment

00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,680
you know they're using man you know

00:15:39,029 --> 00:15:43,040
Active Directory or whatever we wanted

00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:46,620
to be able to be able to hook into that

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,910
and so thing you know it we had kind of

00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,670
this infrastructural scope creep

00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,660
happening things kind of started

00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:54,570
expanding and we had these one-offs

00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,830
popping up here and there which really

00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:57,480
helped us in the beginning and got us

00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,920
the adoption we needed we got they got

00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,360
the users out there we got them using

00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:05,970
the system which means the goal the

00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:08,130
project was was being met but it became

00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:09,540
more and more and more of a management

00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,740
problem because everything was a little

00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,820
bit different and it was all stuck here

00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,230
in my head and I was the only one

00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:19,170
running and I can do forget things yeah

00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:22,339
my brain is Swiss cheese so recently in

00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:24,420
the past year started really looking at

00:16:22,339 --> 00:16:25,560
consolidating and rebuilding the

00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:29,430
infrastructure any much more

00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:31,230
standardized forms so that you know one

00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:32,700
no one person is a single point of

00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:35,220
failure it's not all stuck in my head or

00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,720
so in a document somewhere but that the

00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,980
rest of the team at the open-source lab

00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,080
whether it be the student workers that

00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,730
they are the other full-time staff can

00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,900
actually work on the system plus we

00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:44,730
wanted to build in some more redundancy

00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:48,630
because we had multiple points single

00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:49,860
points of failure in the system so we

00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:51,209
started building out the same structure

00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,970
it's actually still on the same physical

00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:56,190
hardware it's still on those virtualized

00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:59,060
nodes aangan Eddie but you know doing

00:16:56,190 --> 00:17:02,190
things like H a proxy for load balancing

00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:04,050
running multiple redundant web nodes

00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:06,329
where all of the site's live on all the

00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:08,429
web nodes so that rather than segmenting

00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:09,600
them out by school or district we put

00:17:08,429 --> 00:17:10,890
them all in the same pool because

00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,179
they're all really need a lot of the

00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:14,189
same resources and we did the

00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:15,839
customization and at other levels rather

00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:17,280
than at the per machine level which

00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,829
saved a lot of headaches that also made

00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,179
things a lot easier for both scalability

00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:22,380
you know things are stunning slow down

00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:24,650
through another web node into the mix

00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,150
fire it up we're done not a lot of work

00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:28,079
it also allowed us to do maintenance and

00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,340
things like that we could do rolling

00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,350
updates take a note out of the rotation

00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:34,020
update it put it back in take the next

00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:37,250
one out update it put it back in can you

00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,250
guess where a lot of segments here

00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:42,880
expanded started using more network file

00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,770
systems this is where we really got into

00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,120
gluster and studied using cluster SS for

00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,320
shared files between all those nodes

00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,490
because we had to have all the same

00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,440
files on all the same notes because we

00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:52,990
didn't know when a user comes in which

00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:54,970
node they're going to end up on and then

00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:57,220
also expanded the my sequel cluster so

00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:05,440
we had multiple mass multiple slave so

00:17:57,220 --> 00:18:08,290
that we could actually scale out that so

00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,220
then I'm hand this off to Ken here in a

00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:13,450
second but I want to kind of give the

00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:15,190
background here we'd you know about four

00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,450
years in we started to see some real

00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,980
success we started to see some real

00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:19,570
traction we had schools all over the

00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,040
state we'd had some contact with every

00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,810
single district all every one of the 200

00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,920
to start all over the state at some

00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,330
point somebody in that district had

00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,280
logged into the system and tried the

00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:28,720
tools out some districts are going in

00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,040
whole hog you know we had tens of

00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,570
thousands of users at some districts

00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:37,960
some we had maybe one teacher with a

00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:40,780
class of five students and we were

00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,890
constantly in need of symmetrix you know

00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:43,920
we needed to report back to the

00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:46,450
legislature at funding time to say hey

00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,980
you know let's let's show some outcomes

00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:49,300
here what's happening what's working

00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,100
what's not working how many users do you

00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:52,180
have in there when we can um you know I

00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,560
could scrape through the system and

00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,430
count the number of user accounts and

00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,930
things like I could tell them how many

00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:57,670
you know virtual servers were running

00:18:55,930 --> 00:19:00,700
and things like that but we really

00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:03,580
needed a lot more there and so we went

00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,140
to Ken here and I said Ken we need help

00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,300
because we get the system it's kind of

00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:10,210
outgrown this manual structure that we

00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:16,750
had and so this is what I'm going to

00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:18,850
hand it off to Ken now this slide

00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:20,500
probably really ought to start with the

00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:23,260
last point because this is my entry

00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:25,300
point into the the project gathering

00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:28,030
statistics from all these thousands of

00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,830
sites some of them we didn't know where

00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:31,810
they were if they were active we wanted

00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,860
to know things like how many people i'm

00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:34,930
going to use our accounts are on the

00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,670
site i'm going to use our accounts I've

00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:39,040
actually been used on the site where

00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:41,260
they created it and never used again so

00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,720
we began writing some plugins for both

00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,600
Drupal and Moodle by the way how many

00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:50,350
people here are familiar with Moodle

00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:52,000
okay good so like drupal it's a PHP

00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:54,220
system like Drupal you can write plugins

00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,929
you can create web services in it it's

00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:57,850
much more difficult to work with than

00:19:55,929 --> 00:20:02,530
Drupal it's a much larger more

00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:04,030
complicated complex system but we found

00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:06,250
that it was not too terribly difficult

00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:08,980
to get Drupal and Moodle to talk to each

00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:11,440
other and to gather those statistics we

00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:13,270
needed so once we started gathering the

00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,910
statistics and the metrics you realize

00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:17,200
we needed some way to gather them all in

00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:19,720
one place so that we could actually look

00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,610
at them and have some sort of central

00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:24,130
management for all these thousands and

00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:25,480
thousands of Moodle in Drupal sites so

00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:27,960
then we're going to jump back up to the

00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:31,150
top of the slide with the ORV SD central

00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,280
this was at some point while writing

00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:35,049
these plugins I realized we need a

00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,740
central application to manage all this

00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:42,820
stuff it's actually a Python application

00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:45,700
but it relies heavily on REST API s we

00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:48,820
create web services type modules in

00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,530
Moodle and in Drupal so that the central

00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:53,350
control panel can talk to all those

00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:55,929
systems we install a plug-in in each one

00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:57,220
that collects basically everything we

00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:59,440
can figure out how to collect from each

00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,970
site how many courses are installed how

00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,960
many courses are being used how many

00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:06,549
users are enrolled I think there's a few

00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,960
other things the system details

00:21:06,549 --> 00:21:14,980
basically where that server lives what

00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:17,230
it's uri uri czar and we can gather all

00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:19,809
that data in one place and generate a

00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:21,280
report that we can hand to steve who can

00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:23,409
walk into the legislature and say look

00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,510
these are all the schools that are using

00:21:23,409 --> 00:21:27,220
our sites these are how many users are

00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:29,590
using how many students how many courses

00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,720
this is what we're actually doing with

00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:35,559
all the all the resources that we've

00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:37,960
been given so I mentioned REST API is a

00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:41,440
little plug for Drupal working with both

00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,360
Moodle and Drupal Drupal is a pleasure

00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:48,520
to work with it's been really really

00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:52,620
nice writing plugins to talk to other

00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:56,080
systems is so much simpler and it's a

00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:57,610
it's becoming a real key to putting all

00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,740
the stuff together because Drupal allows

00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:03,309
you to have that portal site that people

00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,169
can log into Drupal can talk to or VSD

00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:05,850
central

00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:08,909
now what courses are available to

00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:10,859
install on the Moodle site we can create

00:22:08,909 --> 00:22:12,960
we're in the progress of doing this

00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:15,149
right now we can create a block in

00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,460
Drupal where people can go log into

00:22:15,149 --> 00:22:18,749
their school district see the courses

00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,549
that are available that they can install

00:22:18,749 --> 00:22:21,989
on their Moodle site click some some

00:22:20,549 --> 00:22:24,330
checkboxes and hit a button and

00:22:21,989 --> 00:22:27,629
everything goes together and it's

00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:30,359
beautiful the other thing we're hoping

00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:34,200
to do soon is implement Drupal as a user

00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:37,169
management platform so each district can

00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,600
go in and add their users to the Drupal

00:22:37,169 --> 00:22:42,179
site which has much nicer cleaner user

00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,799
management tools and then those those

00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:45,539
users are automatically imported into

00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:47,639
Moodle you can go directly to your

00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:50,100
Moodle site if you're logged into Drupal

00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:52,230
your autumn excuse me automatically

00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:56,090
logged into the Moodle site so that's

00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:59,730
it's been it's been a great tool for us

00:22:56,090 --> 00:23:04,259
let's see I think I've mentioned the

00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:06,629
deploying news well we're working on

00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:09,960
deploying courses to Moodle sites using

00:23:06,629 --> 00:23:12,269
that obsd central and the rest api's

00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,570
we're hoping to also be able to deploy

00:23:12,269 --> 00:23:17,940
entire sites so I don't know on the

00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:20,249
previous slide there was little box off

00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,690
to the side labeled Jenkins I don't know

00:23:20,249 --> 00:23:23,789
how many of you might be familiar with

00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:25,739
Jenkins it's the the butler of the

00:23:23,789 --> 00:23:28,309
system in world it takes care of things

00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:30,840
for you it does things for you reliably

00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:34,830
when you want them done and in as much

00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:37,320
detail as you want them done so our VSD

00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:39,779
central can use those same tools the

00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,539
same Jenkins API that the infrastructure

00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:45,929
is using to keep sites updated to deploy

00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:47,340
entire sites so a new district decides

00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:50,399
they want to get their Moodle and Drupal

00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:53,850
set up they can come to us we can push a

00:23:50,399 --> 00:23:56,100
button and voila they're Moodle site and

00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:57,809
their drupal site pops up with the

00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:04,590
correct users whatever courses they

00:23:57,809 --> 00:24:06,629
wanted all put together for them I think

00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:08,549
that's that that covers most of what I'm

00:24:06,629 --> 00:24:12,090
doing unless you think i should add

00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:14,419
someone some more details there so turn

00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:14,419
it back over

00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:21,639
so I want to talk a little bit here

00:24:19,989 --> 00:24:24,190
about what worked and what didn't work

00:24:21,639 --> 00:24:25,989
and then I can dive more deeply into

00:24:24,190 --> 00:24:27,159
either the technical side or the

00:24:25,989 --> 00:24:31,629
educational side whichever you prefer

00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:35,259
after we go through this real quick what

00:24:31,629 --> 00:24:36,730
worked really really well was we ended

00:24:35,259 --> 00:24:38,919
up going out to professional development

00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:41,200
events with teachers whether they be

00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:42,609
conferences I've been up on this stage

00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,369
in front of a bunch of teachers multiple

00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:47,200
times in this particular building

00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:49,149
talking directly to the teachers because

00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,580
this is because the system doesn't have

00:24:49,149 --> 00:24:54,009
any constant because it's all hosted

00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:55,749
remotely I can hand a user ID and a

00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:58,179
password to a teacher I can hand the URL

00:24:55,749 --> 00:25:02,019
of the site to a teacher and say here go

00:24:58,179 --> 00:25:03,399
at it and within you know five minutes

00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:05,289
of being registered they're looking at

00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:07,929
their course which they have edit rights

00:25:05,289 --> 00:25:09,190
on a Moodle server on they are they

00:25:07,929 --> 00:25:12,549
could be looking at a Drupal site if

00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:13,840
they wanted to and that was key you know

00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:14,799
it's all about though your teachers are

00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,909
busy if you don't give them something

00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,519
they can use tomorrow they're not going

00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:20,080
to use it this was our way of okay I'm

00:25:18,519 --> 00:25:23,320
going straight to you as a teacher and

00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:25,389
saying here use this it's free you get

00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,190
to use it we had supported we've got to

00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:29,470
help desk to help you with it by the way

00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:31,149
I have to point out Jackie here is on

00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:33,369
the helpdesk she is absolutely wonderful

00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:35,350
she's brilliant so I have to have to

00:25:33,369 --> 00:25:43,690
applaud her because she kept me sane for

00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:45,369
the last five years the other thing we

00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:48,489
did was we engage teachers to teach

00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:50,710
other teachers as the bottom bullet says

00:25:48,489 --> 00:25:52,299
success is viral so what would happen is

00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:53,649
we'd get one of those early adopter

00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:55,330
teachers and this was one of those weird

00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:57,549
difficult kind of contradictions because

00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:59,830
we wanted to get this in the hands the

00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:01,989
teachers but we wanted to make it easy

00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:04,779
enough that any teacher can just pick it

00:26:01,989 --> 00:26:06,129
up and use it but in order to do that we

00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:08,379
had the attract the power users which

00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:10,659
means we also then had to make the tool

00:26:08,379 --> 00:26:12,879
powerful enough to be attractive to the

00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:14,409
power users so what we did was we went

00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:17,139
straight to those power users we said

00:26:14,409 --> 00:26:18,999
here we have some tools we you know try

00:26:17,139 --> 00:26:20,590
them out tell us what you think we want

00:26:18,999 --> 00:26:22,029
the feedback please come yell at me

00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,200
because something doesn't work because I

00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:25,090
need to know so we can make it better

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,759
for the teachers who are less savvy than

00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:28,060
you are and once we get those teachers

00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:30,280
going

00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:31,510
I'm working in their classroom you know

00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:32,650
they're getting the kids excited you

00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:34,800
know maybe they're actually seeing

00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:37,380
better results in the test scores which

00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:39,400
we don't have empirical evidence but

00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:41,620
definitely anecdotal evidence coming

00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,390
from teachers who say use the tools in

00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:45,280
one other classes and another section

00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:46,720
didn't they actually saw a difference in

00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,220
the test scores s actually saw an

00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,460
improvement in a blended environment

00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:54,070
where they were hmm I forgot to put this

00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:56,020
in my slides this is important these

00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,970
tools were targeted specifically to

00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,290
classroom teachers to enhance what

00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:01,060
they're already doing in the classroom

00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:03,340
this is not a replacement for the

00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:06,400
classroom this is not a go do your class

00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:08,080
online this is a you have a classroom we

00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,670
are going to here we are here to help

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,200
you enhance what you're already doing in

00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:14,680
the classroom to bring the internet into

00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:17,920
your class not to allow teachers to

00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:19,960
serve 500 students per class and that

00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,790
was a key thing I think because the

00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:24,760
teachers saw this as a tool to do better

00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:27,130
not a tool to do more and I think that's

00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:28,840
an important very important fact but

00:27:27,130 --> 00:27:30,220
with so we got these early adopter

00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,420
teachers we got them in there we got

00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,070
them working on stuff they started

00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:34,810
seeing results you know the kids would

00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:36,070
maybe trop to the next room over and say

00:27:34,810 --> 00:27:37,480
you should see what mrs. Jones is doing

00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:39,400
over here man it's great it's so much

00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,360
fun it's so exciting or maybe you know

00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,380
the teachers are in the lunchroom and

00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,600
they're talking about stuff and they

00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:45,070
like wow this is working really well for

00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,090
me I'm seeing results with my students

00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:48,670
you know and the other teachers are

00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:51,400
going huh what's going on over there can

00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:53,130
I get that and so but we started seeing

00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,150
was we get a teacher really energetic

00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:59,020
energized and working with the tool in

00:27:55,150 --> 00:28:00,970
school it would spread and suddenly we'd

00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,830
have the whole school infected and then

00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,990
maybe the district and it started

00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:06,070
getting attention so when we were trying

00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,360
to get attention when we're talking

00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:09,340
about those key stakeholders back at the

00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,770
beginning the administrators and the IT

00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:14,440
departments talk to them I got crickets

00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:15,610
nothing didn't hear a word there was no

00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,660
interest they I don't have time to deal

00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,520
with that they didn't understand the

00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:20,500
benefit got to the teachers got the

00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:23,590
teacher started using it they went yeah

00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,730
right let's go and then all sudden the

00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,960
teachers and their the the

00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,970
administrators and the IT departments

00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:29,500
are going hey what's going on over there

00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:30,820
what's all this noise what's this

00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,960
virtual school district stuff why am I

00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:36,190
saying all this traffic going to an

00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:37,210
external server um which as I'll get to

00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:41,670
as some of the things that didn't work

00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:43,050
um actually I get to now Oh

00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:47,340
well I'll talk about the technical stuff

00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:48,660
first so because this is a state funded

00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,520
project and because we're at the whim of

00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:54,120
the legislature we wanted to make sure

00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:56,490
that if the legislature tomorrow zero

00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:58,320
funded the project we didn't completely

00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:00,270
leave the schools in the lurch now i

00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,560
know there's you know you can't just

00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:02,970
forklift something and drop it into

00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,170
school data center and expected orozco

00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:07,230
districts data center and expect it to

00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:08,400
work i totally understand that but we

00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,960
could at least do what we could to

00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,400
mitigate that and the first thing is

00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:14,220
let's not tie them to a large

00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,960
proprietary software licensing bill you

00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,880
know especially these districts with you

00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,430
know 40 50 to 60,000 students on the

00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,290
system you know they're already pressed

00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:23,580
for for money that's one of the reasons

00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:25,140
we rebuilding the system let's provide

00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:27,270
them tools without costing them anything

00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,400
so we wanted to make sure that whatever

00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:30,720
we built we could turn over to their

00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,460
school IT department and say here are

00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,550
the tools this is what we built here is

00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:36,810
the code you can do this we will help

00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:38,040
you do this and I said this multiple

00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,720
times the IT departments that I worked

00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,630
with if you want to bring this in-house

00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:44,280
great I will help you do it you know you

00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:45,720
don't have to wait you know if you want

00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,580
to do this now you like what you see I

00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,840
will come down to you and sit down with

00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,700
your IT department and help you deploy

00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,700
it internally we love that because that

00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:55,950
as far as I'm concerned better serves

00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,450
the goal of the datum of the project

00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:58,920
than just having them run on our servers

00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:01,020
because that's something locally managed

00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,000
locally owned the control is where it

00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,010
needs to be I'm very much in pushing

00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,630
that control as far out to that edge as

00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,860
I can we don't want to control until

00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:09,930
people what to do with the system we

00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:14,370
want the users to define how that system

00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:15,690
is getting used using a cloud-like model

00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:18,450
we were really running of a private

00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:20,070
virtual cloud worked well because it was

00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:22,080
a daily enabled us to spin up servers

00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:24,000
spin down servers reconfigure servers do

00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,620
things very in a sort of very agile

00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,390
manner when we get feedback from schools

00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:30,960
or we see traffic increasing we were

00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:34,590
able to adjust to it quickly config

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,570
management already mentioned we were

00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:38,280
running so many systems there is no way

00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:40,080
we would have been overrun that many

00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:42,450
systems without it it is complete

00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,600
lifesaver as crafty as CF engine is it's

00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:48,060
got its warts and its arcane as hell it

00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,320
got us past that initial growth spurt it

00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,520
got it to the point where we were big

00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,140
enough that we could start dedicating

00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,480
the resources to actually working more

00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:56,420
on the infrastructure so config

00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:59,760
management it was definitely key here

00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:02,070
and the Jenkins bit the ability to

00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,830
automate things like server and course

00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:06,570
radiation made everything work you know

00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:08,160
both with Jenkins and as well I had some

00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:09,780
crafty ph2 scripts that i wrote

00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,190
initially to do that to automatically

00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:14,280
create sites on automatically create

00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:17,460
courses we're key because we didn't want

00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,990
those teachers to have to wait again is

00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,850
that not waiting thing teachers should

00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:22,350
be able to sign into the site say I you

00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:24,240
know look at the other library of

00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:26,340
courses that are available say i want

00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,290
that physics course on my server with

00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,510
control they're able to do that without

00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:32,130
having to wait for any any human being

00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:34,910
whether it be me or somebody at their

00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:37,680
district to approve that they just do it

00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:42,420
which again i'll get to is one of the

00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:46,140
things that didn't work so some of the

00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:47,730
things that caused problems one we were

00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:49,020
a little too aggressive in talking to

00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:51,600
the features and not aggressive enough

00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:54,150
in talking to the IT staffs so what did

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:58,260
we get we got a lot of crossed arms we

00:31:54,150 --> 00:32:01,140
still we still do I think it's fair it's

00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:03,630
a completely valid and reasonable

00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:05,580
problem that this the district IT had

00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,830
with us because we were this unknown

00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:10,050
outside vendor coming in from the

00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:11,520
statewide level you know saying here our

00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,810
teachers have all this stuff and of

00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,400
course the IT departments are going one

00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:18,380
I don't understand this stuff is a lot

00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:21,270
of Microsoft chops you know and it's

00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:22,380
it's a threat it really is you know it's

00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:23,820
like gosh there's all this technology

00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:25,470
coming in my district I'm responsible

00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,670
for technology in my district and I

00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:30,570
don't understand what my teachers are

00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:33,360
using this is a problem and so it's some

00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:35,520
districts it was pretty severe you know

00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,140
we had grievances filed we had all sorts

00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:40,980
of things happen it was a very

00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:43,320
unpleasant negative interaction which I

00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:44,730
really regret and I wish you know if I

00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,350
could just go back five years and do it

00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:49,560
over again I try to find a way to do it

00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:51,240
differently yes the program succeeding

00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,030
yes we're making a very strong impact in

00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:55,860
the classrooms but at the cost of

00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:58,010
driving even a further wedge between the

00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:00,660
teachers and their IT staff locally um

00:32:58,010 --> 00:33:03,360
because the IT stuff saw this as oh my

00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:06,150
god this is going to make more work even

00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:07,620
though I argue yeah we have you know the

00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:09,750
helpdesk and things like that to assist

00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:13,710
I understand the complaint in totally

00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:15,780
valid also it was a bit of a non-event

00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:17,700
adhere thing you know especially at the

00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,960
larger districts the IT departments of

00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,730
the larger districts especially we're

00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:24,480
like oh is these outsiders these you

00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:26,970
know these wild hairy hippies coming in

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,309
tell us how they can do better stuff

00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,630
than we can and we've got a great system

00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:31,890
here we know exactly what we're doing we

00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:33,660
have all these tools we can do all of

00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:34,920
what you're giving why are you coming in

00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:39,600
and doing this to our teachers we can do

00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:42,240
this ourselves true but clearly

00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,500
something's not syncing here because the

00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,240
teachers were still coming to us want to

00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:47,220
use the tools rather than going to the

00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:49,410
local IT department so yeah there was a

00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:51,210
definite disconnect there and there was

00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:55,350
a definite sort of a bit of butting

00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:57,450
heads that we didn't handle well um the

00:33:55,350 --> 00:34:00,750
other problem we had was just plain

00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:05,220
enthusiasm and that seems a little odd

00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:06,450
but I as I had this image at one point

00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,639
where one of the district's I worked

00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:10,139
with had been rolled out Moodle they

00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,610
were so we had a bunch of their students

00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:13,020
it was an alternative high school they

00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:15,629
were really excited things were going

00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:19,169
great and then they got this grant to

00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:20,940
get a bunch of iPads and they started

00:34:19,169 --> 00:34:22,919
doing stuff and I had this image in my

00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:25,320
head of them running around with iPads

00:34:22,919 --> 00:34:27,320
banging down nails because they didn't

00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,370
know the ipad was suddenly I mean it was

00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,590
34 years ago you know the UH pads were

00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:33,179
still very much a very new hot thing and

00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:35,429
people hadn't quite figured out how to

00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:37,409
use them intelligently in the classroom

00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:39,960
yet and so they were using him in wholly

00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:41,100
inappropriate ways and they got really

00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,580
excited about it and they rolled this

00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:46,560
out and it fell flat on its face because

00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:48,360
they had this shiny hammer when what

00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,929
they really needed was you know maybe a

00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:54,260
wrench or a screwdriver and we didn't

00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:57,030
necessarily help hand hold them on that

00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:59,640
and didn't do a particularly good job of

00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:00,690
helping them understand when what you

00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,220
know helping them figure out what the

00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:04,470
appropriate tool is in the appropriate

00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:07,170
application of the tools that they had

00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:09,720
so they got overly enthusiastic they did

00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:13,760
some great stuff and some stuff that

00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:17,090
didn't work so well the last thing is

00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,020
when we originally built the portal I

00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:20,010
wanted to build a strong social

00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:22,350
component

00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:24,300
that connected teachers cross district

00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:26,820
car all over the state to allow them to

00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:28,890
share content you know hey I did this

00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:30,510
really great unit on do you know

00:35:28,890 --> 00:35:32,070
fractions i want to share this with

00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:34,380
other elementary school teachers in the

00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:36,060
state so built this have this whole

00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,590
structure had this way of you know

00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:42,090
allowing teachers to upload content and

00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:43,260
rate it and crickets as another speaker

00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:47,130
i heard earlier this week say

00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:51,240
tumbleweeds not a single object was

00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:52,410
uploaded nothing and i talked to the

00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,210
teachers and there were some concerns

00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:56,370
there were things like well you know if

00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:57,870
i create this stuff is that the visit my

00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:59,700
intellectual property is a district

00:35:57,870 --> 00:36:02,340
intellectual property you know I you

00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:04,620
know I don't again and also part of it

00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:06,390
is again teachers just don't have time

00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,620
they were looking for content they

00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,380
didn't have the time to generate their

00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:14,100
own necessarily and contribute it back

00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:15,630
they liked the idea as one of my friends

00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:20,130
in public administration likes to stay

00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:21,690
and volunteerism collaboration they love

00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,980
the idea of collaboration it's kind of

00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:24,450
like teen sex everybody's talking about

00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:27,870
it but nobody's actually doing it very

00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:29,160
well same sort of thing you know they

00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:31,470
really worked hard at it do they like

00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,910
the idea but it just never really came

00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:34,620
to anything which is a great

00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:40,290
disappointment to me but it's the

00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:44,460
reality of the world so things that we

00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:45,900
stumbled over technology-wise as the

00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,250
site the system started peripheral eight

00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:50,370
we got more and more sites out there it

00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:52,620
become became much much much harder to

00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:55,770
keep things updated and patched we had

00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:58,050
so many different configurations so many

00:36:55,770 --> 00:37:00,570
different versions primarily Drupal 6

00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,680
stuff now getting into Drupal 7 we

00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:03,720
haven't had ripple 5 stuff floating

00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:05,280
around out there I think up until last

00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:07,080
year I actually they may still be

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,310
running for all I know they were still

00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,170
do pro five sites running into

00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:12,300
production because there was just too

00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:14,070
much there and the effort to upgrade

00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:16,170
those and keep them patched because they

00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:17,880
were all a little bit different was a

00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:19,920
problem which is one of the reasons we

00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:23,060
started moving to the Jenkins model and

00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,920
the more standardization of things as

00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:29,670
well as a related thing way too many

00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,900
one-offs we had WordPress sites up they

00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:31,559
were the kind of floating out on their

00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,660
own we have

00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:35,880
you know WordPress multi was a wordpress

00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:37,829
mu and whatever wordpress network stuff

00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,269
that he worked up at some point we had

00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:42,930
all these things they were all

00:37:39,269 --> 00:37:44,999
configured different and you know we had

00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:46,319
no standardization because we tried to

00:37:44,999 --> 00:37:47,549
standardize the structure we had you

00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:49,380
know maybe a server at the district

00:37:47,549 --> 00:37:50,849
level in a server / school some

00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:53,219
districts wanted everybody on one server

00:37:50,849 --> 00:37:55,109
some district 11 / school and so things

00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:56,549
you know as try as we might we tried to

00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:58,920
standardize couldn't do it and so it

00:37:56,549 --> 00:38:01,259
became this kind of mishmash of okay

00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,140
wait is Portland on one server is it on

00:38:01,259 --> 00:38:06,299
eight okay yo and so it became a very

00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,309
difficult thing to manage the other

00:38:06,299 --> 00:38:11,249
thing is and this is our probably our

00:38:08,309 --> 00:38:13,640
greatest technical failure was we had a

00:38:11,249 --> 00:38:16,739
nice cozy storage appliance that failed

00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,059
hard exactly a year ago this week

00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:22,609
actually isn't it was Memorial Day

00:38:18,059 --> 00:38:26,039
weekend um completely blew up on us um

00:38:22,609 --> 00:38:28,829
lost I think we managed to resurrect

00:38:26,039 --> 00:38:30,239
almost all of the data but we had a

00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:32,549
significant downtime in the system it

00:38:30,239 --> 00:38:33,630
was a bad single point of failure which

00:38:32,549 --> 00:38:35,819
is one of the reasons we went to

00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:36,809
Gloucester um because you know we had

00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:38,789
then multiple copies spread across

00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:40,049
multiple machines even though the

00:38:38,789 --> 00:38:42,299
storage array was supposed to be

00:38:40,049 --> 00:38:43,890
redundant it turned out it wasn't we had

00:38:42,299 --> 00:38:45,329
you know card go bad and its speed much

00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:47,489
a bad data onto the systems lost

00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:50,369
multiple volumes it was a very bad

00:38:47,489 --> 00:38:52,079
situation so the one thing we learned

00:38:50,369 --> 00:39:00,989
the most was yet don't trust that damn

00:38:52,079 --> 00:39:03,569
appliance so we've got let's see about

00:39:00,989 --> 00:39:05,729
15 20 minutes for questions and

00:39:03,569 --> 00:39:07,259
discussion and I can dive down into any

00:39:05,729 --> 00:39:08,999
of the technical details or Ken can talk

00:39:07,259 --> 00:39:10,709
about some of the software level stuff

00:39:08,999 --> 00:39:12,420
I'm I wanted to make sure we had plenty

00:39:10,709 --> 00:39:13,589
of time for talking about this because I

00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:16,319
wasn't quite sure who was going to be

00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:18,469
here today so I encourage anybody with a

00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:23,339
question come on up to the mic here and

00:39:18,469 --> 00:39:24,679
let's chat uh I actually work in a

00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:27,509
school district I have a question about

00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:28,829
how do you guys handle the aging of

00:39:27,509 --> 00:39:30,749
everything in the system you know

00:39:28,829 --> 00:39:32,789
schools run you know we kind of run for

00:39:30,749 --> 00:39:34,229
a year then we burn everything down and

00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:36,420
we start up for a new year I'm you know

00:39:34,229 --> 00:39:37,769
you guys looking at having high school

00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,259
students finding their kindergarten

00:39:37,769 --> 00:39:42,420
records still on the system or is there

00:39:40,259 --> 00:39:45,119
some sort of method of removing the old

00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:46,710
to keep everything running um we

00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:48,240
she had explicit instructions from the

00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:50,700
Department of it not to remove old user

00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:56,009
accounts they wanted to keep those

00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:57,990
around I'm not entirely sure why um but

00:39:56,009 --> 00:40:00,150
what we ended up doing with a lot of

00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:02,130
districts is there were certainly

00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:03,420
namespace issues you know especially

00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:04,529
when you're talking statewide I mean

00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,700
their name space issues in any large

00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:07,440
district and when you're trying to talk

00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:10,349
about statewide we really had naming

00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,150
convention shoes and so siloing them off

00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:14,849
using like graduation year and things

00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:18,359
like that tended to help but for the

00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:21,440
most part also up until very recently we

00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:24,150
hadn't done a lot with single sign-on so

00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:25,859
you know as a student would move into a

00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:27,240
new school their account wouldn't

00:40:25,859 --> 00:40:29,670
necessarily travel with them they get a

00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:30,930
new account at the new school and the

00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,950
school's a lot of the schools we hook

00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:33,690
them into this the school active

00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:35,279
directory and so a lot of that just got

00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:36,869
aged out anyway because they remove the

00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:40,710
account from Active Directory it gets

00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:43,470
taken off the system they're done but it

00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:45,990
hadn't been much of a problem but that

00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:53,130
does also account for some of the bloat

00:40:45,990 --> 00:40:54,450
in the user numbers that we see yeah

00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:56,249
yeah they're recording so we'll need to

00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:58,470
get on the microphone thank you um so

00:40:56,249 --> 00:41:00,779
you mentioned your experiences with

00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:05,430
iPads as that situation gotten better

00:41:00,779 --> 00:41:07,739
are you I able to to integrate all right

00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:09,930
you know storing stuff you know that

00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:12,539
they do natively on the iPad and then

00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:14,519
get it into Moodle smoothly um I know

00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:16,200
that embrace recent versions of Moodle

00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:21,299
have gotten better as far as content

00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:23,369
creation on ipad but yeah it's it's an

00:41:21,299 --> 00:41:24,450
issue regardless I think a lot of the

00:41:23,369 --> 00:41:25,829
schools and the teachers are starting to

00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:27,630
figure out that iPads are great

00:41:25,829 --> 00:41:29,069
consumption devices they work really

00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:30,960
good for looking at things and maybe

00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:32,489
interacting with things but when they

00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,339
get into the state where they're needing

00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:36,690
to submit content generally they go to

00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:38,789
the laptop part of the computer lab

00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:41,190
right and get on real keyboard because

00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:46,609
it just was too frustrating for them it

00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:50,609
does does today's Moodle interface well

00:41:46,609 --> 00:41:51,960
with iPads it's gotten better yeah it

00:41:50,609 --> 00:41:53,970
does some detection on mobile devices

00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,380
and actually provides the ability to do

00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,910
a mobile theme which is decent it's not

00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,809
truly responsive which is certainly

00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:59,400
something that

00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:00,359
you know the drupal world is done and i

00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,160
know that there's a lot of work

00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:04,619
especially in the Drupal community to

00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,029
start seeing about replacing a lot of

00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:10,410
those functions in Moodle in Drupal

00:42:06,029 --> 00:42:12,599
which I would kill for because I am

00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:15,119
working with Moodle has reminded me just

00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:19,259
how much I adore how Drupal core is set

00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:21,079
up from a technical standpoint yeah

00:42:19,259 --> 00:42:24,779
dealing with Moodle core is a nightmare

00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:27,089
so anything you know we could do to try

00:42:24,779 --> 00:42:29,459
to push stuff in you know even using

00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:30,930
WordPress instead of Moodle it's just

00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:33,119
getting away from the Moodle interface

00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:35,849
because it's heavy bloated and difficult

00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,109
to work with it's still used the

00:42:35,849 --> 00:42:39,539
teachers like it they have the mindshare

00:42:37,109 --> 00:42:42,809
so you know we did we could but there

00:42:39,539 --> 00:42:45,569
isn't a whole lot you can do and one of

00:42:42,809 --> 00:42:48,599
the questions so in Oregon is this this

00:42:45,569 --> 00:42:50,609
open to other schools in terms of

00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:55,410
private schools or a pillars good

00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:58,349
question yes it is open to any student

00:42:55,410 --> 00:43:01,049
or teacher who is connected with a

00:42:58,349 --> 00:43:02,189
public school district so private

00:43:01,049 --> 00:43:03,900
schools unfortunately are not included

00:43:02,189 --> 00:43:05,279
they're excluded by law it wasn't our

00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:06,420
choice that's the way it is I would have

00:43:05,279 --> 00:43:10,650
opened it up to everybody if I had my

00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:12,089
choice but we were excluded by private

00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:14,279
schools were exploited by law a lot of

00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:15,630
home schools are included though because

00:43:14,279 --> 00:43:16,949
most of the homeschooling is done

00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:18,869
through the local district to the local

00:43:16,949 --> 00:43:21,599
ASD so a lot of homeschool students and

00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:23,069
can use this use the system that said

00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,739
the system is primarily targeted at

00:43:23,069 --> 00:43:27,179
teachers so you know it's tools for

00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:29,279
teachers more than tools for students

00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:31,140
there was a goal of an initial diagrams

00:43:29,279 --> 00:43:33,539
we drew having a student portal I had a

00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:36,089
bunch of content for students that never

00:43:33,539 --> 00:43:37,019
really materialized that we just didn't

00:43:36,089 --> 00:43:40,199
have the demand and we didn't have the

00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:42,150
resources to build it but any teacher

00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:43,499
who's working with a student regardless

00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:45,630
of that students the home school student

00:43:43,499 --> 00:43:48,029
or an in classroom student is that is

00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:51,089
employed by a public school entity is

00:43:48,029 --> 00:43:53,069
able to use in an Oregon yeah

00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:56,219
unfortunately again it's yeah that said

00:43:53,069 --> 00:43:58,709
you know I what we're doing is all open

00:43:56,219 --> 00:44:00,809
source software so all the content that

00:43:58,709 --> 00:44:02,999
we're creating all the plugins that

00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:04,859
we're creating our open source we're

00:44:02,999 --> 00:44:06,839
happy to share our expertise and our

00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:08,400
systems we can't host your site if

00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:10,810
you're from another state but we'd be

00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,270
happy to share those the

00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:16,570
setups and a lot of stuffs on github

00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:20,290
which yeah ping one of us and we'll get

00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:23,500
you github access yep I work for a

00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:26,170
county office of EDD in California and I

00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:28,270
to have gotten into trouble by being a

00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:29,680
crusader rabbit to the teachers saying

00:44:28,270 --> 00:44:31,150
no I just go out and sign up for these

00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,980
things and just go to do it don't wait

00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:35,100
for your district to do this and I've

00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:37,510
gotten into some trouble for doing that

00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:39,940
but I'm kind of sitting back and then

00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:43,060
cackling now as I'm seeing this these

00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:44,680
wave of devices just wash over the IT

00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:47,440
department that I work for you know I'm

00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:50,170
saying all right and even our office

00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,260
tried to ban iPads and that lasted like

00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:55,330
two weeks you know before the iPads just

00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:57,370
started just washing in and now we're

00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:58,390
actually you know that all that all of

00:44:57,370 --> 00:45:00,400
our divisions want to do these

00:44:58,390 --> 00:45:02,200
experimental iPad programs were there

00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,030
buying a hundred at a time and you know

00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:10,000
that's not an experiment folks you're

00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:16,180
deploying yeah yes exactly but but i

00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:18,670
know in oh sneaky sneaky i like it but

00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:20,440
is it of our IT departments becoming

00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:22,000
more reasonable with teachers now are

00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,410
they because it's happening in

00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,660
corporations people are bringing in

00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:27,550
their own technology and even buying

00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:29,950
decisions such as whether or not to buy

00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:32,230
Drupal is moving in corporations it

00:45:29,950 --> 00:45:33,370
seems more to the to the actual users

00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:34,690
and has less to do with the IT

00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:37,180
department are you perceiving that

00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:38,560
happening to some extent yeah I think

00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:41,410
they're they're kind of a few things

00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,960
happening one is a truly unfortunate

00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:46,090
thing which is budgets are getting so

00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,530
tight there are no IT departments in

00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:49,600
some districts I remember getting a call

00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:52,120
not long ago from a from a

00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,380
superintendent in rural district said

00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:55,240
hey I need help with this this isn't

00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:56,320
working and I said oh gosh it looks like

00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:58,450
it something do with your single sign-on

00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:59,890
in your Active Directory yeah like get

00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:02,890
me in touch with your ID or mine I'll

00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:04,030
help him work through it I am the IT

00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:07,090
department they all got laid off last

00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:08,230
month what am I going to do you know and

00:46:07,090 --> 00:46:10,060
we tried to help them as best we could

00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:11,650
but you know without access to the

00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,820
systems or what you know so that's one

00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:15,130
thing is you know just out of sheer

00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:16,570
attrition the teachers don't have an IT

00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:18,190
department to work with any longer so

00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:19,690
they just you know they're grasping and

00:46:18,190 --> 00:46:21,880
whatever resources they can get just to

00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:24,010
get their job done and so that is

00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,400
actually unfortunately part of the

00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:27,039
growth

00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,660
I think also there are districts that

00:46:27,039 --> 00:46:31,000
because there is so much pressure on

00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:32,380
them financially especially or they're

00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:33,579
just getting better educated they're

00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:36,430
starting to learn they're seeing stuff

00:46:33,579 --> 00:46:38,079
like this going on they're like okay

00:46:36,430 --> 00:46:40,089
yeah we can we can do this we can get

00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,410
our toes in it we can you know and now

00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:42,970
that there's somebody else that's done

00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:44,230
it you know I mean this is the great

00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:45,670
public sector thing right no you don't

00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:47,020
want to be first you always want to see

00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:48,880
I want to see somebody else has done at

00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:50,049
first so now that we can start pointing

00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,250
at districts that say look you know

00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:52,450
these guys that salem-keizer they're

00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:54,220
doing it right now they've completely

00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:55,539
off loaded their website you know

00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:57,549
they're saving however many thousand

00:46:55,539 --> 00:46:59,289
dollars a year on this it's okay it

00:46:57,549 --> 00:47:00,369
doesn't hurt and the other districts can

00:46:59,289 --> 00:47:02,289
go well if those guys are doing that we

00:47:00,369 --> 00:47:03,700
can do it that's no problem so we're

00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:04,750
starting to see that and there are a few

00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,250
districts that saw the light from the

00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:08,559
beginning you know there are a couple of

00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:09,789
districts out there that you know Google

00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,599
Apps came out that was what part of this

00:47:09,789 --> 00:47:12,010
that we didn't talk about the

00:47:10,599 --> 00:47:13,029
presentation is actually Oregon was the

00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:14,980
first state in the country to sign a

00:47:13,029 --> 00:47:17,410
statewide Google Apps contract google

00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:19,000
apps for education so every single

00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:20,440
public school in oregon has free access

00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:22,599
to Google Apps for Education the full

00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:25,390
suite you know first one to do a

00:47:22,599 --> 00:47:26,980
statewide agreement on that so you know

00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:28,329
they're they're doing these things

00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:31,150
there's districts just threw it wide

00:47:28,329 --> 00:47:32,589
open you know that I there's one in the

00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:35,020
Newburgh school district here in Oregon

00:47:32,589 --> 00:47:36,579
I love those guys they're amazing they

00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:38,109
just said you want to try it you want to

00:47:36,579 --> 00:47:40,270
try open source stuff great let's make

00:47:38,109 --> 00:47:42,039
it happen let's do it I mean they

00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:44,349
totally embrace this sort of disruptive

00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:46,180
attitude and it's worked great for them

00:47:44,349 --> 00:47:48,010
so you know there are a few out there

00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:51,339
that's done that but it's unfortunately

00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:55,480
attrition seems to be the worst but most

00:47:51,339 --> 00:47:58,029
common reason do you guys feel like your

00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:01,260
system is pretty well stabilized or are

00:47:58,029 --> 00:48:03,490
their major kind of user facing

00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:06,730
components you're thinking about it

00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:08,529
Lance is here great yeah I think the

00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:09,849
changes we've made in the you know the

00:48:08,529 --> 00:48:12,670
past year have certainly made it a lot

00:48:09,849 --> 00:48:15,069
more stabilized we still have a ways to

00:48:12,670 --> 00:48:17,920
go but we've definitely redesigned it in

00:48:15,069 --> 00:48:19,599
a way that it's a lot more robust are

00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,089
there are other open source projects or

00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:24,160
you know features that you get requests

00:48:22,089 --> 00:48:28,230
for or personally interested in that she

00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,230
think would make a good addition to it

00:48:29,069 --> 00:48:36,490
too or VSD infrastructure specifically

00:48:34,230 --> 00:48:38,230
not right now I mean we've already

00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:39,460
tapped into quite a bit of things

00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:41,350
gloucester if s being the latest

00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:43,840
development and working that out I

00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:45,490
certainly helped quite a bit I'm trying

00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:47,530
to think of anything else yeah I mean I

00:48:45,490 --> 00:48:49,150
think Jenkins was another big thing yeah

00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:50,740
and that's one thing I didn't actually

00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:51,910
talk very much about as the automated

00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,920
deployment on Jenkins in the fact that

00:48:51,910 --> 00:48:55,540
we're actually doing entirely automated

00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,300
upgrades of both Moodle and robo via

00:48:55,540 --> 00:49:00,460
Jenkins and even to the point of sharing

00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:01,869
get repos with the school district IT

00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:05,170
for them to upload their own

00:49:01,869 --> 00:49:06,460
modifications in two and then Jenkins

00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:08,260
deploys it to staging when they do a

00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:10,869
commit to the staging branch they get to

00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:12,640
try it out on staging if it's if it's

00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:14,320
working okay then we merge staging into

00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,510
prod and Jenkins immediately deploys it

00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:19,000
to prod which is saved a huge amount of

00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:20,619
work now that's not a user facing than

00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,970
the Denniston are going to notice but it

00:49:20,619 --> 00:49:27,780
does allow the local district and us

00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:30,670
what the OSL teams I keep thinking in us

00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:32,350
to do stuff more quickly but I think

00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:34,330
between you know the e-portfolios in

00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:38,170
Mahara which never really caught on

00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:39,520
Moodle and Drupal and WordPress I mean

00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:40,600
those tools seem to be the key ones the

00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:41,830
teachers just want a website they can

00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,000
put stuff on and have the teachers and

00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:48,880
the students go look at that's what like

00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:50,350
really cared about does your setup

00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:57,190
communicate with any student information

00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:59,410
systems vast number of districts did not

00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:01,150
want us to do that that way there was

00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:02,950
very much firewall issues involved a lot

00:50:01,150 --> 00:50:04,359
of times and they just that and that was

00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:06,160
where some of the resistance with the IT

00:50:04,359 --> 00:50:07,980
staff came in is like no way in hell am

00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,720
i letting somebody outside do something

00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:12,130
the closest we've come is looking into

00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:15,310
say you know their LDAP or Active

00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:17,170
Directory but pushing data into and out

00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:19,180
of the Student Information Systems what

00:50:17,170 --> 00:50:22,930
we were willing to do it on the other

00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:23,859
half generally wasn't which is kind of I

00:50:22,930 --> 00:50:27,040
think a blessing in disguise because

00:50:23,859 --> 00:50:28,690
that is a hairy nasty ugly problem and

00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,550
I'm kind of glad we didn't have to

00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:33,400
address it yet because that would have

00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:35,290
been a lot of work so as each district

00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,510
have their own information system okay

00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:38,980
yes and it's the dog's breakfast out

00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:39,880
there everything I mean there are

00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:42,760
districts that were still doing thing

00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:44,780
with Excel for their sis we have some

00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:49,830
really small districts

00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:51,869
so yeah thank you just wondering if

00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:53,670
there was any ability to track or any

00:50:51,869 --> 00:50:57,300
metrics for student success especially

00:50:53,670 --> 00:51:00,600
across years or is it as everything

00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:02,820
expunged yeah it's not necessarily

00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:04,140
expunged but for the most part and it's

00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:05,430
kind of ties in with the student

00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:07,200
information system thing is that

00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:08,369
teachers while there are gradebook

00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:09,900
functions and Moodle and things like

00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:13,410
that teachers were really using their

00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:14,670
local sis for all of that so yeah we

00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:16,290
didn't we didn't have the metrics I

00:51:14,670 --> 00:51:19,350
wanted to gather them we just didn't

00:51:16,290 --> 00:51:21,000
have any way to we're starting to be

00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:23,310
able to gather more metrics on all the

00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,860
sites through the RV SD central program

00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:28,080
and that's kind of only limited by what

00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:31,140
kind of data we can gather from Moodle

00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:32,910
and Drupal so Moodle tracks a certain

00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:34,920
amount of you know student success

00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:37,260
depending on you know how they've got it

00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,210
set up so in the future we might be able

00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:44,220
to do something a lot more detailed and

00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:46,110
comprehensive you know rates of how many

00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:47,790
people got a's and in certain courses

00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:51,720
how many people completed which material

00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:54,150
that kind of stuff so yeah what level of

00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:56,220
hardware virtualization we able to

00:51:54,150 --> 00:52:00,350
achieve do you own for instance do you

00:51:56,220 --> 00:52:03,980
have a network fabric so that the

00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:07,020
network connections are all virtualized

00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:07,980
do you have well I dance lance and

00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:11,970
tonight when I could answer it but he'll

00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:13,650
do it better I mean we use KDM as the

00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:16,500
hypervisor and all of our virtualization

00:52:13,650 --> 00:52:18,000
I think one of the sites kind of showed

00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:20,160
the new architecture basically the

00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,200
database servers are hardware the file

00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,250
servers are hardware but then we have

00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,600
the physical nodes I mean there's a

00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:26,130
couple of older machines that are still

00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:29,550
physical hardware but those are going

00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:30,630
away so i would say on average probably

00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:31,800
eighty to ninety percent of

00:52:30,630 --> 00:52:33,630
infrastructure is virtualized but

00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:36,210
networking wise it's just well sir bruce

00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:40,260
or in fact nodes there are their own

00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:41,520
there the bluster FS node so we I don't

00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:43,200
know if you describe how we split up the

00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:45,180
file systems on some of the stuff but

00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:47,670
now I didn't get um you say that you got

00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:49,230
rid of your your one file server

00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:51,390
appliance that's assume that this is

00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:53,490
doing some kind of raid in software oh

00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:55,650
yeah all of them has rated yeah yeah we

00:52:53,490 --> 00:52:57,119
still have an older NFS server that's by

00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:58,920
itself but we have been replicas

00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,480
getting stuff off of it for like a call

00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,190
back up but the new system with gloves

00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,529
or FS kind of does it more automatically

00:53:02,190 --> 00:53:06,299
and so we've had to split some things up

00:53:04,529 --> 00:53:08,910
because Lester FS does not work really

00:53:06,299 --> 00:53:10,529
well if you have PHP files on it so we

00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:12,990
have to that's why we have Jenkins to

00:53:10,529 --> 00:53:14,519
kind of have all the PHP files on the

00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:16,650
local file system and then like little

00:53:14,519 --> 00:53:20,630
data triple vowels are going to slow to

00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:23,130
bring the ph p.m. it's it's the type of

00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:25,380
the way gloucester FS works in the type

00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:28,410
of system calls that it does it's just

00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:31,650
incredibly slow it doesn't do deal well

00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:34,859
with small files in PHP I used any kind

00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:36,630
of SSD caching to try speed things up

00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:38,670
what we've done is much caching is we

00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:41,309
can do basically but this is the

00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:43,109
solution we've had and basically all the

00:53:41,309 --> 00:53:45,690
advice we've gotten from where FS is the

00:53:43,109 --> 00:53:48,900
same thing you know don't host the PHP

00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:50,700
files on Gloucester FS ok yeah y-yeah I

00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:52,259
use a lot of memcache heavily used

00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,990
varnish on the front end for caching of

00:53:52,259 --> 00:53:57,119
static static assets basically I mean

00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:59,069
you know just like any other large-scale

00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,900
Drupal or PHP site in general is just

00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:02,430
you know do whatever you can to reduce

00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,749
the number of hits on the PHP back end

00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:06,390
so we don't have to actually ever touch

00:54:03,749 --> 00:54:08,789
disk so lots of stuffs cashed in

00:54:06,390 --> 00:54:10,950
memcache and RAM and what we can as

00:54:08,789 --> 00:54:18,329
cached on the front end of varnish yeah

00:54:10,950 --> 00:54:22,289
cool thanks oh that's the Gannett II

00:54:18,329 --> 00:54:23,999
logo yeah is a fairly new logo yeah we

00:54:22,289 --> 00:54:25,829
put the slides together and I saw this

00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:27,599
logo up here and I'm like what the heck

00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:28,739
is that you know I'm work with agony for

00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:31,200
like six years and I don't know where it

00:54:28,739 --> 00:54:33,049
is so yeah that's that's a new one you

00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:37,799
you had some numbers up there about the

00:54:33,049 --> 00:54:41,579
number of sites that you have 500 or 750

00:54:37,799 --> 00:54:44,220
what are those a combination of Drupal

00:54:41,579 --> 00:54:46,890
and yeah yeah it's preponderance this is

00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:50,069
a Moodle it's probably ninety percent

00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:52,999
moodle sites mostly because the original

00:54:50,069 --> 00:54:55,650
iteration of the site the drupal portal

00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:58,650
when a teacher signs in and they go

00:54:55,650 --> 00:55:00,569
browsing the content i had i created a

00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:01,769
moodle module that can hates me for

00:55:00,569 --> 00:55:05,369
don't he don't let me tell you otherwise

00:55:01,769 --> 00:55:08,279
he hates me for it it's awful crafty PHP

00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:09,630
thing that basically would when when

00:55:08,279 --> 00:55:10,530
teacher signs up they say what school

00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:13,140
district and what school

00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:14,340
there with when they go to say oh I like

00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,780
this piece of content I want to create a

00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:17,400
course based on it they hit create a

00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:20,190
course the system would then check the

00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,960
back end see if a server exists a

00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:23,670
virtual V host for that particular

00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:25,170
school if it doesn't it would spawn one

00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:26,340
would load Moodle into it it would then

00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:27,390
load the course into it had add the user

00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:29,550
and then it would give them the link

00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:31,560
back to the course but what that meant

00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:33,600
was every curious teacher that goes oh

00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:36,450
that's kind of fun click that button new

00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:38,100
server so you know it was good because

00:55:36,450 --> 00:55:39,720
then they had it and if we know we never

00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:41,760
have to create it again and it was fine

00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:43,380
but there are you know probably a couple

00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:45,030
of hundred if not more server sitting

00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:47,790
there that have one user on them that

00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:49,800
has never logged in so the Moodle I'm

00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:53,730
not familiar with the learning system

00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:55,980
okay but the Drupal part huh that's for

00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:58,110
everything else right yes horse where's

00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:59,910
that software and everything else

00:55:58,110 --> 00:56:01,740
although we do have teachers doing

00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:03,810
things in Moodle and in WordPress both

00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:05,190
because more often than not Moodle is

00:56:03,810 --> 00:56:06,600
way overkill for what the teachers

00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:08,010
actually wanted to do they just wanted a

00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:10,800
place to like maybe have a discussion

00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:12,720
and I have students you know download

00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:14,970
assignments or you know put the syllabus

00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,050
up there or something like that so it

00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:17,040
depends on the teachers needs and that

00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:21,030
was one of the kind of the weird things

00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:22,170
as we had this huge variation on what

00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:23,580
the teachers were using it for some

00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:25,140
teachers did the entire class on there

00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:26,520
they use the quiz they use the you know

00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:28,380
the assignment module for incitement

00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:30,120
submissions it tons of stuff on there in

00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:33,720
Moodle some of them are like yeah I post

00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:37,230
my lecture notes up there so yeah it

00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:41,790
varied wildly so my question about

00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:45,180
Drupal is is since you probably have a

00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:47,250
lot of those sites as well how do you I

00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:49,920
guess you have to have a standard list

00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:52,350
of modules that you yeah so that people

00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:55,100
don't go off the rails here and create

00:56:52,350 --> 00:56:59,580
crazy websites that you have to maintain

00:56:55,100 --> 00:57:01,590
so you set exactly what they get and so

00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:04,560
that you can scale up to a lot of

00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:07,340
website the initial set yes however they

00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:09,690
they do have the ability of uploading

00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:11,940
site specific modules in using that they

00:57:09,690 --> 00:57:13,350
want to yeah we gave them plenty of

00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:15,600
opportunities to shoot themselves in the

00:57:13,350 --> 00:57:17,670
foot you know partly because we just

00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:19,530
didn't have the staff to to you know

00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:21,030
manage at that level and to we wanted to

00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:23,790
give them the control you know and you

00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:24,390
know with you know we I did the you know

00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:25,980
with great power

00:57:24,390 --> 00:57:27,720
our comes great responsibility speech to

00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,980
them know it's like okay you know well

00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,869
i'm going to give you this excess but i

00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:32,069
want you know if you do the wrong thing

00:57:30,869 --> 00:57:35,369
you're going to blow up your site and

00:57:32,069 --> 00:57:38,940
we'll try to help you but you know don't

00:57:35,369 --> 00:57:43,619
be stupid right I guess my final thought

00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:45,240
is question rather is so how are you it

00:57:43,619 --> 00:57:48,089
is this a multi-site environment is a

00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:50,150
single sites that yes really what I was

00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:52,890
getting at the answer to that is yes

00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:53,760
unfortunately and Kenan lands can talk

00:57:52,890 --> 00:57:56,160
more because it's changed significantly

00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:57,839
yeah I want to say originally it was

00:57:56,160 --> 00:58:01,019
multi-site and I think the new

00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:03,750
architecture is not yes simply because

00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:06,750
the multi-site problem was well if i

00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:08,010
upgrade this one source repository then

00:58:06,750 --> 00:58:09,299
everything has to get upgrade our wants

00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:10,440
and we didn't want to work we will did

00:58:09,299 --> 00:58:12,450
want to work around this so that's where

00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:14,160
jenkins kind of tied in we're kind of

00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:15,420
did that more automatically at least

00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,309
that's how i recall it being set up now

00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:19,440
yeah well what we discovered really was

00:58:17,309 --> 00:58:21,000
there's kind of a sweet spot for where

00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,279
multi-site really made sense in the

00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,950
number of sites you know and so for a

00:58:23,279 --> 00:58:27,000
very small number of sites you know

00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:28,019
single sites is probably fine because

00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:30,059
we're only doing with you now four or

00:58:28,019 --> 00:58:32,569
five web brutes you get into the eight

00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:34,799
or ten or twelve site maybe 15 sites

00:58:32,569 --> 00:58:36,480
multi-site that made me make them a

00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:38,640
little more sense but then as that

00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,920
number grows it began then it becomes

00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:42,089
more unwieldy again because you do you

00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:45,990
really want to pull the trigger and up

00:58:42,089 --> 00:58:47,759
late upgrade 150 sites all at once you

00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:49,259
know something is going to blow up and

00:58:47,759 --> 00:58:53,009
so it's much nicer to be able to batch

00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:55,319
those and I think I don't see the Oregon

00:58:53,009 --> 00:58:59,579
State folks here right now OSU on

00:58:55,319 --> 00:59:01,619
Tuesday did a talk on yeah same problem

00:58:59,579 --> 00:59:03,059
exactly the same issue yeah so we ended

00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:05,880
up doing something we did in a slightly

00:59:03,059 --> 00:59:08,910
different way um but it's exactly the

00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:10,259
same problem yeah so yeah I would go if

00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:11,880
you have large numbers of sites I would

00:59:10,259 --> 00:59:13,170
strongly recommend using some sort of

00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,210
continuous integration tool like Jenkins

00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:16,319
and deploying single site unless you

00:59:15,210 --> 00:59:19,099
have a compelling reason why you would

00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:19,099
want to do multi-site

00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:27,059
oh we are I'm sorry yes we are out of

00:59:24,089 --> 00:59:29,520
time okay I was just wondering I'm not a

00:59:27,059 --> 00:59:31,950
teacher but where do curious teachers go

00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:35,160
is there a central website that i missed

00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:38,299
the URL for know and I'm Sicilian forgot

00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:40,530
to put it there but it's or VSD org and

00:59:38,299 --> 00:59:42,359
the site has this was this originally

00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:44,309
meant online five years ago it has not

00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:47,030
changed since so I apologize but it

00:59:44,309 --> 00:59:51,020
works so you know yeah or a VST torg

00:59:47,030 --> 00:59:51,020
