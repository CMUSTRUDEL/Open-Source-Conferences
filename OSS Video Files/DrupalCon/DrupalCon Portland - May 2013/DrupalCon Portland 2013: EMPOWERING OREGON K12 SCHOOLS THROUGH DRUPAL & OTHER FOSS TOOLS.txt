Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: EMPOWERING OREGON K12 SCHOOLS THROUGH DRUPAL & OTHER FOSS TOOLS
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	The Oregon Virtual School District (ORVSD) is a learning platform that has been developed in collaboration with the Oregon Department of Education and the OSU Open Source Lab starting in 2005. In its core, ORVSD is a free resource for online teaching and learning designed to promote the use of technology in Oregon classrooms. Its platform is primarily driven by providing Drupal and Moodle sites for nearly every K12 school in the state of Oregon.

This session will cover a brief history of how it started, explain the infrastructure behind the program, some interesting lessons we learned along the way and finally briefly mention how we plan to scale the services in the future. Our hope is that this platform can be useful for other organization and proven to be a huge value to teachers and students alike.
