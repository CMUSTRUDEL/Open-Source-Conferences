Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description:

Sass has looked to address this issue first with Mixins, then Extends, each with their own issues of duplicated code or creation of unnecessary code.

Sass 3.2 introduces the concept of 'silent classes' whereas standardized presentational classes can be created, but are silent until extended in a class used by the application.
