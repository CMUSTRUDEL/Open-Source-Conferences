Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: TOOLING FOR DRUPAL CORE INITIATIVES
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	Different Drupal 8 core initiatives used different tools to achieve their goals, some of the most common tools included:

IRC meetings at set times
Google Hangouts
issue tags of different kinds (eg. the sprint tag)
heavily organized sprints
http://drupalofficehours.org/
http://vdc.drupalofficehours.org/
groups.drupal.org
http://drupal8multilingual.org/
We wish we'd have tools as rich as envisioned in http://groups.drupal.org/node/144584 but we mostly needed to turn to our own solutions for what worked for our initiatives. What can we learn from these tools and approaches and what kind of improvements would be ideal on Drupal.org to help teams work better.

This is targeted to be more a discussion than a presentation so do not expect leaning back and reading slides all the way.

okay welcome everybody this is tooling

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,639
for core initiatives I'm Gabbar Ho Chi

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:14,429
I'm one of the initiative leads four-two

00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,279
blade and this will hopefully be in

00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:19,680
actual core conversations where you will

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,140
hopefully come up and and discuss the

00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,779
problems that I pose I don't have

00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:29,189
solutions for the problems I have

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:30,890
problems so I will try to outline those

00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:33,600
as best as I can and then we'll see

00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:36,090
where do we get from here so I don't

00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,770
really know where what kind of next

00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:40,770
sections will be able to derive from

00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,930
this conversation but what the

00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,750
methodology that I used for preparing

00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,730
this talk is I best all the core

00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:51,539
initiative leads and the themes in

00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:53,610
Drupal 8 2 to give me their tops top

00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,670
tools that worked for them and top

00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:59,399
things that didn't work for them and

00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:02,460
things that they would love to see on

00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,979
drupal org or in any way to help their

00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,619
initiative succeed and I try to collect

00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:13,439
them in the framework that make sense

00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:15,030
for for what we do so so when I was

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,159
thinking about this talk I actually

00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,500
realized that I i will talk a lot about

00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:22,619
tools but I want to put it into a

00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,770
framework of managing a project in

00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,570
general and this looks like very much a

00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,360
project you would do for our client that

00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:35,009
if you would follow all the steps for

00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:37,110
for for the standard project then we

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,720
usually have a great idea to implement

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,570
and then you would have shot a plan for

00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,369
for what you want it to implement so you

00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,350
would have a higher level plan of where

00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:48,780
you want to go why you want to do it at

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:51,689
all what kind of priorities you have

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,189
that you want to achieve and then you

00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:56,820
would break that plant down to

00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:58,290
actionable items so in agile terms you

00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,240
would have epics that you break down to

00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,700
user stories for example

00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,770
and you would estimate those things how

00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,750
long would they take and then you would

00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,060
have a backlog of issues with priorities

00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,160
that you want to work on and

00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:13,230
dependencies between them and then you

00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,090
would take some of these issues into

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,769
sprints and work on them so you could

00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,610
get closer to resolution and you would

00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:23,280
work on your most important things and

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:25,170
you would test those things and pair

00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,390
program and whatever other nice things

00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:29,489
you want to use there and then you would

00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,110
need to report of course for the client

00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:33,000
and you would need to figure out what

00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:36,480
you did and and if you did what you

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,700
wanted to do so you would do progress

00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,260
reporting and then you would reflect on

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,209
what you did and whether you did it

00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:44,640
right and what you want to improve and

00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:46,200
go back to either part of the cycle to

00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,170
take a new stories for the next sprint

00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:54,150
or replan or do other important things

00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:55,830
there so at least this is my experience

00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,900
from several other projects outside of

00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:01,319
the Drupal community where you have

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,910
control over over what comes in and the

00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,890
team that you're working with and the

00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:08,190
output and you have a client to report

00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:09,750
to etc that sounds very formal but when

00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,840
I look through all the stuff that we do

00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,519
in Drupal core now we go through all

00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,840
these steps although we might not

00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,269
realize we are going through all these

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,799
steps we actually do and we do a very

00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:25,170
poor job of doing a lot of these things

00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:29,670
so what I think I think what we excel at

00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:32,450
is this is part of the Sprint's step so

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:35,790
we have we have tools to work on stuff

00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:38,459
but we a lot of the times we don't

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:40,290
really consider the the framework of why

00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:43,590
we are doing it where do we want to go

00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,239
how do we tell people what we did and

00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,650
just reflect on if we are doing the

00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:48,799
right thing and if we want to move

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,780
elsewhere etcetera so we have a lot of

00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,930
randomness in our process and there are

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,150
multiple reasons for that as Greg always

00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,010
says we are we are this big project but

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,739
we don't have any resources to allocate

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:05,160
for for our work so we can't really plan

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:06,690
at all so we want to we want to do all

00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,570
the enterprise stuff but we don't really

00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:12,780
have all the resources for that to do

00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:14,340
we are also very of control so we don't

00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,010
really like to have a project manager

00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,690
that tells us what to do so I think it

00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:22,520
was really for me it was really

00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:26,040
interesting to see that we we've set up

00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,500
we've set up initiative calls every

00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,410
every two weeks we have an initiative

00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,720
phone call with the initiative leads and

00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:36,780
we brought on some project managers to

00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,630
help us and then we were at least my

00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:42,060
experience may I might not talk for

00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:44,880
every initiative Lee but my experience

00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,740
is we were very resistant to actually

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:49,830
listen to what the project mages were

00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:51,540
trying us to do like oh I don't have

00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,940
time for planning this out and I don't

00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,560
have time for first estimating this and

00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,650
I don't have time for figuring out my

00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,480
dependencies and then I think as we went

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:02,490
we understood that we are actually

00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,560
managing such a big project that we

00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,960
would need to do that and we were

00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,650
growing ourselves into actually

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,390
accepting that that's what we need to do

00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:14,610
and the other problem is we have our

00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:17,180
issue queue has the primary tool and I

00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:21,330
think the issue queue is very good to

00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:24,750
focus on what we do in the now so what

00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:28,500
we want to do now but it's not very good

00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:31,070
at figuring out why we do it what what's

00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,840
the output that we are looking for and

00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:38,280
what is proceeding it was following it

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,050
so putting it into context and and just

00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:42,810
and just making it work in the whole

00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:44,280
process so we have the issue queue as

00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:46,110
the primary tool and everything that we

00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,210
did in our initiatives have alternate

00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:50,700
issue queues and trying to augment the

00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:52,640
issue queue with different tools to to

00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:55,230
help our initiatives grow

00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:57,420
and the reason we need to use the issue

00:05:55,230 --> 00:06:00,930
queue is because to get a cup that get a

00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:03,660
comment in Drupal core it's only going

00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:05,850
to happen if it has a core issue and the

00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:07,740
reviewers for the core issue will only

00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:10,260
review it if it has discussion that

00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,900
proves that it was discussed and there

00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,480
were multiple options explored and the

00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,400
right option was was proven to work and

00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:20,220
they will only have discussion if you

00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:22,080
post patches on the issue so we have the

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:24,960
whole process map that from patch to

00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:29,340
commit that that will only work if we

00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:31,020
have an issue for it so we if we if we

00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,970
do it at other places then there's no

00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,700
visibility of what we are doing so we

00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:39,180
kind of are putting ourselves in the

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,710
issue queue and the whole process drives

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,960
us to do that and the issue queue

00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,730
experience probably for us who work here

00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,980
every day is very cool because we have

00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:49,020
all this information of what's going on

00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,510
but somebody coming in and then they

00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,480
want to like see what's going on in to

00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:56,670
play multilingual it's just a whole

00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,460
bunch of things that they can't make out

00:06:56,670 --> 00:07:01,860
it's like what the hell so this is the

00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:04,040
list of the sprint task for Drupal 8

00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:07,080
multilingual that I took yesterday and

00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,790
it's just a whole bunch of stuff so it's

00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,790
kind of hard to tell what's what's

00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:14,130
actually going on here and who's doing

00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,410
it and why they are doing it and there

00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:19,710
are if there are things marking stuff

00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:21,750
important by importance but then we have

00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,390
normal task that we are actively working

00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:27,840
on its critical task so it's kind of

00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:30,520
hard to tell what's going on at all here

00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,620
but we do a lot we do AG meant the issue

00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,440
queue with a lot of tools so when I've

00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,110
asked for initiatives what do you do

00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,550
I've got a lot of a lot of good answers

00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,919
so we'll walk through some of these and

00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:45,009
we'll see which one we're successful and

00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,650
we're only not so for planning we do a

00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:49,569
lot of real-time planning so we get

00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,909
together at Sprint's we have this

00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:54,190
drupalcon we have actually three days of

00:07:51,909 --> 00:07:57,250
sprinting before the sessions and three

00:07:54,190 --> 00:08:00,729
days of sprinting after the sessions so

00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:02,470
we have six days in total by the side of

00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:04,659
the session days for sprinting which is

00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,849
a lot and we use white boards and we use

00:08:04,659 --> 00:08:09,430
we use all kinds of discussion tools

00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:11,380
there when we are not together we use

00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:14,229
google hangouts in skype to just figure

00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:16,240
out stuff I think what we do usually

00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:18,819
approve job is making notes of what we

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:21,099
do there and if we have meetings then

00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:25,050
set out goals of why we do the meeting

00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:28,110
at all and what we want to get out of it

00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:31,479
and then we have some semi real-time

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:34,089
solutions where we're like I've heard

00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:36,130
the view steam and the also the spark

00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:39,669
team that I'm working with and the

00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:41,589
entity team used Google Docs to map out

00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:43,450
different issues and problems and just

00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:46,000
break down things into smaller pieces in

00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:48,880
the figure out priorities and we also

00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,680
use etherpad to make notes which is a

00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,420
real should very similar to Google Docs

00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,230
it's a real-time text editing thing if

00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:57,730
you use Google Docs documents as well

00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,550
and that's somewhat more useful because

00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:02,770
we are already making notes what we

00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:04,899
don't do often is share those notes with

00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:07,300
people because they are very rough so

00:09:04,899 --> 00:09:09,459
it's not very accessible to those who

00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:10,959
are not at the meeting but at least for

00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:12,970
these we have notes and then we can

00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,029
refer back to them my gripe with

00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:17,860
etherpad is I don't I lose etherpad URLs

00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:19,899
very quickly I don't have tools for

00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:24,880
saving either by you or else I should

00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:26,529
have so I often lose those notes we also

00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,290
have white net discussions on groups

00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:31,570
that duplin org which is which is more

00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:34,209
open to the community so Google Docs and

00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,709
etherpad if you know there's a meeting

00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:36,620
and there's a link to the Google Doc you

00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,870
will go there and

00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,290
we'll be able to read them right but if

00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:44,030
you don't know you will not be included

00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:47,240
we also do wide open discussion some

00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:50,600
groups out to put an org of course the

00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:52,820
tool is has so it's good because there's

00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,590
a lot of people seeing it it's not very

00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,660
good for us because it's very easy to go

00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:58,100
off topic and to go on branch

00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,570
discussions and all kinds of problems

00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,220
and we don't have tools on groups at

00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:04,130
Oakland or to break out that discussions

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:08,930
into smaller pieces so so that's what we

00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:10,850
found there as an issue and then we are

00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:14,540
trying to report what we what we planned

00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:16,640
right so often we write up our

00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:17,960
discussions from personal meetings and

00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,080
Google Docs and we post them in groups

00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:23,060
of Dublin org or on Drupal planet or we

00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:26,110
push the list of issues into a meta

00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:31,750
issue or we person Greece's blog

00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:35,510
announcements for major things I think

00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:38,000
we should do a lot more of this and we

00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:42,080
also don't do a very good job of

00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,080
referring back to our plans when we when

00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,030
we when we do stuff so we don't really

00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:51,560
put stuff into context of where we

00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:55,010
planned that at least my impression and

00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,480
then we have those plans sat down and we

00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:59,420
need to break them down and that's

00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,660
that's where that's where the ish accuse

00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:04,340
come in pretty heavily so we use meta

00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:07,790
issues to track some of these plans

00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:09,410
which connect larger pieces into the

00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:11,150
actual issues that we want to work on

00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:13,840
and we also use them for reporting we

00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:16,310
post back updates to what's happening

00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,890
the usual problem is there is not a lot

00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:20,780
of good meta information in most meta

00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:22,430
issues so it's just a list of a bunch of

00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,530
related issues and then you still need

00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:27,790
to figure out what it's what it means

00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:30,290
and why anybody did that

00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:32,330
and then we are very good at handling

00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:34,580
handling the issues themselves so we

00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:37,910
made up a very elaborate system of tags

00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:40,760
and different different category systems

00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:43,280
for for maintaining our issues and we do

00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:45,080
manual parent sub and related issue

00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,570
management there is a Drupal 7 upgrade

00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:50,660
coming up on drupal.org that includes

00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:54,500
more formal support for parents and sub

00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:58,730
issues and related issues but tagging is

00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:01,310
the is the non plus ultra of issue

00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:03,710
management and drupal org and I thought

00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:05,030
we are not doing an estimation obviously

00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:06,920
we can't really estimate how long

00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:08,180
something will take because we don't

00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,650
know who's going to do it and we don't

00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,260
know who's going to argue about it for

00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:14,690
months so we can't really estimate in

00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,910
the sense of actual project estimation

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,740
what we do instead is we are trying to

00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:21,320
guide people on two issues that are

00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:23,150
likely fit fitting for them so what we

00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,130
do is we use tags like novice

00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:27,050
challenging medium and we and we do

00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:30,170
actual meta issues which are in itself

00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:34,190
complex so we try to indicate that the

00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:35,780
challenging level of issues and then try

00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:38,660
to educate people about what these

00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:40,580
levels mean but we can't really estimate

00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,680
in the sense of this will take two weeks

00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:46,490
or two months because we have no idea

00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,320
whatsoever and then we have priority

00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:49,700
tracking which also is pretty

00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:56,720
interesting because there's a global

00:12:49,700 --> 00:13:02,840
priority on issues which is not always

00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:05,150
used appropriately and that many teams

00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,830
use Google Docs to to manage their their

00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:08,360
priority issues for example the spark

00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:11,540
team used to use Google Docs with the

00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,280
magic drupal.org Jason stuff where it

00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:15,260
pulled in all the data from from

00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,390
drupal.org for the issue and then we can

00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:20,600
add additional priority information for

00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:22,220
our personal priorities in spark that we

00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,670
would of course not post on drupal.org

00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:29,210
because that would freak people out many

00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:31,779
initiatives use a sprint tag so they tag

00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:34,029
their own issues with their own

00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:36,279
tax and also the spring tag which means

00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:38,230
they are currently focused on focusing

00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:41,139
on those issues such as in the current

00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,819
priority of their work independent of

00:13:41,139 --> 00:13:45,490
whether they are major or minor or

00:13:42,819 --> 00:13:47,680
normal issues globally and there's also

00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:50,230
personal priorities so we have this

00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,809
talking Carl tag and we have favorite of

00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:54,639
Greece and we have Greg who would love

00:13:52,809 --> 00:13:58,389
to have a personal attack but he's very

00:13:54,639 --> 00:14:00,790
abusing a personal attack he told me

00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:03,779
what you said you would love to use a

00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:06,009
personal priority tag on drupal.org

00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:09,100
there's at least two people having

00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:11,680
personal priority tags but you don't

00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,360
want to use it so anybody if everybody

00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,290
would start to use personal priority

00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,610
text and there will be a disaster right

00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:21,160
priority of chicks priority of white

00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:24,999
said priority of yeah they would be not

00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:26,709
good there's two people um which is fine

00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:30,749
I mean there's there's no problem with

00:14:26,709 --> 00:14:30,749
that I think um

00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:38,169
and then and then yeah so that's so

00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,619
that's all the tools that we use for

00:14:38,169 --> 00:14:43,629
break down and then we took up took from

00:14:41,619 --> 00:14:45,399
all those all those issues what we want

00:14:43,629 --> 00:14:48,069
to actually work on them and put them

00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:49,600
into sprints and there are some

00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:51,459
initiatives that are structured that

00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,319
they use the Sprint tag and others just

00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:55,569
use their last issues on drupal.org or

00:14:53,319 --> 00:14:58,119
they use Google Docs to track what they

00:14:55,569 --> 00:15:00,249
are currently working on there are quite

00:14:58,119 --> 00:15:01,629
a few initiatives using Sun boxes for

00:15:00,249 --> 00:15:03,699
different things where they focus their

00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:06,850
work that their current work and when

00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:09,189
they feel like it's ready for public

00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:11,109
consumption they push to the triple

00:15:09,189 --> 00:15:13,539
inorg issue queue so they've they focus

00:15:11,109 --> 00:15:15,160
their current work in their sandbox it's

00:15:13,539 --> 00:15:16,809
good because they can make very good

00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:18,189
progress there it's not that good

00:15:16,809 --> 00:15:19,949
because it doesn't really have

00:15:18,189 --> 00:15:22,899
visibility for the rest of the community

00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:25,359
but they don't necessarily need to use

00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:27,100
issues which is great they can just push

00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:30,429
in to get and use all kinds of branches

00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,079
and have fun and and then there's at

00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:34,629
least two third-party tools that help

00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,689
with these Sprint's the Corps officers

00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:40,799
to land a rocketship tool I've anybody

00:15:37,689 --> 00:15:44,889
heard about core office hours anybody

00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:48,399
yeah okay that's good rocketship

00:15:44,889 --> 00:15:51,790
yeah that's insiders that's cool so so

00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,859
so Corps officer is is like this so as

00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:55,749
I've said we we live in we live on

00:15:53,859 --> 00:15:58,269
issues so this this is based off of

00:15:55,749 --> 00:15:59,649
issues so you pull in an issue and then

00:15:58,269 --> 00:16:01,389
you can add a lot of other meta

00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:03,999
information on top and assigned to

00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:06,339
people based on different tasks that are

00:16:03,999 --> 00:16:07,989
involved in the issue and then then

00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:10,209
mentor there's people on those tasks on

00:16:07,989 --> 00:16:12,669
those issues so this acknowledge is that

00:16:10,209 --> 00:16:14,379
an issue is not really one thing it's

00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:15,910
multiple things that you need to do and

00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:17,829
then multiple people to do multiple

00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:20,589
things and then helps manage all that

00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:23,709
stuff and and is used for for mentoring

00:16:20,589 --> 00:16:26,319
people on these things and and some

00:16:23,709 --> 00:16:29,129
successful initiatives use core

00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:32,169
mentoring to getting issues that are

00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:34,059
that are useful for people who who are

00:16:32,169 --> 00:16:35,859
not necessarily very experienced in

00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:38,769
Drupal and can come in and help with

00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:41,980
different things and there's a rocket

00:16:38,769 --> 00:16:44,889
ship which the multilingual initiative

00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:48,699
users and the entity initiative is also

00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:51,579
somewhat using is also issue raised same

00:16:48,699 --> 00:16:53,290
thing but it's just just a visual and

00:16:51,579 --> 00:16:55,360
focused way of listing the issue

00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:57,790
information it's not really acting on

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,619
issues in any way so this is the focus

00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,239
board for the multilingual initiative is

00:16:59,619 --> 00:17:04,839
lists all the issues which are tagged

00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:06,549
with the am I in sprint and it it lists

00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:09,699
them out in to do to review to be

00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:11,620
committed and done under these and you

00:17:09,699 --> 00:17:14,230
can see the priorities of them who it is

00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:15,699
assigned to and this is essentially the

00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,220
list of stuff that we are currently

00:17:15,699 --> 00:17:20,079
working on and what's going in to be to

00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:22,029
me to be committed we very actively

00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:25,029
pastor or committees to actually commit

00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:26,980
them very fast because we hate when

00:17:25,029 --> 00:17:29,309
anything is on the right column that

00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,309
looks bad

00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:33,630
so we built these two tools because the

00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:37,260
drupal.org issue queue as you've seen is

00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:40,230
is not very friendly for those coming in

00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:42,000
who are not really involved yet and they

00:17:40,230 --> 00:17:45,360
have a very hard time figuring out what

00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,650
to do so but these two tools approach

00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,700
the same problem from very different

00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:52,320
perspectives so the core mentoring tool

00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:54,420
wants to break down the tasks into even

00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,940
smaller pieces and then pair people up

00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:59,490
to do them and help mentor them and go

00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:02,910
to it and the multilingual ish ative

00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:04,950
rocket ship to liz is to show what we

00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:06,870
are what's our current focus and what we

00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,630
currently working on in the same tool is

00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:12,000
also used to have lists of related

00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,220
issues so you can have our views of what

00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,200
are the what are the important things so

00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,030
we also have a tab of content property

00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,720
issues which are very important for us

00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:27,890
and that's also a board of issues for a

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:30,120
specific topic so so this is also also a

00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:32,370
informational communicational tool for

00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:34,530
us to communicate with those coming in

00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:35,700
is what's going on right now and what

00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,490
are the important things we are

00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:40,830
currently working on and then we are

00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:42,450
also using all kinds of discussion tools

00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:45,150
outside of issue cues to talk about

00:18:42,450 --> 00:18:47,610
these things so we use Google Hangouts

00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:50,160
we use regular phone calls we use skype

00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:52,200
use IRC we use group stupid or events to

00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:54,630
announce these things and then we use

00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:57,510
Google Calendar to if we have recurring

00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:59,430
events to get people know about them at

00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:01,650
least I've got multiple people like

00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:04,230
complaining to me when I did not put

00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,730
stuff into shared google calendars

00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:08,610
because they never know when evens are

00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:10,860
based on other things so we use a lot of

00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:12,600
other tools to communicate outside of

00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,570
issue cues that are again not

00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:18,570
necessarily pushed back to the issue

00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:21,120
queues and then when we when we are done

00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:23,250
with stuff in the issue cues we usually

00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,800
want to report about them but

00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:28,200
that again we I don't think we do a very

00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:31,290
stellar job about them so we have meta

00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,990
issues which which which are collections

00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:37,950
of related issues and we sometimes

00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:39,810
update them with progress I think I've

00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:42,030
seen more often cases when we don't

00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:44,160
update them we forget about them we

00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:45,420
created matter issues so we know what

00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,610
are the issues but then we don't come

00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,170
back to them we have some unified ways

00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:50,490
of letting the community know about

00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:53,880
what's going on we have the core

00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:56,700
initiatives page which Shannon and some

00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,670
other people very hairy CLE update when

00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:02,130
they have time but it's it's human-based

00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:05,160
so so there's a lot of effort going

00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:07,080
there and and if those humans have other

00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,660
priorities in their life obviously will

00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,120
not necessarily update understandably

00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:14,730
and we do occasionally drupal planet

00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:22,620
posts and very occasionally three posts

00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:26,250
about progress on his blog as well and

00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:29,940
then so so what I found in my initiative

00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:31,530
for reporting is that that we can tell

00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,120
what's going on right now and we can

00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,070
drive people in but we don't really

00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,760
where we really missed a lot of other

00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:41,520
things that we can use to to to tell the

00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:43,500
world about what we do so I built a

00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,350
whole system around integrating all the

00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:48,300
things that we that we have and try to

00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:51,860
move away from issue queue as our

00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:56,310
primary tool to to to a full-on

00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:58,950
reporting and an team team management

00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:01,400
system essentially so that we can

00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:04,560
communicate what we are planning to do

00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:06,180
we can communicate the breakdown of the

00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,040
different topic areas that we are

00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,870
working on so that we can communicate

00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:11,730
what's being we are working on which is

00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:13,590
both important for us and important for

00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:17,610
anybody else who's looking at what were

00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:19,380
you doing we can hopefully be part of

00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,910
what we are working on which

00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:24,030
we don't even do wery well in the

00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:27,960
modeling or initiative and and and

00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:30,540
reflection in terms of all the meeting

00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:32,550
notes that we have and all the findings

00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:35,970
that we then we find in these in these

00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:37,860
meetings and posting about them so what

00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:42,510
I built a round rocket ship is a whole

00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:44,730
whole system of stuff which I think

00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:48,240
improves on the on the experience a lot

00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:50,340
and this is unfortunately was not really

00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,640
possible to do one drupal org so I built

00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:55,530
a whole independent site for this which

00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:59,160
actually was built very easily so these

00:21:55,530 --> 00:22:01,620
are mostly just blocks and notes so what

00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:03,720
this is about is just a summary of the

00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:05,520
initiative and what we do so we have a

00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:08,430
visual summary of the main things that

00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:12,060
we are focused on and short summary of

00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:14,190
our initiative we have events of what's

00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:16,110
going to happen when you can find us on

00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:19,640
IRC when there's in person meetings I

00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:23,790
have pictures of buddies were involved

00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:26,280
actual flesh-and-blood and we have news

00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:29,190
about what we did and what we are about

00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:31,800
to do and we have a twitter feed for for

00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:33,840
all the updates so you can just come

00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:36,840
here and have a sense of of the team

00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,730
working on this when you can connect

00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,610
with us why we are doing this what we

00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:45,750
want to achieve where we are going and

00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:47,730
what's happening right now um and and

00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:50,430
it's very easy I mean it was very easy

00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:54,210
to do this because the first column is a

00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:57,150
static node the second column might the

00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:59,250
team is also a static image the meetings

00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:01,110
is a block that I regularly updates the

00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:03,710
latest news is an aggregator thing and

00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:07,080
the twitter feed is full HTML block

00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:09,120
JavaScript I have a news page which is

00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,560
aggregator module it's aggregates from

00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,260
all the blogs of all the people working

00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:15,660
on initiative attacked for initiative I

00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:17,700
have a video stage where i put up the

00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,200
videos of my my sessions on other

00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,750
people's sessions about the initiative

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,820
so you can watch Francesco plus sellers

00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,380
interview in modules and rebels or my

00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,840
back camp session about the

00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:29,730
initiative we have the focus issues page

00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,680
which you've seen earlier is our what we

00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:34,080
are currently working on and then we

00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,270
have focused pages for novice issues for

00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,120
issues that need screenshots for issues

00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:42,030
that are challenging etc and we have

00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:44,310
topic pages for topical issues summaries

00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:46,650
like content property issues and that we

00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:49,230
have a meetings ends and sprints with

00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:51,000
the google calendar and information of

00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:54,390
what's going on win and we have a team

00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,370
page of even more pictures and and names

00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:58,380
of actual user names of actual people

00:23:56,370 --> 00:24:00,990
working on initiative so you can find

00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:02,670
who you can work with and then we have a

00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:04,350
contact form to contact us if you really

00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:08,400
want to but nobody ever used that page

00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:13,350
so it didn't prove to be really well so

00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:16,500
I think site so my so in summary what I

00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:18,360
found is we are very focused on issues

00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,690
as a primary tool because that's the

00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:23,930
only way we can get something into core

00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:26,220
so we need to work with issues right now

00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:29,760
we can augment them with different

00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:32,070
things so what we what we really needed

00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:36,210
to get people into into our initiative

00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:37,940
was to have times when we can we can

00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:41,070
meet with people so meetings and

00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:42,570
information about that we have people

00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:45,690
actually working on the initiative

00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:48,330
visibility of them so you can talk to

00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:50,130
them and then the plans of what we're

00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:52,380
actually working on so you know what you

00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:54,690
can work on and we wanted to integrate

00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,760
all this into here so if somebody comes

00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:59,130
in and wants to know what what's the

00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,470
goals what's going on right now who I

00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:03,780
can talk to win then they can see the

00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:07,020
whole spectrum I think what we do a very

00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:09,300
poor job here is reporting because our

00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,890
latest news is both upcoming stuff and

00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,690
plans and all kinds of things so we

00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:16,110
don't really do very good job of

00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:18,090
reporting what we do even but I think

00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:20,960
this is a much more integrated

00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,960
experience of

00:25:21,159 --> 00:25:26,019
of a tool set for an initiative that

00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:27,879
that helps people on board and helps

00:25:26,019 --> 00:25:29,679
people get engaged and get involved in

00:25:27,879 --> 00:25:32,109
and keep being involved in the in the

00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,659
community there's there was a proposal

00:25:32,109 --> 00:25:37,509
on drupal.org for something similar

00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:41,379
called topic pages and it was part of

00:25:37,509 --> 00:25:43,960
the prayer prairie initiative and they

00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:45,639
worked very hard on this they did great

00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,979
designs and then they've said ready for

00:25:45,639 --> 00:25:49,599
implementation and it's ready for

00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:52,690
implementation for anything two years

00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:55,019
now so if anybody wants to jump on it

00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:57,879
then there's some great designs for this

00:25:55,019 --> 00:26:00,159
so what this focused on is is to have

00:25:57,879 --> 00:26:02,950
have a similar experience on drupal.org

00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:07,299
for teams where you can see who's on

00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:12,009
this team what are they doing at all the

00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:14,200
activity and all their topic sub topics

00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:16,119
and related topics integrate it all

00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,729
together so this is not really

00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:22,570
integrating evens or plans or anything

00:26:18,729 --> 00:26:25,029
else unless you actually put put static

00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:27,190
content in here but it's more like more

00:26:25,029 --> 00:26:29,859
like lively like a facebook wall for

00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:32,349
your for your for your team essentially

00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:33,960
so there were very great great plans to

00:26:32,349 --> 00:26:36,309
do some of this on drupal org

00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,919
unfortunately it didn't happen and i

00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:41,440
think the reason that that both the

00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:44,289
Kauravas our esteem and myself went with

00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:47,289
an off drupal.org solution was that we

00:26:44,289 --> 00:26:52,389
have we have our home goes with our own

00:26:47,289 --> 00:26:54,039
stuff and diverting in are diverting

00:26:52,389 --> 00:26:56,289
instead of our home goes to drupal our

00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:58,869
work was not really an option because we

00:26:56,289 --> 00:27:00,609
have their own goals to reach so we have

00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:02,859
deadlines with Drupal 8 that we need to

00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:06,279
be so we need to have a very fast

00:27:02,859 --> 00:27:10,269
solution than our site was ready in less

00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:11,470
than a week so so at so that's all the

00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:15,149
information I gathered from the

00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:19,349
initiative leads and

00:27:15,149 --> 00:27:21,450
and in short my conclusion is we really

00:27:19,349 --> 00:27:23,159
do a good job of what we do in the now

00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:26,279
with our issues we have a fantastic

00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:28,169
tagging system we have this great tool

00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:31,979
for onboarding people with the Kauravas

00:27:28,169 --> 00:27:34,169
our site what we do a poor job of is to

00:27:31,979 --> 00:27:36,210
have a planning system that we can refer

00:27:34,169 --> 00:27:37,769
back to and that people understand what

00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:40,619
we are doing why we are doing it and

00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:43,229
then reporting system that output from

00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:45,419
this is to YY Twitter this and what we

00:27:43,229 --> 00:27:47,429
did and then cycling that back all

00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:50,309
together and if you look at that it's

00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:52,320
really really a full on project

00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:56,099
management experience where you like me

00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:59,789
to go from go from A to Z and do all

00:27:56,099 --> 00:28:02,039
that and we are as Greg said pretty much

00:27:59,789 --> 00:28:04,559
way beyond the point where where it was

00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:07,739
it was feasible to do for for a few

00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,450
people so it's really a really a big big

00:28:07,739 --> 00:28:13,979
theme system that we need to build and

00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:16,739
maintain so that's so that's my overview

00:28:13,979 --> 00:28:20,039
and I would like to open this up for

00:28:16,739 --> 00:28:23,719
discussions I don't have solutions for

00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:23,719
the problems as I've said

00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:37,910
I have to be first yes so I mean it's

00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,710
obvious we need better project

00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,450
management tools and it's good and

00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:43,040
obviously this is new for us since we've

00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:47,660
only just recently realized we need

00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:51,830
project management at all um but uh do

00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:54,170
you have an opinion about the sort of

00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:57,650
buy it or build a question because

00:28:54,170 --> 00:29:00,320
historically our track record of in

00:28:57,650 --> 00:29:04,970
doing major improvements to drupal.org

00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:07,070
is not the best and and you know we've

00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:09,800
we've done okay doing very very large

00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:11,390
projects and we've done okay doing very

00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:13,400
very small projects and it's stuff in

00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:15,500
between that we've done almost nothing

00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:19,940
of really when it comes right down to it

00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:22,100
and so on the one hand it's very

00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:24,440
difficult to imagine a world in which

00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:26,780
will ever get better at that especially

00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,340
without more drupal.org dedicated staff

00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:30,580
of which we really only have one and

00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:33,920
that's drum on the infrastructure side

00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:36,440
but on the other hand there's a lot to

00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:39,950
be said about you know this is our home

00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:42,080
and we own it right and and this is this

00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:44,390
is we build what we need we eat our own

00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,180
dog food and all of that and you know if

00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:49,520
we go off on to another place what would

00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:51,950
that place be and you know what happens

00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:53,480
when they sell themselves to yahoo and

00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:56,060
yahoo shuts them down and things like

00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,640
this and yeah and I was sort of

00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:02,330
wondering what your feelings are about

00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:06,920
that so I think that those probably

00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:08,300
multiple things so so so yes we don't

00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,850
have the project management tools and

00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:13,370
yes we figure that we need them um and

00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:16,460
and yes we already built this big

00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:17,840
project module suite that we don't well

00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,520
maintained because we don't have enough

00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:22,310
people working on it which is painful

00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:24,570
and drum does a great job of doing what

00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:28,259
he can but he's one person not temper

00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:32,789
10 people so that's understandable but i

00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:40,380
think it's doing a very good job um so i

00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:42,240
think so i think we so we are just got

00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,919
to a point where we are getting more and

00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,710
more companies to dedicate people to

00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:49,470
Drupal core development and Drupal core

00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:51,389
is already very summit so they use

00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:53,940
Drupal core but a lot of companies

00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:55,980
didn't realize that that they are better

00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:58,169
off if they dedicate people to that and

00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:01,259
I think group of that arc is one step

00:30:58,169 --> 00:31:03,090
further it's a meta-level and and we are

00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:05,250
not yet there to even have the right

00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:08,370
amount of people working on Drupal core

00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:09,960
paid to or finance to work on it so we

00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:13,440
would need to reach a level where we

00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:16,200
have the kind of dedication where where

00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,539
where sponsors or companies realize that

00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,370
if they if they if they finance people

00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:23,429
to work on the tools that's even bigger

00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:26,279
because that helps scale eligible to a

00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:27,990
level where we're even more people will

00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:31,559
work for them yeah it's interesting

00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:33,629
because I mean we really do need to I

00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:36,330
mean you know we have if we find it hard

00:31:33,629 --> 00:31:39,210
enough just funding core development but

00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:41,190
now we need to now we need to come up

00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:43,620
with a whole organization for this meta

00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:45,840
stuff too right and there's so much of

00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:48,779
the meta stuff it's not just our tools

00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:53,220
on drupal.org but I mean but you know

00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:54,990
like the the these so-called what the

00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,940
training gap or whatever right the

00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:58,529
ability to bring in new core developers

00:31:56,940 --> 00:32:00,299
and when you guys have done very well

00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:01,799
with core mentoring and that's good but

00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:04,169
there's more of that that needs to be

00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:07,610
done too I mean you know one sprint

00:32:04,169 --> 00:32:12,620
three times a year isn't enough and

00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:16,280
in the past six months shows what I know

00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:19,700
um and not to mention on to online every

00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:21,650
week of course but I mean there's a ton

00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,299
of this meta stuff that like it seems

00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:26,150
like we're only beginning to talk about

00:32:23,299 --> 00:32:27,679
and it's already like like we should

00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:29,809
have been talking about it like five

00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,610
years ago so it's like we're already so

00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:33,320
far behind that seems like some of these

00:32:31,610 --> 00:32:36,559
issues are already gotten so big that

00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,870
it's like almost unapproachable yeah I

00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,910
think we'd so as I've started to talk I

00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:43,910
think we just realized it ourselves so I

00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:45,770
think woods yes Mike's sorry I didn't

00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:50,020
mean to crush everybody's spirits there

00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:50,020
so Mike's although it is what I do best

00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:55,040
so my experience from from our

00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:56,750
discussions earlier as we as our

00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,220
initiative leads were very resistant to

00:32:56,750 --> 00:33:00,020
all the project management stuff at the

00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:02,750
start like a year and a half ago or a

00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:05,600
year ago so we just grew into okay we

00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:09,380
really need this stuff so now we are

00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,850
like oh we're screwed so I wasn't I mean

00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,440
I was kind of late to the game too we

00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:14,870
didn't get on the scrum calls until last

00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,570
October so September i guess it was but

00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:20,929
I i love the project management and i

00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:22,130
find it very helpful um sorry that's not

00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:26,419
what I'm that's not I'm standing here

00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:27,740
I'm so why what I was um the thing that

00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:31,880
the thing that concerns me is I think

00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:35,480
that we as initiative leaves as core

00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:38,179
developers we know what we need from

00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,070
drupal.org that it doesn't do and it's

00:33:38,179 --> 00:33:41,510
chemie it's time consuming to try to

00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:43,970
communicate that to other people and

00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:45,320
it's and we don't laugh like you said we

00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:46,429
don't have the time to help fix this

00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,440
problem the right way on drupal.org

00:33:46,429 --> 00:33:50,750
ourselves because you already have other

00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,640
priorities that are more time sensitive

00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:57,020
in that are critical edge of future um

00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:58,100
and I mean even recently they're you

00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:00,020
know they're working on the issue queue

00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,970
upgrade the Drupal 7 upgrade then they

00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:05,330
had there's a new version of triple dog

00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:07,010
issues that's there and no I on the one

00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,270
hand I was very worried about that I'm

00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,649
like oh I really want to help review and

00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,970
test this this is this is going to be

00:34:09,649 --> 00:34:12,619
very important it's going to affect work

00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:13,909
that I do every day and so you know

00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:16,100
there was an email thread and there's a

00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:17,480
dev site and I never got back to it and

00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,109
tested them and give them feedback just

00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,440
because there's so

00:34:18,109 --> 00:34:23,389
much other stuff taking up my time and

00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,159
so I you know I I don't have an answer

00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:26,809
for this but I don't know that you have

00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:31,519
an answer for it's like what what can we

00:34:26,809 --> 00:34:33,589
do so that we have a way for people who

00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:35,989
are busy to give the feedback about what

00:34:33,589 --> 00:34:38,480
they're busy about to people who have or

00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:39,679
with or without funding who are going to

00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,589
actually do the work to build these

00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,329
tools so other than you and I don't know

00:34:42,589 --> 00:34:45,739
how you do everything that you do I mean

00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:47,929
he's like this guy is like a project

00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:50,539
manager and he built that website and

00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:51,950
like he still has like a whole job with

00:34:50,539 --> 00:34:54,259
you know responsibilities in the job

00:34:51,950 --> 00:35:00,349
that it's amazing so anyway I don't I

00:34:54,259 --> 00:35:02,450
don't know how to solve that so so so

00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:07,519
yeah so so just trying to get feedback

00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:10,369
for this session was very hard it's like

00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:13,609
please tell me your paint just write

00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:14,989
down your pains please please please so

00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:17,180
even just getting out the pains of

00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:19,069
people is hard so I think I think I

00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:22,190
think like having this session is is

00:35:19,069 --> 00:35:24,380
this is a step right so we just try to

00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:26,650
organize our pains and what and what we

00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:30,140
do and what what's not working for us

00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:33,499
and on the other hand I think we are

00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:36,170
doing a lot of that feedback wise so I

00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:37,849
think we are better at at letting out

00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:40,759
improvements than actually making them

00:35:37,849 --> 00:35:44,269
happen so we have this nice plan that's

00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:46,519
nice there's also Michael kiara user

00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:49,670
advocate had a session yesterday on

00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:52,640
issue qs u X and he had great proposals

00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:55,519
for for secure improvement and the groom

00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:58,279
of this size is like how many seats

00:35:55,519 --> 00:36:01,069
there are like 600 / Tyra no I don't

00:35:58,279 --> 00:36:05,989
know and and he had 10 people attending

00:36:01,069 --> 00:36:08,720
this session I know I've dup that's not

00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:10,700
personally knew I'm just saying that as

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,230
that so that was that was the level of

00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:15,770
interest in the metal level of of

00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:28,280
improving our workplace the issue queue

00:36:15,770 --> 00:36:29,660
so we're one of the yeah so that was so

00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,460
that was an interesting session they had

00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:33,560
good insights into the issue queue and

00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:38,030
how we improve our workplace like it's

00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:40,400
online now and so I think so they made

00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:42,920
they made up plans and these are plans

00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,830
and there are good plans but then we

00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:48,020
don't we we don't with so as with the

00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:49,640
core initiatives we have great plans but

00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:52,460
we also need to rally people to actually

00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:55,040
implement them so it's not it's not

00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:56,540
enough to put put up great pictures now

00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,010
i'm also looking forward to the VAM

00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,990
improvements to drupal the dark that

00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:01,280
dress showed in the keynote because he

00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:03,350
also showed distribution marketing

00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,230
improvements a year ago and that didn't

00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:07,850
happen either so like showing shiny

00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:12,050
pictures and making up plans is not

00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:16,010
making it happen unfortunately I think I

00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:18,020
think part of that is for your casual

00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:20,900
low-level user or your casual low-level

00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:22,280
contributor an issue queue is fine there

00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,710
they've got an issue they work on it

00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:27,560
they're done the initiative leads are

00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:30,170
working at a level that most people

00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:31,610
aren't yet but Drupal does need to be

00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:34,460
doing more of swear kind of a leading

00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:36,800
edge where the meta discussion is more

00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:40,430
important than the actual implementation

00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:44,130
discussion yeah and we currently our

00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:50,040
meta discussion tools are crap

00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:53,619
yes so I think having a way for us to

00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:56,980
you know have good meta discussion tools

00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:59,560
of architecture of design of things like

00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:02,340
that that is optimized for that kind of

00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:05,050
discussion I think is probably the

00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:08,880
biggest bank of the buck individual

00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:10,869
improvement we could make or one of and

00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,390
part of that is also cultural I know a

00:38:10,869 --> 00:38:14,740
lot of the early postings we had back on

00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:17,440
coop such a dork for a couple of the

00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:20,020
initiatives just figuring out how to

00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,400
present you know a discussion in a way

00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:23,470
that turned into a discussion and the

00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:28,750
conclusion well rather than into a bike

00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:30,760
shed we got that wrong a lot and that's

00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:32,350
partly tools and partly cultural and

00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,740
partly just how you write something in

00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:38,980
the first place and we I'm presenting

00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:42,700
opposite you again don't play you to

00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:46,150
this I didn't control the schedule I

00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:49,270
think a lot of that can help us to just

00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:51,130
add that extra layer there for that

00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:54,670
virtual thicken optimized for that level

00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:56,830
of discussion will help I also think on

00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:58,660
the project management side there's a

00:38:56,830 --> 00:39:01,330
big difference between the way your

00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,980
project manage a project where you know

00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:06,490
what your resources are and a project

00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:08,200
where you don't and I know early on we

00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:10,570
started adding product project managers

00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:13,060
to the initiative process we were trying

00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:14,200
to set up kind of this sort of project

00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,850
management you would have when you know

00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,530
what your resources were and I know in

00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:19,330
my case I did push back on that because

00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:21,010
I don't know what my resources are I

00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:23,170
don't have control over that don't ask

00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:24,520
you for dates you know I can't say when

00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:25,720
three trees is gonna commit something

00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:28,450
much less when something's gonna get

00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:30,790
written yeah more recently we've had

00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:32,740
product managers who are doing more you

00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:35,109
know follow-up to help keep track of the

00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:36,790
various people who are working on things

00:39:35,109 --> 00:39:38,560
and keep track of them and poke them and

00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:40,600
that's been very helpful that's been a

00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:42,250
lot more useful so a lot of those figure

00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,960
out how does one project manage

00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:45,880
volunteers which is a very different

00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:49,060
animal than fun than project managing

00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:51,850
staff definitely so I think for the

00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:54,310
tools for meta discussions I don't think

00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:55,020
we so hopefully we shouldn't be in the

00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:58,080
business of

00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:00,690
doing those tools so so we use hangouts

00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:02,310
we use skype we use in person spends we

00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:05,130
use a lot of things there are

00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:07,890
appropriate for for for the case and

00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:09,030
there's an exempt dr very advanced tools

00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:11,580
that we shouldn't be building for

00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:14,460
ourselves so i think what we what we

00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:16,290
should do is we should have better

00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:20,070
communication of what's happening in

00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:23,700
those areas and end and what were the

00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:24,900
conclusions so that if so that if we you

00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,610
get into the next stage there's

00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:30,180
something to refer back to because right

00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:32,160
now my my meetings are in IRC i post an

00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:34,470
IRC lock but you still need to read the

00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:36,840
whole thing to get it and John's

00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:39,090
meetings are on hangouts the mobile

00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,860
initiative you need to watch the whole

00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:45,150
thing to understand what was discussed

00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:47,760
so so and and I don't think anybody does

00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:50,340
either reading DRC like we're watching

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:54,180
the video unless there's like really

00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:56,250
important stuff to refer back to so so

00:40:54,180 --> 00:41:00,510
we need to have a system where we have

00:40:56,250 --> 00:41:02,430
conclusions extracted and communicated

00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:06,240
which we don't do and that's much easier

00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:10,550
I think if we have to conclusions it's

00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,550
just needs to sip Lynn from us

00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:24,150
yes yep agreed so first thing no new

00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:28,620
contributors do not find the issue queue

00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:30,630
usable at all yeah no no Sega casual

00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:33,000
casual contributors do not find the

00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:35,190
issue queue helpful it's very difficult

00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:37,800
for casual contributors even not

00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:50,450
complete movies people no one knows what

00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:52,260
to work on it yeah that's not true and

00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:57,330
individual issues are still problematic

00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:59,280
for me blows but ok so one of the

00:41:57,330 --> 00:42:01,800
problems with working with issues

00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:05,100
themselves is there are missing a lot of

00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:07,110
context for example the instructions for

00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:09,390
how to complete a task that needs to be

00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:13,380
done yeah so if something needs to have

00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:16,920
a review or if it needs a screenshot

00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:18,390
added or if it needs a test added we

00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:22,140
have instructions for those but they are

00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:25,200
not incorporated into the issue there

00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:27,120
was this was at our conversation

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,950
tomorrow in which in both of my core

00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,660
conversations Larry was in the the

00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:33,510
audience in my head and he's not going

00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:34,710
to be like and also also a lot of the

00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:37,320
times something we're not very good at

00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:39,510
is documenting on the issue not not only

00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,680
the you know the procedural things that

00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:42,150
we need to do but also the technical

00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:43,770
aspects of what's involved in the issue

00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:46,860
people will just file issues and say you

00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:48,960
know do this without providing the

00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,370
context architectural e to explain the

00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,270
change that we're trying to have someone

00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:58,160
make so that's another problem too yeah

00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:59,360
um and then Oh with grad this was the

00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,240
thing that I thought was helpful with

00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:04,430
regard to dates and project management I

00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,380
found that a happy medium is to sort of

00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:08,030
instead of giving specific date for

00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:10,280
things make do our planning around

00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:12,500
phases of the release cycle because that

00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:14,540
is a schedule that we have and adhere to

00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:17,870
for some value of shrinking and

00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:19,370
expanding at least um and so I we infuse

00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:21,890
we found that to be really useful in to

00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:23,870
to you know say these these are our

00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:26,750
milestones and in to organize and

00:43:23,870 --> 00:43:27,740
prioritize our work you know we can we

00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:29,180
can certainly can't commit to a specific

00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:32,240
date because who knows what's going to

00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:34,160
happen but we can say that you know this

00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,300
is done or it's not done by this time

00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:39,880
and so these things that can be done

00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:43,130
later we're going to do those later yeah

00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,930
so I agree that the issue queue is

00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:46,790
difficult for new contributors I am a

00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:50,210
casual contributor and have been for

00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:51,650
four years or so and I don't take it

00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:54,680
have a problem with the issue queue so I

00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:57,680
tend to agree with chrome or there but i

00:43:54,680 --> 00:44:00,530
do have difficulties following the meta

00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,150
discussions just very recently i've

00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:03,920
tried to get up to speed on what's going

00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:05,900
on with the web services initiative and

00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,460
you know i found some good blog post and

00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:10,700
i found some good groups drupal.org

00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:13,460
discussions but linking all of that

00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:15,260
knowing where to go for that is is

00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:17,630
pretty difficult but I do one thing it's

00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:19,790
true for any initiative yeah yeah I

00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:22,040
certainly true for money so I want to

00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:24,890
make a positive suggestion a very simple

00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:26,330
proposal by expanding something that I

00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:29,090
think we do pretty darn well right now

00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:31,100
which is change notices if I want to

00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:32,600
figure out how to implement the new

00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:34,430
routing or something I could plan to

00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:36,050
change notice and and get right in on

00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:39,260
that but for something that's not done

00:44:36,050 --> 00:44:41,480
yet that's where I get stuck so maybe we

00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:43,400
could follow an idea of change notice

00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:45,260
driven development where we write what

00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:47,810
we hope our change notice would be as

00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:50,300
early as possible post that in different

00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:52,640
place and that becomes our roadmap for

00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:54,770
what needs to do yeah that's fun an

00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,870
issue summary yeah yes I mean

00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:58,370
you know it's it's an acceptance test

00:44:56,870 --> 00:45:00,110
but but it's an acceptance that's driven

00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:02,030
toward what we ultimately produce for

00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:05,150
baby I changes which is a change notice

00:45:02,030 --> 00:45:06,530
it's essentially writing down where

00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:12,860
what's at target what we want to achieve

00:45:06,530 --> 00:45:15,110
I think that idea changed notice driven

00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:16,940
development is a great idea in it it

00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:20,720
echoes what I intended to talk about

00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:23,000
which is defining the rules and

00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,950
parameters for initiatives I know

00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:28,100
something Larry has talked a lot about

00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:31,670
is that as an as an initiative lead he

00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:34,400
knows he has some level of authority

00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:36,920
over the concept of web services but the

00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:39,530
level of authority and the ability to

00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:46,100
make a decision and have that decision

00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:49,250
stick is very squishy that there aren't

00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:51,230
rules around when is an archetype where

00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:53,600
is an architectural decision set in

00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:56,240
stone so if you make that change notice

00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:59,060
ahead of time for what the the goal of

00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,460
whiskey as an entire initiative is now

00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:03,260
at what point can you say all right we

00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:05,930
we have consensus and agreement around

00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:08,780
what the large goal is and now you get

00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:14,330
into the implementation and I think

00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:16,640
until core gets some clear rules on on

00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:19,610
what what exactly can an initiative lead

00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:24,020
do and what what level of authority does

00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:25,970
the initiative lead have I think the the

00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:31,400
tools will still be secondary is as long

00:46:25,970 --> 00:46:33,710
as our our deeper cultural mental models

00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:35,500
are squishy without a clear mental model

00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:38,990
of what initiatives are supposed to do

00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:40,790
the tools can't help us yeah we've been

00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:42,560
actually talking about that a lot in the

00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:45,770
initiative calls is what our Authority

00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:47,840
initiative leads have and whether that's

00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:49,160
whether it's a be land and all if I say

00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,120
something that's going to be like that

00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:55,500
um

00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:57,270
and we've both had hard arguments in the

00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:59,310
initiatives and we both had arguments

00:46:57,270 --> 00:47:01,860
with Greece and other commuters about

00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:03,930
what what the inertia police decided so

00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:06,840
I don't think we felt either way that we

00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:08,430
have authority in that realm so we I

00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:11,760
think we all have our fair shares of

00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:15,750
fights in both ways and that's just

00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:17,580
because we are some let's debate going

00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:19,380
back down to be our very of control of

00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:22,860
having a boss that says what we do

00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:25,590
because we are all we are all volunteers

00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:28,890
that want to work for a goal and we and

00:47:25,590 --> 00:47:30,690
we want to feel ownership around what we

00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:32,370
do and if it's somebody else telling us

00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:34,200
what we do and we are not part of the

00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:36,570
decision then we usually don't feel like

00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:41,700
that we have ownership about the problem

00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:44,790
and then it's not fun sure so so are the

00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:47,970
things we can as a community do to make

00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:50,220
sure we keep that level of collaboration

00:47:47,970 --> 00:47:53,160
so people feel like they have a level of

00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:58,020
ownership over their work and on top of

00:47:53,160 --> 00:48:01,530
that layer a clear roadmap for how how

00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:05,340
we get from rough discussion and sprint

00:48:01,530 --> 00:48:10,710
rooms to commits that I think the the

00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:12,840
individual issue is complete when when

00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:14,280
we're talking about a bug fix patch and

00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,410
there's consensus around the fact that

00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,540
this is a clear bug in the bug needs to

00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:21,300
be fixed like the rules the mental model

00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:26,250
for that is agreed upon yes the mental

00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:28,110
model for how do we decide upon entity

00:48:26,250 --> 00:48:30,030
level translation versus field level

00:48:28,110 --> 00:48:32,340
translation the mental model for how do

00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:36,930
we get from that conceptual need to an

00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:38,820
actual completed chunk of code that

00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:41,040
mental model I don't think we have

00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:44,400
agreement on and until we get that like

00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:46,560
the tools the tools we come up with will

00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,640
be just as messy as our mental model

00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,860
yeah

00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:56,220
yeah I don't have any solutions for that

00:48:49,860 --> 00:49:00,330
I hey tried to say something you don't

00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:03,860
know me I'm Neil drum so I am one of the

00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:03,860
two people at the association working

00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:15,090
also talking on a sun staff so it's not

00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:19,380
just one person it's you know two ish

00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:23,790
people oh can you can we multiply you by

00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:26,100
10 or something um uh we're gonna start

00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:28,320
planning for next year sometime this

00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:30,600
year which is a new thing for us as far

00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:36,210
as like staff budget and things like

00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:39,150
that so yeah I hope I i hope the our

00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:40,440
staff expands of course I I can't

00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:42,770
comment on whether it will happen or not

00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:48,690
that's good divine overboard number or

00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:51,960
executive director and yeah I think a

00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:56,100
lot of the criticism it here is fair

00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:57,840
like it's we we've gotten some a big

00:49:56,100 --> 00:50:00,600
stuff done and some small stuff done and

00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:03,990
I think change noses are probably the

00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:09,540
most recent example of the mid-size

00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:10,770
project that we got launched and yeah

00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:13,290
stuffs been stalled a bit with the

00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:15,870
Drupal 7 upgrade but I think second half

00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:17,970
of this year or potentially set up for

00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:20,280
getting moving on drupal.org

00:50:17,970 --> 00:50:23,400
improvements since the upgrade will be

00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:26,160
done and you know how the tools involved

00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:31,020
like project module are becoming more

00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:33,359
standard Drupal code projects with issue

00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:34,980
module B have less magic in it

00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:39,359
and hopefully more people want to work

00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:41,460
on it because of that so so but yeah I

00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:44,640
have a lot of answers at this point

00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:46,650
because this I can't really comment I

00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,509
don't really know you know what we'll

00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:53,460
have four staff or volunteers for us to

00:50:48,509 --> 00:50:55,410
this year and you know yeah so that's

00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:57,960
what I was about to say is that this

00:50:55,410 --> 00:51:00,329
really is that is that we should accept

00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:02,609
that that big changes to drupal org our

00:51:00,329 --> 00:51:04,920
initiatives and they need initiative Lee

00:51:02,609 --> 00:51:07,380
teams that manage the goals and that get

00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:09,029
volunteers excited and plan it out and

00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:11,039
get them ownership and implementing the

00:51:09,029 --> 00:51:12,869
untested and deployed because the

00:51:11,039 --> 00:51:15,420
association is not a cash cow that will

00:51:12,869 --> 00:51:17,819
hire 200 people to work on drupal org so

00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:20,309
we need to have the same solutions we

00:51:17,819 --> 00:51:23,730
just need to acknowledge that and

00:51:20,309 --> 00:51:26,220
getting getting to our process yeah yeah

00:51:23,730 --> 00:51:30,180
maybe drupal.org governance will help

00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:32,390
that's a new kind of process that Greece

00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:34,279
has been

00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:38,359
you know leading along with all the

00:51:34,279 --> 00:51:40,180
other Drupal governance stuff so some of

00:51:38,359 --> 00:51:44,260
this could be a good test case for that

00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:48,380
it's we're having our first governance

00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:50,329
meetings like of the actual people who

00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:54,500
will be on the committee's I think on

00:51:50,329 --> 00:51:57,440
Friday so it's gonna take a few months

00:51:54,500 --> 00:52:01,750
before it actually is a kixin useful

00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:05,930
process or like productive process mmm

00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:07,099
and yeah we're not gonna be able to

00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:08,599
solve a lot of these problems because

00:52:07,099 --> 00:52:11,930
they're not technology problems yep

00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:14,890
there yeah yeah project management it's

00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:14,890
our process yeah

00:52:17,910 --> 00:52:23,810
I went related

00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:28,130
yeah that's coming with the Drupal 7

00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:30,890
upgrade yeah sorry there and yeah I

00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:33,370
didn't do it volunteer showed up and did

00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:37,070
it I don't know their name off hand

00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:46,730
Andre a gift for gift forward at hug

00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:48,140
then yeah yeah and yeah any other I

00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:50,660
don't really have anything else I can

00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:53,210
think up to say right now but let's go

00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:56,180
yeah find me at the conference wanna

00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:58,460
hear how the new issue page looks so

00:52:56,180 --> 00:53:00,890
yours printing on drupal.org still on

00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:02,930
Friday and yeah if people want to get

00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:05,090
involved in improving these tools Tamia

00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:07,790
and I'll be the extended sprints as well

00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:09,050
unless the weekend day yeah safest again

00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:10,820
where he wants to involve in actually

00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:12,980
implementing tool improvements that Neil

00:53:10,820 --> 00:53:15,710
drum will sprint on friday saturday and

00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:17,060
sunday so we haven't spent here in the

00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:19,100
building on friday i believe and

00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:21,590
saturday and sunday we are sprinting in

00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:23,450
the Aqua offices you can if you search

00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:27,680
Google for extended sprints in Portland

00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:30,080
you will find the information so i plus

00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:33,670
once the idea of change notice driven

00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:36,590
development i do like the concept and

00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:38,450
just the right to an extent issues that

00:53:36,590 --> 00:53:40,430
have a good issue summary are a lot

00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:41,810
easier to get through i found some of my

00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:43,460
most successful issues are the ones

00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:45,470
where i start with an issue summary

00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:47,750
that's as long as a blog post that lays

00:53:45,470 --> 00:53:50,510
out the complete logic but those taken

00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:52,670
our and i have to write yes but they

00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:55,010
might save you two weeks yeah but the

00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:57,260
catch i found there that works if that's

00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:59,780
written initially updated issue

00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:02,480
summaries partly through i find our like

00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:04,280
a quarter as useful and i'm not sure if

00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:07,280
that's a social problem or technical

00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:10,490
problem or both but if that comment one

00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:12,170
is the issue summary you know that co

00:54:10,490 --> 00:54:13,730
joins existence and that the issue

00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:15,740
summer you may not know how up-to-date

00:54:13,730 --> 00:54:17,240
it actually is is a problem and that

00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:20,120
makes issue summaries less useful than

00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:21,050
they could be so that's another i think

00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,240
they're actually some talk of that

00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:25,760
getting meal is that getting improved in

00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:28,030
d 7 as well I think I saw something

00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,030
about that

00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:35,250
okay so I thought I saw something in the

00:54:33,390 --> 00:54:37,320
last blog post about that sadly it's not

00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:39,000
like an issue somebody will show the

00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:41,490
latest files so you don't need to look

00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,930
at the latest files the latest batch so

00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:46,700
we'll have the summary and the latest

00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:49,920
batch for the issue so you have yeah

00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:52,260
right yeah they don't like find what the

00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,720
latest patches will be there so I guess

00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:57,240
at least for the time being you know

00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:59,460
issue summaries are great and useful and

00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:02,820
do help if you do them at the beginning

00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:05,790
it when you do them halfway through they

00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:08,160
are substantially less useful so do them

00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:12,500
early and let's fix that second half so

00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:14,520
that they are still useful later okay

00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:16,710
Kathy you have a full page of notes

00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:20,610
there I was just writing down

00:55:16,710 --> 00:55:23,040
everybody's good ideas that's good and

00:55:20,610 --> 00:55:26,010
so I thought I thought this idea of the

00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:31,800
change notice driven development this

00:55:26,010 --> 00:55:34,410
perplexes me because somebody said that

00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:37,590
it's similar to a well-written issue

00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:40,680
some ranges and often you can use the

00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:43,620
issue summary as your first raft of your

00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:45,630
change notice when you go to write it if

00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:48,180
it's a if it's a good one and I'm

00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:50,130
thinking to myself why does why is it

00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:52,170
tempting to be like oh what a brilliant

00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:55,110
idea why would we do change notice

00:55:52,170 --> 00:55:58,230
driven things and I thought maybe it's

00:55:55,110 --> 00:56:03,600
because we have fewer change notices

00:55:58,230 --> 00:56:06,420
than we have issues not every issue gets

00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:07,920
a change notice so perhaps people are

00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:11,370
thinking that we would have changed

00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,990
notices for the most important things

00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:16,080
the bigger things that we are going to

00:56:12,990 --> 00:56:18,510
have changed notices for and so that

00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:20,490
might be part of the attraction is that

00:56:18,510 --> 00:56:21,840
when we if we were to just say no we

00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:23,340
don't need change notice driven

00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:24,780
development we have the issue summaries

00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:28,100
it doesn't solve all the problems

00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:31,440
because then we have too many issues and

00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:35,040
we can't focus and but I thought well

00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:39,150
what kind of issues get changed notices

00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:42,270
I mostly major in criticals so we might

00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:44,370
be able to approximate I guess not

00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:47,520
really right anyway there there might be

00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:50,520
some way to approximate using change

00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:52,800
notice driven if we can filter the

00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:54,570
issues that would eventually get a

00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,760
change notice i think so i think the

00:56:54,570 --> 00:56:59,040
idea of change though is that what what

00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:00,870
i've heard when i get her this the

00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:03,090
change that is driven development is it

00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:05,490
forces you to write your goals down

00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:07,770
before you start the issue so it's just

00:57:05,490 --> 00:57:09,560
a trick to trick your mind into writing

00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:12,330
down your goals before you get started

00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:13,980
because the issue issue doesn't force

00:57:12,330 --> 00:57:16,230
you to do that it's just a text field

00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:18,150
that you can enter anything and that

00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:20,250
change notice is also text field but

00:57:18,150 --> 00:57:23,010
it's supposed to be a text that is

00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:24,720
useful after the issue is done so you

00:57:23,010 --> 00:57:27,240
need to write down what you want to do

00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:29,940
before you do the issue is kind of my

00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:32,700
mental understanding of this idea and we

00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:34,500
can do other this is just plus does it

00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:36,840
change notice development it's just the

00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:39,030
actual tool used that people suggested

00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:41,670
here but it's I think the manufacturing

00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:44,160
is to change your mental thing yeah

00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:46,230
think think your goals before you could

00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:50,030
you could do it a few so I mean it's

00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:53,610
just a mental trick okay and then a

00:57:50,030 --> 00:57:55,980
Larry's idea to make the issue summaries

00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:59,580
more useful by knowing the last time

00:57:55,980 --> 00:58:02,490
they were updated especially like you

00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:05,130
know all the comments from 55 through

00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:07,740
100 were after the issue summary was

00:58:05,130 --> 00:58:11,190
updated that would be really really cool

00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:14,160
but I wonder if with the new mock-ups

00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:18,480
I've looked I've seen them if I think

00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:21,150
that might not be as urgent because the

00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:24,210
new methodology of interacting is

00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:26,880
driving updating issue summary with

00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:29,910
every single comment so it wouldn't it

00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,900
would never be out of date so I don't I

00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:32,460
don't know how that relates to our

00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:33,780
future you know how much longer we're

00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:35,880
going to have to live with what we have

00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:37,500
so it might not be anyway I thought

00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,599
knowing when the issues summering was

00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:45,650
updated is really

00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:47,960
point it brings so I keep telling myself

00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:51,229
that when I make a revision log I'm

00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:55,789
going to remember to put a dash C but I

00:58:51,229 --> 00:58:58,940
never remember to do that fulfill I

00:58:55,789 --> 00:59:01,759
think we can take that concept of change

00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:04,400
driven development to even groups

00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:07,759
drupal.org if someone is is kicking up

00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:12,369
what they hope to be a discussion about

00:59:07,759 --> 00:59:15,499
a broader goal define in that first post

00:59:12,369 --> 00:59:17,779
what you want a resolution to look like

00:59:15,499 --> 00:59:20,029
in whatever level of specificity you can

00:59:17,779 --> 00:59:21,470
so it might be will know that this

00:59:20,029 --> 00:59:25,099
discussion is done when we have

00:59:21,470 --> 00:59:27,739
agreement on what file format we're

00:59:25,099 --> 00:59:30,880
using for cmi or we'll know that this

00:59:27,739 --> 00:59:34,339
issue is done when we have agreement on

00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:36,440
yeah not request now actually yeah

00:59:34,339 --> 00:59:50,150
actually getting that agreement I have I

00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:54,019
have nose yeah sure sure so yeah I can't

00:59:50,150 --> 00:59:56,779
help necessarily i can't help human

00:59:54,019 --> 00:59:59,359
nature but if if the person kicking out

00:59:56,779 --> 01:00:02,479
the discussion sets clear expectations

00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:04,219
for what the end of the discussion could

01:00:02,479 --> 01:00:07,190
look like I think that'll help everyone

01:00:04,219 --> 01:00:10,579
approaching the discussion yep move

01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:12,259
towards what the end goal is now if you

01:00:10,579 --> 01:00:17,390
want a bike chat about what the end goal

01:00:12,259 --> 01:00:19,369
is bike shed a nested inside of bike

01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:22,069
shed I don't know there's nothing we can

01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:23,569
do to stop that so I think we are we are

01:00:22,069 --> 01:00:25,460
making we are making up a lot of

01:00:23,569 --> 01:00:28,999
interesting project management and

01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:31,210
people management ideas on our own that

01:00:28,999 --> 01:00:33,589
we're out there are probably existing

01:00:31,210 --> 01:00:36,559
already because people manage other

01:00:33,589 --> 01:00:38,930
people and projects on so I wanted to

01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:40,249
blog blog just very quickly a book that

01:00:38,930 --> 01:00:42,200
i recently read and i would suggest

01:00:40,249 --> 01:00:45,130
everyone to read who would want to work

01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:48,210
on open source it's titled the switch

01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:50,180
how to make change when change is hard

01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:53,040
and it's from cheap and then heath and

01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:54,720
it's not about software I think there's

01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:57,420
one example about software in the book

01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:59,060
but it's about making change when when

01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:02,040
you feel like you don't have any control

01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:04,770
so it's like how you get kids with

01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:06,240
cancer take their pills or how you get a

01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:09,720
city that is on the verge of bankruptcy

01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:12,660
to for their for their residents to

01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:14,460
actually spend their money there or how

01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:17,430
you get how you get how you get a bird

01:01:14,460 --> 01:01:21,599
to not go extinct at an island stuff

01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:23,190
like that so there's a lot of very good

01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:27,390
examples and techniques in the book

01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:29,339
about about managing people and and

01:01:27,390 --> 01:01:30,900
tricking their minds into things when

01:01:29,339 --> 01:01:33,570
you want a good when you wanna when you

01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:35,220
are for a good cause and there's just an

01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:37,349
amazing set of techniques and examples

01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:40,280
there so i would suggest anyone to pick

01:01:37,349 --> 01:01:43,440
up the book and read it's a lot of fun

01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:46,589
so building on what kathy was just

01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:47,760
saying I agree you change notice driven

01:01:46,589 --> 01:01:49,950
development work for everything doesn't

01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,510
necessarily work for a bug where they're

01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:54,420
going not going to be a change notice

01:01:51,510 --> 01:01:56,130
which is the majority of issues but in a

01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:57,900
sense I see it is like the feature

01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:59,700
development if the entire level

01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:01,650
equivalent of test-driven development

01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:02,760
where you write your tests first that

01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:05,280
forces you to think through what you're

01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:07,680
doing yeah and then you know what you

01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:10,160
need to write so many of you if you

01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:12,359
can't explain it it's too complicated

01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:15,570
there's another guideline then that's

01:02:12,359 --> 01:02:19,800
our good issue summaries with code

01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:21,599
samples can be very helpful but again

01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,980
they the idea of updating the issue

01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:26,700
summary with every comment kind of

01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:28,650
scares me because we have plenty cases

01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:30,030
now where you get into a 30 comment

01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:31,589
fight with people with different visions

01:02:30,030 --> 01:02:33,570
and I'd hate that fight to be carried

01:02:31,589 --> 01:02:35,520
out in the issue summary because then I

01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:37,440
can't read the damn thing it's just 12

01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:40,050
people's opinions merged together into

01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:42,420
one document that can't read so we also

01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:44,070
need to somehow protect against that

01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:45,600
again I'm not entirely sure how but

01:02:44,070 --> 01:02:47,710
that's another

01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:53,110
concern that would come when we start

01:02:47,710 --> 01:03:00,910
using that more yeah so I think we are

01:02:53,110 --> 01:03:02,620
over time right I think we are so

01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:06,250
against O'Neill wanted to say something

01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:12,910
uh I don't know all the details of the

01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:15,940
new issue you I offhand but if you want

01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:20,080
to test drive them there on our chemical

01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:22,120
staging sites get seven site def

01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:23,830
drupal.org and I can you know find me

01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:26,560
I'll actually tell you the URL instead

01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:28,360
so the sdss ation block has opposed the

01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:31,690
other associations long as a link to it

01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:34,650
and yeah that's our staging site that's

01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:36,880
what drupal.org would look like if we

01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:41,800
took the site down into the upgrade

01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:44,800
today and this you pages are we put a

01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:48,120
bunch of effort into closing out all the

01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:51,580
issues about that last couple weeks so

01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:53,500
they're you know they're pretty much set

01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:55,980
unless we get more feedback and we

01:03:53,500 --> 01:03:58,890
realize well we need to fix something

01:03:55,980 --> 01:04:03,450
so yeah have a look and figure out what

01:03:58,890 --> 01:04:05,580
exactly it does and if it works good so

01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:07,980
thanks everyone for coming i hope this

01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:09,660
was somewhat useful especially thanks

01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:13,730
