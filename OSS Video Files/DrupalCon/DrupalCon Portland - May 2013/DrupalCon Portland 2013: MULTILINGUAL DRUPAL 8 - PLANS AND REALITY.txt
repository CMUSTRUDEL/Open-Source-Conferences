Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: MULTILINGUAL DRUPAL 8 - PLANS AND REALITY
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	Drupal's project lead Dries Buytaert announced the Drupal 8 Multilingual Initiative in May 2011 in hopes to bring ubiquitous multilingual capabilities to Drupal 8 all around. The plans were ambitious.

Many of the big goals were completed as of this session submission and many are still in progress. Come to this session to get an overview of the plans and an up to date review of where we are and what to expect from Drupal 8 when it comes out.

If you actually want to get involved, we announced sprints for both before and after DrupalCon on the weekends. See http://groups.drupal.org/node/281033 for more information.

Ongoing updates about the initiative can be found on http://drupal.org/community-initiatives/drupal-core and http://drupal8multilingual.org/ with IRC meetings every other Wednesday (always announced at http://drupal8multilingual.org/planet and https://twitter.com/d8mi). Find us on IRC on #drupal-i18n.
