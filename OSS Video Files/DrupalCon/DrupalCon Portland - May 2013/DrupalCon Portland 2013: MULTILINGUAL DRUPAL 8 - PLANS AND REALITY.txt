Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: MULTILINGUAL DRUPAL 8 - PLANS AND REALITY
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	Drupal's project lead Dries Buytaert announced the Drupal 8 Multilingual Initiative in May 2011 in hopes to bring ubiquitous multilingual capabilities to Drupal 8 all around. The plans were ambitious.

Many of the big goals were completed as of this session submission and many are still in progress. Come to this session to get an overview of the plans and an up to date review of where we are and what to expect from Drupal 8 when it comes out.

If you actually want to get involved, we announced sprints for both before and after DrupalCon on the weekends. See http://groups.drupal.org/node/281033 for more information.

Ongoing updates about the initiative can be found on http://drupal.org/community-initiatives/drupal-core and http://drupal8multilingual.org/ with IRC meetings every other Wednesday (always announced at http://drupal8multilingual.org/planet and https://twitter.com/d8mi). Find us on IRC on #drupal-i18n.

good afternoon everyone I'm going to

00:00:03,179 --> 00:00:07,020
kick things off a little bit early I'm

00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:09,150
Jason E I'm the local community track

00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:13,320
chair lead here from drupalcon Portland

00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:14,549
and aside from picking sessions one of

00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,760
the great things that I get to do is

00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:19,619
introduce the featured speakers so Gabor

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,380
is actually one of our featured speakers

00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:24,630
you may be wondering why the

00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,699
multilingual initiative is part of

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,640
community and one of the things that

00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:31,260
I've tried to do this year is reexamine

00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,079
what we what we mean when we talk about

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:37,590
community and that includes contributing

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,059
code so invited Gabor to come speak tell

00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,850
us about what's going on in the

00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:44,550
multilingual initiative and particularly

00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,350
what they've done what needs to be done

00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,719
and how you guys can all get involved

00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:56,850
with that so without further ado I'll

00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:58,079
turn it over to get more thank you so

00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,180
yeah so this session is about

00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,210
multilingual Drupal 8 it's going to walk

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,040
you through every goodie that we did in

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:10,670
Drupal 8 and it will explain why we did

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,670
it and what we are still to do um I

00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,960
would I'm totally fine if in the middle

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,299
of it you think it's not for you and you

00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,540
walk out I would love to be at three

00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,920
other sessions at this moment but I hope

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,600
it's going to be very excited very

00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,030
excited about this topic so i hope it's

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,000
gonna fire you up because there's a lot

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,400
of changes and the way we approached it

00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,970
is is we want to have drupal 8 finally

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,950
have language as as a core thing not as

00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,810
an afterthought so if you've been if

00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:42,240
you've been using language stuff in

00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:44,850
drupal 7 a lot of the cases languages an

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,310
afterthought and i have two interesting

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,649
photos to to explain that actually at

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,409
this conference so this is my user

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:53,970
account on on the site i'm not sure you

00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:55,500
notice the extended character is not

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,659
really in the fun that is supposed to be

00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,320
and if you look at your printed schedule

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:04,490
it's even better

00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,900
ah yes so so if we put language as like

00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,700
a core thing and that just doesn't have

00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:09,200
the thought that it may may work or may

00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,590
not work and we don't really think about

00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,360
it then we can we can do stuff better so

00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,100
I'm this guy who like always uses his

00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,860
actual name instead of cutting off the X

00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:21,080
and just to see what happens and this is

00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,480
not picking out drupalcon I've been able

00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,080
to photograph my badge and session

00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:29,510
prints at multiple conferences so far so

00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,130
that's just how it goes so although i'm

00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,670
presenting this session this is a huge

00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:37,070
huge huge team effort so this is the

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:39,140
list of people who helped out so if you

00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:42,290
think you you have no idea how to help

00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:45,140
out you can probably notice that we have

00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:46,850
a lot of people who helped out some so

00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,340
this is all the names of people who ever

00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:51,769
commented on the issues that we worked

00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:54,430
on and we got into core or we are about

00:02:51,769 --> 00:02:58,550
to get into core and there are a few

00:02:54,430 --> 00:03:01,130
relatively big names but not not many so

00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:03,290
so there's a there's a there's a core of

00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,000
a few people who work really hard and

00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,709
then there's a lot of people who just

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,140
chip in and do their small thing and

00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:11,060
then then then go on with their life so

00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,430
you don't need to be involved very much

00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,140
in this if you don't want to but we very

00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,959
much love you to get involved and and

00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:19,820
help us with tiny tiny changes to big

00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:22,310
changes so this is a huge team effort

00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:24,860
there's actual human body's working on

00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:27,560
this so this is uh this is a sprint we

00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:29,900
did last summer and or DISA yeah last

00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,400
summer in in Barcelona we've been

00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,530
mapping out the configuration system

00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,290
there with with all kinds of people from

00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:38,959
core this is a sprint way that this past

00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,630
weekend and we are continuing to spend

00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,780
this coming weekend as well so we are in

00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:47,150
town on Friday Saturday and Sunday to

00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:49,760
work on Drupal 8 multilingual so this is

00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,880
just from this past weekend this is from

00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,200
bad camp last November we are

00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,239
Francesco's working on the entity

00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,250
translation module right here and this

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,040
is also from Barcelona so we have we

00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:05,060
have a lot of hard work and we also have

00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,680
a lot of amazing fun so it's been it's

00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,600
been a great experience and what we came

00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,100
from is the Drupal 7 multilingual

00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,989
experience where you have Drupal core

00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:14,160
and if you want to do anything with that

00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:15,990
you need to add up a lot of things

00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,430
so first thing you want to have

00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,140
languages on your site and you want to

00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:21,360
translate your site to those languages

00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:22,920
you need to enable this locale module

00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:26,820
that provides languages and foreign UI

00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:29,460
for your site and then if you want to

00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:31,080
have one make it useful then you need to

00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,880
have the localization update module

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,370
because the low calmodulin itself is

00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,020
very painful to maintain with all your

00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,940
translations if you have a hundred

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,100
modules and five languages you need to

00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,230
manually write down on a piece of paper

00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,450
the hundred version numbers for your

00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:47,250
hundred modules and then you go to

00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,470
manually localized rupal an organ

00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:51,360
download all those files 500 files

00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,520
manually download to your computer and

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,410
then you upload all those 500 files

00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,060
manually to your website and the

00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:58,710
localization update module saves you

00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,880
from that hassle it identifies your

00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,860
versions it downloads everything

00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,130
automatically and imports them so that's

00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,240
the kind of modules that that show that

00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,830
that multi-language enough to thought

00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,020
and we really have these problems that

00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,400
we need to solve with extra things and

00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,260
then there's the content translation

00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,660
core module which creates copies of your

00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,850
nodes so you can translate them but it's

00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,890
only working four nodes so if you use

00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,840
Drupal commerce or you want to translate

00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:25,560
taxonomy terms or menus that's not for

00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:27,150
that um then we have plugging in the

00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,550
whole we have the i18n module which

00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:31,080
plugs in a lot of holes so it lets you

00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,780
actually translate menus and taxonomy

00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:36,030
terms and contact forms and to some

00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,680
degree views but it depends on a lot of

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:40,320
other modules so if you want to actually

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,720
do all the stuff that I mentioned I 18m

00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,030
has like 20 sub modules and then it

00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,680
requires other modules like variable

00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,930
module and variable realm a module and

00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,790
variable translation module and all

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,370
kinds of models you need to add on your

00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:56,760
site so we are like now 20 models by at

00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,080
this point and then that's that's the

00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,370
variable yeah that's required and then

00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,780
you figure out you want to have Drupal

00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:03,540
commerce on your site and nothing

00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,919
supports a general entity translation

00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,840
from here so you also need the entity

00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,610
translation module which translates

00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,350
content in a different way from the core

00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,790
content translation module and now you

00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,410
have two different solutions for the

00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:16,560
problem it's very painful you don't know

00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:18,840
which one to use when and it's just a

00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,220
mess so there's a lot of things going on

00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,930
that you need to be aware and this

00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,979
that's just scratching the surface so

00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,280
there's a lot of other things like

00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:27,810
Edmund language module or or or

00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,610
translation redirect or there's a lot of

00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:32,310
other things that you need to think of

00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:34,889
and we wanted to have language as a core

00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:36,389
feature as much as possible we will not

00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:38,970
be able to resolve all the problems

00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:40,230
obviously that there are in all the

00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:42,720
problems that all the use cases that

00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,639
there are for multilingual sites but we

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,950
wanted to have a solid mod solid mod

00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,740
single based system that provides all

00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:51,900
the services that contribute on and make

00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:55,050
that base system as useful in itself as

00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:58,380
possible so we have four pillars in

00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:00,960
Drupal 8 for multilingual support the

00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:03,090
first pillar is language so the language

00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,860
pillar lets you set up languages on your

00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:06,750
site and do all kinds of stuff with

00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,150
language and we'll go through all the

00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:10,770
details shortly and then we have a

00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:13,050
pillar for interface which is your

00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:15,690
software translation so you can use this

00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:17,100
to translate your software and use a lot

00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,919
of automation and a lot of cool features

00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,500
there we have a pillar for content which

00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,780
is which is generally up all kinds of

00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:26,700
entities in Drupal core that is

00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,260
supported across entities and then we

00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,150
have a pillar for configuration which

00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,669
was the most lacking thing in Drupal 7

00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:34,919
like translating your views or your site

00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:37,320
name or your slogan or your contact

00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:39,390
category or user roles or whatever else

00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,070
that you have on the system so we wanted

00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:43,080
to provide native support for language

00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:44,789
in general and then build three layers

00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,919
on top that are parallel to each other

00:07:44,789 --> 00:07:49,020
for your software for your content than

00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:51,090
for your configuration now you might say

00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,320
that this is still very confusing

00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:54,810
because now you have three different

00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,400
systems depending on where your content

00:07:54,810 --> 00:08:00,150
is stored and how when where it's coming

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,760
from yes it is not be almost this is not

00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:04,289
the ultimate ideal system for everybody

00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,960
we are trying to make the user

00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:08,970
experience of those three solutions

00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,039
unified in a way that users might not

00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:13,289
even recognize that they are interacting

00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:15,870
with three different things but

00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:17,430
internally the storage and the backend

00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,650
and everything is very different for

00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,660
these three things so we needed to have

00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:24,030
like individual thinking for them and

00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,130
have solutions for them it's already a

00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,590
huge improvement since Drupal 7 because

00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:31,320
Drupal 7 for configuration has an

00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:33,390
unlimited number of sub of custom

00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:35,490
solutions like views works totally

00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,409
different from user roles and input

00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,270
formats and interpolate the

00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:40,050
configuration initiative did a very good

00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,360
job

00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:44,099
of summarizing all that and distilling

00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,200
that down to one system so we can rely

00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,790
on that by the way it feel free to come

00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,260
closer i will have screenshots that

00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:53,070
might not be visible so feel free to

00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:55,500
move over here and come closer i'm sorry

00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:58,140
that i might not have the biggest fans

00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,680
possible so the first pillar that i want

00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:03,089
to talk about is language and that's

00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,860
very exciting for me because that in

00:09:03,089 --> 00:09:08,370
itself brings in a lot of new features

00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:10,290
so first thing we put language step one

00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,940
in the drupal installer so when you

00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,010
encounter a Drupal 8 the first thing you

00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,320
encounter is a drop down with languages

00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:18,720
and that's about 100 languages that you

00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,730
can install Drupal 8 in and it and it

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,860
also automatically pre-selects your

00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,690
language from your browser preference so

00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,700
if you have your browser preference to

00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:28,320
prefer German stuff then you will have

00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,870
German pre-selected you just click the

00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,910
button to move forward and what it does

00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:34,649
it downloads the translations live from

00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:36,450
there are most up-to-date translation

00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:38,279
from the community and it will import

00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,959
that translation in the next step when

00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:42,839
you choose your install profile will

00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:45,660
already be translated so if you use an

00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,970
arabic language it will also be RTL like

00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,410
just I think that's no way to make

00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,329
language and is simply at that so you

00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,680
just pick language we ought to select

00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:54,779
your language for you if it's not fine

00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,730
used to pick something else and we just

00:09:54,779 --> 00:10:01,440
download it in and you can use it right

00:09:56,730 --> 00:10:02,820
away now this works it works with all

00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,010
distributions and all future modules

00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:06,839
because it works with the ability and

00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:09,720
localization update feature that we put

00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,040
in that identifies all the versions of

00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,020
stuff that you are running and pulls

00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,020
down translations for them so its future

00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,250
proof as well when you have language

00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,529
module you have language assignment

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:21,930
features so you can assign language to a

00:10:19,529 --> 00:10:23,820
lot of things one of the big problems in

00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:26,070
Drupal 7 is a lot of things don't have

00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:27,779
language as an intrinsic property so

00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,790
when you want to translate them we can

00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:32,190
assume what language that might be in

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,690
but we don't really know so we assume

00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,760
it's in the site default language and

00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:38,880
that's a very painful thing that we do

00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,410
that so in Drupal 8 well you can assign

00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,790
language to notes you can assign

00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,320
language to users you cannot send

00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,940
language to path aliases you can assign

00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,519
language the terms you can assign

00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,959
language to a view so if you if you have

00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,600
a multilingual website and you create a

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,899
view only for the Spanish pages like a

00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,059
view that only

00:10:52,899 --> 00:10:57,129
make sense for the Spanish section then

00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:58,480
you create the view and put the text in

00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:00,490
spanish because it wouldn't make sense

00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,879
to do it in english or anything else and

00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,990
then you can say this is a spanish view

00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:08,649
and that's very important for us to know

00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:10,149
that information we you can you we know

00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:11,259
the information about language

00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:13,269
information about your site

00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:15,279
configuration so like we know what

00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:17,410
language your site name or your slogan

00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,689
is in so when you install Drupal in

00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:21,730
French you have the form to fill in your

00:11:19,689 --> 00:11:24,129
site name and slogan we save that that

00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:27,040
um that you input that content in French

00:11:24,129 --> 00:11:29,319
so we will know that that your your site

00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,089
information is in French there and then

00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:33,160
there's a lot of other things so we we

00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:35,050
unify language assignment across all

00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,999
kinds of things in Drupal and our

00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,309
primary goal there is we need to know

00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:41,139
language for the smallest thing possible

00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:42,910
so that we don't need to rely on

00:11:41,139 --> 00:11:45,639
assumptions and if we know the language

00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,319
then we can work off of there and we can

00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:49,329
translate to other things we can filter

00:11:47,319 --> 00:11:50,860
by language we can we can target by

00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:53,350
language we can do all kinds of crazy

00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:55,420
things but we need to know the data so

00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,249
that that's a very core feature that we

00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,290
need to build them there's also very

00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:00,970
flexible language set up so of course if

00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,050
you have language for everything then

00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,120
you will have language dropdowns

00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,949
everywhere and it's very painful so we

00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,899
wanted to simplify that for things where

00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:10,529
you already know the language so we have

00:12:07,899 --> 00:12:12,939
this configuration page for example for

00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:15,339
content types and for all entity types

00:12:12,939 --> 00:12:17,589
across Drupal core that lets you

00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:19,689
configure how Lang how they behave in

00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:21,639
terms of language so you can say you

00:12:19,689 --> 00:12:25,720
want certain content types to be always

00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:28,029
in certain languages or or or expose

00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,949
language selector on them and then

00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:31,300
default to the site default language or

00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,009
the users current language or the

00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:35,589
language that the page is in or a

00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:37,389
certain language so you can you can make

00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,829
very flexible settings here so for

00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,660
example if you have a multilingual site

00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:43,689
but your forum is always in one language

00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:45,670
then you can set the forum to always be

00:12:43,689 --> 00:12:47,709
for example in English and do not show

00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:49,720
the language selector on forums and then

00:12:47,709 --> 00:12:51,220
it will just be an easy form and there

00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,749
will be no exposure of language because

00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,389
you already know what's going on there

00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:58,199
so you can vary you can you can

00:12:55,389 --> 00:13:00,610
configure this in a very detailed way

00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:02,639
yes and we have two special languages

00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:05,860
here not specified and not applicable

00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:09,550
that's a new thing we used to have

00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,870
the language in neutral and we don't

00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:12,519
have language neutral we have not

00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:14,350
specified and not applicable and that's

00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:17,980
a fork off language neutral to two

00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,899
things not applicable is it doesn't make

00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,640
sense to a sign language so if you have

00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:23,019
a cat photograph that doesn't have any

00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,600
text on it then it does not have

00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:29,200
language there is no meaning of language

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,470
associated to a photograph of a cat it

00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,390
made but yeah made young okay so maybe

00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:37,540
if I photograph your face it may not

00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:39,820
happen yeah it depends on your data

00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:41,380
model so you don't need to pick your

00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,910
learning to pick any of those options we

00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:44,769
provide it for you if you want to and

00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,620
the other option is not specified which

00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:49,450
in our in our model means that it could

00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,459
have language but you don't know what

00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:53,350
the languages so you can have state

00:13:51,459 --> 00:13:54,670
where you might feel the language

00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,769
information in later but you don't know

00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:58,029
yet and when you can have a state where

00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,950
it doesn't make sense to assign new

00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:02,589
language and then you have states where

00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:04,540
where you can assign language so we have

00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:06,279
we have this set up very detailed and

00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:08,019
it's possible to add any kind of custom

00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,720
languages and special languages to this

00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:13,180
system we have language visibility so

00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:15,279
for each block on the page and Drupal 8

00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:17,199
is making a lot of things blocks we have

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,360
language visibility so you can see which

00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,459
languages those blocks are displayed

00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,170
there's also built in language

00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:24,970
supporting views so you can filter for

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:28,029
language in all kinds of views in your

00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:29,800
Drupal site and nearly all of the pages

00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:31,269
in Drupal core front facing pages are

00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,880
built with views now the listing pages

00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:35,500
so you can configure the front page or

00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,540
anything else to filter to language that

00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,120
was a very common thing that people

00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:42,820
asked in Drupal never had that's very

00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:45,820
easy to do now there is language

00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:47,709
selection features highly improved so we

00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,149
simplified the language configuration

00:14:47,709 --> 00:14:51,399
experience so now all the language

00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:53,050
selection is configured in one place the

00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,430
detection and selection configuration

00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:58,300
you're going to go out to configure a

00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:59,709
language and we be able to pass the

00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,149
language selection by default which is

00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:03,070
very painful again in seven that it's

00:15:01,149 --> 00:15:06,399
not enabled we have two new features

00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:08,649
there we have admin preferred language

00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:10,420
which allows people to set our separate

00:15:08,649 --> 00:15:11,829
preference for the admin pages so if

00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,300
they have a multilingual site but they

00:15:11,829 --> 00:15:15,010
only know one language and they need to

00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,140
work on the site they can set up

00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:19,200
reference for administration only and we

00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:21,120
have a selected language option

00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,070
again solves the problem of the default

00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,540
language in Drupal 7 that if you set the

00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:26,040
default language on your site at once

00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,560
you're never able to change it again

00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:30,720
ever because of the assumptions that I

00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,220
talked about five minutes ago so we have

00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,810
that option there so you can change the

00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:35,760
language fall back without affecting the

00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:37,710
default language of the site so we made

00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,870
them disconnected which is very cool and

00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:42,900
we improve browser language detection a

00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:44,580
lot so we we have much better

00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,590
understanding of languages coming from

00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:49,170
browsers and we also have a mapping

00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:50,760
system of language names under language

00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,860
codes understood by browsers and

00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:55,080
language codes understood by drupal and

00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:58,110
you can add custom mappings to this

00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,430
system so like like drupal has certain

00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:01,530
language codes for like chinese

00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:03,150
languages but then actual browsers have

00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:05,310
like 10 different versions of those

00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:07,290
language codes for chinese and we ship

00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,490
with some of those mappings by default

00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:10,800
and you can add more of those mappings

00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:13,380
so you can understand language codes

00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,180
coming from the browser in all kinds of

00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:20,010
ways and map them to internal languages

00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:23,520
which is I think pretty cool yes yeah

00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:26,730
yeah we also have transliteration in

00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:29,280
core so for example machine names here

00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:31,710
here there's entering Billy Russian

00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:36,450
machine name and it's transliterated to

00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:38,190
ASCII characters so we have

00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:39,690
transliteration API in court that's

00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:41,220
built in and we applied that to machine

00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:43,770
names we haven't applied that to

00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:46,650
anything else yet but it's in there and

00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:48,360
it works pretty wrong it's there's a

00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:50,580
possibility to apply to any other thing

00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,470
like file names whether things in core

00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:56,270
where you need to transliterate them to

00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:59,340
to to meaningful internal identifiers

00:16:56,270 --> 00:17:01,230
from the outside language so I think

00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:03,600
that's pretty cool as well and i think

00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:05,160
that the big bombshell is that english

00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,470
can be removed from the site if you

00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:11,490
don't want that anybody happy about that

00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:13,770
here no yeah a few okay so at least

00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:16,350
where I come from in Drupal 7 when you

00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:18,030
install citing Italian you still have

00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,380
English because Drupal has this built an

00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:22,140
assumption that Drupal comes from

00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:24,030
english first and what Drupal 8 does is

00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,010
you can just get rid of English and have

00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:27,540
Italian is the only thing and then you

00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:29,880
don't get bothered with English popping

00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:31,880
up all the time that you never use so

00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,860
that's I think pretty cool

00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:36,540
so in so in summary this is just

00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,130
enabling one module in core language

00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,200
module we have all these features you

00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:41,610
can remove English from the site we have

00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,620
a very flexible language selection

00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:46,380
system with the only options and much

00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:49,080
more usable like in place path graphics

00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,240
editing and all that very easy we have

00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,340
black visibility / language we have the

00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,080
used language filtering and all kinds of

00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:58,140
front-end pages with views so you can

00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,440
you can dynamically do your pages in

00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,790
views we have flexible configuration for

00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,040
for a language on content types and

00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,510
entities what they default to whether

00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:09,060
they show language is a real language

00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:10,830
selection we have either Simon

00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,570
availability so we assign language to

00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:14,160
all kinds of things across Drupal core

00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,560
and language is the first in the

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,360
Installer now we have interface

00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:20,910
translation building on top of this so

00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,100
what we put in there is automated

00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:24,720
translation downloads so when you enable

00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,070
the inner finnish translation module or

00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,420
when you install Drupal in a foreign

00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:29,250
language it will go out and

00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,020
automatically download translations for

00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:34,080
core and all the modules that you have

00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:36,000
on the site and import them so you don't

00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:40,800
need to do anything manually you just at

00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,150
the language it works kind of good so

00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,560
this is another required module its

00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:45,060
separate now so there's language module

00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:47,670
and interface translation module two

00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:49,650
separate things and it just works like

00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,870
that so it's all magic and we've

00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,640
improved it a lot more on top of that so

00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:55,050
this is magic but we also put in a lot

00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,330
of things to help you maintain that

00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:59,130
thing so let's say you are an enterprise

00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:00,450
side or or you just care about the

00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:02,540
quality of your translations maybe

00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,710
you're not enterprise and you want to

00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:06,570
quality assure your translations on

00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,860
diverse staging environment and you want

00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:09,600
to push that out and you don't want this

00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,430
automatically download magic thing

00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,860
because it breaks your life site no

00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:15,330
problem what we did is we centralize the

00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:17,490
translation file location to one

00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:20,160
directory you can even put the directory

00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,720
to get version control or whatever you

00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,000
can download the translation files to

00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:27,330
that directory on dev or staging you can

00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,860
QA the import and you have the live site

00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:31,020
configured not to download any

00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:32,880
translations ever and when you push up

00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,710
your new release you it pushes up all

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,480
the files in the directory that maybe

00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:38,490
get version controlled and then it's

00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,880
important on the live site exactly sqa

00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:43,740
Don divorced aging very good right we

00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,210
have customization tracking so of course

00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,470
we pull down translation

00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:47,820
community but of course you are not

00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,559
happy with the translations that the

00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:51,870
community provides right it always

00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:53,220
happens so we track your customizations

00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,740
on top of what you download it from the

00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,600
community so when you import a

00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:59,549
translation file for example we asked

00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,620
you if it's if it's from the community

00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:03,600
or if it's your custom thing and also

00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,220
when you manually translate stuff on the

00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,580
site we will track that you customized

00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,409
to translations and that also works with

00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,630
protecting all your customizations so

00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:14,250
when this automatic update ones it will

00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:16,169
protect other customizations that you

00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:18,029
did before and it will not update them

00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:20,789
if you don't want it to update your

00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:23,580
customizations also we made it better to

00:20:20,789 --> 00:20:25,380
run on shared hosting in fact so if you

00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,140
if you import a huge file a huge

00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,000
translational product used to timeout or

00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,649
have memory problems in Drupal 7 and now

00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,940
we import them in small pieces we have a

00:20:31,649 --> 00:20:35,549
running window on the file that we

00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:38,100
import and it runs much better on shared

00:20:35,549 --> 00:20:42,120
hosting we have a whole new interface to

00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:44,760
translate your your site to whatever

00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,500
language so this used to be a table of

00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,690
source strings with languages crossed

00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,919
over if they were not translated and you

00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:51,809
can click there and then you can

00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,130
translate one string to all the

00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:55,020
languages on the site that you've had

00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:56,669
now that's not the use case that people

00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,169
actually want to have what they want to

00:20:56,669 --> 00:21:01,380
have is source during to one language

00:20:58,169 --> 00:21:03,570
and translated as fast as possible so in

00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,490
Drupal 8 we built this system where we

00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:08,010
have the source strings and we have the

00:21:05,490 --> 00:21:09,929
target strings and you can translate

00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:12,330
right away in place we also added

00:21:09,929 --> 00:21:14,399
support for plural strings that was not

00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:15,809
there in Drupal 7 is not back portable

00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:17,820
because we needed to update the data

00:21:15,809 --> 00:21:20,190
structure so you can translate one

00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,830
minute and Counting it in and the same

00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,659
thing we also track what you change so

00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:26,190
it's it's yellow in the table so you can

00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:28,320
walk away have a coffee come back and

00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:30,600
you still see what you changed we keep

00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,850
record of what changes made so we keep

00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,470
track of all the customizations and they

00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:36,990
will not be overwritten by stuff

00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,880
imported from the community and you can

00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:40,679
also export all your customizations so

00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,179
you can go to export your translations

00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,620
and you can just export the

00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:45,210
customizations that you made on top of

00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:47,760
the community translations and then

00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:51,210
bring them over to your other sites the

00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,820
thing is pretty cool also English can be

00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,320
translated to so in Drupal 7 if you

00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,330
wanted to have a custom English thing

00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,610
you needed to create a custom English

00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,380
line

00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:01,270
and then you were then you ended up with

00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,010
two English languages because they built

00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:05,830
in English is not removable in seven and

00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:08,679
it's not translatable so you needed to

00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:10,690
create a custom English in 78 you can

00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:12,370
remove English or if you want to

00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:14,080
translate to English which in this case

00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:16,420
means you want to customize the English

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,280
interface like you want to replace login

00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,620
with sign in and log out with sign out

00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,210
or whatever then then you go to the

00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,220
English language you check a checkbox

00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:26,200
make it available for translation and

00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:27,780
you can go and translate to English and

00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:31,179
you can replace whatever string you want

00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,950
easy peasy so in summary interface

00:22:31,179 --> 00:22:35,260
translation you can translate to English

00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,630
we have a whole new interface that's in

00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:39,790
plates in place translates your stuff

00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:41,950
and it saves your customizations we

00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:43,570
track all your custom translations the

00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:45,490
import will not timeout if you're

00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:47,530
running on shared hosting we centralize

00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:49,179
file directory for enterprise so you can

00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:51,130
track your translations and curate them

00:22:49,179 --> 00:22:52,540
and push them live we automatically

00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:54,940
download your translations from the

00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:56,169
community identify all your models for

00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,120
all the languages we download them

00:22:56,169 --> 00:22:59,500
import them and it's a separate modules

00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,380
if you don't need it you will not enable

00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:04,690
it so if you want to run a data store

00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:06,490
site that only has English interface you

00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:08,590
can still use language module to a sign

00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:09,910
language to stuff but you don't need to

00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,950
translate the interface and you can

00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:14,110
still have a site which has a rich

00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:15,940
language information of data but it

00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:17,880
doesn't need to have all this baggage of

00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:22,330
interface transition if you don't use it

00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:25,090
okay there's content translation which

00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:31,960
is same module name that was in Drupal 7

00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:34,270
but is an entirely different thing so

00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,100
thing is it it's only support notes but

00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:39,250
it supports all content entities in

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:41,280
Drupal core we are working on some of

00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,840
the details of this so that's why the

00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:46,240
yesterday is here and I will talk about

00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,220
that briefly we have an integrated

00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,559
configuration experience for this so how

00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,570
this looks like is you go to your custom

00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:54,190
language settings screen it lists all

00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:56,080
the entity types that you have on your

00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:58,540
system in my case it's common custom

00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,799
blog content economy term user and we

00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,510
are working on making menu items

00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:02,919
available here and then if you use

00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:05,530
Drupal commerce it will just show up

00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:07,120
here as a checkbox and you can say you

00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:10,840
want to have custom language settings

00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:13,090
for for your content so you go in

00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:15,310
we want to make custom language settings

00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:17,500
for content types then you will get this

00:24:15,310 --> 00:24:20,980
table that you've seen earlier but is

00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,870
now an even more dynamic table so you

00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,010
can set the default language for things

00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:26,200
but you can also make things

00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:27,880
translatable so you can say you want to

00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,310
make the article a content type

00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,800
translatable fine and then under the

00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:34,480
article content type you can make the

00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,160
body field translatable the image field

00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:40,180
translatable the tag field translatable

00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:42,220
end under the image field you can make

00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:45,820
the alt text and the title translatable

00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,680
and keep the file synchronized so it

00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,180
will synchronize the actual file that is

00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,640
uploaded but you can translate all the

00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:53,590
language specific information on top so

00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:55,510
you can have as detailed configuration

00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:57,760
as you want and you can just like diving

00:24:55,510 --> 00:25:00,790
deep into this from the very top very

00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:04,120
simple checkbox e-form to this very

00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:06,070
scary big thing where you can configure

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,600
everything and this is one screen where

00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:09,820
you can configure content translation

00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,080
across all your site everything so you

00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,490
don't need to go to your content type

00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:15,760
settings on your user settings on your

00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:17,620
taxonomy settings this is one screen and

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,280
you can configure everything in place so

00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:22,930
i think that's that's pretty cool so we

00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,360
also trend we also store all these

00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:27,070
translations in place under under the

00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:29,200
entity so if you want to achieve

00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:31,150
something similar in Drupal 7 this is

00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,940
the entity translation module concept

00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:36,190
but we improved on that a lot in how it

00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:38,110
works and how it's how its configured so

00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:40,090
it's essentially the user interfaces we

00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:42,130
have a translate tab on content you go

00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:44,140
to the translate tab we have a list of

00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:45,790
languages then you go to actually add

00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:48,190
the translation it will be very similar

00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:50,350
to the actual note form in Drupal 8 and

00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:52,690
you can just translate it and save it if

00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:54,580
you have permission to edit everything

00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:56,800
on the node you will be able to add it

00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,480
all the stuff that is not translatable

00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:00,310
in the translation as well if you don't

00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,620
have permission you will not be able to

00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:04,210
do that and there there's a lot of

00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:06,840
possibility for content modules to

00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:09,520
improve on this user interface obviously

00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:12,010
we have a lot of ideas that we will

00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,290
explore on the Sprint's on Friday and on

00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:15,520
the weekend there's a lot of exciting

00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:17,080
opportunities here and we have a few

00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:21,070
designs that we want to explore to

00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:24,400
improve this even more now there's a few

00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:25,810
problems here so so our main prob

00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,370
currently in this system is that

00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:30,220
properties are not yet translatable

00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:32,770
which is very painful so if you go back

00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:34,690
to the to denote configuration page i'm

00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:37,030
not sure if anybody noticed this problem

00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:41,020
but you can't actually translate the

00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:44,920
title of content in Drupal 8 that's bad

00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:47,110
so so that's that's like but it so it's

00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:49,840
unbelievable right so we can't release

00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:52,360
without that but we but it's hard to do

00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:54,010
so we're working on that very hard and

00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,590
that's the same problem for menu item

00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:58,060
labels and taxonomy term names and stuff

00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:00,640
like that that we want to solve for the

00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:02,440
release so we want to make them store /

00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,940
language and for you to be able to

00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,160
configure the same translate ability

00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,650
configuration on them so you have it

00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:11,290
configurable as any other field field on

00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:13,330
your entity it's very important for us

00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:14,920
so we're working very hard in this so if

00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:16,510
you have spare time and you like hard

00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:19,150
problems then you're very welcome to

00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:21,070
work on that and the other interesting

00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:23,620
problem is we haven't even started

00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:26,980
working on the migration path from

00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:28,690
Drupal 7 for this shiny new thing as a

00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,790
matter of fact we have to count and

00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:32,410
translation modules in core right now we

00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:34,150
have this content translation model and

00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:37,750
we have the content translation legacy

00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:39,340
module which is hidden so if you install

00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:41,860
Drupal 8 fresh you will not see that

00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:44,200
module at all but if you install Drupal

00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,970
8 by updating a Drupal 7 side you will

00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,160
see that module and all your previous

00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:50,830
content you're using that module will

00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,110
retain its features and functionality

00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:55,480
but we don't plan to implement anything

00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:57,700
new for that and we want to remove that

00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,880
from core and have a migration path for

00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:02,980
this new thing whether it happens by the

00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,200
time of release us to be seen but of

00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:07,450
course we would love to we would need to

00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,270
have this feature in anybody who's

00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:11,980
updating from Drupal 7 but this is a one

00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:14,490
of the big pain points that we need to

00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:17,740
resolve but there's a lot of fun things

00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:20,770
so core search api core search and the

00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:22,720
API supports language as well so in

00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:24,400
Drupal 7 we have a similar feature for

00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,250
entity translation but the search is

00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:29,020
there is no support for this so for for

00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,610
to be late we index each language

00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:32,890
version separately in the core search

00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:35,410
module and we also pass on language

00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:37,030
information all the AP is so when search

00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:38,260
comes in or when search indexing

00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:40,300
capitals we pass on the language

00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:42,400
formation so this makes it much much

00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:44,200
much much easier to integrate concept

00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,550
search modules with core they will get

00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,490
all the language information that we

00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:52,360
have there's also note access API /

00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:55,180
language so so now that we store all the

00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:57,940
translations in one entity we also

00:28:55,180 --> 00:29:00,100
support access / language for notes

00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:03,100
which is pretty exciting so in summary

00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:05,170
we support note access API / language we

00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:08,230
have searched indexing as a separate

00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:10,240
content we updated search ap is this

00:29:08,230 --> 00:29:12,510
applies to all content entities in core

00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,550
including menus taxonomy terms and

00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:17,260
regular content and users and all kinds

00:29:15,550 --> 00:29:19,240
of other things you can configure

00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:21,070
translate ability on the per bundle as

00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,680
in content type custom block type etc

00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:26,860
level and on the field level and on the

00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:28,450
subfield level very granular and we are

00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,770
still working on some stuff so like

00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:31,750
drupal 8 is not going to be really

00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:34,560
released on monday so we need to be

00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:37,210
working on something for a Europe that

00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:39,430
we have left so so we're working on

00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:42,100
properties to make them translatable and

00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:43,720
the migration path needs to be worked on

00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:46,270
but i think it's it's a very exciting

00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:48,340
thing there and then there is conflict

00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:50,170
translation which is especially exciting

00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:52,720
from either so i had a lot of fun

00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:55,660
working on this as well as all the other

00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,720
things and for this i want to explain

00:29:55,660 --> 00:30:00,640
briefly what config and content is in in

00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,600
Drupal 8 because that might not be clear

00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:06,010
on and the unfortunate truth is that as

00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,110
long as we have these as separate

00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:10,510
modules in separate you is we will need

00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:12,970
to explain this to users as well which

00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:15,610
is not good they don't they shouldn't be

00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:17,440
in the business of trying to understand

00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:20,110
this but I will see whether we can

00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,390
improve the UX to the point that it

00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:24,250
doesn't need to be explained so I've

00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:26,710
been talking about a lot about entities

00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,240
and we have entities supported in the

00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:31,660
content language translation thing

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,910
that's true in Drupal 8 there's two

00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:36,190
kinds of entities in core so what I've

00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:38,530
been talking about so far was content

00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:40,360
entities so there's content entities

00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:42,580
which are notes comments contact

00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:46,240
messages menu items terms users etc

00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:48,460
these are content entities and usually

00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,650
identify them because you can put field

00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,600
by the feature that you can put the

00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,280
fields on them

00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,020
so you can have configurable fields in

00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:57,030
them this is not necessarily true for

00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:58,679
every content entity but it's a

00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:01,140
generalization that might work to

00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:03,210
understand the concept like you can put

00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:06,830
fields on those users terms menu items

00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:09,690
no but contact messages and comments yes

00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:12,660
so that's content entities there's also

00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:14,880
config entities configuration entities

00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:18,059
in Drupal 8 and you can think of those

00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,929
as configuration that has pieces that

00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:25,650
has instances instances like a view or

00:31:21,929 --> 00:31:30,179
vocabulary or a contact category or a

00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:32,549
field or a block type so that's our menu

00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:34,770
in fact so that's that could be very

00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:36,600
confusing because a menu is an entity

00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:39,030
but it's a configuration entity and the

00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:41,010
menu item is an entity but it's a

00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:43,049
Content entity now I can't do anything

00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:45,600
about this I haven't designed this thing

00:31:43,049 --> 00:31:47,250
I think I think it makes sense from from

00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,400
an architectural perspective it so it's

00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:52,200
a nice architecture the things that you

00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,270
configure to do your content our

00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:58,400
configuration and the things where you

00:31:54,270 --> 00:32:00,690
do your content our content but again

00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:03,419
not sure that people will necessarily

00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:05,220
understand this so we'll need to do a

00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:06,990
lot of Education run this and get people

00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:09,000
and understand so this could this

00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:10,860
translation thing pertains to the

00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,590
configuration thing there is also a

00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:16,289
configuration that are not entities

00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:18,299
where there's not instances of things so

00:32:16,289 --> 00:32:21,150
for your site information like your site

00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:22,890
slogan or your site name those are not

00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:25,440
entities you can have multiple sightings

00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:27,330
so those are just configuration and

00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,299
there are just a couple things that are

00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:34,380
neither and they are just other storage

00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:36,059
things thankfully past aliases you

00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,429
already have language so they are kind

00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:40,110
of covered so in interpolate this is

00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:42,419
essentially the data model of Drupal 8

00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:44,850
in general so this applies regardless of

00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:46,980
language so you have entities for most

00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:48,480
of the things and some of those entities

00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:51,179
are content than some of those are

00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,620
configuration and this part of the talk

00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:54,960
is concerned about configuration

00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:57,270
translation and the good thing is for

00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,220
the for this blue thing all the

00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:01,830
configuration system uses one storage

00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:03,780
format and one system to maintain so

00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:04,970
that's amazing foreign language support

00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,890
and why it's amazing

00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:09,080
it's because we can track language on

00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:11,240
each file for entities and for these

00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:13,460
configuration pieces so we can say this

00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:15,289
view is in this language or this menu is

00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:17,539
in this language or this contact

00:33:15,289 --> 00:33:18,950
category is in this language and then we

00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:20,570
can do stuff with that as I've said

00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:22,549
earlier it's very important for us to

00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:26,480
track language on as granular as

00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:27,980
possible and then that's also also true

00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:30,289
that chip configuration is always in

00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:33,860
English so we can translate from English

00:33:30,289 --> 00:33:36,260
to other languages and we have a runtime

00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:38,059
overwrite support for configuration so

00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,320
we can ship all that configuration for

00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:41,480
the system and whatever configuration

00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:44,000
you create will create those

00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:46,309
configuration files and Drupal 8 and we

00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,070
can overwrite the translatable pieces of

00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:51,110
configuration with with translated text

00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,309
and then we can merge them and have

00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:54,650
translated versions of your

00:33:52,309 --> 00:33:56,720
configuration in different languages so

00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:58,730
that's a lot of fun to do and the

00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,190
feature in Drupal 8 that allows us to do

00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:02,960
is schema so we have a configuration

00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:06,049
schema system that explains the

00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,210
structure of the configuration for us so

00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:09,740
we can look at the structure find the

00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:12,050
pieces that are translatable and

00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,669
overwrite them with translations and

00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:16,070
have translated versions of the

00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:18,280
configuration for you so there is the

00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:20,869
configuration system unified in Drupal 8

00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:23,389
allows over rights that we can use to

00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:24,830
provide language variants and it has a

00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:26,419
schema system that explains the

00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:28,909
structure of configuration so we can

00:34:26,419 --> 00:34:30,679
build those over rights and this also

00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:32,570
supports a lot of other cool things in

00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:34,490
Drupal 8 like domain module or organic

00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,500
groups so it's not just applying to

00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:38,270
language the overrides and the schema is

00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,859
very useful for for the main module

00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:42,020
organic groups on the combination of

00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:46,040
language domain module and organic

00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:47,599
groups sounds fun so for ship

00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,070
configuration what we have is we

00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:51,020
actually integrated this with the

00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:52,220
interface translation so all the

00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,960
configurations that is shipped with

00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:57,320
Drupal core we consider a part of the

00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:59,060
software so you can translate your this

00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,560
is a contact category called website

00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,690
feedback that is shipped with Drupal

00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,670
core you can translate that contact

00:35:02,690 --> 00:35:06,650
category to a different language in in

00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:09,920
locale in the user interface transition

00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:12,380
UI and it's saved back to the

00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,880
configuration override system so it will

00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,980
be available as a translated

00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,360
configuration we it also works with

00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:19,460
boolean translations from

00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:21,170
community so the community can pre

00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:23,030
translate all the configuration that's

00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:25,190
in Drupal core so your views your

00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:27,530
content types your contact categories

00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:29,300
your node types will all be translated

00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:31,550
to different languages and it will all

00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:32,630
be translated from English so you will

00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:35,390
not have this problem that you have

00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:37,160
right now in seven that when you install

00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:39,050
Drupal it installs in a certain language

00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:41,180
and then when you add other things that

00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:42,890
are in another language and there's

00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:45,920
nothing to keep track of what's going on

00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:47,360
there so if you translate your contact

00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,460
category you will have a form that has

00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:52,250
your translated contact category name on

00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:54,470
it by the virtue of the scheme and the

00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:56,570
configuration the override system so

00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:59,270
that's this just built in features so

00:35:56,570 --> 00:36:01,460
you use the interface translation module

00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:03,470
to look for strings that are in

00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,480
configurational you translate it but

00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:08,150
this is a very crappy user interface to

00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:10,190
translate configuration because it's way

00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:11,870
out of context from where your contact

00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:14,150
categories are configured right this is

00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:16,130
our strings these are just strings

00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:17,810
individual strings that you need to find

00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:23,210
and translate so we have a better

00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:25,040
solution so the problem is this is only

00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:27,050
supported for ship configuration that is

00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:28,730
shipped with core the reason for that is

00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:30,230
the whole interface translation system

00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:33,080
is set up so it translates from english

00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:34,550
to something else and it translates all

00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:37,040
the stuff that the community can also

00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:40,190
translate on the community translation

00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,720
server so it doesn't support translating

00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:45,590
your own content types and your own

00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:47,480
views and we don't have any integration

00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:49,520
for translate or for making these

00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,220
strings available on localize drupal org

00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:54,980
so there's a lot of new api's in Drupal

00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:56,330
8 a lot of new syntax that we need to

00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:58,100
fit that they need to find all the

00:36:56,330 --> 00:37:00,620
translatable strings that are present in

00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:02,900
code for Drupal 8 that we don't yet have

00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:05,330
solution for finding all those strings

00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:07,190
so all the AP is that did not change

00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:09,140
from seven are supported but all the new

00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:12,350
API is I'm not supported at all so we

00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:13,760
need to work on that a lot however we

00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:16,640
have a country model in the works that

00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,440
we propose for core that that would

00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,600
provide that country that will provide a

00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,760
translation you I across everything in

00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:24,980
configuration and it's very shiny and

00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,850
easy so it's called a configuration

00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:30,170
translation module and what it does is

00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:30,740
it provides a translate tab on

00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:32,780
everything

00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:34,880
is translatable and configuration how

00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:36,890
easy is that so you go to your site

00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,810
configuration here is your site name my

00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:41,150
site name here is your slogan fantastic

00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:43,010
slogan and there's a translate tab so

00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:44,990
you go to the translate tab and surprise

00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:47,030
it will have a list of languages on your

00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:48,710
site much like content translation it

00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:50,300
will indicate the original language i

00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:52,460
installed the set in english i can

00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,710
translate it to hang gary and then i hit

00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:56,810
the add translation thing and i will get

00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:58,820
a form where I can input the translation

00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:00,740
for my site name and my slogan which

00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,750
were the translatable things from the

00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:04,700
previous page the previous page had a

00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:06,530
lot of other things that were there

00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:08,869
configurable but these are the only two

00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:11,180
things that are translatable so i can

00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:12,950
save that and then I go and the

00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:16,010
translated site name and slogan is there

00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:18,560
so the best thing about this is this is

00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:21,680
for the site name but this same system

00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:24,380
works for translating a menu a custom

00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:31,820
block a contact category a filter format

00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:33,560
a user role a panel a rule whatever so

00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:36,590
whatever uses the configuration system

00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:38,210
as long as they use the schema system

00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:40,609
they explain the structure of their

00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:44,450
configuration that we can identify the

00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:46,340
translatable things we can pull we can

00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:48,770
pull them out we can generate a form we

00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:50,420
generate this form for translation so

00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:51,830
you're if you have a country module you

00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,690
just provide you just use the

00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:55,790
configuration system and write a schema

00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:57,770
for your configuration and we generate

00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:59,840
the configuration form for you we save

00:38:57,770 --> 00:39:01,790
the translation for you and the right

00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,859
place it will be used for you it will be

00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:06,200
in the configuration system it is staged

00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:08,630
with configuration so it can be used to

00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,730
have staging life all that all those

00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:13,609
goodies are there so you only use the

00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:16,130
configuration system and and the schemas

00:39:13,609 --> 00:39:18,980
and you are done so we are proposing

00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:21,680
this module four core it looked not very

00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:23,660
likely to be committed we go but now I'm

00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,700
getting some more positive feedback so

00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:27,050
maybe maybe we'll have it in core it

00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:29,750
would be very nice i think it's a very

00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:32,240
crucial component for translatable DB

00:39:29,750 --> 00:39:34,400
cuz otherwise it's a WTF is like I can

00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:36,440
translate the default configuration in

00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,840
the very shitty you I but then I can't

00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:43,770
really translate the other stuff I don't

00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:46,650
know so so yeah so so this is this

00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:48,510
huge improvement ah the big thing to do

00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:50,670
here is change management so when the

00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:52,980
module is updated and they have a new

00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:54,690
plugin structure a new data structure

00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:57,150
for their views plugin or their they

00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:59,550
rule plugin or whatever then we need to

00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:00,960
maintain all those translations to move

00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:02,970
from the old structure to the new

00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,310
structure and we need to manage all that

00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:06,990
that we are not doing yet and we we have

00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:09,240
we are having a lot of discussions about

00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:11,220
that this week and we have issues to

00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:14,070
talk talk about that and this is a very

00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:16,110
nice user interface it has a tab at the

00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:17,760
right place it has a form it only shows

00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:20,220
two translatable is it works for views

00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,500
very nice but it's still very tricky

00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:27,120
because of the structure that I've shown

00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:30,870
earlier is that is that that you have

00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:33,330
these so the Drupal data structure is is

00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:36,480
very fragmented now so when you want to

00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:38,700
translate like a custom block it is it

00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,590
is a type of block that is that's a

00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,360
custom block type that is a

00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:45,540
configuration entity and is translated

00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:47,760
as configuration and then there's the

00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:50,730
block itself which is a Content entity

00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:53,130
it's an instance of the custom block so

00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:55,770
it translated as a Content entity so the

00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:57,900
body of the block will be translated as

00:40:55,770 --> 00:41:01,100
the content entity and then you place it

00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:04,140
on the page which is a block placement

00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:06,180
configuration entity so to place a

00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:09,090
custom block in Drupal 8 involves three

00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:11,190
entities that's the m2 configuration

00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:12,660
entities and a Content entity and if you

00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:15,300
want to translate you need to translate

00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:17,340
all three so there's a huge opportunity

00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:19,290
there for us to kind of figure out a

00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:21,420
good UI there there's a huge business

00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:23,310
opportunity for these guys to provide us

00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:26,250
a find you I own these lingotek guys

00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:28,680
over here who who would love to provide

00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:30,780
a nice and saying UI on top of this that

00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:32,340
that makes sense and is very fluid and

00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:34,650
is not exposing all these technical

00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:38,070
details of Drupal will obviously want to

00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:40,680
work on work on a general solution so we

00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:42,510
are not reliant on lingotek to do it but

00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:48,450
they will do it probably sooner them

00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:51,630
then we will do so watch out so the good

00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:53,340
news around configuration is we have we

00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:55,890
have a full interface translation in

00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:57,580
full translation interface think and rib

00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:59,380
that we are proposing for

00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:03,930
or if it will not lending core it will

00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:06,250
be in contribute modular works already

00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:07,810
we've been working a lot on actually

00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:10,150
improving the user experience of that

00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:12,160
and we'll do even more of that on Friday

00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:13,930
and will do accessibility testing it on

00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:17,560
Friday so we are working a lot on on

00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:19,990
perfect or perfecting this to make it

00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:21,640
even better we have standard translation

00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:23,560
tabs in this feature we have a schema

00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:25,810
system that explains that structure that

00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:27,880
we can use to generate forms and save

00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:29,500
translations we have conflict over eyes

00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,840
that are the actual translations saved

00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,460
this works for any configuration across

00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,200
all of tuples so we don't need to have

00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:37,030
the I Tina underscore views module and

00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:38,650
the i-10 and underscore panels module

00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:40,090
and the ITN another score path module

00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:41,710
and the IT underscore menu module and

00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:45,220
all of those because this works

00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:46,990
everywhere it's we have a core uy for

00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,430
ship configuration only which is also

00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:50,620
integrated with automated translation

00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:53,170
updates and customs drink tracking and

00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:55,060
everything unfortunately we don't really

00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:57,220
do the change management for this yet

00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:58,780
which we should and the UI is very

00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:01,750
tricky and we need to have a layer on

00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:03,820
top which makes sense so there's also I

00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:06,340
should mention the MGMT also here which

00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:08,320
is also unified UI on top of all kinds

00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:10,420
of sources of translation that you can

00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,550
push it to jobs and then translate them

00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:17,290
so there's also a very big possibility

00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:19,510
there that T MGMT 4tube late could could

00:43:17,290 --> 00:43:21,760
could plug in this hole and provide you

00:43:19,510 --> 00:43:24,640
with with an integrated solution in

00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:26,770
Drupal 8 so I would love to I would love

00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:29,800
to have that out sooner than later for

00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:32,320
Drupal 8 so we have these four pillars

00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:34,720
we have language support which which

00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,850
adds amazing new features like languages

00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,730
Simon across everything and and much

00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:41,410
easier to use we have interface

00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:43,170
translation which automatically download

00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:45,970
supports enterprise work flows better

00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:48,820
tracks custom strings lets you translate

00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:50,590
to English we have content translation

00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:52,570
which works across every and every

00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:55,180
content entity in core and it's very

00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:56,590
granular very configurable and we have

00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:59,440
content translation which works across

00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:02,590
every content every config in Drupal and

00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:04,420
is very very powerful as well so our

00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:06,370
goal with Drupal 8 is to really have

00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:08,410
length so as just to go back to my point

00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:10,360
at the start is to really have language

00:44:08,410 --> 00:44:12,610
as a core understanding and not just

00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:15,370
afterthought and have core support

00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:17,470
language everywhere and if and if you

00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:19,330
use core abs and core systems proper

00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:21,580
then you will have language support in

00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:24,190
your module so if you have a custom

00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:25,960
content entity type you will use the MTT

00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:28,600
API that has built-in language support

00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:30,850
if you have custom configuration systems

00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:33,100
like rules and panels will have then you

00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:35,440
will have intrinsic support for language

00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:38,200
through the configuration system so this

00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,060
is really a base support system that I

00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:42,490
hope would basically change the game for

00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:44,830
multilingual in Drupal 8 because this is

00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:46,930
supporting everything if everybody who

00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:48,460
uses the API right to have language

00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:51,490
support in their modules which is going

00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:52,990
to be amazing i believe so if you want

00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:55,750
to get involved and be part of this and

00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:57,880
be in that huge list of people we have a

00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:59,500
website a Drupal 8 multilingual org

00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:01,690
where you can see all the people working

00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:05,290
on this all the events that we have

00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:07,600
meeting times sprints news about what we

00:45:05,290 --> 00:45:09,430
are doing focus issues on what we are

00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:12,670
currently working on what we want to

00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:14,590
achieve even videos of where we are so

00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:17,080
when this video is available I will put

00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:19,270
it there so people can see and always be

00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:22,210
up up today we have a Twitter feed at da

00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:25,090
tamiya tweeted such DMI we will sprint

00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:27,760
here we already sprint it here on the

00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:30,280
last Saturday Sunday and Monday and we

00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,350
will sprint here on Friday Saturday and

00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:33,850
Sunday we will sprint in this building

00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:36,040
on Friday and we will sprint on the

00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:37,390
weekend in the Aqua office they are

00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:39,310
sponsoring not just the multilingual

00:45:37,390 --> 00:45:41,380
sprint there will be whiskey Sprint's to

00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:44,880
expense configurations prints a lot of

00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:47,410
sprints and the we will split in Dublin

00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:50,230
Drupal Daphne's Dublin is the biggest

00:45:47,410 --> 00:45:52,540
developer conference in Europe outside

00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:54,430
of Triple Crown obviously so that's

00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:57,070
going to happen at the end of June and

00:45:54,430 --> 00:45:59,380
it's the last week right before feature

00:45:57,070 --> 00:46:02,230
freeze so it's the last opportunity to

00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:04,870
not feature fees code freeze so it's the

00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:06,700
last opportunity to get or get a lot of

00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:09,070
those things that we still need to do in

00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:11,590
so we will be there a lot of us will be

00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:13,060
there all week to work on those things

00:46:11,590 --> 00:46:14,710
that are still not ready at that point

00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:17,800
obviously we would love to have stuff

00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:20,560
ready as soon as possible so i would i

00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:23,020
would wish you are included already on

00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,190
this list if you are not then please get

00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:26,050
involved come

00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:27,670
come on over and friday either if you

00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:29,589
haven't haven't been involved with core

00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:31,930
before you should go to the mentored

00:46:29,589 --> 00:46:34,690
sprint there's people who will mentor

00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:36,790
you to get on board and get involved we

00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:38,560
have all kinds of list of tasks so for

00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:40,780
example Kristin identified two days ago

00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,640
that that the module name for

00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:45,490
configuration translation is not

00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,079
capitalized properly and we don't even

00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:48,640
have the issue for that so we have an

00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:49,720
issue opens we have a patch filed we

00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,270
have somebody to test that an

00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:55,050
uncommitted so there's things like that

00:46:52,270 --> 00:46:57,819
we can we can have issues on any level

00:46:55,050 --> 00:47:00,069
on any kind of area that you want to be

00:46:57,819 --> 00:47:02,560
involved so there's people mentoring you

00:47:00,069 --> 00:47:04,060
on Friday if you already experienced in

00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:06,490
Drupal core development you come to our

00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:09,130
sprint you will look for me or or

00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:10,420
somebody else on the multilingual table

00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:12,640
we will have signs up where the

00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:16,300
multilingual table is we will be there

00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:18,099
and you can find us there so that should

00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:20,950
be it I hope you are as excited about

00:47:18,099 --> 00:47:23,069
Drupal 8 as I am and let's open up for

00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:23,069
questions

00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:38,810
I know we haven't solved some of the

00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:45,980
problems so there there should be

00:47:38,810 --> 00:47:47,990
problems you mentioned that language

00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:50,950
detection will be browser-based will you

00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:55,880
still support URL based language

00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:58,340
choosing oh yeah so so so what we have

00:47:55,880 --> 00:48:00,500
is all the features of Drupal 7 for

00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:02,510
language configuration with a much

00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:05,390
better user interface so it's all

00:48:02,510 --> 00:48:07,130
configured on one UI and we have Pat and

00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:08,690
we already by default if you install

00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:10,760
Drupal it will enable path language

00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:12,740
selection by default so you will not

00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:14,510
like i just added a language and i can

00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:16,520
and i and i added a language selector

00:48:14,510 --> 00:48:17,660
black and it doesn't work so that's the

00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,460
initial experience of somewhere in

00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:21,470
drupal 7 so you will work out of the box

00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:23,660
into blade so we have all that supported

00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:25,120
and we improved the browser detection a

00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:27,830
lot we have we've added a lot more

00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:29,360
testing coverage we've added mapping for

00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:32,390
external languages to internal languages

00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:33,740
and then we have a couple more language

00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:37,510
selection options so yes we support

00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:39,800
everything that we did so far thank you

00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:42,560
this morning in Kristin sessions she

00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:44,930
explained that in d6 translation is node

00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:46,790
based in seven its node or entity base

00:48:44,930 --> 00:48:49,070
and in eight it'll be receiving

00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:53,090
field-based and it'll be filled based on

00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:54,770
going we use a model where for region

00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:56,030
only content like for China only

00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:58,400
products for example we source

00:48:56,030 --> 00:49:02,120
everything in English unpublish it and

00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:04,580
then translate to chinese since it's one

00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:06,680
node how are we going to unpublish the

00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:09,790
english and have the chinese only show

00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:12,350
yes so I believe there's currently a

00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:14,750
custom solution in the node

00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:18,050
implementation for either the distance

00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:19,160
latest or not and we also working on

00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:21,230
making the properties themselves

00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,820
multilingual it's very exciting because

00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:24,830
you can have authored tracking /

00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:26,810
language and status tracking / language

00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:29,390
and created time tracking prillaman and

00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:31,010
stuff like that so so you can have all

00:49:29,390 --> 00:49:32,690
those properties for a language then you

00:49:31,010 --> 00:49:34,700
can just unpublish certain languages

00:49:32,690 --> 00:49:36,950
that you don't want to see so treat it

00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:38,990
kind of like a a meta node and I don't

00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:40,610
know yeah yeah okay right thank you so

00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:42,730
what we found is in room in Drupal 7

00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:44,740
we've created copies of the node

00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:46,510
and then people didn't really understand

00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:48,340
that there may be another copy of this

00:49:46,510 --> 00:49:50,140
note that is kind of the same thing but

00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:52,030
it's not really the same thing and what

00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:53,590
we do instead now is we translate it in

00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:55,780
place and we apply it to every entity

00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:57,670
type so people that some people who

00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:59,320
don't want to deal with language they

00:49:57,670 --> 00:50:01,060
deal with one entity and they don't want

00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:03,670
to they don't need to deal with language

00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:06,520
people who want to deal with with

00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:09,220
language can provide like the the entity

00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:13,540
identifier and language and then be more

00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:15,119
granular in what they deal with so has

00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:18,510
there been any thought given to

00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:22,450
integration between date and

00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:25,960
multilingual right now we had hellish

00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:29,830
problems translating date for doing date

00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:32,560
formats and Chinese in places where it

00:50:29,830 --> 00:50:37,090
can't be handled by you know PHP date

00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:38,890
codes and stuff like that so I don't

00:50:37,090 --> 00:50:41,770
have a good answer for that I know that

00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:44,800
the day the other day trans date format

00:50:41,770 --> 00:50:47,650
/ language configurability that there

00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:49,359
was in seven was boarded 28 and it's

00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:51,030
ed's in the configuration system it uses

00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:56,460
the configuration language system I

00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:59,859
don't think that was improved much but I

00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:02,290
I don't have good details on that

00:50:59,859 --> 00:51:04,780
unfortunately okay so certainly that the

00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:07,270
existing features certainly there I'm

00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:09,070
not sure if it was improved in a way

00:51:07,270 --> 00:51:11,050
that's helpful it's probably more of a

00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:13,900
date problem than a than an

00:51:11,050 --> 00:51:20,850
internationalization problem but but it

00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:26,200
is a problem yeah any other questions no

00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:28,600
okay then oh wait slightly unrelated but

00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:30,070
at the sprint I think is around the

00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:33,400
multilingual table someone left a mouse

00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:36,900
on Monday those was wondering if anyone

00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,900
here who's missing a mouse

00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:47,289
okay yeah what was that I didn't catch

00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:52,930
that oh you lost a mouse are you left it

00:51:47,289 --> 00:51:57,579
I don't know yeah you can you can put it

00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:59,410
out you can you can yeah so if that's it

00:51:57,579 --> 00:52:01,589
then thank you i hope you will enjoy the

00:51:59,410 --> 00:52:01,589
