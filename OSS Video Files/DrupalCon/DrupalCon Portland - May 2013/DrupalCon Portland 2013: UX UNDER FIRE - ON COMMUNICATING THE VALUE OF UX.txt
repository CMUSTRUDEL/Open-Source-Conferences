Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: UX UNDER FIRE - ON COMMUNICATING THE VALUE OF UX
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	As a UX professional you've probably found yourself forced to argue for the importance of UX in a project. You've probably heard people say that UX is of little importance. And as a designer it's not always easy to explain why UX matters. But UX needs to be justified. And it's your job to do so. In this session I will present ways to convince even project managers from hell about the value of UX.

Attend this session to learn methods to visualize and communicate the value of UX and usability. Using these tools and frameworks you will be able to convincingly argue for why UX is critical to a website delivering what its stakeholders expect.

SESSION HIGHLIGHTS

The reasons why UX comes under fire, and the many misconceptions that exist regarding UX and usability.
The UX value proposition: How to visually translate the value of UX work.
The link between UX and business: How to talk about UX in terms business-oriented people can relate to.
A remarkable success story: How a few hours spent on UX increase revenue for an online retailer by 45%!
* I use the the term UX here as a shortening for the wide field of usability, interaction design (IxD), user experience design and information architecture.

TARGET AUDIENCE

If your job includes communicating with the customer, capturing requirements, formulating requirements or helping ensure the project is a good use of your customer's money, this one is for you. In a typical agency you are a UX designer, graphic designer, project manager/lead, technical lead, client manager or product owner to mention some common titles.

Previously presented at DrupalCon Munich 2012 and Frontend United in Amsterdam in April of 2012, this session was very appreciated and highly rated.

all right let's start local decision on

00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:14,099
you execute in the fire everyone hear me

00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,670
okay get yourself better i was in the

00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:19,680
microphone on through the passage right

00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,420
before start so if topic area seem to

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,719
the fire it's essentially a lot of

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:39,899
criticism that helix comes under due to

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:43,410
a lot of misconceptions that exist so my

00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:45,690
name is jacob one they may know me as no

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:50,190
one always one of its founders arrays

00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:53,969
i'm actually but i'm actually on buying

00:00:50,190 --> 00:01:00,420
it sweet which is distributed this will

00:00:53,969 --> 00:01:02,730
agency and here my contact details so

00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,339
it's a it's a synthetic digital agency

00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,570
this would dispute agency and what do

00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:11,210
you think separately from other

00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:13,770
companies and it's something action

00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:22,470
alright so you can check out the website

00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:28,650
whistle so fix you slaughter from state

00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:31,829
and the log is so i think it's up to

00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:38,100
post it one of the things are okay with

00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:40,320
you XX like this calendar like the pure

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,490
engineer may be certain color and make

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:48,090
it pretty yeah right I have friends

00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,680
called into toys like this week I'm you

00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,210
know they were like yeah what leads to

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,480
sex occurred you know so it is make

00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:58,430
photonic crystal Motor Co

00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:59,990
no that's not the way she did so to

00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,030
understand what is the problem why this

00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:06,500
is wrong let's go back to route to why

00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:08,000
you exist method in first place so I'm

00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,730
going to take some rhythm from physics

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,610
times for you x so in Europe would have

00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:15,560
a navigable ryanair maybe heard of it

00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:18,350
and right now they have tried to the

00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,020
basic bad copper southwest so they

00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:24,380
actually achieved but they're dead

00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:25,970
they're not good in any way including

00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,460
their previous about the head of Flight

00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:32,600
one principle but that's mostly because

00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:34,670
to treat their Kevin Correia I'm going

00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,010
to do is when you are released when you

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:41,390
actually buy to get to the website you

00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:43,780
the option of choosing insurance and

00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:49,610
there's offices I don't want come on

00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:51,560
instead you have heated in place of so

00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:54,380
that both cover me is a country

00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:59,690
apparently it's a new number of European

00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:03,080
Union yep code remaining here so an

00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:04,910
elevator somewhere in Xbox pain those of

00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,820
you speak Spanish about this is very

00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:12,050
confusing this is a very much sir we've

00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:13,280
all accepted oh damn an idiot and I

00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:16,300
worked which but until you have to

00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,890
question if I was in the elevator and

00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,110
then if so I don't know the subway man

00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:24,410
extraction here it is not likely Sweden

00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:30,010
and first-ever far as many unlike what

00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:32,750
like maybe we just saw this order now

00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,730
you just press the weight and like to

00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,550
specific to Mike this is what's in

00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:39,860
everyone OMG sorry these points but thus

00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,630
we know like dished out the cause you

00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:44,840
know the things are lined up thank you

00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:49,370
I've seen as blogging LOL you're my idol

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:53,170
it doesn't your brain sees and hears a

00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,170
very famous example from XTC

00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,090
the Venn diagram over what people look

00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,420
for our University website and

00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:07,900
information that usually expire like

00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:11,350
voldemort Scott check an e-commerce for

00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:14,730
usability absolutes uses it it's

00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:18,130
actually a big loss of revenue I like

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:20,049
double missiles one said like three says

00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:23,230
four hundred percent I fix immiscibility

00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:25,540
small fixes and an e-commerce site if

00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:30,130
your customers are members online

00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:33,580
vendors monomer sites then they have a

00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:40,060
lot of good reason to pay you to do some

00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:42,220
work so using these are problems you can

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:47,800
be resolved just buy the stuff isn't all

00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:53,320
right of course not I mean no so what is

00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:57,040
your call it for me you teaser is a

00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,590
number actresses and methods so in here

00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,960
its order to understand the and stamper

00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:05,350
user needs a state initiative a

00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:09,039
requirement design vintage solutions in

00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,240
evaluate us which is dehydrated and I

00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,180
would like to see this number of

00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,250
expression so in user experience were a

00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,530
number of activities we have image

00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,850
design you civil engineering into

00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:23,440
actually some with me to architect

00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:25,989
experience which may say with ease they

00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,719
won't ever come back later

00:05:25,989 --> 00:05:32,869
this is how I see what would you tease

00:05:29,719 --> 00:05:38,869
about flip with a school night what are

00:05:32,869 --> 00:05:43,009
the diffident this apparently sly

00:05:38,869 --> 00:05:45,769
Patrick mark mark say the town yoox

00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:51,259
include HTML xml / Jason so wait do you

00:05:45,769 --> 00:05:53,119
putting a text i won race for according

00:05:51,259 --> 00:05:56,209
to enter any information architects

00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:58,639
which we honestly doubt the reformation

00:05:56,209 --> 00:06:03,829
architecture efficiency what all this

00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:07,339
stuff like it's pretty but i don't it

00:06:03,829 --> 00:06:13,999
doesn't make me an advisor exactly this

00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:15,349
company you also see customer service so

00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:17,629
if you're looking for a job somewhere

00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:21,919
ask them to draw a Venn diagram of the

00:06:17,629 --> 00:06:23,209
exposition protocols and it is complete

00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,589
you're not to open oh I'm doing

00:06:23,209 --> 00:06:28,699
human-computer interaction there's

00:06:24,589 --> 00:06:32,559
something else living si tu and chances

00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:32,559
are this is what looks like your office

00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,419
so that lets play a lot of confusion

00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:40,159
here so let's let's a fine listen this

00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:43,999
thing's here they are the activities the

00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:46,339
things we do this is it these are sets

00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:48,619
of tools that we do carry out in your

00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:50,629
work and then there's the quality stuff

00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:53,029
you that we achieve that we produce in

00:06:50,629 --> 00:06:57,289
the products so how do these things

00:06:53,029 --> 00:07:00,889
relate at the core we are visible to go

00:06:57,289 --> 00:07:04,309
so things like efficiency you know East

00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:06,529
learn digital early and those you trying

00:07:04,309 --> 00:07:08,899
lead to products having other things

00:07:06,529 --> 00:07:11,819
like big sport of creativity

00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:18,419
entertaining and half of motivating

00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:21,579
so they won great user experience

00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:23,709
requires good usability so it's easy to

00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:25,479
read easy to remember how to use is easy

00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:27,939
it's probably motivating satisfying to

00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:30,789
see can you think of a product that is

00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:33,819
the audience is used but still motivated

00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:35,379
well some are games a heart we play them

00:07:33,819 --> 00:07:38,109
closer heart they're hard in the right

00:07:35,379 --> 00:07:40,359
way if you struggle with user interface

00:07:38,109 --> 00:07:42,549
mood for your for gaming or chewy

00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:44,979
usually now you want to be beaten by the

00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:49,989
by the gorilla lecture on you know logs

00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:53,679
like to thank you so we have all these

00:07:49,989 --> 00:07:57,419
tools and they allow us to create new

00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:59,649
disability narratives experiences so

00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:02,639
here comes we also implement solutions

00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:04,959
of this problem we also do they actually

00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:09,969
we've been prototypes on what we do

00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:12,339
using divisions but you know I shoulders

00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:14,859
over the river put the Sumerian on it's

00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:17,549
going to work anyway well Luke's the

00:08:14,859 --> 00:08:20,499
sequencer know something looks for work

00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:23,079
and that's why it's little expression

00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:24,429
for me which makes a given form or shape

00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:26,709
to something keep it use it

00:08:24,429 --> 00:08:28,779
interchangeably website but i like about

00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:30,519
the sign is that you design a solution

00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:33,009
if you just want to give something an

00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:38,409
appearance or something you actually it

00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:40,389
isn't how it works some companies have

00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:43,000
made in sight distance and this is

00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:44,800
critical but you can get enormous this

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,300
is a cutter making sure if something

00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:55,809
works in a pleasing way and it one way

00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:57,730
to this is familiar so grateful tasks to

00:08:55,809 --> 00:09:00,339
experiences it completely different

00:08:57,730 --> 00:09:01,459
solutions leg of a function of demeaning

00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:04,009
for

00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:05,660
so let's let's map some some quality to

00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:08,420
see how they this is just my subjective

00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:10,999
understanding of things but these are

00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,490
still some numbers actually that's what

00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:14,929
it's like in kaznia and some actionable

00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:16,790
really is a beautiful only two

00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:19,100
specialties things you just because

00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:21,529
they're fun to you sir I can't imagine

00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,300
if licking the circular motion on your

00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:25,249
form maybe that clicked at least an

00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:27,740
iphone or android to execute that

00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:29,569
momentum he also keeps rolling them or

00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:32,389
the way that the eye control over the

00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:34,999
screen with fact it's entirely flawless

00:09:32,389 --> 00:09:37,069
there's no there's there's no slowness

00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:39,170
or anything and I remember cities a

00:09:37,069 --> 00:09:41,300
friend he had another corner from an

00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:42,860
early-generation and said look Robin

00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,920
look at stuttering you know when you're

00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:49,129
like strong screen looking like it goes

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,980
smoothly that is the same thing does it

00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:53,720
matter but it doesn't need this the way

00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,639
you perceive something the work is how

00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,379
you think it works so it seems to work

00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:01,970
well we believe work for you can trust

00:09:57,379 --> 00:10:04,069
it so there is in companies here I don't

00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:05,449
be protected I'm very much trust them I

00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:06,559
would say they're dead lift somewhere

00:10:05,449 --> 00:10:11,059
here between useful and reliable

00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:13,069
products upon two books products are you

00:10:11,059 --> 00:10:16,699
getting better and better ladies vs

00:10:13,069 --> 00:10:20,660
inter is actually oh I should cross the

00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:22,490
chasm and see Microsoft even better not

00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:27,980
really great but they're really spending

00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:30,889
a lot of time DUI google I like over

00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:35,240
google day there yeah look it's fascism

00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:37,009
some stuff but it works of course that's

00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,410
low ground they made this knowledgeable

00:10:37,009 --> 00:10:41,769
meaningful useful one for design to be

00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:41,769
the band

00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:49,720
so this is apply this or to have

00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:51,520
purposely took an example really so what

00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:56,650
the bunt is perfect they provide a lot

00:10:51,520 --> 00:11:02,350
of these folks no way so let's look at

00:10:56,650 --> 00:11:04,180
it wait to the tools are at Lincoln so

00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:05,320
information design is a skill and

00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,550
practice of referring to make sure

00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,960
people understand like graphs and

00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:09,960
diagrams that it takes here is

00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,030
experienced finest is how it feels like

00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:19,090
like what kind of emotions you give the

00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:21,130
rights to the user in music I also has

00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:23,740
to do with using others and things to

00:11:21,130 --> 00:11:25,780
engage user information architecture

00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:29,340
it's about five strips information from

00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:31,720
a Content autonomous navigation menus

00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:35,170
you spoke engineering has to be the

00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:37,270
small details and use user is

00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,890
potentially is often but what about user

00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:44,100
research when you actually remove

00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:48,370
symantec saw you change into experience

00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:50,800
interaction is fine if I have saluted

00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,840
the power to thread a lot of different

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,020
versions is a town or taps before

00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:59,200
decided to go with exactly that kind of

00:11:55,020 --> 00:12:02,260
solution in graphic design they overall

00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:07,720
looking for three will be equated here

00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:10,240
and it collapses but I mainly that

00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,850
thought despite all this source not make

00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,810
it easy to present the multi-part is

00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:21,910
hard either buyers as it ran successful

00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:26,800
so let's make the song and look at is so

00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:29,650
three percent in products on the council

00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:32,460
after wrong that they then they give up

00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,460
trying to finish them

00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:39,210
twenty-five percent delivered on time

00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:42,760
budget but results nothing was expected

00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:45,940
I'm going to argue that results is no

00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,860
matter whether the project is exactly to

00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:52,090
scope or requirements with whether X

00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:55,600
deliver services recommended a bit in

00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:58,150
two trips and see to the budget they got

00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,880
everything they wanted other reasons for

00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:02,650
this wrong tell me where of a lack of

00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,450
user lipid involvement we built

00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:09,840
something the oxygen sockets problem in

00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:13,390
a way that requirements being incomplete

00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:17,490
the price being clarified later on the

00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:19,810
course of project already six vacations

00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:21,520
the customer you know like the customer

00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:23,320
having an idea what they were buying but

00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:28,900
was not what work you were able to

00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:30,820
deliver so this is massive waste I mean

00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:33,970
hope we can fix this now we have to do

00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:37,510
we have the tools to identify problem

00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:41,820
different needs in design to them but we

00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:45,670
also tools to understand i will show you

00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:48,810
this was called effectively affect my

00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:51,220
pain relies on two different researchers

00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:53,740
first was ever so i would like to belt

00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,450
for a reason and to me the code there

00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:59,130
are certain business values related to

00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:01,960
building website or poor poor system and

00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:04,960
the ghost can only be achieved if people

00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:07,810
are using the website if it's not being

00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:12,510
used its there's no they kicked me out

00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:16,210
of it he has the advantage of an

00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:18,970
providing on a very much upon review of

00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:20,980
of the different of the goals and of the

00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,810
state holds more from the frick traffic

00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:25,690
looks like this we're going to break

00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:28,840
them in half and see where it it's Percy

00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:31,210
support but that core here is the extra

00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,710
frame and finally I reflect this is the

00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:35,170
first thing you do and it can be kind of

00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:37,420
Mississippi a lot of thinking it because

00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:38,499
you think differently about light across

00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:42,369
this

00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:48,009
I call this walk of life because it

00:14:42,369 --> 00:14:49,989
comes soon say hey William oops okay bye

00:14:48,009 --> 00:14:52,719
why it's really hard to find out to be

00:14:49,989 --> 00:14:55,749
open there's no way to post comments and

00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:58,629
feel post a comment okay why do you need

00:14:55,749 --> 00:15:02,709
that well a big share of our customers

00:14:58,629 --> 00:15:04,239
want to feel involved well we need to

00:15:02,709 --> 00:15:07,239
reach those customers in order to

00:15:04,239 --> 00:15:10,389
channel for more settlers item that's

00:15:07,239 --> 00:15:12,639
what they want to challenge more turn

00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:15,609
parts a site that was uh putting on

00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,949
better website but what better met about

00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:21,699
two different authors were asking why

00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:24,489
why why repeatedly American a it does

00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:26,559
Wi-Fi one asked you to move over the

00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:29,349
more meaningful dialogue with your

00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:31,689
customer but the chorus understand the

00:15:29,349 --> 00:15:32,829
motivation and the person holding money

00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:38,019
while they actually giving you the

00:15:32,829 --> 00:15:40,149
magnetically second so okay so we go

00:15:38,019 --> 00:15:41,709
walk what do we have to do to reach this

00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:46,419
customers and more text chat more inside

00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:50,199
well i'm going to write that sir these

00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:53,499
people should be more a few services it

00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:56,470
needs to be measurable and it should be

00:15:53,499 --> 00:16:00,839
long-term so it is not something happen

00:15:56,470 --> 00:16:03,159
overnight in a month or even longer

00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:06,970
alright so the formal act effect and the

00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:09,939
right number of always symmetry I'd as

00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:13,359
you can see these are all highly

00:16:09,939 --> 00:16:15,489
qualified it's not opinion it's actually

00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:17,829
if you see it is affecting your patterns

00:16:15,489 --> 00:16:23,019
in their beliefs count then we have

00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:24,519
succeeded and is also like a limiter and

00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:26,079
that allows you to basically look back

00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:30,449
at six months see what's working what's

00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,449
not let's revise introduction

00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:39,080
you go to the robot and direct lift of

00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:41,150
it you have the GOP's specific all right

00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:43,400
so we have the effect you have the goats

00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,790
we need to understand that users are it

00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,590
is the one if they're not using website

00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:50,930
just look again affected we need

00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:53,090
understand what motivates them and what

00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:55,730
do they expect yourself so first of all

00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:58,700
who are they to find it to the oil you

00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:00,770
can use these red engineering ok which

00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:04,730
start is the observation and interviews

00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:11,510
to stop is personas are you familiar

00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:13,040
with personas placemats ok good so right

00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:15,680
you're going to get a little bit in a

00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,120
second so for some of us are responsive

00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,980
really good not just for you but for the

00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,240
sinus and what developers to because

00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:23,300
they can actually relate to what it says

00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:25,220
in the person they love to something

00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,170
from nobody next to sign of a person we

00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:28,850
give a person a given change because

00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:31,610
he's 22 vote because it works is my

00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:33,860
planet for example you know spreadtrum

00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:37,460
export export bringing bear with Spencer

00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:38,510
chemistry to go but like it which angel

00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,370
like this what do you actually think

00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:42,470
this one was sort of like helping them

00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:44,930
if you start involving entirely members

00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:46,520
I would even recommend you to print out

00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:50,810
this person or even take into the walls

00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:53,180
in your office and Constance's questions

00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:59,840
of course they have gasoline kara

00:17:53,180 --> 00:18:02,690
tomorrow then we can not it now compare

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,330
I would not recommend you to divide

00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:07,130
people into these roses these rolls are

00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:09,950
often a llama where they work in a

00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,960
company but typically we have OC like

00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:15,260
information seekers information retreat

00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:17,870
retrievers the finishing publishers the

00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:20,450
curious wants is for try to think more

00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:24,460
about but kind of behavior for the earth

00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:24,460
people Moreland where they work

00:18:27,929 --> 00:18:33,519
so the next appear is the thing how the

00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,289
article suppress information you need

00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:39,879
like how will they be information

00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:42,639
and here's more information architect or

00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:44,619
synthase and using card sorting and

00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:46,389
three testing you can actually you can

00:18:44,619 --> 00:18:47,619
see you can find a much larger way to

00:18:46,389 --> 00:18:50,409
divide your content the weight

00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:53,320
percentage in terms of menus and do

00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:54,700
interviews and sitemaps ass off and let

00:18:53,320 --> 00:19:00,309
it or less they'll answer even more

00:18:54,700 --> 00:19:02,259
questions about this user okay so we

00:19:00,309 --> 00:19:03,610
know a bit about who they are in

00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:05,889
information look before and how they

00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:09,879
expect that information we divided and

00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:11,470
organized so next thing we know is what

00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:14,259
are the costs like why do they way to

00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:15,700
take this information and this one

00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:16,929
experience designing expense I

00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:20,409
interaction design and graphic design

00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:22,720
commit we can do wireframes we can skype

00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:25,749
file to catch you feel which starts to

00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,720
decide we could mark up storyboards and

00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:32,769
turn in apps but scenarios if you matter

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:40,539
with your apps pit so something is very

00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:44,559
exciting recently is form of discipline

00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:46,929
of the design called the sources so

00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:49,149
regularly in the business easy

00:19:46,929 --> 00:19:51,399
compromise some wonder secretions and

00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:54,879
enters the website when you serve design

00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:56,080
you go off and you look at the customers

00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:58,029
experience through all these different

00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,759
chambers they design regardless of

00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:02,619
channel find solutions will invest and

00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:03,909
one way to visualize to our customer

00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:08,369
would interface with the country it

00:20:03,909 --> 00:20:08,369
would be cheaper tickets a call join map

00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:16,570
all right so how do i am on a mission is

00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:20,080
this call it finally goes that good that

00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:22,149
users have and then is waiting with the

00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,490
overall effect but now I can look at

00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:26,169
each target group what they expect and

00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:27,600
however we meet the expectations or

00:20:26,169 --> 00:20:30,940
serve that need

00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,130
and this is that this is the most

00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,290
felicitous it isn't filled in either one

00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:37,690
comes come to your site now we are right

00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:39,850
now what you have now they have defined

00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,770
what the customer expects you have to

00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:44,230
find you the need to engage and what

00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:45,520
they are expected in the website this is

00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:49,000
one more component now in order to

00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:51,970
exhale for complete basically a big

00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,870
foundation for projects requiring system

00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:57,610
and that is actually tasks that's the

00:20:55,870 --> 00:21:00,850
next step so I can see it put the goals

00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:03,360
out here and we'll also make a maximum

00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:07,510
when I was translating them into tasks

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:09,040
so in order to want to redo I want to so

00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:11,440
for example this user here one more

00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:14,320
surprise paper forms the life forms or

00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,880
to do that I expect great points

00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:19,929
communication classes make it possible

00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:22,120
for users two digits and what so you

00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:23,830
know if function is expecting now we can

00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:26,530
design the user interface the mock-ups

00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:31,300
and everything to give a nice persona is

00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:34,600
given this person's it teaches so as you

00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:36,880
can see using using research you say we

00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,650
should design we can actually convert

00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,190
distance because Creek business value

00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:44,890
and make requirements how to live this

00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:47,530
is why this is not about selecting

00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:49,510
columns is actually about making sure

00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:54,210
what we building extra services progress

00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:54,210
without this work with shooting time

00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:03,520
so how can help people understand this

00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:06,799
but this is actually beautiful but

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,020
criticism uses this misplaced to

00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:12,590
acknowledge and you started they give

00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:16,730
the role the UX has a while I dare say

00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:19,250
that make up the favors of IT projects

00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:21,559
can be voided and I think we have to do

00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:23,659
it I mean we can't actually get away

00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:25,250
from from persistent failure of action

00:22:23,659 --> 00:22:28,340
billing solutions that meet people's

00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:30,860
needs without ever thinking this way the

00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:34,039
resistance to UTC practice is a

00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:38,059
resistance to working with the poor Mike

00:22:34,039 --> 00:22:40,010
exclusions generally and companies are

00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:43,070
hiring people have tapas are hiring more

00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:45,620
more you expecting more simply rotate

00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:47,870
all the systems that the people place is

00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:49,940
used in order to do all the trim

00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:52,159
substituent from accounting to your old

00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:54,980
of my pops everything change standard

00:22:52,159 --> 00:23:00,020
like poor usability is you really stop

00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:01,940
to get a result take it it's basically

00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:06,620
to your bad business person if you have

00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:08,059
you seen divx one way to deal is also a

00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:10,549
season we call the you x value

00:23:08,059 --> 00:23:13,880
proposition and this is a way to

00:23:10,549 --> 00:23:16,730
visualize the impact of some units work

00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:19,280
it's highly subjective though it's not

00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:21,340
it's not a pic by any means but it gives

00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,470
a visual idea of where you basically

00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:27,080
worth while to put rafters so much

00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:30,590
saturated it break down your debate on a

00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:32,659
project in the number of balls you wanna

00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:35,240
you wanna might reduces from picking

00:23:32,659 --> 00:23:37,340
motors for storm and service this is a

00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,940
customer has a better model so for a

00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:46,059
monsoon compared only site which would

00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:46,059
customers may be vengeful ghost water

00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:52,669
then listed those then we actually break

00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:55,250
them down into the vu facilities of

00:23:52,669 --> 00:23:59,600
influence so what implants move signals

00:23:55,250 --> 00:24:04,010
to have it example manga on the list go

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:06,289
for example or then do is I will help

00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:08,780
them out and this this could be used a

00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:11,510
regular spreadsheet and then we're like

00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:14,690
wait to catch sight of it and there were

00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:16,940
eight the potential state of it so when

00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:19,640
it maybe seifert but it experience

00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,950
pledged she'd be like this this is

00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:23,770
receive a consultant lesson report i

00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:30,850
work till eight but actually happen

00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:37,130
great so gain potential costs investment

00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:39,500
inflows in the end you have a sheet or

00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:46,970
you can visually see what here's where i

00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:51,500
can actually make my degree so so sorted

00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:53,240
ripe but and also oh yeah but do you

00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:58,280
have a case where this really make a

00:24:53,240 --> 00:25:04,460
fist you said you so here comes the 300

00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:09,200
million dollar and this is actually

00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:10,970
something to expo group for this guy was

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:20,419
actually miss Pickett the last opinion

00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:27,860
us talk about waveforms me one story Oh

00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:30,530
put bad waveforms creme brulee brulee so

00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:33,590
it's off to meet you retailer and they

00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:37,429
have a checkup from is you can my

00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:42,649
hotspot you can say what you want you

00:25:37,429 --> 00:25:44,659
can see the bottom right fancy the

00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:46,610
problem is the kind of smart so the a

00:25:44,659 --> 00:25:49,250
dysfunction we have the richest before

00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:51,280
we can take out a galaxy which is now

00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:53,470
Wow get a sick so much time

00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:58,420
Thank You Phineas it's just six few

00:25:53,470 --> 00:26:01,060
minutes right yeah they think so Susie

00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:04,800
she wants the watch watch and she's

00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:07,030
tried she's an order soon much n

00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,220
which is like seriously what after

00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:11,890
releasing i know i just want ice and

00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:15,490
stuff can he be bubbling relationship

00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:18,190
with these guys i I just like I'm on the

00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:20,680
board here before backing jack in fact

00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:23,200
she has ordered 20 times she's a big

00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:25,450
fight McClure so she has always I parted

00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,360
in 20 mattresses key thing is she has

00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:31,570
constantly forgotten her name and

00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:36,690
Thank You mr. basket for interesting the

00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:43,900
database actually directly nevermind

00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:47,110
it's not worth all right but somehow

00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:49,540
that you find out the people run is it

00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:51,700
from oh right this is a problem so like

00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:53,470
maybe wasn't so smart to pick that

00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,840
registration from there anyway maybe or

00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:58,300
smarter force people to register so

00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,280
let's let's find regular to see what

00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:03,460
happens so they'll remove the registry

00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:07,920
and I replace it with this you can

00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:07,920
continue it out or you can log in and

00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:15,790
the results were pretty massive for the

00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:19,360
five percent brocation Satan's game

00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:21,190
itself by that simple change but that

00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,620
was not a change an engineer realized i

00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:25,090
also have change that but the designer

00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,100
saw was like another you see mr.

00:27:25,090 --> 00:27:34,660
professional advice the workflow and

00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:37,799
talk to you sir so there's this massive

00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:40,299
a investigates the major you action

00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:41,980
alex is important so I'll take away my

00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:43,570
cute isn't just I can you discern what

00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:46,960
appears it deals with how something

00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:49,269
works and using specific goals to

00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:54,090
requirements anyway but if you added

00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:56,230
expense camp it helps toolbox of methods

00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:58,210
the cop let's do this translation

00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:01,740
business goals in two requirements and

00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:05,769
it's proven when there are 300,000 cases

00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:07,929
why it doesn't also if you like the

00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:20,649
session please evaluate it or depreciate

00:28:07,929 --> 00:28:33,480
to feedback and thank you so much all

00:28:20,649 --> 00:28:36,789
right questions hi sorry so I work at

00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:41,970
post-secondary in lethbridge alberta and

00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:45,940
i am curious how you would deal with

00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:51,130
people who have gathered data but you

00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:54,279
have a set of your own but there might

00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:56,470
be conflicts because some of it may be

00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:58,980
biased especially people who have worked

00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:01,809
with the audience for quite some time

00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:04,389
but they may not have noticed in the

00:29:01,809 --> 00:29:08,139
trends that you've been gathering on

00:29:04,389 --> 00:29:11,590
your own which is an unfortunate case in

00:29:08,139 --> 00:29:14,080
this communication but so how I guess my

00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:17,350
question is how would you deal with my

00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,450
data versus your data and in you know if

00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:20,620
there's buys or how do you how do you

00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:23,080
deal with that

00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:26,290
it's the custom has been two years of

00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:29,980
research on oil yeah mostly in the case

00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:34,900
of recruitment but I find they're not

00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:39,180
asking the why it's more like a therapy

00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:41,500
session I guess you know well I guess I

00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:45,430
just find that they're not asking the

00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:47,530
whys behind some of the reasons for why

00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:49,390
people do things they're just it's more

00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:52,450
like a case of how do you feel they got

00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:54,370
really explore all right and you can

00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:57,550
handle this information as some kind of

00:29:54,370 --> 00:30:01,720
do you can use less just sort of like

00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:03,429
God usually a survey or therapist to see

00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,870
all right and they hand it to you and

00:30:03,429 --> 00:30:08,350
like yeah look at this going to help you

00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:09,880
make a better design well I could I

00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,320
would go back to this users and maybe

00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,360
I'll call them the park to some very

00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:16,090
representative and trying and have

00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,250
interviews with you usually need to

00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:20,260
speak to so many people and indeed the

00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:23,110
thing is that if you read Steve protocol

00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:24,760
I think it's not the one and topic you

00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:28,270
think it's another one about useful test

00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:29,679
it's like most of these 30 mistakes the

00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,270
biggest ones can be discovered by

00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:33,820
anymore you don't need to have someone

00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:36,370
to is perfect in our target cricket fine

00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:38,200
and the same this case you don't talk

00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:41,770
over you talked a few that you think I

00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:43,300
rips negative of the group and that

00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:45,520
would have to buy validate your ideas

00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:49,140
regarding what they are the motivations

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,140
for filming editing

00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:06,360
more kisses I was wondering how do you

00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:09,450
handle feature creep milliken projects

00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:12,390
with Nick to excessive clients that

00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:15,000
through mock-up process or the working

00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:17,430
process keep adding things what connects

00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:21,960
our users could save their favorite

00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:24,360
something do you try and handle that in

00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:29,460
the mock-up face and say no more

00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:31,080
features Oh distribution what's a

00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:33,780
problem later on when trying to build

00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:36,260
the project in heretics decline and you

00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:38,640
actually see how to fix ago I previously

00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:40,950
before they said assimilation of the

00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,980
tests on the PM box which i recommend

00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:45,240
you guys to attend after this one what

00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:49,230
we're going to discuss these things even

00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,520
more so feature creep is is the biggest

00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:53,280
problem is during the implementation

00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:54,930
process as well as this really even as a

00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:57,870
designer when it comes to changing it

00:31:54,930 --> 00:32:00,090
boys yeah after designer soliciting like

00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:04,020
it'sit's you get to sign one thing in in

00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:05,700
decline in an isolation even though it's

00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:11,370
good to try and achieve multi design

00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:13,650
it's not always realistic I would try

00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:16,280
and I will try to discuss things with

00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:19,080
customers relevant to the customer

00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:21,180
basically trying to get these things up

00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:22,740
when it is to change like in a wireframe

00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:25,290
session will try and get all this you

00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,330
pick out my wife and have them

00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:30,840
understand occasionally makes it's a

00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:34,170
region good it's quality time and try to

00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:36,570
have some input dialog and not just go

00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:38,880
from basically what you say the red mark

00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:42,360
up and trying to increase the direction

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:44,520
of not very rough my friend that wants

00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:47,450
you can make for test book Mockingbird

00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:50,010
account or a fix for go mockingbirds go

00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:52,620
it's all I woke up to and makes very

00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:54,900
rough my first name to take one of those

00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:57,750
negative maybe you'll get into into

00:32:54,900 --> 00:33:00,640
illustrator make it even find and forms

00:32:57,750 --> 00:33:03,310
and the colors signal

00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,230
or several stages but then maybe you can

00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:08,530
catch some of those requests much sooner

00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:17,800
when the changes is much easier thank

00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:22,570
you more questions we're playing time so

00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:25,030
all right well if you have more

00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:28,780
questions you can just an investment

00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:31,090
Witter you can come back me up I'll be

00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:35,220
