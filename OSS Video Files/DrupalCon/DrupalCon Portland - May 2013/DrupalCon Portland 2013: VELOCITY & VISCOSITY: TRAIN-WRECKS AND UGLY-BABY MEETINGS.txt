Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: VELOCITY & VISCOSITY: TRAIN-WRECKS AND UGLY-BABY MEETINGS
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	Drupal's great. But why is it so hard to have velocity but not viscosity around clients, dev teams and projects? This thrashing leaves many clients leaving Drupal and many Drupalers hating clients. Clients and projects drive Drupal and so let's develop better methodology for implementing world-class Drupal sites, have profitable dev shops and happy Drupal customers.

TRAIN-WRECKS FOR DEVELOPMENT: If you're losing money on projects, wishing the client's expectations were more realistic, burning out your team, have too many bugs and constant scope creep; this might be an interesting and valuable 50 minutes. Development shop margins are thin; but great process, training and client management make all the difference.

TRAIN-WRECKS FOR CLIENTS:If you're going into a project or have one already off the rails, this workshop will help develop a strategy for success. Learn how to prepare, document and go into a development project as a partner and collaborator.

EXCUSE ME, BUT YOU NEED TO KNOW YOUR BABY IS UGLY:This year, I've had no less than five of these uncomfortable and unfortunate conversations on a rescue project. Sometimes we're the second, third, fourth development team and no one has told the client the truth about their site, their own shortcomings as a client and why their project is failing. We'll discuss red flags, project containment and how to successfully triage a project back to health.

CLIENT CALAMATIES:Got stuck with a bad Drupal site? There's a better way to work with the development cycle. With some thoughtful planning around Client Wrangling, Project Wrangling, and Risk Assessment, projects can be successful.

LOSING VISCOSITY & GAINING VELOCITY: In this fun, collaborative and interactive session we'll share, dissect and discuss:

what makes a good client
homework for everyone
what makes a good project
plan, plan, plan, develop
risk assessment, risk management
calling a flag on the play, triage and pulling the plug
minimum viable product
agile, waterfall and hybrids
downfall of design-driven development
downfall of client-driven development
the magic of matrices for everything
Drupal can be still be fun and clients can become great collaborative partners with just a little structure.

Much thanks to great friend, thinker, synthesizer and guru, Johnnie Fox (http://drupal.org/user/672052) who co-brainstormed this session several years ago.

hello I think we're we have three

00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:06,720
minutes but if you are sitting in the

00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,970
back half of the room if you feel

00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,590
comfortable no pressure I'd love for you

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,940
to come to the front part of the room

00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:17,279
one because the rooms not very full and

00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:21,390
second I do like to get people talking

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,890
in the mics up here and so it'll be a

00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:24,150
lot easier for everybody to hear so if

00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,060
you're in the back half and you feel

00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:29,580
comfortable to move forward and there's

00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:33,719
really nice people here I met someone

00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:34,739
named Amy who seemed a very nice so I'm

00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,640
going to go ahead and get started

00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:40,530
because I I think also they do not have

00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,600
anything scheduled for this room because

00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:47,520
I'm the last session of the day yay and

00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,020
the good thing is this is really fun so

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,000
all of you who have been like cramming

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,940
things into your head like just relax

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,340
this is really fun the slides will be up

00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,980
and mostly you'll just get it like yoga

00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,219
oh yeah why hadn't I thought of that

00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,250
before so I also don't know everything

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:07,680
and actually you guys know just as much

00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:09,240
so if you would like I'll go through all

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,420
the slides but we can actually stay and

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,930
play a little bit after if you like so

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,540
hello I now started a new job with

00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:21,299
pantheon and so I am buying everyone

00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,220
here a free account at Pantheon so if

00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,580
you go to get Pantheon com you can have

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:27,840
a free hosted website until you want to

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,049
go make it go live and then we charge

00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,180
you money but actually i actually i

00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:36,119
think as developers if it's for your own

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,640
personal site your website i do believe

00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,390
it's free and i just don't know how to

00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,729
do it yet because i just started monday

00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:47,310
so I'm sponsored by Pantheon and I'm

00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,899
also sponsored by top shelf modules so

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,680
you can ask me about either one of those

00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:55,880
later but right now it's all about you

00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:59,790
so I was so surprised that they actually

00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:01,500
picked this topic because this has been

00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:07,110
a passion of mine for a very long time

00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:10,110
and I am so glad that you're here to

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,230
share it with me all right who's here

00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:16,470
how many are engineers yeah

00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,180
ok how many and I call everybody who

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,010
actually does the building site building

00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,159
designing theming all of you are

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:26,549
engineers how many people are here from

00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:28,530
a development company or an agency ok

00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:29,700
how many are from the client side like

00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,769
you're with the university or an

00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,900
organization or library and you guys

00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:35,310
actually have the harder job I want

00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,690
everybody to appreciate how hard their

00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,180
job is because they can't fire their

00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:43,200
client so that makes it really really

00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,849
hard right and so I think you will get a

00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,640
lot of take away because if you actually

00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:50,220
treat your internal stakeholders with

00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,340
some of this rigor it will help you not

00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,530
go crazy how many of you are thinking

00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,299
about a project you're like a customer

00:02:55,530 --> 00:03:00,780
and you're getting ready to go into a

00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:03,569
project nobody those are the people I

00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,329
like to talk to they should be here go

00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:08,359
find so how many are in a project that

00:03:06,329 --> 00:03:12,900
they wish they didn't have to finish

00:03:08,359 --> 00:03:16,230
yeah oh yay ok so maybe we can do a

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,760
little rescue and triage here okay so I

00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,780
talked to some of you and I do know some

00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,130
of the things that you're trying to get

00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,720
to and I hope you leave with some really

00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,790
good tools today and they're all really

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:30,120
dead simple there's nothing fancy that I

00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:31,889
do I've just been doing it forever so my

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,790
name is Susan rust I've been in Drupal

00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:37,260
since 4.7 and I picked Drupal because it

00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,870
was actually the one at the time that

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,819
had clean urls and if I can encourage

00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:44,130
you guys walking in to come forward and

00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:46,650
sit up front that would be awesome I've

00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:49,380
done tiny tiny jobs i did a three page

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,480
website for a tiny it's not even a

00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,450
church they're called plant plant sites

00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,150
or something like that and a woman named

00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,889
Betty ran the whole thing all 12 people

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,989
that attended this little tiny thing and

00:03:58,889 --> 00:04:02,280
I felt sorry for them and I built them a

00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:04,859
little drupal site and I've done really

00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:07,139
big enterprise projects with the

00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:10,590
National Episcopal Church and SDG&E and

00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:12,660
I on media and things like that and then

00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,629
from this morning's note i found out

00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,389
that i'm a dictator and i was so pleased

00:04:15,629 --> 00:04:21,239
to find out that i actually have a role

00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:24,550
in drupal and that's why actually i love

00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:27,129
being here with this community

00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,539
I I ended up with a design shop a

00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:30,220
graphic design shop and I kept doing

00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:31,599
logos and people kept saying yeah but

00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:34,090
where's my website that looks awesome

00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:36,099
and unlike you understand that print and

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:37,960
web are not the same thing right and

00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:39,699
they're like yeah but whatever so I

00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,129
learned to build websites and then I

00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:45,699
learned to do drupal thank goodness for

00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:48,039
the google any questions so far is

00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:51,819
everybody in the right place they want

00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:53,470
to learn how to do ugly baby meetings so

00:04:51,819 --> 00:04:55,870
we have to know why projects fail

00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,759
because actually to have a cure or

00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:59,020
remedy or solution for everything you

00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,310
have to know why it happened in the

00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,550
first place there has to be a little bit

00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:07,590
of diagnosis so why do projects fail

00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:10,590
somebody tell me why do projects fail

00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:10,590
yeah

00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:25,800
yeah managing expectations that

00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,389
everybody's expectations right so that's

00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:31,919
very important why else do projects fail

00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:33,900
who has a yes guy with the hat more

00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:40,469
planning yeah you mean not enough

00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:48,629
planning yes oh yeah a roadmap for it to

00:05:40,469 --> 00:05:50,250
go somewhere money or what happens on

00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:53,069
projects where there's nobody on the

00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:55,560
client side working on it so I build us

00:05:53,069 --> 00:05:58,199
a site we have 27 thousand pages of

00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:02,699
content and yeah I just figured out for

00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:05,729
us like that works well right so one of

00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:08,190
the things one of the things I would

00:06:05,729 --> 00:06:11,639
like you guys to start understanding and

00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:15,120
seeing for yourself is avalanches happen

00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,919
how one snowflake at a time but if

00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,919
you've ever been on ski patrol or been

00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:22,289
up in the mountains they know where the

00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,479
avalanches are going to happen right and

00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:27,060
actually now in hindsight when you look

00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,889
at your bag projects don't you kind of

00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,080
know that that was an avalanche just

00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:34,259
waiting to happen how many of you were

00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:37,620
ever truly truly surprised that the

00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:39,270
avalanche happened yeah no one right so

00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:43,529
one of the things you have to listen to

00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:45,659
your self so I don't read all the slides

00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:48,889
but this one's really important failed

00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:52,650
projects are doomed from the beginning

00:06:48,889 --> 00:06:54,990
no one wants to admit it and that's the

00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:58,110
genesis and so one of the things about

00:06:54,990 --> 00:07:01,379
not having ugly client baby meetings is

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:04,979
to not turn them into projects or not

00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:10,390
turn them into projects yet any

00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:12,100
questions okay so

00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:15,520
on the client side so one of the things

00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:18,310
that clients often think is that the

00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,130
website will cure all of their business

00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:23,050
woes they don't have process in place

00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:24,250
they haven't analyzed their business

00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,530
they don't even know what they're trying

00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:29,340
to do but if they would just get a new

00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:32,890
website and marketing could go to town

00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:35,260
everything would be okay and the truth

00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:39,030
is is that a website only presents data

00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:41,770
and it only is a reflection of their

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:43,270
internal clarity so if they don't have

00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,790
internal clarity what's the website

00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,950
project going to be it's going to be a

00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:50,880
mess and so this is one of those

00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:54,040
avalanche moments where you can say ah

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:59,560
first thing they have no business rules

00:07:54,040 --> 00:08:01,510
written down anywhere now how many of

00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,240
you have seen business rules that go

00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:08,190
something like this well we send out an

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:10,420
email and then we attach a word doc then

00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:13,560
fill in the blank fill in the blank fill

00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:16,240
in the blank is that a business process

00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,010
no it's not a business process I'm

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,800
working with a client right now that

00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:24,070
sends secure data back and forth via

00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,990
email and random other channels and

00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:30,400
they're so worried about if the Drupal

00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:33,220
site is going to be secure it's like you

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:38,080
know you just sent all that data over

00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:40,540
the email to 75 people so they don't

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,510
have a business process around their

00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:46,470
communication of important data so how

00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:49,690
do we model that properly for Drupal and

00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:54,820
you have to solve that question before

00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:56,650
you can begin the project so one of the

00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,590
things that I say about clients and

00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:02,260
projects is that day one is the best

00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:05,950
it's ever going to be it's kind of like

00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:07,840
a boyfriend or a marriage right like the

00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:09,730
honeymoon phase is as good as it's going

00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,010
to get after that there's dirty dishes

00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:14,200
and dirty socks so if you're not really

00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:16,720
loving the vendor if you're reading

00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:19,480
really not loving the client if it's

00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,800
just not you know you don't have that

00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,380
chemistry like you don't feel like

00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,990
you're on the same side is the project

00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,660
actually

00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:28,310
going to be fun to work on and how many

00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:30,860
of you have a client or a project now

00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:33,010
that it's nothing wrong with a project

00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,230
that's the chemistry with the client

00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:38,540
yeah it makes work going going to work

00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,850
really hard and when it when you want to

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,560
go to work and it's really hard it takes

00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,209
out the joy out of you and when it takes

00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,410
all the joy out of you it's really hard

00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:49,910
to succeed and what happens when you tie

00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:51,440
up all your time because some of you

00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:54,320
that I spoke to around the room are

00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,880
pretty small so what happens if you take

00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,920
up eighty percent of your billable time

00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,980
with a client and a project you don't

00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:04,670
love it's just tough and one of the

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:07,459
things about doing well as a solopreneur

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:09,250
and entrepreneur small group is that you

00:10:07,459 --> 00:10:12,830
have to all love what you're doing and

00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:16,880
there's an opportunity cost to every

00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:20,029
decision you make so I actually saw

00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:23,149
something very similar to this in

00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:25,010
dallas-fort Worth they built a dallas

00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:27,230
fort worth airport is as big as the

00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:29,990
island of manhattan and they built this

00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:31,820
monorail that went around and i would

00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:35,300
drive by it every day to and from work

00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:38,180
and at one point i went nothing not

00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,860
going to me and my husband went ah you

00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:42,170
don't know you're talking about and sure

00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,550
enough but they kept building like like

00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,110
I was seeing it at an angle from the

00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:47,000
road and I could tell it wasn't going to

00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,700
meet the engineers were standing there

00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,990
looking at each other every day and they

00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,000
knew it wasn't going to meet but they

00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,339
kept building and they built within like

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,230
20 feet of each other like but you could

00:10:55,339 --> 00:11:00,320
tell a long way off right like maybe a

00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:02,450
half mile down like yeah guys we need a

00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,550
bus curve in here but they never did it

00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:09,350
they never did it so lack of planning

00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:12,529
and then the desire not to stop and do

00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:15,050
some planning so how many of you guys

00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:16,880
think that it's a good idea for me to

00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:20,750
take a backpack and decide that I'm

00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:23,570
going to climb Everest it's really nice

00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:26,320
oh you think it's a good idea he's

00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:28,730
trying to get rid of me already um so

00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,810
this is what happens though they're all

00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:35,660
all engineers in general love to write

00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:37,710
code and there's an urge and a deep

00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:40,800
desire to get a project

00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:44,910
and start building but this is how those

00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,950
end up it's not a good idea I can't walk

00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:50,250
very far I get high altitude sickness

00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:53,130
and in general I'm not that athletic so

00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:56,730
I probably shouldn't plan a track to to

00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:59,130
everest in an afternoon and then we also

00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:00,600
have what i call the project fantasy is

00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:02,700
that at the beginning of every project

00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:06,900
we think it's going to feel and look

00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:09,930
like this but we know it's going to be

00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:12,420
like this but in order to be in business

00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:15,300
like we have to keep kind of having that

00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,460
fantasy so today i hope we cover some

00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:22,830
things to get the project's looking more

00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:28,350
like this and last like that so any

00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:30,060
questions so far okay so one of the

00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:34,920
things that i started out very early on

00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:37,440
is realizing that one of my gifts i need

00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:42,870
to step back one of my gifts is that I

00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:46,830
am NOT an engineer but i can speak

00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:48,510
pidgin engineer and I don't really I'm

00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:51,990
not a formal business analyst but I'm

00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:54,570
very good at divining that gap between

00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:57,120
the client wanting something and what

00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:59,520
engineering wants to build and that is

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,460
how many of you are kind of like under

00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,530
five people in your company this is the

00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,820
biggest strength that you can have and

00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,010
if you have a small company you probably

00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,560
and are successful you probably are

00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:15,090
already doing this in some pretty

00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:18,710
concrete or maybe understood way and if

00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:21,990
you can keep developing that skill and

00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:24,540
developing the strength and muscle to do

00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:27,150
it better and better your projects will

00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:30,030
become way more professional and not

00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:35,040
professional profitable so what I found

00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:38,100
is that clients do this I want to do

00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:40,200
this and because this is how I do it in

00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:43,110
my business and the engineer goes yep I

00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:44,670
can build that and they go okay and the

00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:46,710
engineer goes off and builds that and

00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:50,130
its really expensive because its custom

00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:51,300
or the clients just start talking about

00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,560
all their business process

00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,860
us in their clients and their metrics

00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:58,110
and the engineers just go I don't care

00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:00,450
tell me what to code I will build you

00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:05,399
anything just stop talking about that

00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:08,250
and and so there's just this big gap and

00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,440
then the client goes well what can I

00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:12,420
have and the engineer says anything I'm

00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,459
an engineer and like well what does that

00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,500
look like well whatever you want it to

00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:20,190
look like I'm an engineer so there's

00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:22,500
this impasse between what it is what can

00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:24,750
be built and what's possible and what's

00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:29,640
inexpensive and what's a good choice and

00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:32,130
all that kind of stuff so this became

00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:36,570
the first part of my consulting life is

00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:41,550
kind of doing this translation what do I

00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:44,459
mean by if a client is coachable is one

00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:46,290
of the reasons projects failed who's got

00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:50,720
a who's got an example of an uncoachable

00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:50,720
client yes

00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:08,210
yeah yeah that's a good example what

00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:20,630
about clients that say I know exactly

00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:23,600
what I want yeah or yes yes are there

00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:28,580
trying to guide you through engineering

00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:30,320
speak because I know better so to me

00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,000
coachable clients are people that don't

00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,180
listen to me I don't care what it is

00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,960
it's about where to park whatever as a

00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:41,000
dictator you have to actually be

00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,970
coachable and that doesn't mean that you

00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,650
just accept everything that I say but it

00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,660
means that when I'm really serious about

00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:50,360
saying I think this is the best path for

00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,300
you and this is why that you consider it

00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,460
carefully it doesn't mean that that is

00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:58,790
the answer but that you think about it

00:15:55,460 --> 00:16:00,680
deeply and you say yes I see why you

00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,450
think that and here are things you don't

00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,400
know about my business that's a

00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:07,790
coachable client they're teaching me I'm

00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:11,780
teaching them it's a relationship people

00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:14,839
that don't want to be guided aren't

00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:18,740
going to make you happy and if and the

00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:22,160
project won't go well what do I mean by

00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:24,050
this wrong shop to client mix how many

00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,380
of you taken a project that's either too

00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:31,910
small to big or slightly out of your

00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:33,950
wheelhouse how many keep your hands up

00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:38,060
how many of those projects went really

00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:40,400
really well yeah so it's a it's a date

00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,720
it's a it's an odd mix because if you

00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,780
never take anything out of your

00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:46,580
wheelhouse it's boring right and you

00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:50,089
don't grow and you don't learn the next

00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:53,600
thing and it's also really smart when

00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:56,839
you're when you're a growing shop to

00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,660
really be advised not to tackle the

00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:01,370
things that you can fail at

00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:04,189
spectacularly little failures are good

00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:06,350
right fail often fail quickly but fail

00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,970
where it doesn't count like it won't

00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:10,819
drive you out of business you won't have

00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:13,399
to let people go your reputation will be

00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:16,699
damage and your reputation at the size

00:17:13,399 --> 00:17:18,860
that you are is everything so be sure

00:17:16,699 --> 00:17:20,569
that when you say yes to projects

00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:23,509
they're the right project for your

00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:26,899
company in the right part of your growth

00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:29,120
cycle and it's always good to take on

00:17:26,899 --> 00:17:30,799
something a little challenging but be

00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,470
sure that you can get resources and

00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:36,139
support to help you grow who took on as

00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:37,549
something really big and was successful

00:17:36,139 --> 00:17:39,620
at it let's hear that story because

00:17:37,549 --> 00:18:03,379
that's more interesting I her saw a

00:17:39,620 --> 00:18:23,049
little tiny hand right there yes and how

00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:25,519
did you do it successfully nice so she

00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:27,980
didn't do exactly what I was going to

00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:31,309
recommend but her client was exactly

00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:34,159
what I was going to recommend was tackle

00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:36,590
big things with alliances and in that

00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:38,360
instance they because it was the data

00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:40,700
and they were the data creators that was

00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,860
an alliance and that's a really good way

00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:46,250
to grow and be very honest about it and

00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:48,919
say and decide upfront what the risks

00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:52,100
are for you and for them and be open

00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:54,529
about that on risk and then also say

00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:56,419
let's have a triage point where we can

00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:58,399
pull the plug where we won't be the

00:18:56,419 --> 00:19:00,620
right vendor right like wouldn't that

00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:02,750
make it a lot easier like if you just

00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:04,850
had that honesty of communication and

00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:07,639
they were clear and then if it doesn't

00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:09,769
work out are they mad at you no because

00:19:07,639 --> 00:19:12,139
we already decided upfront that we may

00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:14,299
or may not be able to do it and usually

00:19:12,139 --> 00:19:15,980
end up like giving them free research

00:19:14,299 --> 00:19:17,750
time and things like that because you

00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,490
want to grow to that so that's a really

00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:24,039
good way to have done it and that was a

00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:24,039
wise way to tackle that project so

00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:30,720
now is anybody in here strongly invested

00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:32,880
in the front end design of things okay I

00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,670
hope I don't make you mad so I started

00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:39,000
out as a designer the graphic artist so

00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:42,440
I I speak of with this from having come

00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,140
from that place and what I have found to

00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:48,150
make money and do the least amount of

00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:53,220
work like that is the other thing that

00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:55,170
we want to do right so I also used to do

00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:58,980
interior design because i have a BFA and

00:19:55,170 --> 00:20:01,440
I the analogy that I use is that I can't

00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,900
order your wallpaper and your drapes

00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,760
until we've built the house because at

00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,470
the end of the day I don't really know

00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:10,020
exactly where everything is going to end

00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:12,300
up and if I do it I can do it before the

00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,590
project I can do it before but you're

00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,360
going to pay more money because I'm

00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,310
going to order way more wallpaper than I

00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,390
need and the drapes aren't really going

00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:22,080
to fit and we're going to have to tailor

00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:23,820
them so the first thing is you have to

00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:26,940
do the analysis what should this site do

00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:30,690
then you engineer how that's going to

00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:32,640
work in Drupal and then you overlay your

00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:36,120
beautiful design onto that which already

00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:40,080
works how many of you get really

00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:41,730
beautiful comps from somewhere how many

00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:46,230
of those projects are really fun to

00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:48,180
build yeah not so much because every

00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:51,150
single button you have to your reverse

00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:54,120
engineering the end so it's kind of like

00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:55,860
me ordering 175 yards of fabric and

00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,460
laying it down there and go build me the

00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:04,530
windows that fit the draperies right and

00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:05,790
I I it doesn't work and so what i do and

00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,950
i was going to build a slide for this

00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:10,500
and I'm sorry around a time but there's

00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:12,630
actually a process where you do all of

00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,090
your business analysis and then you go

00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:17,760
into engineering and you can start your

00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:19,410
design because you in the front part of

00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,800
the process you built your wire frames

00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:25,050
and then at the very end the last two

00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,850
weeks of a project is steaming how many

00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:29,880
of you theme kind of continuously

00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:33,150
through the project save yourself so

00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,830
much time and many don't do it don't do

00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:37,619
it just wait until the end leave

00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:40,889
everything is ugly and gray as

00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:44,979
double-billed yourself this very generic

00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:47,739
version of of your site do it and bartok

00:21:44,979 --> 00:21:49,599
whatever garland it doesn't matter get

00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:53,279
your client to quit looking at design

00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:53,279
when you're trying to talk engineering

00:21:53,339 --> 00:22:00,489
what do I mean by this focus on trees

00:21:58,509 --> 00:22:03,869
not the forest how many of you have

00:22:00,489 --> 00:22:05,979
clients that keep moving pixels on you

00:22:03,869 --> 00:22:09,639
that's what happens when you start

00:22:05,979 --> 00:22:11,289
design too early it drives you crazy and

00:22:09,639 --> 00:22:13,210
it takes a lot of time and a lot of

00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:14,529
money and nothing really ever gets built

00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:18,279
because you're just moving pixels and

00:22:14,529 --> 00:22:19,960
changing hex colors so but it can be

00:22:18,279 --> 00:22:22,749
about anything it can be about billing

00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,519
it can be about wanting to see hours

00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:27,129
it's about wanting to have a client

00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:30,249
meeting every day it's any time that

00:22:27,129 --> 00:22:32,409
what they're requesting doesn't move the

00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:35,460
ball forward who's got a good example of

00:22:32,409 --> 00:22:35,460
a behavior like this

00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:04,650
yeah so she had comps and they kept

00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:06,330
adjusting the comps trying to guess what

00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:07,740
people were going to how they were going

00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:10,260
to use something that had not yet been

00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:12,480
built and that's a really a good example

00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:15,690
of that and that's a really good example

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:19,230
of why you take away design until you're

00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:21,300
done with engineering so how many of you

00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:24,240
have clients that like want itemized

00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,890
bills and why did this planning take why

00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,750
did you have to do 25 minutes of

00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:36,720
research on this module how many of you

00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:54,060
have that how do you cure that also who

00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:56,220
has a cure for that yes uh-huh yeah yeah

00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:58,410
that is actually a good good methodology

00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:00,660
is to staying clear communications a lot

00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:02,580
of times as a small company that is a

00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:06,110
big challenge who else has a good

00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:06,110
solution for that yes

00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:19,399
why are you trying to do this and let's

00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:34,249
talk about it you know it'd be very

00:24:19,399 --> 00:24:36,590
clear yeah so she's saying that kind of

00:24:34,249 --> 00:24:39,440
just basically saying why our unit

00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:42,679
picking me like let's have and have that

00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:44,450
conversation up front wonderful what do

00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:46,519
I mean by process-driven rep then rather

00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:49,570
driven and it's a little bit about what

00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:51,470
we talked about so I'm going to move on

00:24:49,570 --> 00:24:52,730
so one of the things that I've

00:24:51,470 --> 00:24:54,919
discovered in working on a lot of

00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:57,139
projects is that if you think your ears

00:24:54,919 --> 00:25:00,639
estimated your project at 200 hours how

00:24:57,139 --> 00:25:00,639
much time does the client have to put in

00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:05,359
200 hours and they don't really know

00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,489
this so it's up to you to educate them

00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:09,200
that hey you know we're going into a

00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:12,559
thousand our project we're going into a

00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,629
1500 our project it does often take that

00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,580
much time because the larger the site

00:25:14,629 --> 00:25:18,649
the more people the more stakeholders or

00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:21,769
more meetings and they need to be

00:25:18,649 --> 00:25:24,440
prepared to do that work that's a big

00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:26,929
risk point and these are just things we

00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:33,649
hate to hear right like nobody likes

00:25:26,929 --> 00:25:35,389
this any of these things and and I'm

00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:36,710
glad you guys are laughing because I

00:25:35,389 --> 00:25:39,379
hope you understand that these are

00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:41,359
universally true like there it's

00:25:39,379 --> 00:25:43,609
happened to all of us and happened to

00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:49,100
who has who has never had anything on

00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:51,169
this list happen to them see you I'm not

00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:52,999
really that smart so let's talk about

00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:54,859
now that we've kind of identified like

00:25:52,999 --> 00:25:57,859
what the problem is like how to avoid

00:25:54,859 --> 00:26:01,489
them so a project requires a visionary

00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:03,200
it can be you in you should also have

00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:05,600
someone on the other side of the fence

00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,059
who is also a visionary without the two

00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:11,149
of you and whoever the visionary is it

00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:14,179
can be the owner it can be the I have an

00:26:11,149 --> 00:26:16,519
extraordinary project manager that I get

00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:18,169
to work with every now and then but they

00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:19,669
have a very strong vision of how this is

00:26:18,169 --> 00:26:21,379
going to get done and when maybe not

00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:23,029
from an engineering standpoint but

00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:24,379
they're very clear on how they're going

00:26:23,029 --> 00:26:26,960
to work with the clients and all that

00:26:24,379 --> 00:26:30,049
stuff so identify who that visionary

00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:32,360
and I I find it interesting that often

00:26:30,049 --> 00:26:33,770
the person in charge of the project if

00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,470
the engineer who's trying to be heads

00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:39,919
down in code and so the person that is

00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:42,850
heads down cannot by default be the

00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,870
visionary and business owners

00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:48,020
unfortunately often our left brain right

00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:50,210
brain and can do both but at some point

00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:54,740
it's not good necessarily the most

00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:56,510
effective way so when I was doing

00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:58,220
consulting I actually trademark the term

00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:00,770
client wrangling and I actually got

00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:03,649
hired to do client wrangly so it was

00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:06,260
pretty fun what do I mean by force

00:27:03,649 --> 00:27:10,730
projects into an MVP state who knows

00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:12,950
what MVP is okay so MVP is the minimum

00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:16,820
viable product so it's the smallest unit

00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:19,789
of thing that you can create features to

00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:22,220
say it's a website so usually projects

00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:24,230
come in and there's like 20 pages of

00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,750
things and you meet with a client and

00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:30,140
it's hours and hours of stuff and your

00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:34,240
job is to for notice I don't say suggest

00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:38,059
I say force a project into an MVP state

00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:41,260
so those are the reasons for it but who

00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:43,490
can tell me why this makes sense not

00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:45,470
those are like great reasons but why is

00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:52,929
it really important for you to do this

00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:52,929
very early on who's raising their hand

00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:58,130
yes it's actually that's actually true

00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:03,590
but the other part of it is not only

00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:07,279
fail but succeed the smaller you make it

00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:09,140
the less complicated the task the more

00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:11,870
likely you are to succeed and what

00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:14,630
happens in minute you succeed you have

00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:16,399
instant trust then you can keep growing

00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:18,830
and stretching and getting into more and

00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:21,710
more complicated things so if you force

00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:22,760
that first unit into and you know when

00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:23,809
you're a small business owner and

00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,279
someone's like I have a

00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:26,690
fifty-thousand-dollar side I have a

00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,360
hundred-thousand-dollar side I have a

00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:33,580
300,000 or whatever your metric is for a

00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:35,929
juicy project cut it in half cut it into

00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:39,230
twenty-five percent cut it into the

00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:40,310
smallest unit you can because if you

00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:42,710
knock that out of the

00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:44,540
argh all those other bad client

00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:46,310
behaviors a lot of them will disappear

00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:48,680
because they trust you you've had a win

00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:52,010
together and that's the most important

00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:57,320
thing you can do so who is a good

00:28:52,010 --> 00:29:02,600
example of that Oh anybody here doing

00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:05,180
that a few of you okay go ahead someone

00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:17,540
said something it doesn't always work

00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:20,660
tell me why can wait one moment can

00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:28,580
everybody hear her now can you come to

00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:32,510
the mic so we do a lot of projects where

00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:36,020
we take over Drupal sites and fix them

00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:37,940
and then you know then the client wants

00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:40,460
us to then add new functionality to it

00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:42,200
right so the fixed part is actually the

00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:43,940
easy part right now if somebody's built

00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,100
something wrong or it's not secure

00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:48,350
whatever shall we say let's just bite

00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:50,120
that off as a small piece we can show

00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:52,700
them how we can make their site work

00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:55,580
better and and there are uh wow this is

00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:58,250
working great and then we move on to new

00:29:55,580 --> 00:30:01,550
functionality and we break it down into

00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:03,230
chunks and it's still hard to put new

00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:05,570
functionality into a site you haven't

00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:07,430
built because other developers don't do

00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:09,980
things the way you do and they're like

00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:14,360
well we really we know that you've done

00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:17,180
all this other stuff for us but we want

00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:19,190
this faster and quicker and it doesn't

00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:24,470
it didn't build the trust at all is that

00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:28,040
a coachable client no no okay so there

00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:30,800
you go that's a good it's a good process

00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,330
but then if it doesn't work you're back

00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,670
to square one with throwing the client

00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:36,500
away but but it comes from Ashley

00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:38,420
deciding at the front end whether the

00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:40,310
client was coachable and that and that

00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:42,800
is really important so you see how like

00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:44,450
if you don't have that coachable client

00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:47,290
all along the process you can't really

00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:49,820
ever grow them into a good partnership

00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:54,050
so and the other thing is picking the

00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:56,270
right team internally and externally and

00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:59,300
this is often what I see and when I say

00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:00,920
team I mean like the clients team I

00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,720
actually talked to someone who is doing

00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:06,350
this mega and a price site and the

00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,870
project manager literally was a recently

00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:10,310
former massage therapist but she was the

00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:11,930
most technical person because she knew

00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:17,870
how to do social media so they made her

00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:19,910
in charge of this project so what would

00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:22,100
I tell you now that you know me what

00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:29,120
would I tell you to tell the client when

00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:32,030
their team is awful ya know you not

00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:38,540
necessarily by but you have to say your

00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:40,250
team is awful yeah so it's you can you

00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:42,470
have to say it more diplomatically and

00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:44,960
you can say you know I for this kind of

00:31:42,470 --> 00:31:47,290
project these are the areas of expertise

00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,610
that I need covered with your team or

00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:52,580
perhaps these are people that need to be

00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:55,700
more team-oriented these are people that

00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:56,930
actually have to have time to do this

00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:01,460
project and you know we talked about

00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:28,210
time earlier oh is that a coachable

00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:28,210
client yes the contact uh-huh yeah

00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:56,110
right yeah yeah so your client wrangling

00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:58,150
is what you are yes you're hurting so

00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:59,560
and this last part is important to like

00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:01,300
different people need to be on the team

00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:03,460
at different times you don't need

00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:05,440
everybody doing the whole project the

00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:07,660
whole time necessarily so kind of kind

00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:09,730
of manage that like we don't we don't

00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:12,460
think often as companies that we are the

00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:27,180
ones in charge of organizing that but

00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:29,590
yeah yeah you kind of are yes mm-hmm and

00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:31,720
then they're often not coachable because

00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,950
they know they don't have to be yeah

00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,740
that's why I said you guys have the

00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:38,170
hardest job and a lot of it can be

00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:40,240
helped by process where it's a little

00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:42,190
passive-aggressive where you say and

00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,650
it's the only thing that you can do is

00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:46,090
say oh well I see that you want these

00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:47,350
things done but the here's our process

00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:50,290
and as soon as you get your part done

00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:51,520
we'll do our part so that that helps but

00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,350
you actually have to have a fairly

00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:57,280
formal structured process that has the

00:33:53,350 --> 00:34:00,700
sanction and permission to hold it as an

00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:04,960
Appy civ in business unit with integrity

00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:07,240
so we talked about triage things and all

00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,230
that kind of stuff but teamwork is

00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:14,020
important one of the things I was with a

00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:16,450
team and they were they had a very very

00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:18,280
big site to do and they had 90,000 I'm

00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:19,780
like wow that's kind of skimpy he goes

00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,419
yeah we burned through the other million

00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:24,970
other 900,000 it was a million-dollar

00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:28,750
budget I said what happened to the other

00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:31,540
900,000 they spent a year going down the

00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:33,760
road with and yet but that's that's not

00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,770
the tragic part this wasn't a fault oven

00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,419
yet so I don't want anyone to say I

00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:39,340
don't want to need legal letters this is

00:34:37,419 --> 00:34:41,950
not the fault of in yet this was the

00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,570
fault of the client whose engineering

00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:47,130
team

00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:49,320
sat in the sales meeting new dead on

00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:51,990
that it would not handle users the way

00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:56,070
the projects boat recruit you know the

00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:59,070
project specs were and they had no

00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:01,620
authority even as the technical team to

00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:04,620
throw a flag on the play and say this

00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:06,630
will fail so everybody in your company

00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:08,810
everybody on the client side you have to

00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:11,820
have this important meeting that says

00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:14,790
everybody has a permission to throw a

00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:17,430
flag on the play and stop development so

00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:19,260
we can talk about it and that is just a

00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:21,390
clear boundary that will help so much

00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,580
because often on a very difficult client

00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:25,200
somebody on the other side is knowing

00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,840
some drama that's going on that's going

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,130
to derail it they know very early on

00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:32,250
they just don't think it's their job to

00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:34,650
say so and so you have to empower people

00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:37,920
to help you get these kinds of things

00:35:34,650 --> 00:35:40,350
done anybody have a good juicy story

00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,300
about that besides my good juicy story

00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:47,120
that was a pretty sad one right nine

00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:47,120
hundred thousand dollars down yeah

00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:07,050
mm-hmm it is difficult it's it's a big

00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,090
cultural change when you're inside of an

00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:13,500
institution you could be inside of a big

00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:15,900
dot org dot edu or association and it's

00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,160
tough it and it is a very deep cultural

00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:18,870
change and that's why it's like it

00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:21,270
actually takes leadership and vision and

00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:23,910
people on the team who are more heads

00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:26,040
down doing the work they need that

00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:27,780
leadership and vision and a lot of times

00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:30,350
if you just write this document down and

00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:32,550
say just to let you know as the

00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:34,230
consulting firm as a development firm

00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:36,540
these are our norms that we're bringing

00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:38,400
to this project and we will respect

00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:42,030
anybody on the team that does this so

00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,130
maybe inside then or inside of the whole

00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:46,050
institution but maybe you can create

00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:49,370
enough of a safe haven just enough

00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:49,370
breathing room for that to happen

00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:55,490
so most of you know this kind of thing

00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:57,500
that there's three things if you want

00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:59,540
something faster you have to give us

00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:01,910
more money and less features and blah

00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:04,000
blah blah so it's kind of a thing like

00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:07,490
that but what's also important is that

00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,860
there needs to be three different people

00:37:07,490 --> 00:37:12,410
if you are the person wearing all these

00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:16,160
three decision points it doesn't really

00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:18,710
work the system works best intention so

00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,900
look at your own development team your

00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:23,150
project management your ownership styles

00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:25,760
all the different stakeholders and

00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:29,240
assign these roles let someone be an

00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:31,370
advocate for features let someone be an

00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,500
advocate for budget let someone be an

00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:35,930
advocate for time in general it's

00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,400
something like that up there I don't

00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:39,440
think I have a laser pointer on this but

00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,030
those top three stakeholders normally

00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,680
it's something like that but it's very

00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:44,720
important to keep that tension alive

00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:49,670
that's what keeps the project taught and

00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:53,660
moving forward so you guys get this

00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:57,110
right and these are these are really

00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:58,460
important things to do here and so now

00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:02,660
i'm going to give you an actual solution

00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:06,800
tool so doing a big project I think it's

00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:08,390
close to a half million dollars and even

00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,830
in the very beginning though one of the

00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:12,770
things that I do is I actually start

00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:15,170
with this matric with with the client so

00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:17,360
remember how we were saying MVP Minimum

00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:19,640
Viable Product the first thing I always

00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:22,400
try to do is to never have custom

00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:24,680
development in phase one as little

00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,340
custom Drupal as possible try to do

00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:30,860
drupal out of the box you guys forget

00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:34,070
how magical Drupal is to people that

00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:38,660
don't know what it does like you forget

00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:40,430
and now it's not so a rare but there was

00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:42,500
a time when if you could just have login

00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:45,740
that was something used to pay 20 grand

00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:48,620
for like the Drupal does amazing things

00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:51,050
views is magical like if you ever sit

00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:53,000
down and explain to someone who doesn't

00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:54,860
understand content management system the

00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:57,290
whole concept of views and blocks their

00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:59,210
mind is blown like drupal does amazing

00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:01,790
things if you do nothing with it but

00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:02,250
just build a site and manage content and

00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:05,660
have you

00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:08,790
sirs so we try to start with everything

00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:10,860
that is critical and as much out of the

00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:15,390
box as possible I really try to stay in

00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:18,840
quadrant one that's a 11 and I do this

00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:20,910
with the client so we would like blah

00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,890
blah blah to integrate with blah blah

00:39:20,910 --> 00:39:26,270
blah and then show up magically on this

00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:32,270
page is like great is it critical whoa

00:39:26,270 --> 00:39:34,920
it's him yeah well maybe so it's needed

00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:36,840
what marketing would really like it like

00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:39,510
if you really drill down into what's

00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:42,570
critical for a lunch that list is really

00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:45,360
surprisingly small sometimes so keep

00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:51,720
pushing and then I tell them they don't

00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:53,640
get the stuff in the yellow that's off

00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,930
the table for the first conversation and

00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,970
that really helps them and you know what

00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:58,620
they really like this because this is

00:39:56,970 --> 00:40:01,110
something they can wrap their heads

00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:03,350
around because they don't know in

00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:06,510
general what Drupal does out of the box

00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:08,610
like it's pretty cool and even language

00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:10,200
in the contract says unless otherwise

00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:12,600
stated you're getting Drupal out of the

00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,310
box you had some expectation well if

00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:17,280
Drupal out of the box doesn't do that

00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:21,120
it's not covered so what did I just give

00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,920
you the secret to yeah that's one of the

00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,050
big expectations I thought Drupal did

00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,730
that well yes it does then why don't I

00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:28,490
have it because you didn't pay seventy

00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:31,950
five thousand dollars for it whoa I

00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:34,290
think I should get that because I

00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:36,870
thought it was important right how many

00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:39,000
of you had that conversation like why

00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:41,180
doesn't Facebook work differently on my

00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:44,340
website than it does everywhere else

00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:48,020
right so how many of you would find this

00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:53,370
useful anybody doing something similar

00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:55,950
okay awesome so that you can use this

00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:58,820
kind of matrix for everything so let's

00:40:55,950 --> 00:41:01,860
see is this the second one okay so

00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:03,870
midway in this very very big project and

00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:06,560
it's been going on for 14 months very

00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:11,790
big team of engineers working on it and

00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:14,080
a month before launch a month before

00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:17,560
lunch end of a huge

00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:19,630
sprint cycle of like six prints the

00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:23,110
client came back oh they finally did

00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:26,080
some testing and then list came in it

00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:29,890
was like a rainstorm of new features and

00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:31,960
changes and and it was horrifying right

00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:33,160
like you get for typewritten pages of

00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,280
things that they think should be

00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:38,710
different or work differently and so the

00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,930
product owner he's like yeah I want all

00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:42,250
these changes and the project manager

00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:43,810
who's in charge of time is going

00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,970
nothing's getting done I've got my

00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:47,680
sprint plan and the engineers are like

00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:52,210
me I'll throw something else out and

00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:54,930
build that I don't care right so we have

00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:58,510
two of the three people kind of like at

00:41:54,930 --> 00:42:00,760
at odds and I'm like okay great let's

00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:02,350
make a matrix and they're like rolling

00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,630
their eyes but this is what we did we

00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:06,760
said look things are either done or

00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:08,290
they've kind of been engineered or

00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,180
they're built right that's kind of the

00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:13,030
state of how you can find something in

00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:15,850
in the actual project and it's either an

00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:17,320
independent thing meaning that it's a

00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:20,260
it's a request that doesn't touch

00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:22,060
anything else right or maybe it's a

00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:23,740
little related it might touch some other

00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:28,570
things so there's some possibility of

00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:30,850
breaking or oh this will mess with the

00:42:28,570 --> 00:42:33,040
entire structure of organic groups and

00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:36,310
all the dashboards so we just did this

00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:38,290
matrix and if it was built and it was

00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:40,270
integral to everything else that was

00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:42,160
built they didn't get it and what was

00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:43,930
really great was that it made everybody

00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:46,540
sit down and put everything in a matrix

00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:48,280
which took like 15 minutes like can you

00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:51,040
imagine how long people would have spent

00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:53,590
arguing over this otherwise so they took

00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:56,980
the four pages and we put them in here

00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:58,720
and went me that's pretty good and so we

00:42:56,980 --> 00:43:01,750
came up with like a one and a half page

00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:03,340
list and then we did this because we're

00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:05,260
still trying to meet that deadline right

00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:06,550
just because they crammed in a bunch of

00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:10,960
stuff they're not going to let us launch

00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:12,880
later and we did that like it's less

00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,440
than 20 hours it's more than 20 hours I

00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,300
know it's a black hole like we got to do

00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,060
research it's probably going to change

00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:23,110
the scope and we came back to them with

00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:25,060
what came out in the green and said this

00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:25,630
is what can get done without costing you

00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,660
extra money

00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:30,730
your time and they went okay but see we

00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:32,559
actually had a reason in a rationale and

00:43:30,730 --> 00:43:35,440
when we showed them we actually showed

00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:37,269
them the matrix list and they went ok

00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,880
that's really reasonable and they were

00:43:37,269 --> 00:43:42,309
happy like but the whole four pages when

00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:44,920
it came in had that client must be done

00:43:42,309 --> 00:43:47,109
for launch right but you can kind of

00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,910
help them sort through that so this is

00:43:47,109 --> 00:43:51,910
tremendously valuable and you can do

00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:53,740
this like I want to go on a vacation and

00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:55,900
we need people to work like you can make

00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:59,559
up your matrix all day long and it just

00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:02,109
is very helpful it's very fast so

00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:05,609
planning we talked about that earlier ok

00:44:02,109 --> 00:44:07,660
am i doing on time I've got four minutes

00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:10,720
ok so I want to tell you some other

00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:12,549
really good things so when I first got

00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,799
to one of my clients that we grew their

00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:16,269
shop from 3 to 15 people this is what

00:44:14,799 --> 00:44:19,750
they did this is what a deaf shop does

00:44:16,269 --> 00:44:21,519
and this is what they do now so all of

00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:25,660
you need to add more of the stuff in

00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:27,369
right now and so I'm going to just talk

00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:30,819
to you about these four things so that

00:44:27,369 --> 00:44:37,000
you can see them and I think I have to

00:44:30,819 --> 00:44:39,569
oh don't laugh at homework are you guys

00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:44,730
having fun are you guys learning stuff

00:44:39,569 --> 00:44:51,250
very weak say yes I'm being recorded ok

00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:54,009
ok so the first thing is um how many of

00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:56,259
use on the outliner favorite tool of

00:44:54,009 --> 00:44:59,410
mine everybody write that down that's an

00:44:56,259 --> 00:45:02,619
incredible tool so we actually do audits

00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:04,569
so we actually spend time figuring out

00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:09,009
all the URLs that we're going to build

00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:10,779
and what it is and and like that there's

00:45:09,009 --> 00:45:14,289
notes in here like which are third-party

00:45:10,779 --> 00:45:16,869
integrations needs more discovery things

00:45:14,289 --> 00:45:19,630
that are problems there's another

00:45:16,869 --> 00:45:21,970
corollary document that actually goes

00:45:19,630 --> 00:45:24,339
with it that is also done in on the

00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:28,240
outliner that actually starts to capture

00:45:24,339 --> 00:45:31,720
what it is contenttype view block etc

00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,279
and that actually you can add right in

00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:35,650
here because you can do columns with

00:45:33,279 --> 00:45:38,060
that

00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:40,580
the other thing I'm going to spend a

00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:43,520
little bit more time on storyboards but

00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:45,350
there's a thing called snippets so when

00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,609
I first got to this company I looked at

00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:49,280
their tickets and the ticket said build

00:45:46,609 --> 00:45:52,280
of you and for more information see

00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:55,280
specs is that a ticket how many of you

00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:57,230
have tickets it look like that okay when

00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:58,850
you're one guy and it's in your head you

00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:00,800
met with the client you know them you

00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:02,869
can do that the minute there's two it

00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:04,730
can't work anymore and it starts to

00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:06,590
disintegrate it's that Avalanche moment

00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:08,150
that I'm telling you about but even if

00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:12,770
you're one person you should do this so

00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:14,180
now can you guys see that no I don't

00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:18,260
know how to make it bigger this is a

00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:22,000
very cumbersome tool for that let me see

00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:25,160
if I can just do this okay that better

00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:27,440
okay so now when they put in a ticket

00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:32,480
that says build of you this is what it

00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:33,830
starts doing because if you build a view

00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,890
three times you haven't made any money

00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:39,440
on it and just a simple thing like

00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:41,240
knowing what the URL is going to be in

00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,650
advance what are the fields there's

00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,960
actually more of this where it says

00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:46,670
every field has to be whether the label

00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,410
is hidden displayed what are the image

00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:50,480
cache profiles are using the image

00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:53,570
fields from some other view all that

00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:56,300
kind of stuff and what happens if you do

00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:58,490
this for your entire site up front you

00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:02,240
start to see that you only need for

00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:04,250
image presets not 22 you see that you

00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,750
only need to use this field as a

00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:09,230
reference rather than building it

00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:12,140
uniquely on each view this helps speed

00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:14,840
up everything make your site way more

00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:18,440
scalable how many of you build out

00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:20,930
dashboards okay so that's the best thing

00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:22,490
that you can do in Drupal and this is

00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:24,200
something that we do early and discovery

00:47:22,490 --> 00:47:27,050
is that we don't bother with what the

00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:30,560
wire frames are so much we build them

00:47:27,050 --> 00:47:32,600
their dashboard wireframes because what

00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:36,140
surfaces when you build the wireframe

00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:37,760
dashboard for the end user someone tell

00:47:36,140 --> 00:47:38,780
me I'm not going to pick on you just

00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:41,420
because I haven't picked on enough

00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:43,369
people but I'm so glad you haven't who

00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:47,590
knows why you would want to build a wire

00:47:43,369 --> 00:47:47,590
dashboard some of you raised her yes

00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:52,529
it's what they care about most but what

00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:55,619
is what's often they're like well how do

00:47:52,529 --> 00:47:57,959
I manage this and that this turns into a

00:47:55,619 --> 00:48:00,299
whole thing right so if you build the

00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:02,549
dashboard and lay that out that tells

00:48:00,299 --> 00:48:04,380
you every content type you need it tells

00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:06,329
you every feature you need it tells you

00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:08,219
every view that you need it tells you

00:48:06,329 --> 00:48:10,559
what they're expecting the site to do

00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:12,809
because if they want to manage it from

00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:14,369
here and you cannot believe the gaps

00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:18,989
that come up once we do that they're

00:48:14,369 --> 00:48:21,239
like hey how can I do this and it's like

00:48:18,989 --> 00:48:23,219
that was never anywhere in any of the

00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:25,049
documents and that's so valuable okay

00:48:23,219 --> 00:48:27,989
we're actually at time and if you want

00:48:25,049 --> 00:48:30,569
to go you can there's nothing until the

00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:33,959
final keynote so if you want to stay I

00:48:30,569 --> 00:48:36,599
just have a few more things and then

00:48:33,959 --> 00:48:41,099
this is and you can actually leave after

00:48:36,599 --> 00:48:44,190
this if you choose Oh 15 minutes oh yay

00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:47,849
oh good I thought the time went really

00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:49,890
fast okay so okay because this is really

00:48:47,849 --> 00:48:51,630
important so this is something that i

00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:54,180
started doing very recently called

00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:56,779
storyboards and storyboards are

00:48:54,180 --> 00:49:00,299
incredible if you have any facility of

00:48:56,779 --> 00:49:02,190
of storytelling this is what it is so

00:49:00,299 --> 00:49:06,299
how many of you do any kind of user

00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:08,459
stories so user stories are great except

00:49:06,299 --> 00:49:11,849
for it doesn't translate into anything

00:49:08,459 --> 00:49:13,949
Drupal it's just a paragraph and at the

00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:15,599
end of the day the gap is is that you

00:49:13,949 --> 00:49:17,880
can take all the user stories you want

00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:21,059
but engineering could care less they

00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:23,069
really don't respond to user stories so

00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:25,109
what we started doing is this thing

00:49:23,069 --> 00:49:28,469
called storyboarding and what it is it's

00:49:25,109 --> 00:49:31,049
an workflow of the user story in Drupal

00:49:28,469 --> 00:49:32,969
so it's the user story told in Drupal

00:49:31,049 --> 00:49:36,839
and so we have legends and we reuse the

00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:39,390
same things over and over again so this

00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:41,819
is the different roles and let me tell

00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:43,769
you i we i scoped a project they said oh

00:49:41,819 --> 00:49:45,390
we only have three users we only got

00:49:43,769 --> 00:49:48,539
three people that's all that will ever

00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:52,319
login administrate the site and 17 rolls

00:49:48,539 --> 00:49:56,489
later we're like at the organic group so

00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:58,849
this is really important and then how

00:49:56,489 --> 00:50:00,069
many of you work with very non-technical

00:49:58,849 --> 00:50:02,949
customers

00:50:00,069 --> 00:50:08,199
this is the best tool for you so this is

00:50:02,949 --> 00:50:10,569
also done in Omni graffle and so you can

00:50:08,199 --> 00:50:14,440
do this yourself and so I tell a little

00:50:10,569 --> 00:50:16,690
story of out darn it I'm not supposed to

00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:20,739
have that up there no one read that so

00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:23,109
the an employee visits the site and then

00:50:20,739 --> 00:50:25,719
all this stuff happens and then a video

00:50:23,109 --> 00:50:29,170
is uploaded and then it's visited by

00:50:25,719 --> 00:50:30,640
employees okay and then these are the

00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:33,099
different things that happen here's

00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:35,229
where some taxonomy happens here's where

00:50:33,099 --> 00:50:39,309
a content type is created it has this

00:50:35,229 --> 00:50:42,430
taxonomy the person logs in it does

00:50:39,309 --> 00:50:45,369
these things gets notifications the

00:50:42,430 --> 00:50:47,979
administrator does this and then

00:50:45,369 --> 00:50:52,509
somebody logs in and they can do these

00:50:47,979 --> 00:50:55,109
different things and then a project ends

00:50:52,509 --> 00:51:00,099
and this is what they're able to do now

00:50:55,109 --> 00:51:04,420
I'll show you another one real quick so

00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:09,150
more things see a lot of people they

00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:15,819
swore only three here are content types

00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:18,509
that they said was just too and then

00:51:15,819 --> 00:51:22,209
this is a workflow around all this stuff

00:51:18,509 --> 00:51:27,160
that's all super secret and then they

00:51:22,209 --> 00:51:30,519
email it around and then but you can see

00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:32,440
like all of a sudden how you can start

00:51:30,519 --> 00:51:34,719
to take apart their word document they

00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:37,959
sent you and you can actually start

00:51:34,719 --> 00:51:42,759
turning it into Drupal and what's useful

00:51:37,959 --> 00:51:47,739
for this is that what I can do from here

00:51:42,759 --> 00:51:49,119
is really cool so in let me go back to

00:51:47,739 --> 00:51:55,779
my keynote because I have a great slide

00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:58,180
for this so so this first of all it's

00:51:55,779 --> 00:52:00,039
very very fast and so it doesn't cost

00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:02,920
anything to do because you're doing that

00:52:00,039 --> 00:52:04,809
darn user story read through anyway but

00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,459
it's so it's very inexpensive and

00:52:04,809 --> 00:52:08,739
lightweight which is a big savings to

00:52:06,459 --> 00:52:11,680
you and but the most important thing no

00:52:08,739 --> 00:52:12,200
matter how lowly technical your client

00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,450
they

00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:18,500
stand what's going on because it's their

00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:20,359
workflow that you're illustrating but

00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:22,490
what was really weird to me because you

00:52:20,359 --> 00:52:24,560
know I'm more on the business

00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:27,980
development sales side is that my

00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:29,960
engineers loved this they were thrilled

00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:31,640
with it and you know why because I can

00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:34,310
take this document eight-page document

00:52:31,640 --> 00:52:35,750
put it in front of my engineer and you

00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:37,579
know we now know what all the different

00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:40,040
symbols mean and he reads through it

00:52:37,579 --> 00:52:41,930
just like you would code and in two

00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:44,030
three four minutes he marks it up and

00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:47,000
goes problem problem this doesn't work

00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:50,750
like this yep yep find out more about

00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:53,780
this and so we get like this first pass

00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:56,540
at architecture that costs ten minutes

00:52:53,780 --> 00:53:01,490
of his time and that's really really

00:52:56,540 --> 00:53:04,430
important and how many of you tried to

00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:06,859
write back write up this stuff to send

00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:10,040
back to the client like you do that yeah

00:53:06,859 --> 00:53:11,900
like a scope of work this is my scope of

00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:14,420
work even for very large projects as a

00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:16,160
preliminary one and guess what they

00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:17,900
actually read through it how many of you

00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:19,970
have had that scope of work everybody

00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:21,680
signs it there's a deposit and midway

00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:23,119
through the project they're like where's

00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:24,650
this magical feature that I was

00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:26,510
expecting and it's like well it's not in

00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:29,089
the scope of work well you overlook that

00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:32,150
you should build it for me for free yeah

00:53:29,089 --> 00:53:34,280
so this really solves that it also does

00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:36,290
something else really magical it avoids

00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,730
scope creep and you know why it's

00:53:36,290 --> 00:53:39,800
because they actually understood what

00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:42,890
you were selling them they understood it

00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:46,579
as an actual development cycle for what

00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:49,819
they were trying to get done so anything

00:53:46,579 --> 00:53:51,680
L met anybody have any insights or can

00:53:49,819 --> 00:53:54,470
anybody see how that they are going to

00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:56,660
find some value in that that's like the

00:53:54,470 --> 00:53:59,079
matrix and those two things are probably

00:53:56,660 --> 00:54:02,630
the best thing you can do for yourself

00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:08,300
it accelerates architecture for free

00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:11,030
that's a big deal yes yeah omnigraffle

00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:12,710
has a bunch of templates and then they

00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:14,950
have a lot of frameworks and you can buy

00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:17,210
like people make on me graffle um

00:54:14,950 --> 00:54:19,670
templates that you can insert in and

00:54:17,210 --> 00:54:21,349
then over time I've just made my own but

00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:22,940
yeah it's really fun it takes minutes

00:54:21,349 --> 00:54:25,570
and you know sometimes it's nice to do

00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:31,490
something mindlessly creative

00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:33,620
okay so lots of tools okay how many of

00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:39,830
you have loved talking about money on a

00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:43,370
project yeah so again this is an area of

00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:44,750
coachability and so I cannot tell you

00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:46,640
the number of times people don't

00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:49,160
actually have good budgets for their

00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:51,350
projects it's horribly underfunded it's

00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,630
under man and its mission critical to

00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:57,380
their company and it makes no sense and

00:54:53,630 --> 00:55:01,250
so that's a really big warning flag for

00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:04,610
me i'm working with a university right

00:55:01,250 --> 00:55:07,130
now college actually and there'd

00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:10,070
allocated no people no resources and

00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:11,630
what is the value of a student how many

00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:15,380
know how many of you are have some sense

00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:18,170
that a student they bring in 200 to 250

00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:19,850
thousand dollars it's a big sale a

00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:21,860
student is worth a quarter million

00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:23,630
dollars and they're like grumbling

00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:25,760
because you're saying phase one might be

00:55:23,630 --> 00:55:27,530
a hundred and twenty thousand dollars so

00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:30,260
it's really worth half a student but we

00:55:27,530 --> 00:55:32,960
want to enroll 20,000 students over the

00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:34,880
next three years but but we don't want

00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,820
to spend more than this so there's a

00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,440
funny relationship to how much they're

00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:41,020
willing to invest and so it's a very

00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,660
good way to start off the conversation

00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:47,180
is the value proposition of the site

00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:48,740
what is it that you want it to do and

00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:50,840
how is it that you want it to convert

00:55:48,740 --> 00:55:52,760
and don't talk about it in terms of your

00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:54,590
hours and time your hours and time are

00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:58,180
not interesting to them it's what

00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:58,180
they're trying to get done on the site I

00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:04,190
had someone say you know what and I

00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:06,380
cannot tell you what a big company they

00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:07,610
were there like we don't pay for QA and

00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:09,560
we don't pay for p.m. we pay for

00:56:07,610 --> 00:56:11,660
engineering and I said great I

00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:14,480
completely get that and they now pay

00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:18,170
engineering rates for QA and p.m. so it

00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:19,760
works out great you cannot not pay for

00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:21,980
QA and p.m. because otherwise your

00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:25,220
engineers doing it and engineers are

00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:27,290
expensive and they're scarce so don't do

00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:29,780
that like that it's just goofy and if

00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:31,400
the client tells you that just tell them

00:56:29,780 --> 00:56:33,320
what I did that's so great we're

00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,450
completely on board with that and

00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,500
they're like why does it take so long to

00:56:35,450 --> 00:56:39,700
build everything it's like because I

00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,700
have to QA and PM it

00:56:40,299 --> 00:56:45,650
matrix magic so how many of you are

00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:48,829
really good at estimating so this is the

00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:50,959
way engineer's estimate if I stay in my

00:56:48,829 --> 00:56:53,329
dorm room all night long and I drink

00:56:50,959 --> 00:56:56,539
redbull I don't text my friends I don't

00:56:53,329 --> 00:57:00,979
play world world warcraft world of

00:56:56,539 --> 00:57:04,099
warcraft and i can do this in a day a

00:57:00,979 --> 00:57:07,069
day meeting 24 hours a day to management

00:57:04,099 --> 00:57:09,049
means 6.5 billable hours so already

00:57:07,069 --> 00:57:11,689
we're like way disconnected right and

00:57:09,049 --> 00:57:13,549
and everything is never going to have a

00:57:11,689 --> 00:57:15,079
problem their environments always going

00:57:13,549 --> 00:57:18,769
to work the deployments always going to

00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:20,869
go well but even outside of that there

00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:22,130
are some things that you can look at as

00:57:20,869 --> 00:57:24,589
estimating how many of you are here

00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:28,489
responsible for estimating if not money

00:57:24,589 --> 00:57:31,279
at least time ok great so I borrowed

00:57:28,489 --> 00:57:34,599
this very lightly from node 1 and are

00:57:31,279 --> 00:57:37,429
you able to see this down here so

00:57:34,599 --> 00:57:38,689
there's some things that create

00:57:37,429 --> 00:57:41,959
variables when you're going to build

00:57:38,689 --> 00:57:44,150
something one of them is risk so if it's

00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:45,409
really important to the project you need

00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:48,469
to give yourself a little bit more

00:57:45,409 --> 00:57:51,890
buffer if on that magic matrix I said

00:57:48,469 --> 00:57:55,369
this is critical this must talk to the

00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:57,769
biblio module then you probably want to

00:57:55,369 --> 00:58:00,559
bump up your hours around it because you

00:57:57,769 --> 00:58:03,469
can't like be just okay that it kind of

00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:06,650
mostly works the other thing is

00:58:03,469 --> 00:58:08,869
complexity if you've done views and it's

00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:11,150
just more views great it's a one right

00:58:08,869 --> 00:58:13,369
but if it's something that you haven't

00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:15,979
quite built its solar with a module

00:58:13,369 --> 00:58:18,859
that's still in beta it's not that it's

00:58:15,979 --> 00:58:22,249
hard but it's not something that you're

00:58:18,859 --> 00:58:25,789
completely familiar with that that

00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:27,589
complexity might be a two and then how

00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:29,150
many times you've done it it's complex a

00:58:27,589 --> 00:58:30,859
Salesforce integration but I do those

00:58:29,150 --> 00:58:35,209
all day long this one's a little

00:58:30,859 --> 00:58:37,969
different and then a coachable client so

00:58:35,209 --> 00:58:42,199
you can see how two hours can really

00:58:37,969 --> 00:58:43,900
vary from six to 18 and I and this is

00:58:42,199 --> 00:58:46,369
just on dev hours this doesn't count

00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:48,799
project management QA and all that's not

00:58:46,369 --> 00:58:50,650
their overhead things so you can see how

00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:52,990
a small business can

00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:55,780
really start to run into trouble right

00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:58,870
away if only engineering the engineering

00:58:55,780 --> 00:59:02,050
mind if it's you doing everything does

00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:04,810
estimating and then QA is sometimes

00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:08,560
twenty-five percent depending on how

00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:11,410
complex it is p.m. it often takes

00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:15,820
twenty-five percent and then we're lucky

00:59:11,410 --> 00:59:18,490
if we can get 10 or 15 and then design

00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:20,860
and theming so there's lots of things in

00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:22,720
there where to our project might really

00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:31,390
take you three days might take you 30

00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:35,050
hours and so if you look at different

00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:37,090
client a and client be you can have the

00:59:35,050 --> 00:59:40,030
same complexity and the same experience

00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:42,270
but a little bit more difficult client

00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:44,800
no I'm sorry these should have been 1.5

00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:46,270
you can see like Ashley shifts your

00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,190
hours if you have to spend more time

00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:50,440
actually talking to the client about

00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:54,700
everything you need to account for that

00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:56,710
in the development time because a lot of

00:59:54,700 --> 01:00:03,600
conversation often means a lot of

00:59:56,710 --> 01:00:07,840
revision so how many of you have a

01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:11,050
triage points on a project how many of

01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:13,570
you know what I mean by that okay so a

01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:18,670
triage point is like have you guys seen

01:00:13,570 --> 01:00:20,530
mash or like emergency ER or there's

01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:22,720
triage if you go to the move you been to

01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:24,670
the ergency room like when you come in

01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:26,740
they do actually kind of look at you and

01:00:24,670 --> 01:00:27,970
sometimes it's better than others but

01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:30,100
they decide if you're going to die or

01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:31,510
not so if you have a respiratory thing

01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:33,010
they'll take you in right away if you

01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:35,440
have arterial bleeding they'll take you

01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:37,030
in right away and then so you get

01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,520
through the first point in triage and

01:00:37,030 --> 01:00:41,710
triage means every project should have a

01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:43,450
point where you can pull the plug you

01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:46,380
should discuss these with the client and

01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:48,490
you should know like at what point

01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:51,130
something's going to go wrong a triage

01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:53,700
point can be they haven't paid their

01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:57,040
bill in two weeks that's a triage point

01:00:53,700 --> 01:00:58,990
what's another triage point what are

01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:02,070
some points where you should stop and

01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:04,870
look up

01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:06,790
yeah the clients not responding right

01:01:04,870 --> 01:01:08,620
they haven't done uat they're not

01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:16,390
getting back with your own content

01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:18,400
decisions yes yeah so they're they're

01:01:16,390 --> 01:01:20,440
iterating before you even finished

01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:22,570
building like they're just kind of

01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:40,990
spinning that's a really good triage

01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:45,180
point how would you triage that yeah so

01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:45,180
that's that's very so that's a good

01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:51,280
specific for what happened in that one

01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:54,040
point but there's a bigger conversation

01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:56,200
that you can have a say oh well let's

01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:58,150
sit down and talk about how development

01:01:56,200 --> 01:02:00,070
cycles go and then you have the

01:01:58,150 --> 01:02:01,810
opportunity to how many of you work in

01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:03,970
sprints even though if they're not very

01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:06,160
formal okay so you need to explain to

01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:08,350
them what a sprint is and what happens

01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:10,540
all along the way so one of the things

01:02:08,350 --> 01:02:12,220
about managing client expectations is

01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:14,170
letting them know how it's going to go

01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:15,460
we're going to go to on first date I'm

01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:17,680
going to hold your hand I'm going to

01:02:15,460 --> 01:02:18,910
take you and drop you I'll walk you all

01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:21,100
the way up to the front door and then

01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:22,450
I'll Drive off on the second day we're

01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:24,100
going to go and we're going to go to

01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:25,960
this restaurant and then the ballgame

01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:28,900
and then I'm going to give you a kiss on

01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:30,340
the cheek so so that's kind of how

01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,510
you're going to explain Sprint's it's

01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:34,390
like you're actually going to lay out

01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:36,970
and you're going to preempt that

01:02:34,390 --> 01:02:40,060
behavior and say this is something that

01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:41,230
often happens in a project we build

01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:44,350
something and you want something

01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:46,300
different and so here's how that's going

01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:49,600
to go and then you tell them how that's

01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:51,520
going to go in advance and then when it

01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:53,380
happens you can go Oh remember that

01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:56,140
thing that I said earlier on that's in

01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:58,510
my contract and so let's decide what

01:02:56,140 --> 01:03:01,450
this is is this a new feature request is

01:02:58,510 --> 01:03:04,780
this you know so if you preempt things

01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:06,550
like that that always happen to you and

01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:07,990
some of you have things that happen to

01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:09,370
you over and over again and some of you

01:03:07,990 --> 01:03:11,470
never have those because you've learned

01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:13,210
to autocorrect you can figure that out

01:03:11,470 --> 01:03:14,430
but if anything's happening to you on

01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:18,960
every project

01:03:14,430 --> 01:03:20,550
you need a pre-emptive conversation oh I

01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:22,440
did want to talk about this phase 1

01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:24,540
phase 2 one of the things that I noticed

01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:26,490
is people get really attached to me

01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:28,530
working on projects with them they like

01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:30,630
the fact that I'm a dictator but that

01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:32,790
I'm pretty thoughtful and methodical and

01:03:30,630 --> 01:03:34,829
help things go better and they really

01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:38,760
get some anxiety at the end of a project

01:03:34,829 --> 01:03:40,500
and they think that they have to shove

01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:42,119
everything in at the last minute because

01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:45,089
I'll go away and they'll never see me

01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:48,450
again and sometimes it's a money thing

01:03:45,089 --> 01:03:50,819
right or sometimes it's they don't

01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:52,410
understand that they bought a child

01:03:50,819 --> 01:03:54,210
that's growing up with them and they're

01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:56,069
never going to stop feeding and taking

01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:57,809
care of it so one of the things that I

01:03:56,069 --> 01:03:59,400
always do is every time something like

01:03:57,809 --> 01:04:01,079
that happens is I tell them oh well

01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:03,690
we're going to do that in phase 2 will

01:04:01,079 --> 01:04:05,490
do that in phase 3 so you're helping

01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:06,750
them understand this is a very long term

01:04:05,490 --> 01:04:12,480
relationship with you they've just

01:04:06,750 --> 01:04:15,000
started one tiny part of the path okay

01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:17,609
do not buy the cheapest guides you do

01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:19,470
not want to go up the mountain path with

01:04:17,609 --> 01:04:21,119
the cheapest guides and you guys are the

01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:22,410
Sherpas those of you that are the

01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:25,319
engineering teams in here you're the

01:04:22,410 --> 01:04:27,960
Sherpas and so do not be the cheapest

01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:35,339
guides be the best guides really guide

01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:37,799
your client up that mountain so now

01:04:35,339 --> 01:04:39,210
you're afraid to start and I really

01:04:37,799 --> 01:04:40,380
wanted to have more time to be

01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:43,440
interactive and when it's a smaller

01:04:40,380 --> 01:04:46,859
group we really do that so I so hope you

01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:48,750
still had a lot of fun I'd like you all

01:04:46,859 --> 01:04:50,099
to take out a piece of paper that you'll

01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:53,220
throw away and lose or open your laptop

01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:54,540
and I'd like you to write down as many

01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:56,040
things that you think you're going to

01:04:54,540 --> 01:04:57,390
implement and I know that you think oh

01:04:56,040 --> 01:05:00,380
I'm going to remember this I'll download

01:04:57,390 --> 01:05:03,480
the slide I'll ask or but you won't so

01:05:00,380 --> 01:05:05,220
just take a few notes of some things

01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:07,740
that you're going to implement when you

01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:09,299
get back that was meaningful to you are

01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:11,450
the things that you're going to research

01:05:09,299 --> 01:05:15,890
so I think it's going to be matrices

01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:19,619
it's going to be storyboards estimating

01:05:15,890 --> 01:05:21,750
managing client expectations doing

01:05:19,619 --> 01:05:23,309
minimal Viable products who else has

01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:27,290
wants something that they really liked

01:05:23,309 --> 01:05:27,290
from today yes

01:05:30,619 --> 01:05:44,910
uh-huh yeah yes yeah do you feel free to

01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:47,490
go we're over if you'd like to stay I

01:05:44,910 --> 01:05:48,900
can spend some little time up here and

01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:51,240
we can continue talking if you have any

01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:56,780
specific case uses to you but did you

01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:56,780
guys I'm value from today yeah thank you

01:05:58,580 --> 01:06:04,950
yes hi this is a PSA if you don't mind I

01:06:03,090 --> 01:06:14,450
lost my phone in the session before this

01:06:04,950 --> 01:06:14,450
anybody pick up a phone by chance okay

01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:21,480
so this is my friend johnny fox i just

01:06:19,830 --> 01:06:24,000
want to give him a plug because we did

01:06:21,480 --> 01:06:29,460
this session together and that's neat

01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:30,900
yes um so i really like the storyboards

01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:33,420
yes everything you thought of putting

01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:34,770
those icons up on Mike raffle topiary my

01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:36,330
gosh you know I don't really know how to

01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:39,150
do that but if you come talk to me I

01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:40,830
happy to do I'd like to use them but

01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:42,980
quick question so are though like what

01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:45,780
would the difference between those and

01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:47,310
like a flowchart or activity diagram

01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:49,380
like besides being a little bit more

01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:50,640
visual probably clients i can see would

01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:52,710
respond to it better just for having

01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:54,510
that extra visual element yes because if

01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:55,859
it's 40 yeah i would say a little bit

01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:57,030
more time consuming right so I'm just

01:06:55,859 --> 01:06:59,840
building if I just want to build a uml

01:06:57,030 --> 01:07:02,609
activity diagram a lot not as pretty but

01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:06,990
hey be faster to build right yeah so

01:07:02,609 --> 01:07:10,140
flow diagrams I think flow diagrams tell

01:07:06,990 --> 01:07:12,600
something about logic where this is more

01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:14,700
of an end users work flow through the

01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,990
drupal site so it's slightly different

01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:18,240
because it's not giving them logic

01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:20,690
points it's saying i'm going to get my

01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:23,730
car drive to the store pick up bread

01:07:20,690 --> 01:07:25,710
pick up eggs pick up milk i'm going to

01:07:23,730 --> 01:07:29,040
come back make scrambled eggs toast

01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:33,090
where the flow diagram might say get in

01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:35,340
the car yes no if yes then this is the

01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:37,920
road clear behind me so it's slightly

01:07:35,340 --> 01:07:39,450
different and it doesn't tell the user's

01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:42,240
experience with

01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:44,550
site and that workflow becomes useful

01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:47,550
because some of those storyboards I went

01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:49,710
through a little complex and what it did

01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:52,230
is that it allowed me as a sales person

01:07:49,710 --> 01:07:54,660
to not sell something that the engineer

01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:56,700
didn't sign off on and so that's really

01:07:54,660 --> 01:08:00,000
helpful like how many of you engineers

01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:03,600
love that but I said you could do it yes

01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,980
I really liked the flowchart that you

01:08:03,600 --> 01:08:06,930
were talking about we actually have used

01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:08,880
OmniGraffle in the past uh-huh and it's

01:08:06,930 --> 01:08:11,540
fantastic for once you're in the project

01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:14,610
other things that we struggle with is

01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:17,550
the discrepancy between what's old quote

01:08:14,610 --> 01:08:21,840
unquote sold to the client and then what

01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:26,130
is explained from the client to PM or

01:08:21,840 --> 01:08:27,840
Ryan ears do you have any ideas for how

01:08:26,130 --> 01:08:30,360
to do that in the business development

01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:32,610
and the sales process so that things

01:08:30,360 --> 01:08:35,130
like once we get into you know

01:08:32,610 --> 01:08:37,800
wireframes like oh by the way my boss

01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:40,170
reminded me that we have this database

01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:43,260
that we fully need to write migrated

01:08:40,170 --> 01:08:44,820
into yeah so the storyboards that's a

01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:46,920
really good question so the storyboards

01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:50,610
are actually happening when we're doing

01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:54,480
the the preliminary conversations it's

01:08:50,610 --> 01:08:57,090
pre-sales yeah because that's how we

01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:59,430
actually know how to bid out the project

01:08:57,090 --> 01:09:02,010
because all the workflow is there we

01:08:59,430 --> 01:09:03,780
know all the content types it actually

01:09:02,010 --> 01:09:05,760
takes a little bit more time and money

01:09:03,780 --> 01:09:07,820
but the client really likes the process

01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:10,500
and we almost always win the projects so

01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:12,360
it gives them a lot of faith that you

01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:14,370
understand what's going on with their

01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:16,800
business so they really like it and it

01:09:14,370 --> 01:09:19,830
gets to be alarmingly fast because you

01:09:16,800 --> 01:09:21,510
use the same ten pages really and you're

01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:22,800
just moving the little icons around and

01:09:21,510 --> 01:09:25,980
changing the narrative down the right

01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:28,500
side so i have my account manager

01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:30,150
actually sit in on the sales meetings

01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:33,030
when we get to that point and then she

01:09:30,150 --> 01:09:35,820
just does them so they're not even

01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:37,890
coming from very it's not coming from

01:09:35,820 --> 01:09:40,710
engineering it's coming from the sales

01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:42,990
side of things and so how many here do

01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:44,610
sales like it's a really powerful sales

01:09:42,990 --> 01:09:47,820
tool like if you if you're interviewing

01:09:44,610 --> 01:09:50,160
for shops who are you going to hire the

01:09:47,820 --> 01:09:51,330
person that like maybe sometimes they'll

01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:54,120
hire someone that did

01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:57,510
mockup but someone that walked them

01:09:54,120 --> 01:10:02,550
through their own idea is they feel very

01:09:57,510 --> 01:10:04,860
connected to anything else yes so when

01:10:02,550 --> 01:10:07,170
you have a client that one thing that

01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:09,630
resonated with me worth where they want

01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:12,260
to talk through every change their happy

01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:15,210
about it's easier to set those

01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:18,270
expectations beforehand yes but you

01:10:15,210 --> 01:10:21,420
don't always know right what well how

01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:23,310
they're gonna be so so do you try to

01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:25,410
come for that in your meetings

01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:26,790
beforehand or do you just have to sit

01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:29,370
down with them and they might say well

01:10:26,790 --> 01:10:32,690
you didn't tell me we weren't going you

01:10:29,370 --> 01:10:35,070
do kind of no because if they if someone

01:10:32,690 --> 01:10:36,990
hires you on the first meeting after a

01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:37,980
short time that's a bad thing right like

01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:40,230
they don't even know what they're buying

01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:42,570
if they if you have to come back for

01:10:40,230 --> 01:10:44,400
five meetings that's too much to

01:10:42,570 --> 01:10:46,770
remember that one slide this is too much

01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:49,080
too little it's like neither of things

01:10:46,770 --> 01:10:50,250
those things are good and you can tell

01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:54,420
because they start to have really

01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:56,550
detailed emails to you and they start

01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:58,200
like needing a lot of narrative so you

01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:59,610
kind of get a feel for it but it should

01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:02,130
just be part of your normal thing that

01:10:59,610 --> 01:11:04,200
says this is our typical meeting

01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:06,210
schedule like we have a sprint we have a

01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:08,850
kickoff we have a client meeting it

01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:11,550
lasts this long we expect to communicate

01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:13,500
with you daily through base camp and

01:11:11,550 --> 01:11:16,170
then just kind of set that that's the

01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:17,820
expectation and then at the end of the

01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:20,070
next sprint if they've been over

01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:22,170
communicative you can talk about that

01:11:20,070 --> 01:11:24,780
say hey I see that your project is being

01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:26,580
very account management heavy do you

01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:29,810
need me to find more resources to that

01:11:26,580 --> 01:11:33,120
and we can just add that to your project

01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:35,190
yeah so yes let them know they're being

01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:36,840
resource heavy right like that's a

01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:39,870
really nice way of saying quit taking so

01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:42,330
much of my time and I think I'll too

01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:45,330
especially for those of you and

01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:47,250
universities the more formulaic you can

01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:49,050
make your meetings and your process for

01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:55,020
developing a site that's that safer

01:11:49,050 --> 01:11:57,090
you'll be anything else yes oh you guys

01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:58,380
are so great thanks for hanging out what

01:11:57,090 --> 01:12:01,170
if you could talk about the RFP process

01:11:58,380 --> 01:12:04,680
a little bit because to me RFP is recipe

01:12:01,170 --> 01:12:06,990
for problems yeah these are science that

01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:08,790
way but that that may seem to be the way

01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:10,650
that a lot of interesting work comes out

01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:14,220
it does how many of you have been

01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:18,150
successful with rfps huh that's that's a

01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:21,660
really high number so turn it you guys

01:12:18,150 --> 01:12:23,550
should support my theories so I don't

01:12:21,660 --> 01:12:27,420
like RFPs and I'll tell you why they're

01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:29,550
either predisposed to already somebody

01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:31,230
already working in and and institutions

01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:32,150
have to put out RFPs but they already

01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:34,290
know who they're going to hire

01:12:32,150 --> 01:12:36,210
especially if it's very Drupal II like

01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:38,280
if it's like we need 12 content types

01:12:36,210 --> 01:12:40,950
and 14 views and blood Loblaw it's like

01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:42,960
yo Dino Drupal something's going on or

01:12:40,950 --> 01:12:44,760
if they're so vague they don't know any

01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:47,670
Drupal and so it's not going to work

01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:49,790
either I haven't found RFP is good

01:12:47,670 --> 01:12:51,750
because they tend to be fixed bid and

01:12:49,790 --> 01:12:54,210
unfortunately they don't pay for

01:12:51,750 --> 01:12:56,400
discovery and then you get in there and

01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:58,050
find out there were 24 things that they

01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,750
didn't mention in the RFP that you are

01:12:58,050 --> 01:13:02,460
now responsible for and so it's really

01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:05,940
tough and it's one of those opportunity

01:13:02,460 --> 01:13:07,530
costs some people are brilliant at them

01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:09,810
and they can kind of structure our piece

01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:12,570
to work for them I get annoyed by having

01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:13,920
to do them so I would rather go find

01:13:12,570 --> 01:13:17,610
work with people who want to work with

01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:20,130
me in my city where I can see them and

01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:24,060
meet with them then chase rfps far away

01:13:20,130 --> 01:13:27,300
I my success rate in closing a project

01:13:24,060 --> 01:13:30,410
where they're in my city is very high my

01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:34,350
success rate with rfps is very low so

01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:36,210
thick that helps yeah hi this is I'm

01:13:34,350 --> 01:13:40,820
glad this is my last sessions this is my

01:13:36,210 --> 01:13:43,470
favorite oh thank thank you um yeah um

01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:46,530
so I really wanted to ask you when you

01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:49,410
talk about the pixel perfect client that

01:13:46,530 --> 01:13:50,820
gets hung up on design and I yeah the

01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:53,010
way that my shop works and our team

01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:55,350
works for I think we do a very good job

01:13:53,010 --> 01:14:00,090
of you know our design happens very late

01:13:55,350 --> 01:14:02,400
in the process um it but how I really

01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:04,530
want to know from a realistic standpoint

01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:07,110
like how late do you actually start and

01:14:04,530 --> 01:14:08,780
how do you I feel like in a lot of

01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:11,580
projects I spend the first three weeks

01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:13,590
telling the client why it's okay that

01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:15,900
they're not going to see a design yes in

01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:16,550
until six months from now yeah seven or

01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:18,920
eight months from

01:14:16,550 --> 01:14:22,429
but what some of the tips or techniques

01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:24,920
you use to reassure them that it's okay

01:14:22,429 --> 01:14:27,739
we're not gonna see anything pretty for

01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:29,360
a very long time yeah it's a very

01:14:27,739 --> 01:14:31,219
different thing and especially like I

01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:34,639
will say at least now people don't ask

01:14:31,219 --> 01:14:36,619
for a design as in order the estimating

01:14:34,639 --> 01:14:38,059
proposal but I think you're the

01:14:36,619 --> 01:14:41,090
strongest asset because I think you're

01:14:38,059 --> 01:14:42,889
you're probably very creative is showing

01:14:41,090 --> 01:14:46,489
them the portfolio and say this is the

01:14:42,889 --> 01:14:48,020
way we work it's very successful and it

01:14:46,489 --> 01:14:50,170
saves you a lot of time and money

01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:52,639
usually people will cave when they say

01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:54,500
we can do this now but you're going to

01:14:52,639 --> 01:14:57,710
have to pay me to redo it several times

01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:59,750
and I have found this way to be so

01:14:57,710 --> 01:15:01,550
there's a feel felt sound I understand

01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:04,010
how you feel others my other clients

01:15:01,550 --> 01:15:06,020
have felt the same way but what we found

01:15:04,010 --> 01:15:09,440
is that this is a most successful way to

01:15:06,020 --> 01:15:12,199
have a project because there everyone

01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:14,150
feels afraid and alone like I didn't

01:15:12,199 --> 01:15:15,920
quite get into all of this but the

01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:17,719
reason clients are so difficult is

01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:20,480
because they're afraid they're terrified

01:15:17,719 --> 01:15:22,670
they're terrified it's like me planning

01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:23,989
a summit to Everest for all of you I

01:15:22,670 --> 01:15:26,929
would be terrified because I'm going to

01:15:23,989 --> 01:15:28,429
kill you and so it's not a good day and

01:15:26,929 --> 01:15:29,719
they feel the same way they're

01:15:28,429 --> 01:15:31,550
responsible for something they've

01:15:29,719 --> 01:15:33,860
probably never done before they have no

01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:35,389
expertise in they have to trust you in

01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:38,000
their jobs on the line their reputations

01:15:35,389 --> 01:15:39,949
on the line so yes the feel felt found

01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,440
is a really good way to do that oh I

01:15:39,949 --> 01:15:44,869
also think the second I don't think

01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:46,880
people talk about money soon enough yeah

01:15:44,869 --> 01:15:49,520
as soon as you can be equalizing and say

01:15:46,880 --> 01:15:52,790
if we do this this is the dollar amount

01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:54,260
like this will cost you actually these

01:15:52,790 --> 01:15:56,050
dollars then all of a sudden they're

01:15:54,260 --> 01:15:58,369
very comfortable about talking about

01:15:56,050 --> 01:16:00,559
exact chua Lee do that yeah exactly

01:15:58,369 --> 01:16:04,190
exactly well thank you for your welcome

01:16:00,559 --> 01:16:07,849
sister welcomes anybody else sorry just

01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:10,340
quickly so um you did mention sprint and

01:16:07,849 --> 01:16:11,510
agile yeah scrum and all that but then

01:16:10,340 --> 01:16:16,309
earlier around you're talking about

01:16:11,510 --> 01:16:20,599
leave design to the end so no I'm not an

01:16:16,309 --> 01:16:22,400
agile purist but no I mean either um so

01:16:20,599 --> 01:16:24,800
how about it so if if I was an agile

01:16:22,400 --> 01:16:29,210
purist I would say well you're not

01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:30,500
producing releasable features mm-hmm

01:16:29,210 --> 01:16:32,600
right because we're not themed

01:16:30,500 --> 01:16:34,400
right and then the reason I asked us

01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:36,980
because you know like we always bend the

01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:38,360
rules or whatever in our project we're

01:16:36,980 --> 01:16:40,280
okay we're building the functionality

01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:42,170
and then do we create separate user

01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:44,300
stories for the theming part of it and

01:16:42,170 --> 01:16:46,400
where do they come in sprints but then I

01:16:44,300 --> 01:16:47,960
was struggle because there's that part

01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:51,050
of me that's reading all this theory

01:16:47,960 --> 01:16:53,650
around agile is saying we're not

01:16:51,050 --> 01:16:57,530
producing production-ready software then

01:16:53,650 --> 01:16:59,600
okay ya know how do you hear let me get

01:16:57,530 --> 01:17:00,920
to that slide that has all this stuff on

01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:03,170
it do you understand what I'm saying in

01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:06,170
terms of the struggle a little bit yes

01:17:03,170 --> 01:17:09,200
so I I need to I guess my point is if we

01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:10,960
leave design to the end yeah are we

01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:14,990
still being agile in that in that case

01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:17,650
yes thanks grunkle so let's look at this

01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:19,820
so what happens is that see where

01:17:17,650 --> 01:17:22,460
development and designer four and five

01:17:19,820 --> 01:17:24,770
they're really 4a and 4b they're

01:17:22,460 --> 01:17:27,860
happening in tandem so while the

01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:30,020
engineering team goes off and builds the

01:17:27,860 --> 01:17:31,520
design team now starts designing and

01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:33,500
working with the client on design and

01:17:31,520 --> 01:17:35,870
what it's actually really helpful is a

01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:38,090
little bit of a magician's trick like

01:17:35,870 --> 01:17:39,860
you worked through all the discovery and

01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:42,050
now your engineering team is and sprints

01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:43,430
and then you show them shiny things

01:17:42,050 --> 01:17:45,440
shiny thing come over here let's look at

01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:47,120
pixels and colors now and they quit

01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:49,400
bothering you are armed engineering so

01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,900
you can build something and so it's a

01:17:49,400 --> 01:17:52,790
really good ways that you have design

01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:55,940
and development now happening in tandem

01:17:52,790 --> 01:17:59,720
and then theming happens when design and

01:17:55,940 --> 01:18:01,880
development are done so once they've

01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:03,860
approved all the designs engineering is

01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:05,180
done sometimes one happens lightly

01:18:03,860 --> 01:18:07,150
before the other but they really take

01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:10,640
about usually the same amount of time

01:18:07,150 --> 01:18:13,160
and then they accept all of the

01:18:10,640 --> 01:18:15,080
functionality and sign off on that the

01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:18,860
designs and cons are ready to go and

01:18:15,080 --> 01:18:20,600
then you theme in 12 Sprint's like

01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:24,020
there's nothing else really going on QA

01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:26,360
documentation bug fixes but your theming

01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:28,790
during that time and then the site's

01:18:26,360 --> 01:18:30,980
ready to go it's really effective so

01:18:28,790 --> 01:18:33,530
it's a little bit separating out demon

01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:35,630
from design yes yes are completely

01:18:33,530 --> 01:18:38,030
separate theming happens when everything

01:18:35,630 --> 01:18:40,340
else is done and not until then that's

01:18:38,030 --> 01:18:45,440
the magic like that's where you really

01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:46,970
have to the margins anything else you

01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:48,770
guys have been so awesome thank you for

01:18:46,970 --> 01:18:51,970
hanging out it was really fun come talk

01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:54,890
to me and don't forget about your free

01:18:51,970 --> 01:18:56,750
free account at get Pantheon calm and

01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:57,920
you can talk to him about top shelf

01:18:56,750 --> 01:19:00,220
modules if you want to know more about

01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:00,220
