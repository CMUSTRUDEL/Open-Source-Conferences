Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: DRUPAL LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT, OR HOW TO KEEP YOUR DEV SWAGGER AFTER LAUNCH
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	There are a number of emerging standards for professional Drupal development processes, but the challenge doesn't stop after the initial build. The industry discipline of "Application Lifecycle Management" (ALM) is still a frontier, and it's not as tedious or cumbersome as you might think. Done right, it's a liberation.

Realizing the full potential of Drupal means keeping your agility after launch and being able to drive ahead with additional features and fixes. Far too often, after the go-live, developers lose their ability to rock updates because the toolchain isn't in place to keep the site evolving easily and safely.

In a perfect world, all developers can continue making updates to the site design and functionality easily and seamlessly without downtime or worry. This session will cover several practical must-haves for best-class Drupal Application Lifecycle Management:

Deploying directly from version control ("push to deploy")
Running continuous integration with a Drupal site
Managing Drupal across multiple servers
Setting up and running Drush remotes
Handling core updates
Learn how to use shell scripts, git hooks, Jenkins and other free and open source tools to cover these important functions for your development team and sites.
