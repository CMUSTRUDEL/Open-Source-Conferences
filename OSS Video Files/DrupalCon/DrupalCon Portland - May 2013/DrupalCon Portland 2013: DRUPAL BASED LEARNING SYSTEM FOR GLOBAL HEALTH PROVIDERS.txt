Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: DRUPAL BASED LEARNING SYSTEM FOR GLOBAL HEALTH PROVIDERS
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	The Knowledge for Health (K4Health) Project, based at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's Center for Communication Programs, is launching a newly designed Global Health eLearning Center (GHeL) that is slated to be contributed back to the Drupal community as an install profile. The K4Health Project uses eLearning to strengthen the knowledge base of public health practitioners with the ultimate goal of increasing the use and dissemination of evidence-based, accurate and up-to-date information to improve health service delivery and health outcomes worldwide. Funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and in partnership with FunnyMonkey and Aten Design, the Drupal 7 based learning system will help take distance education in developing countries to the next level by promoting greater collaboration and knowledge sharing through this open access and open source platform.

In order to expand its features and functionality, and to ensure long-term sustainability, GHeL moved to a Drupal based content management system. This change allows more flexibility in course design, easier sharing of content, and allows the site to leverage the feedback and support of third party developers, the Drupal community. Courses within the site can be used exclusively online, or in a blended learning experience to reinforce and support training goals of other capacity building efforts. By design, the site was built to support the work of individual learners and trainers. By being a contributing member of the Drupal community, K4Health is able to expand its reach and support and share its experience developing open source solutions for the global health community.
