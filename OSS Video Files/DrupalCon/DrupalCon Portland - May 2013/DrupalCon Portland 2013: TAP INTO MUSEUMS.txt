Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: TAP INTO MUSEUMS
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	TAP is a collection of free and open-source tools which support the creation and delivery of mobile tours. The tools also serve as examples of producing and consuming tour content using the TourML specification. Currently TAP consists of authoring tools built on top of the content management system Drupal, a native iOS mobile application, and a web-based mobile application built upon the jQuery Mobile library.

Originally developed by the Indianapolis Museum of Art, TAP along with the TourML specification has been fully open sourced for use by the museum community. Currently TAP is being utilized to provide mobile tours by The Art institute of Chicago, Balboa Park, Museum of Fine Arts Boston and The Indianapolis Museum of Art amongst others.

This session will provide an overview of how we leveraged drupal to build this open source suite of tools and how it has been implemented in the museum community.
