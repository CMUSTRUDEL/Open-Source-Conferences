Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: REST AND SERIALIZATION IN DRUPAL 8
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	Drupal 8 makes it just as easy to output your content in formats like JSON and XML as it is to output HTML... even with Views! And with the new REST module in Drupal core, it's easy for external apps to use that data and to create and maintain content on your site. You may know Drupal 7 contrib modules like Services and RESTWS, now we have a much more flexible and powerful system in core.

In this session, you'll get an overview of the new REST and serialization systems, with demonstration of their configuration and use. You'll see how you can extend these tools, adding your own custom formats and REST plugins.

Throughout the talk, we'll cover key REST principles and also give tips on how to test your setup.

We will also explain how web service interfaces for entities are exposed using Drupal 8's improved Entity API. Access control, working with fields, creating, reading, updating and deleting resources will be covered in our talk.

okay we're going to get started here so

00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,269
this is the rest and serialization in

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:13,250
duple eight presentation and have to say

00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:13,250
that there's a lot of food on the side

00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:21,779
so that does have the side effect of

00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:24,029
making it somewhat difficult to read

00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,710
them from further back if you are

00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,320
interested in those details you might

00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,260
want to move closer we also have the

00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,050
slides available on github pages so if

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,329
you go to presentation the session page

00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,270
on triple dot org at the bottom you'll

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,079
see that our link to the slides

00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:42,270
unfortunately we didn't optimize the

00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,190
images and everything so it might take a

00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,129
while for them to get down to your

00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:51,390
computer but um but you can look at them

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:54,570
there when they come in so i am lynne

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,260
floor i am an independent developer I've

00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:01,859
been working on serialization issues and

00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:03,210
Drupal for the past nine months or six

00:01:01,859 --> 00:01:04,799
six nine months I've been working out

00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:07,229
people ate and before that I was working

00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:11,850
on other ways of getting data in and out

00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:15,390
of people and rupal 7 and this close I'm

00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:18,210
close I'm working for ethical or company

00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:21,479
based we're doing their coolest abuse

00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:25,290
and I really walk with services for some

00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,939
time now you might also know me from the

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,310
total that we face excuse so I drew a

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:32,540
lot of code review and helping

00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,540
onboarding new contributors

00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:43,799
so first I'm going to start with this

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,390
what is rest you know people have been

00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,570
really really excited about the fact

00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,149
that we have rest and tuefel eight but

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:54,030
i'm not sure that um everybody's on the

00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:56,280
same page as to what rest actually is so

00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,299
I want to do a little bit of just insert

00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:59,070
doctor you get everybody on the same

00:01:57,299 --> 00:02:01,289
page and then Klaus is going to go into

00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,729
how it actually works as it is right now

00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:03,899
is equally and then I'm going to come

00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:06,210
back and talk a little bit about the

00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:09,060
serialization stuff and also talk about

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:13,560
what the next steps for making it a more

00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:15,410
restful system are so I'm spurs going to

00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,299
start with some pretty dry definitions

00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:21,690
for you know it's stressful web services

00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:23,700
so wikipedia defines a web service as a

00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,980
method of communication between two

00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,100
electronic devices over the world wide

00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:31,410
web and so that's really a boring way of

00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:33,600
paying what you do every single day

00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,930
where you go on the web now say that you

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:41,400
have an iphone app and that's connected

00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:43,709
to openstreetmap and you know you send

00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,920
her a class maybe to get portland mac

00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:51,170
data or add a new road and you know open

00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:54,120
three methods is rewrite so basically

00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:57,120
the two electric devices here are the

00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,400
client on your phone and the server that

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,250
has all the data so one service is

00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,609
basically a way of telling you know

00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,709
getting the command or the operation

00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:13,620
from the client to the server and having

00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:15,420
communication between us and rest is a

00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,930
piece of architecture for doing with

00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,639
Hampton city a style of software

00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,280
architecture burn contributed system

00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:27,660
such as the World Wide Web so the guy

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,840
who came up with this concept of rest he

00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,889
was a heavily involved in a ctp

00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,510
development of the early early web

00:03:31,889 --> 00:03:38,760
standards and so he actually our email

00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:40,920
addresses a formalization of what they

00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,389
have been doing a way of describing how

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,310
the things actually work so whenever

00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:45,440
you're using

00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:48,610
why lab you're actually using a very

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:54,200
bassy at the minimal set of rest

00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:58,190
architecture so I just want to get

00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:00,650
everybody a picture of what rest in

00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:03,680
Drupal is right now so I'm going to run

00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,980
the most basic rest request I'm going to

00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,680
get a note I'm going to get it in JSON

00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:27,800
so to do that I go to a particular you

00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:32,950
are I this worked before let's so I'm

00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:36,610
going to go to a URI and i'm going to

00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:39,080
use get to actually get the node and

00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:42,470
you'll see here that i actually have a

00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,810
an acceptor I'm telling it what version

00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,370
of you know what syntax I want this note

00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:49,550
to come back in and that's it

00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:51,500
application JSON and then when I said

00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:56,240
you see it actually gives me that note

00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:59,210
at Jason so there are four components to

00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:04,100
this record request there's the base

00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:06,200
form at the HTTP verbs the URI and the

00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:09,169
media type also known as the work i'm

00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:12,289
going to go through and explain what how

00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:14,419
these all the way so these format that

00:05:12,289 --> 00:05:16,550
is just you know you're pretty familiar

00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:19,550
with big papa there's a syntax that you

00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:23,389
put data into so they fawn is one

00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:29,419
example of a base for matt and xml is

00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:31,160
another version and there are your eyes

00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:33,560
when you're working with a ref service

00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:38,300
of your working with a set of you our

00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:41,260
eyes so you are eyes and be your eyes

00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:44,090
for resource for example we have

00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:45,980
entities last note / one

00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:50,060
see you all right that you interact with

00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:51,770
to work on top on a resource and Drupal

00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,880
we're actually hoping to change it so

00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:55,220
that you don't actually have to have

00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,130
entity in the past that something that

00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:02,810
we would like to have happen and we'll

00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:04,460
see if that gets in and you can also

00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:06,229
have your eyes for what are called mini

00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,440
relations so the resource you know

00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:11,300
that's what you're interacting with the

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,650
Luke relation is somewhat different I'm

00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,220
actually going to talk more about link

00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:19,580
relations later in the presentation so I

00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:23,060
will just leave your background so an

00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:27,139
example of what you know using your eyes

00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:29,830
and not using your eyes look like is as

00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:32,180
well as if you work at work with n

00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:36,080
points before where you just actually

00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:38,210
like send something in JSON or XML that

00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,800
gives all of the information about you

00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:41,330
know what the identifier for the thing

00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,940
is that you want to interact with and

00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:46,639
what the operation you want to have what

00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:51,500
you want to do on that thing is that is

00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:53,360
not restful instead you actually want to

00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,400
have a URI that represents the thing

00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:01,880
that you're interacting what you don't

00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:04,250
want it tunnel everything through so

00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:06,020
media type people often get the media

00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,450
type confused with the base formats but

00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:11,180
I think Jade long as a media type which

00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:14,330
it is application JSON is a media type

00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,490
but you can also have more specific

00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:19,099
media types for example one that we're

00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:23,510
using in Drupal and the Hound module is

00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:26,000
application how plus jigsaw and what

00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,650
that media type does is it gives a

00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,500
little bit more information about what

00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:34,490
the consumer can expect too far in the

00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:38,150
response so if al a consumer can expect

00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:39,979
to find links or embedded you know those

00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,900
are reserved keywords and the consumer

00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:49,520
knows what to do with the data that is

00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:52,000
but those key words though you can also

00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:57,080
provide patio I'll is actually a

00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,840
standardized media type it's an ietf

00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:02,810
draft but you can also have vendor

00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,630
specific media types so different have

00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:08,840
their only and they have their own rules

00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:11,000
for what consumers can expect when they

00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,510
receive on something that's application

00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,420
then github be fun they say that all

00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,950
resources may have one or more

00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:22,990
underscore URL properties linking to

00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:25,760
other resources so that's basically

00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:28,160
providing the same functionality as what

00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:33,160
how is doing but in a way that's very

00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:37,700
specific ticket and so an example that

00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:39,380
this is something I love cotton a

00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,690
depressed people will actually say you

00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:44,330
should do where you actually have the

00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,950
file format now so you have dot gaze on

00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:49,790
and that's the way you switch the cumin

00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:51,620
HTML and JSON version but it gets a

00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:54,980
little bit software you have media sites

00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:56,480
like tackle because you know you're

00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:00,050
basically creating your own pilots there

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:04,640
and that gets a little confusing so

00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:07,850
instead the best thing in my opinions do

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:11,990
is use the exact header and actually

00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:15,010
specify explicitly which media site you

00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:21,920
are expecting and in a Facebook post

00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:24,950
which you are something so HTTP methods

00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:28,400
these are how you specify which

00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:33,380
operation you want to have done to the

00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:35,540
listing on the server yes means go fetch

00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:38,000
this page or the three source and bring

00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,650
it back to you don't take it a lot of

00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,510
people who want to get in a way where

00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,920
they actually you can change things

00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:46,810
using yet but that's not a very good

00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:50,279
thing to do get should not change this

00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,629
post and our application works

00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:54,379
thank you saying here's some data go

00:09:51,629 --> 00:09:57,120
making thing for me Coast doesn't have

00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:58,740
strict rules so you can't actually use

00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:03,149
in other ways but a lot of people use it

00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:06,269
basically for the create operation we

00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:08,370
are using French instead of foot and act

00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:12,209
as basically waiting here at some change

00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:14,779
feels go update on the existing thing so

00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:16,980
this is your update functionality and

00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:20,129
then there's delete which basically

00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,899
means get rid of that thing and so an

00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:25,079
example of doing this wrong would be

00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:27,629
actually put are not wrestling would be

00:10:25,079 --> 00:10:33,059
to put the operation directly in your

00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:35,519
you are so instead of that you actually

00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:37,559
use the Asian fever to the ancient you

00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:42,959
connect it say what you want to have

00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:45,990
done so let's look back at that request

00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:47,670
that I did and see how these all come

00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:51,059
into play so we have our bait format

00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:55,199
which is Jail on the URI which is

00:10:51,059 --> 00:10:59,250
actually node 1 these TP method which is

00:10:55,199 --> 00:11:05,550
gaps and the media type which is

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:08,220
application / do now if I change of UT

00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:11,699
things for example i change the uri two

00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,139
entities lymph node method post and the

00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:22,709
media type let's take a look at what

00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:25,709
that so here's the uri i'm tanking HTTP

00:11:22,709 --> 00:11:27,750
method and here you see I'm using

00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:30,300
quantum tape instead of except for my

00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:33,000
cutter on having application palace JSON

00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:35,850
and now when i send it you'll see that i

00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,309
actually created a node all my site the

00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:41,670
tool one created that's a status message

00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:43,170
a status code and that tells me the

00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:45,660
highway success well i could have gotten

00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,370
other things like a 500 error or other

00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,779
kinds of status messages but since i got

00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,779
it to a one I know it's been created

00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:59,460
and I should also mention that it's what

00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:01,800
i'm showing you here this is an HTTP

00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:04,260
client it's one for chrome isn't it

00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:06,480
center for cone called def HTTP client

00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,370
but you can actually you can get

00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,070
different browser extensions you can all

00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:15,500
things pearl and you can also use HTTP

00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:15,500
directly from the code in your closet so

00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:23,910
now i want to take a look at how this

00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:26,190
all fits into restfulness camp there's a

00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:27,450
really good model for talking about a

00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:31,110
restful something as it's called the

00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:33,030
richardson maturity model and this is a

00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,320
guy named martin fowler we meet her

00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,980
before he actually wrote about a long

00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:40,650
slog to this this image is from his blog

00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:42,660
but level 0 that's basically when you

00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:45,630
are not doing anything roughly all

00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:48,900
called the swamp basically when you're

00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:51,510
sending XML messages that contain the

00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:54,110
operation the identifier everything that

00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:57,080
you need and you send an extranet point

00:12:54,110 --> 00:13:01,530
if you're totally back to your network

00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:02,670
so that is level variable level one is

00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,230
actually when you start using those

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,600
resources when you start using those

00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:08,100
your eyes to interact with things so

00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,870
instead of sending the identifier as

00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,600
part of the body you actually want to

00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:16,860
you are I like things last three which

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:20,760
is corresponding to your third thing and

00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:22,710
we actually we have that in place like I

00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,860
said when I change you are a little bit

00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:30,300
but that's pretty much inflated level

00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:32,910
two is the HTTP verbs so let's get patch

00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:34,140
close we have that pretty much replace

00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:37,460
there are few bugs that we need to

00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:39,780
resolve but that's pretty much in place

00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:41,550
level 3 that's where we start getting

00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:44,360
through the things that we haven't fully

00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:47,630
designed yet

00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,279
and I'm actually negative result asleep

00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,470
at the hypermedia controls I'll explain

00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,420
later but right now Klaus is going to

00:13:51,470 --> 00:14:00,170
show you everything that we do have a

00:13:53,420 --> 00:14:03,680
more right now and how to use it so

00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:05,800
before I get into details found we are

00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:09,920
taking questions while with our tester

00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:11,959
hashtag craft I think it was not a good

00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,810
idea because other people are tweeting

00:14:11,959 --> 00:14:16,670
weird stuff about the rest so but

00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:20,630
nevermind use it anyway if you have any

00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:25,250
questions yeah yeah combined it with

00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:27,019
will put on that might help so I'm going

00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:29,089
to talk a little bit about Howard rest

00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:32,450
is now implemented in Drupal and how we

00:14:29,089 --> 00:14:35,620
use those standards so what we did in

00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:38,420
Drupal aim is to model that is a server

00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,370
so we are not talking about clients back

00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,680
to people talking to other sites but

00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:45,800
Google itself and serving stuff out and

00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,540
excitement back and to put that into

00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,250
perspective and we have to think about

00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:52,370
what we are actually trying to

00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:54,620
accomplish here and we want to get stuff

00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:58,130
programmatically into and out of two

00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:00,199
more because we humans humans just

00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:02,329
browser page without browser and we are

00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:05,060
able to detect what title is on that

00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:06,500
page but computers are done they don't

00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,329
know where to look for the time of an

00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:12,110
offensive we have to tell them how to

00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:15,079
data is Stratford and so we need formats

00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:17,510
and need to specify how how data is

00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:19,640
represented in order to make it machine

00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:24,050
readable that's the King readable form

00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:26,709
of life changing for example or XML

00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:31,670
so as a pet rupal acts as a temp service

00:15:26,709 --> 00:15:33,230
interface provided there are a couple of

00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:35,570
use cases that we've been common with

00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:37,760
back I will have a pole here because

00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:39,380
it's the very obvious reason everybody

00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,269
is talking about where you have your

00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,399
native applications and you want to talk

00:15:41,269 --> 00:15:45,769
to the back end which can be written for

00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:47,329
installation so your phone app is

00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:49,880
setting those requests of getting Dave

00:15:47,329 --> 00:15:51,920
and posting data back but of course

00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,180
there might not be on-site JavaScript

00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:57,500
that wants to interact with your

00:15:53,180 --> 00:16:00,910
back-end that this case and Griffin 33

00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:04,000
years just having a single page and then

00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:06,410
everything changes binary turn the page

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,990
sending requests back to the weapons you

00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:12,079
can do that the possible to be done with

00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:14,870
the rest module or you can use it for

00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:17,300
migrating deploying staff getting

00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,399
stuffed into people so for example you

00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,200
set up your station one to station site

00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,950
we must don't want to mess around in our

00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:26,630
lifestyle 12 perfectly clear that note

00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:28,339
for example is dating site and of course

00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,899
you don't want to repeat those steps on

00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:31,700
the production side again to win the

00:16:29,899 --> 00:16:35,180
Miss Bayside put it over to third party

00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:36,649
seller gets one useless and of course a

00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:38,870
lot of people want to build to hair wet

00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:42,589
in the ice so that clients connects the

00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:44,810
data and the rest of the group 08 is

00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:48,440
supposed to use this private or public

00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:50,329
API for example to buy with neither and

00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,430
from the legacy system we do both

00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:57,190
because have access and can use the

00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:57,190
migrant module so restful is repetition

00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,930
to get a little bit of historic content

00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:05,179
what do we have in people seven right

00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,339
now the most famous example is the

00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:11,900
services module you can do a lot with

00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:14,720
bad as if it has evolved from an RPC

00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:17,270
server actually and what was supposed to

00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,520
review this assumes all right so it's

00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:22,160
not really in conformance with raspa

00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,290
yeah people use it a lot and there's the

00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,930
causes of of my skin in services which

00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:30,360
means you can specify at work what you

00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:32,130
are eyes family your reasons are going

00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,440
to agree things are going to appear

00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:37,170
which might conflict with I'm actually

00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,870
hypermedia controls we will be talking

00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:43,140
about it's going to profit later and it

00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,880
also uses a balloon it is hard for equal

00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,590
nodes and commencing reverse so there's

00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,400
no arbitrator support for arbitrary

00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:52,590
entities and if after a nasty start when

00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,380
submitting forms automatically because

00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:57,360
from the API into the stake center / 7

00:17:55,380 --> 00:18:01,350
wasn't ready yet m to be used

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:03,450
generically for a service provider yeah

00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:07,850
and it has exercies authentication work

00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:07,850
so many requests exam a modification

00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:15,600
then what I did was the rest of us

00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:18,720
module are in purple seven because I

00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,540
want to have something different use the

00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:23,730
API which is to very few of your arm it

00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:26,430
gives you all sort of metadata about any

00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:27,870
entity type in your in your system so

00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:31,080
with West Papua sinclair's expose

00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:34,650
basically any instance we have 47 and

00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:39,030
can do operations on it bites and more

00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:41,220
notes yeah it's the perfect of modern

00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:42,780
lupus ever because we have a couple of

00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,790
problems with page caching because the

00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,260
page has only works on the giver I and

00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,540
when you have we're cool as the only

00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,580
book that you also want on once work on

00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,890
other HTTP headers for example etcetera

00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:55,410
ones that matter so we're cup of course

00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:57,240
look back it does even a hybrid module

00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:59,580
that uses some photos from Westphalia

00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:02,190
services hej guide which is very

00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:04,020
interesting with mouse brain span the

00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:06,390
full power of dense KP I brought you

00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:11,820
with any entity to the service module I

00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:13,860
think it's a very inclusive approach now

00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:16,380
looking at through 28 what we have there

00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:19,170
are basically three modules the rest

00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:22,290
vectors module that is us a module and

00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:24,810
the cowl module the first one and had

00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:27,000
with the requests and the responses and

00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:29,970
the second one is Eric civilization love

00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,860
you and Vince forms those objects those

00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,890
for example if re google to live in a

00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:35,920
database that we

00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:37,870
old down to justice three everyone's

00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,790
doing probably and that is what is

00:19:37,870 --> 00:19:43,690
shipped with the HTTP response that is

00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:45,970
delivered our module army provides

00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:49,690
special formats will be settled on that

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:52,060
for to the latest our platform at orphan

00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:55,770
on economic reform at as you guys ever

00:19:52,060 --> 00:20:02,460
video controls it is based on chase them

00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:04,930
that modeling module defect I'm sorry

00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:10,570
have a text application language is

00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:13,840
there so we have a cup of resources well

00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:16,150
replay that we have operations and we

00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,520
align them in that way and shall clear

00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,320
the table and of course in resources

00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,200
opting to the interest and that

00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,940
perfectly fits our our entity model

00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,740
because entities are also object of the

00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:30,730
investigates both and sweet sauces that

00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:33,130
is a lot it is that we do and what we

00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:37,240
here define an operational base an

00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:39,370
action that we do or that we use to

00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,200
manipulate the resource this in this

00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:42,790
case I just want to leave something okay

00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,350
I'd reviews I get requests to that

00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:47,050
specific clothes and then i get rid the

00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:49,600
sensation with that so we have the full

00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:52,690
coverage all our shuttle operations wave

00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,730
we update that we need and we mapped

00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:58,000
them to be their corresponding HTTP

00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:59,830
methods both gasp hasn't elite and we

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,590
also kept them to a specific path as

00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:04,930
slim already said there's still the

00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:07,360
empty prefixes if your eyes as you can

00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:09,040
see here maybe we can remove that's the

00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,370
only before eight but for navigating

00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:14,970
that padlock conflict with any HTML view

00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:17,890
percentage that live at / looks like one

00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:19,900
we are currently working on your iPad

00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:25,200
roles for MC so that we can be more

00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:28,390
flexible there so what we do in the

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,430
reflector is module is to expose

00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:32,340
entities of resources as bad as we use

00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:35,020
the plug-in system for that

00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:37,000
to expose then we use that you educate

00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,309
guys that we basically just have one

00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,830
planet that serves all engines attached

00:21:39,309 --> 00:21:44,020
to them all NT two types of war and

00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:47,080
possibly our entity types that are added

00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:49,650
by rubicon to mortals example commerce

00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:53,440
product ID for private message x cheese

00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:57,100
and we have metadata about that we know

00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,110
which feeds our own identity so when a

00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:01,630
new entity is powerful i can inspect

00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:05,650
here I know that field i can say that

00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:07,690
and we also made it configurable so you

00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:10,480
can decide which entity or decide you

00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,370
want to expose and which entities you

00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,679
want to leave alone because you might

00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:16,929
not want to export five messages because

00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:21,040
they are an internal thing for public

00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:22,809
raising a guy just lived up to it and we

00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,640
also have access to all the negative end

00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:28,419
on the field level of course so when

00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:30,610
you're trying to request the dog and you

00:22:28,419 --> 00:22:32,380
were supposed to see a view for example

00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:35,110
that it is automatically given that is

00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:37,000
all driven by the usual entity infused

00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:40,809
exists put on the can assume we have

00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,280
occurred until now you might ask and

00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:44,650
what about authentication authorization

00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:47,190
who is allowed to do what who's allowed

00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:50,200
to week something was allowed to

00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:52,840
manipulate something and authentication

00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:56,260
which they also is not my rest module

00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,270
itself unfortunately we don't have any

00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:00,640
additional authentication mechanisms in

00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:02,500
call right now only the usual a section

00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:04,510
to the occupation which is a bit clumsy

00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,450
to use from unity either it's of you i

00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:10,720
will show you the flavor and access

00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:13,450
control is fully dribble by the user

00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:18,910
object to force all the conditions can

00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:20,470
apply and exhaust system is this is done

00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:23,440
around that so we are using that here as

00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:26,080
well and there's an extra dose of

00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,150
permission to access an HD already api

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,450
so there is and it is no safety net

00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:38,400
before you expose anything

00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:40,650
out your it disappears so what would

00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,210
like to do now is a little bit of the

00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:44,820
most gracious of the wheel demonstration

00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:48,510
but I've I pulled up my coat and caused

00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:50,580
by then we use of the API and the first

00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,920
thing it will of course is you need to

00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:54,810
have super 80s later I put up some

00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:57,030
graphic amount here because I use them a

00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:59,070
lot it's very handy so that would be the

00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:01,200
dash a command to install yahoo / 8 side

00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:03,810
where a user account and password then

00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,720
it across the serialization module and

00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:08,550
the reflectors of model I think the

00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,840
arrest has the dependency 20 station

00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:14,580
swivel away without any way and yeah we

00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:18,470
want to go to hell so you also enabled

00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:21,930
on the stand of start nursing fans gear

00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:24,030
then we let's say 12 work with the note

00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:27,510
resource we want to read notes how do we

00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:30,300
can figure that in google 8 we use gamma

00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:33,570
file to to figure stuff so there's a red

00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:36,900
flop settings of piano file and we copy

00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:38,640
that from the active public directory to

00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,340
the station coffee territory so that's

00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,470
part of the sea lion icity where you

00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:47,730
plan I change your configuration very

00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:49,500
important bacteria also found out which

00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:52,680
are copied over so there's this one

00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:54,420
configuration app in your files

00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:57,420
directory you will find you are there

00:24:54,420 --> 00:25:00,600
copy it over then you add it here and

00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:03,180
now we want to specify what you want to

00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,560
expose so that is the ammo you might

00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:06,540
have seen it before it's very simple

00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:09,090
formats it works love with in irritation

00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:11,400
so the first line resources here and

00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:13,350
defines late array of breeze once that

00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:16,320
is enabled in this case which has been

00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:18,930
able it for notes so entity column node

00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,390
is the event prairie fire of the note

00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:23,100
plug into its most likely source and we

00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:25,500
only want to allow get requests so we

00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,060
write down get there if you only want to

00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:28,440
allow one format which is how in this

00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,310
case

00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,990
basically a structure you can do it

00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:35,790
father etiquette types it can enable

00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:38,470
other requests methods and other formats

00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:40,000
then we put the configuration because we

00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:42,130
edited in the staging directory now we

00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,860
want to make it active you can do little

00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:46,960
bit for us even I I was very surprised

00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:49,870
that it actually works with flash

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,270
already but can also do it today a

00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:54,340
Drupal 8 eff course and then we need to

00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:56,980
clear cache is so because the flagging

00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:58,540
stick post new routes we need to know

00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:01,540
where evil Eric let's go to be educated

00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:03,100
guesses so that rather read it you can

00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:07,420
also put up with rush will also work

00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:09,940
will play a I need to configure

00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:13,270
conditions who is able to reach that log

00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:16,630
now that we can figure and you just have

00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:18,160
to at what we do here is a definition to

00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,900
the ananda controls because we want

00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,060
anonymous users to reach the notes now

00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:23,620
and there is a commission that we can

00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:27,010
offer you have reversed but within the

00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:29,980
rocks a DUI and protecting we need to

00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:32,890
create an example node and we want to

00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:35,050
get so i played around a bit with the

00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:37,540
devil module and this it has in fact I

00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:39,610
sleeper of generating content with God

00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:41,590
so that also works if you also what you

00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:44,680
of course you can ultimately right just

00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:48,070
creating a basic page there yeah we can

00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:49,930
catch them so what avoids would be

00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:52,630
unjust let's get from the command line

00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:55,810
because their rules on unix-like system

00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:57,550
like curl on w get I am sending a

00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:00,370
request the important thing here is to

00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:02,230
specify the exact error because you

00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:04,990
don't want to get actual HTML you want

00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:08,980
to get the hell format so base if I that

00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:10,180
I'm after you is important now the axis

00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:12,430
of thing that you want to get in this

00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:14,290
case it's just not one and it's

00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:16,480
basically it but you can of course also

00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:18,880
good of HP so you are developing some

00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,250
PHP application and you can do it with

00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,810
very primitive curl as you see here just

00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:25,420
set the clock Constance to the your I

00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:30,250
the exact error and you get the chasing

00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:33,440
back Dakota and that's basically what

00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:35,389
even nicer is to use capo it's an HP

00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:38,299
it's library it's what part of to the

00:27:35,389 --> 00:27:41,990
corner and we just create a client there

00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:43,309
it's a very nice object-oriented ABI put

00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:46,639
in there you are I and the exact error

00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:48,200
such as well and deluded and before

00:27:46,639 --> 00:27:50,240
handle in the end before the send

00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,820
methods and the request is actually made

00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,970
love before and then you decode that

00:27:52,820 --> 00:28:01,070
well Jason and you have your note array

00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:02,870
again and that looks like this so we

00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:06,169
have a link section in calc I think

00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:08,179
cleanest getting back to that later that

00:28:06,169 --> 00:28:10,789
reverse and what it is and where it can

00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:12,950
be found that thing note 1 in our case

00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:14,720
and then it lists all the properties of

00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:18,049
the flow of the world for executive

00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,029
already and for example also are obvious

00:28:18,049 --> 00:28:22,269
the body pillow fights hamper wits with

00:28:20,029 --> 00:28:24,470
the one value and costly the format

00:28:22,269 --> 00:28:32,059
unless that's all you have to do in

00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:33,529
Google a to get node and because you not

00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:36,769
only want to interact with single

00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:39,080
resources you also want to have retrieve

00:28:36,769 --> 00:28:40,820
all collections if they do it in Google

00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:42,740
eight now it's used because it's a

00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:44,659
logical step to do we already have it

00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,789
we're rebuilding pork we don't want

00:28:44,659 --> 00:28:48,289
through will do anything see if the two

00:28:46,789 --> 00:28:51,139
queries love ourselves so we just

00:28:48,289 --> 00:28:53,029
leverage and use from that you have a

00:28:51,139 --> 00:28:55,789
special difficult buggin and that you

00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:58,539
can configure add that will then expose

00:28:55,789 --> 00:29:01,730
their pillows that use with reefers as

00:28:58,539 --> 00:29:04,100
chasing or power or exit out what

00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:06,740
everyone it's very similar or comparable

00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:09,620
to diffuse data source module in 47 so

00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:13,340
if you have used that deal it might be

00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:15,440
very similar familiar for you and you

00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,059
can either output of all entity the

00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,970
whole dog which has spoken a collection

00:29:17,059 --> 00:29:23,240
of logs which could get a little a

00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:26,080
little bit big so you can also check out

00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,080
put individuals

00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:32,409
thank you support but of course you

00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:34,299
hassle 12 rights group or just reading

00:29:32,409 --> 00:29:36,460
stuff might be enough for some API that

00:29:34,299 --> 00:29:38,770
one trip or something now let's look

00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,990
into how you can actually write a new

00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:42,880
mode to google and during this period

00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:45,039
post request but it's very similar to

00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:50,440
for Pat requested want to update

00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:53,740
something for that in order to be able

00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:56,049
to do that we have to and those who the

00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:57,429
same steps as before copy there and SAT

00:29:56,049 --> 00:30:00,400
excited to the state in directory

00:29:57,429 --> 00:30:02,710
because we can and preparing their and

00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:04,539
national spokesman the meantime so don't

00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:07,960
edit stuff linear axis configuration

00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:09,220
directory always copied to the station

00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:12,669
that are three and it went from there

00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:14,530
because solemnized we just have them

00:30:12,669 --> 00:30:18,370
post operation there and of the format

00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:20,370
and which we want to bolster and the

00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:22,570
next thing we have to do is also a

00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:25,270
particular commissions with allowed

00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:27,640
ourselves we might not want to give that

00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:31,299
weight whether anonymous user role so we

00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:33,190
get the tools and trusted low here yeah

00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:35,049
then repeat the steps from the core

00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:39,220
people to configuration to the character

00:30:35,049 --> 00:30:41,140
which would be ready to go yeah now it

00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:43,890
gets me pumped yet because left to do it

00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:46,179
with to Karen page which is not nice but

00:30:43,890 --> 00:30:48,880
casual actually makes it makes it pretty

00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:53,740
nice so you just have array cookie jar

00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:57,220
here that will hold your cookie and you

00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:59,049
have a subscriber to apply and then you

00:30:57,220 --> 00:31:02,230
trust them send the post regret so they

00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:04,510
use a lot important the responses that

00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:06,909
request will carry a cookie and your

00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:09,909
client will catch that for you and the

00:31:06,909 --> 00:31:12,390
request that you said next will carry

00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:16,690
that hook alarm so you will be educated

00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:18,760
pretty straightforward nvm with custom

00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:20,260
plates to specifying a name your

00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:21,940
password and the quality you want to

00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:24,480
post the widget will use a lock in court

00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:28,330
they should people together

00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:30,580
here the next thing you have to do is

00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:32,860
because we are posting things and we're

00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:35,140
doing the recession cookies are we have

00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:38,710
to do some CSI protection because

00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:40,840
otherwise they are there are classic

00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:42,760
plugins and other weaknesses in browsers

00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,040
that could be exploited back so we have

00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:46,780
to get an extra hour session token' our

00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:48,310
client is equipped with a certain

00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:50,950
cooking so it has to read back the

00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:52,660
special page to get the total and then

00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:55,060
we just filled up or not but what i'm

00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:57,820
doing here is test i'm setting the title

00:31:55,060 --> 00:32:00,250
field and i have to configure the type

00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:02,890
that i want to create this case it's the

00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:05,310
basic page and contemplate that we have

00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:09,460
in the span of insulation over the plate

00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:12,490
Jason code that whole array and then

00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:14,140
perform a post request also have to

00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:16,390
space hyphen in that because the boots

00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:19,170
to know what format it being you and I

00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:22,180
have specified I'm sorry I've spoken

00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:26,290
yeah i'm going to go telling them the

00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:28,270
request will get back at 201 it all went

00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:30,490
well and rupal exactly the load or we'll

00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:33,070
get some others there are steps both

00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:37,150
from HTTP by set foot for free with the

00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:40,480
access denied or I don't know probably

00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:43,060
400 if I did the format wrong and if i

00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,650
permitted to put it something wrong you

00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:48,850
get it is just the basic HTTP standards

00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:50,980
how does the power play together in the

00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:54,310
next module itself so let's take a look

00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:55,720
inside haha were tired so we have with

00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:58,210
your plugins to use the black assistant

00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:00,010
because we want to make those components

00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:02,470
that are responsible for the league

00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:04,840
stuff the products are swappable and we

00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:07,330
want to make them configure wall family

00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:09,520
we want to make easy so that people can

00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:12,070
add additional visas plugins in Drupal 8

00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:14,410
15 and the most important thing that was

00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:16,600
plugins do they set rates and serious

00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:19,330
hiv-1 height and pay the handling on the

00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:23,140
other side and the plugins only have the

00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:25,060
data and only angle actually exploring

00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,950
loading data they are not at all

00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:29,610
concerned about your disease that is to

00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:32,320
be the separate and that allows you to

00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:35,320
quickly configure your formats or to

00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:38,680
attack the formats for your particular

00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:40,180
research that you want to expose be

00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,640
confused by dragging there are only

00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:44,950
classes basically interests exact with

00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,700
with some acts on them and that's all

00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:52,380
Atlanta using google aid and what we do

00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:55,480
is on that recent plug-in you have and

00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:57,430
methods that are name exactly as the

00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,200
HTTP methods the voice actively they

00:33:57,430 --> 00:34:00,910
have a get method there if we can get

00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,920
requests they will post never there

00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:06,280
remember your post request actually

00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:08,020
short for Patrick preferences and yeah

00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:10,300
what we're doing worries we have one

00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:12,700
entity they are trying to rule them all

00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:15,430
and which forces and derivatives for

00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:17,800
each entity type poetics let the future

00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:19,380
of like balances which is where cat and

00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,670
I suspect you to the plotters can

00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:26,800
look into the air and multi-platform

00:34:21,670 --> 00:34:28,600
right waistline so there's also a short

00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,270
attempting to play for which I am

00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:34,510
chatting poses what's the blog entries

00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:36,760
and as a resource and if I can form a

00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:38,560
get request to move / eb large which one

00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:40,210
I need to configure that before from

00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,980
same as we're there for notes and I need

00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:44,170
to assign the permissions to access that

00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:46,320
we first so let's back the very same and

00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:49,480
that is what's the plugin look like so

00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,810
as you can see we use annotations in the

00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:55,270
parade and the ad gladium and tells the

00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:57,340
the plugin system hey this isn't an

00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:59,410
actual fighting and you have to place

00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:02,080
the file in a special folder in your

00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:05,260
country module and that plugin has an ID

00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:07,420
and leaves extends a reason based task

00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:10,510
which is just the help of two gets the

00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:12,130
routes definitions and other staff you

00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:13,960
don't have to respect from that you can

00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:16,080
also buy right there on your own and

00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:19,060
override them the route for example and

00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,440
the Saudi Aggie gets passed in what we

00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:23,080
are doing here which is loading the wash

00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,670
but n 38 x that I give we first group

00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:27,870
from the database and then we film it

00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:30,220
and if you look closer you can see and

00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:33,670
when you perform the cat request it

00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:37,490
relates to the microplane ssl

00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:39,650
the plugin ID translates in Kunda out so

00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:41,269
they're your iPad like this is no data

00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:43,130
it doesn't have to be like that is just

00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:46,640
the default case where we just take the

00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:50,180
plugin aegean stick it up but you can

00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:52,009
play it right and here at the end is the

00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:53,809
reason that we are referring to that get

00:35:52,009 --> 00:35:58,039
back in so that we know which they voted

00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:59,569
out and which am NT to injure and after

00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:02,329
the response looks like a cow for

00:35:59,569 --> 00:36:04,670
example well how might not be

00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:06,920
appropriately because basically chasing

00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:09,200
because that example just returns an

00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:11,660
array and so it first whether it's too

00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,460
varied am chasing if you want to do more

00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:15,920
fancy things you might want to use i'm

00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:19,009
actually class object and then write

00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:21,529
your special see realizes for that so

00:36:19,009 --> 00:36:25,059
that you can have organized those format

00:36:21,529 --> 00:36:28,130
actor make it look more appealing and

00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:30,650
out of the box you also get that get

00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:32,779
that as xml so what again it has roped

00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:38,329
the rhesus plug it in together Chase's

00:36:32,779 --> 00:36:39,890
aboard the XM have support for p against

00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:42,230
that's it yeah I have another picture

00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:44,119
here of how that pipeline words are

00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:46,009
correct module so we have the incoming

00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:47,599
requests that is the dispatch final

00:36:46,009 --> 00:36:49,910
rating system to their request handler

00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,200
which is part of the module and see

00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:54,890
realize there is an excellent program

00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:57,230
and what it does is just if there is an

00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:59,480
account of only requests oh yeah i know

00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:01,430
i have to be civilized that so i put it

00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:03,710
in pipeline and whatever comes up there

00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:05,690
have high sounds the dragon and whatever

00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:08,599
the planning returns i say the truth

00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:11,329
serialize done and then let's get in

00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:15,380
their gifts and respond to little time

00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:16,910
and research plugins only now we

00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,769
responsibility is to talk to the

00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:22,089
database or in the dispatch week

00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:22,089
whatever they have to do

00:37:23,499 --> 00:37:32,179
excellent for civilization okay so also

00:37:29,779 --> 00:37:33,709
showing you all this JSON and XML and i

00:37:32,179 --> 00:37:38,809
want to show you how you actually get

00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:41,299
your data into so we currently have

00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:43,399
three formats and four we have Jason we

00:37:41,299 --> 00:37:45,109
have X Pennell kinda sorta it's

00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:48,589
basically just a film with angle

00:37:45,109 --> 00:37:51,169
brackets we don't actually do name

00:37:48,589 --> 00:37:53,929
spacing or attributes so if you actually

00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:56,839
want real XML I would suggest not using

00:37:53,929 --> 00:37:57,829
this one but I will explain a little bit

00:37:56,839 --> 00:38:00,079
about how you can write your own

00:37:57,829 --> 00:38:03,199
serialism can normalize errs and

00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,659
encoders really easily and then there's

00:38:03,199 --> 00:38:07,640
the hypertext application language which

00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:11,239
is our hydro media format you want with

00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:14,539
one that supports linking doing hydro

00:38:11,239 --> 00:38:18,009
media and inked on but it also has an

00:38:14,539 --> 00:38:20,659
XML variance if you want to use that you

00:38:18,009 --> 00:38:24,140
but we depended on the symphony

00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:26,319
serializer component I actually really

00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:29,689
like the way that they approach this

00:38:26,319 --> 00:38:31,189
basically what you do if you want to use

00:38:29,689 --> 00:38:33,259
serializer which you don't have to use

00:38:31,189 --> 00:38:35,059
rex dt réaliser to realize it was

00:38:33,259 --> 00:38:37,609
completely independent if you want to

00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:39,380
use serializer all you have to do is get

00:38:37,609 --> 00:38:41,419
it from the container and then called

00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:43,909
serialize and passing your objects in

00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:47,839
the corner and it off so you can happen

00:38:43,909 --> 00:38:51,339
some stuff in context but um what it

00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:54,979
does is it seeks an object for example

00:38:51,339 --> 00:38:56,809
locate the note and it passes it through

00:38:54,979 --> 00:39:00,309
a series of what are called normalizer

00:38:56,809 --> 00:39:04,069
to take that nodes object structure and

00:39:00,309 --> 00:39:05,359
translate it into an eraser and now the

00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:08,569
rage structure can be different for

00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:12,499
different formats and then being cold

00:39:08,569 --> 00:39:15,139
step takes it from the arrange structure

00:39:12,499 --> 00:39:16,939
into the string so in JSON you it adds

00:39:15,139 --> 00:39:19,069
the curly braces and all that kind of

00:39:16,939 --> 00:39:23,899
stuff or an XML would I be angle

00:39:19,069 --> 00:39:27,409
brackets and so the way this works it

00:39:23,899 --> 00:39:29,710
gives you fine grained control over how

00:39:27,409 --> 00:39:31,730
your resource is actually

00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:33,530
so let's say that we have a note here

00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:35,870
and it has a text field and it types

00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:37,490
long field and image field and I

00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:42,140
palomita reference basically I'm

00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:44,120
describing in the purple and in your in

00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:46,460
your dates on you have field image and

00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,980
let's say that it's actually giving you

00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:51,020
the file ID instead of you know whatever

00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:54,080
you actually want to have is the date of

00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:58,580
your heels in it you know you might

00:39:54,080 --> 00:40:01,310
actually want to have the URI of the dms

00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:05,480
model itself you can write what's called

00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:08,060
a normalizer just change that and the

00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:10,370
rest of the pipeline is exactly the same

00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:13,610
you're just one or two lines of code and

00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:15,800
inside of a glass and so the way that

00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:17,990
this works is there's what's called a

00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:20,720
team of responsibility for your

00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:23,180
normalizer so we have the entity

00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:25,550
reference item normalizer the field I

00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:27,020
and normalizer the field normalizer an

00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:31,850
empty normalizer these are the

00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:33,200
normalizer zat how provides and you'll

00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:34,760
notice that they're getting they're

00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:39,470
going from more specific or less

00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:44,870
specific from more granular to larger

00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:46,310
grains and what happens in serializer it

00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:49,820
actually goes through when a handsome

00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:51,980
theta it goes through and it are asks

00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:55,150
you know do you support normalization

00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:58,340
for this object and in this format and

00:40:55,150 --> 00:41:00,740
within your normalizer you can say you

00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,690
have my support and he reference item

00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:05,210
fields or no i could not support any

00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:07,010
reference item fields and so in this

00:41:05,210 --> 00:41:09,860
case because we're working with an image

00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:11,780
feel it would say no I don't support

00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:15,260
that then we get to the field item

00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:17,810
normalizer and image built the image

00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:20,300
item actually extends he'll died on base

00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:22,480
so it would actually be supported by the

00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:24,840
field

00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,600
so let's say that you do want to

00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:30,010
override how the image field is output

00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:33,430
you just add a normalizer at the top of

00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:36,700
the Train and then when it calls the

00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:39,520
force normalization that normalize will

00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:40,990
be chosen as the one to use so that's

00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,700
the nice thing it gives you that really

00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:45,850
fine grained control without having to

00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:47,290
change too much override too much all

00:41:45,850 --> 00:41:49,300
you have to do is add your normalizer

00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:54,250
same thing for encoders and coders are a

00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:56,530
little bit simpler but that is the key

00:41:54,250 --> 00:42:01,360
never quantity that gives us such fun

00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:04,090
control so I weren't thinking about

00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:06,160
talking more about serialization but you

00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:07,780
know I'm thinking and might actually be

00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,940
better if anyone here once to write a

00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:12,010
serialization just come talk to me I'll

00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:15,250
be here for the next three days I've

00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:17,740
been happy to walk you through the rest

00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:20,740
of that pretty much that gives you

00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:23,530
pretty far but if you actually want to

00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:27,520
get hands-on on Bobby Walker so what's

00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:30,340
next as I said there's this maturity

00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:32,950
model and Roy fielding has made pretty

00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:35,770
clear that the royce building is a guy

00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:37,300
who came up with the idea of rest he's

00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:40,620
made pretty clear that unless you have

00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:44,500
level 3 you are not really a REST API

00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:47,170
most most people who talk about rest

00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:48,640
api's and I think even within the Drupal

00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:51,460
community some of the expectation has

00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,170
just been level one and level two but if

00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,580
we really want to be restful we also

00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,990
have to have level three so I'm going to

00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:59,080
explain a little bit about what level 3

00:42:55,990 --> 00:43:02,920
get you and this is another example from

00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:04,630
mark dollars block he has a walkthrough

00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:07,870
of making a doctor's appointment by own

00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:09,310
API so what the hospital has this API

00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:10,650
and you can actually build iphone

00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:14,010
applications

00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:15,750
to interact with it and the nice thing

00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:19,290
about that is then the hospital it

00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:21,240
doesn't have to manage all the iphone

00:43:19,290 --> 00:43:25,850
apps by themselves by opening up that

00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:29,070
ecosystem you by the way past renovation

00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:31,440
so when somebody works you click this

00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:33,600
upcoming appointment button on on their

00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,940
phone it would get a list of open slots

00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,710
in the schedule and to do that it would

00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:41,210
just send a get request against the you

00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:46,590
are I've response and tell it what

00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:48,300
content it once or feedback so the

00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:54,180
server would return a list of open

00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:55,560
appointments and you look here we have

00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:57,540
one of these new our eyes that were

00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:00,540
talking about before this is a link

00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:03,330
relief the app would have to know that

00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:05,490
it's looking for this link relation is

00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:08,450
looking for the link relation that

00:44:05,490 --> 00:44:11,460
allows you to book an appointment and

00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:14,430
then it gives you the a threat the

00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:16,170
actual place that you go to to book this

00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:18,300
apartment so that's what we're talking

00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:20,610
about with leaf relations it's basically

00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:26,670
pointers to where you can go next you do

00:44:20,610 --> 00:44:28,830
something else and so the client would

00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:32,340
choose the appointments that they want

00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:38,700
and they would post a message to that

00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:41,540
URI and they had their own like to try

00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:44,700
their their content to something

00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:45,900
basically this is another link relation

00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:47,640
the client would have to know about this

00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:51,630
information that there's that they need

00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:54,410
to provide patient and then provide your

00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:54,410
application

00:44:54,950 --> 00:45:02,359
and then the server returns confirmation

00:44:58,839 --> 00:45:05,119
it also referring links that told the

00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:09,230
client what can do next is so for

00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:10,880
example we have a cancel here and then

00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:13,250
you would have a panel pointment button

00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:19,880
and this told you what you are I've to

00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:22,670
go to do that so it is the case that you

00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:24,260
actually do need to know what these link

00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:28,550
relations are in order to do something

00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:31,700
meaningful in your application but there

00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:33,800
are two benefits of hypermedia one

00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:37,369
business forum Fowler actually is alone

00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:39,079
new unfolding here one allows the server

00:45:37,369 --> 00:45:41,630
to changes your eyes scene without

00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:45,440
breaking clients also known as

00:45:41,630 --> 00:45:48,050
decoupling and it helps find fellers

00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:53,000
explore the protocol also known as

00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:56,150
discoverability so let's say let's look

00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:58,130
at what decoupling done to you so an

00:45:56,150 --> 00:46:00,890
example of a hard-coded way to do it

00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:04,460
then struck that cancel URI is just

00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:07,460
email you you look at the URL structure

00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:09,890
you as human process what that you are I

00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:12,290
structure is and then you write it in a

00:46:09,890 --> 00:46:14,569
rule so how its constructed the problem

00:46:12,290 --> 00:46:15,950
with this is if they ever change their

00:46:14,569 --> 00:46:19,099
your eyes structure which is you

00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:21,440
recently likely your your application

00:46:19,099 --> 00:46:24,800
breaks so if you use the link relation

00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:27,530
to access it then you don't have to

00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,450
worry about whether or not they change

00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:31,550
to your instructor you're not depending

00:46:29,450 --> 00:46:34,220
on there you are I structure you're just

00:46:31,550 --> 00:46:35,780
accessing the or is there's also

00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:38,130
something called templating that you can

00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:41,369
do in

00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:43,710
rest I'm not gonna get into that but you

00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:47,059
can also basically have the rules for

00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:52,289
creating the URI as part of your message

00:46:47,059 --> 00:46:54,089
and then discoverability so you know we

00:46:52,289 --> 00:46:55,769
have the view patient info button as

00:46:54,089 --> 00:46:59,130
cancel appointment button and those came

00:46:55,769 --> 00:47:01,140
from the link relations that I know

00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:03,210
about my application when I was coding

00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:05,039
it I knew with these world now let's say

00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:07,019
you're six months down the line you're

00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:10,619
looking at a response that's coming in

00:47:07,019 --> 00:47:15,299
and you see a new regulation like ads

00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:18,599
don't done the thing what's recommended

00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:20,490
to do is to document your installations

00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:21,960
at the actual your I this is one good

00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:25,500
thing about using your eyes for leave

00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:27,779
relations you could as a developer when

00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:29,369
you see that new uri just go to it find

00:47:27,779 --> 00:47:31,440
the documentation and figure out what

00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:33,930
it's supposed to do and then you can add

00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,730
a new button to your user agrees so

00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:37,710
that's what discoverability is it gives

00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:42,299
developers a way to discover the new

00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:44,730
features of India so hyper median Drupal

00:47:42,299 --> 00:47:48,420
this is as I said kind of open questions

00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:50,849
so we do have linked relations for NC

00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:53,279
reference etcetera but what else could

00:47:50,849 --> 00:47:55,109
be exposed ok from Viet controls what

00:47:53,279 --> 00:47:57,839
else do people I suppose we'll ever need

00:47:55,109 --> 00:48:01,859
angel we want to SC males do we want to

00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:03,539
do fascination with the view so that is

00:48:01,859 --> 00:48:05,730
what we are going to be looking at next

00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:13,549
and if folks have ideas that will be

00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:13,549
around all weekend thank you very much

00:48:24,030 --> 00:48:30,150
okay so there were a few questions on

00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:32,640
Twitter and we will try to answer those

00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:38,160
either as directly back to the people or

00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:40,160
we can hear well go ahead we talked

00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:43,370
about the dream responsibility for

00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:46,920
deserialising data could you talk about

00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:51,210
how they hit handle for serializing

00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:55,260
potentially a post or a foot so that in

00:48:51,210 --> 00:48:58,200
that example of posting patient / lynn

00:48:55,260 --> 00:49:01,020
clark watch disappointment I imagine the

00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:03,780
server would then need to a patient

00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:06,420
fling party and get the entity ID of

00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:09,150
that entity and safety edge aligns

00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:11,210
considers that the reverse process look

00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:13,650
like a chain of responsibility for the

00:49:11,210 --> 00:49:17,970
simulation process funny you should ask

00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:20,400
it actually does we introduced the

00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:22,640
thankful and entity resolver that also

00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:27,420
uses a chain of responsibility and

00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:31,560
interface it gets a little complex so i

00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:33,360
will unless anybody is dying here i

00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:34,650
might catch up with you afterwards

00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:39,630
please do explain the details of that

00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:42,840
okay oh one more question are are their

00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:46,580
major items that look like they won't

00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:48,840
make it into grupal by code freeze and

00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:50,480
we've been hearing to fleet more and

00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,560
more about the idea of either

00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:56,070
incremental releases to Google eight

00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:58,590
that and features or not an expert three

00:49:56,070 --> 00:50:00,390
dimension business QA that could add

00:49:58,590 --> 00:50:02,430
features but not we're getting back was

00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:04,230
compelled how to go be what we have it

00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:06,810
eight point out other things in the rest

00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:13,800
world that could be added to core either

00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:15,990
in 59 x that look at on top of one well

00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:18,000
one thing is actually documenting the

00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:20,880
link relations we don't actually provide

00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,320
documentation those URLs right now we

00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,170
have a focus on that because that is not

00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:27,930
an API change kind of a thing so that

00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:31,349
something that click on the longer you

00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:34,329
got to class you have an

00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:36,609
yeah so the biggest pain points is learn

00:50:34,329 --> 00:50:38,200
the authentication google it red

00:50:36,609 --> 00:50:40,690
molecules in the air exceptional

00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:42,670
education which is pretty rapid but yeah

00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:45,339
you hope to make it so that if to DC and

00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:47,829
medical trip and also page cache which

00:50:45,339 --> 00:50:50,140
really people into place it's still not

00:50:47,829 --> 00:50:53,109
fixin still very broken sailors into the

00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:55,030
seven if you have different

00:50:53,109 --> 00:50:57,040
representations of varies from one path

00:50:55,030 --> 00:51:00,369
and Paige having is mailing you you run

00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:06,520
in the problem six is very depressing if

00:51:00,369 --> 00:51:09,309
we want to help with that your doctor is

00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:12,550
mention we can use the exact letters to

00:51:09,309 --> 00:51:15,190
ask for specific format of resource so

00:51:12,550 --> 00:51:17,440
how far respond to negotiation in

00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:21,010
developing new place the park so do i

00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,930
have to ask for very specific and media

00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:24,819
type or can i do things like okay give

00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:27,190
me xml if you have it if not get me

00:51:24,819 --> 00:51:30,099
Jason is that already there how is it

00:51:27,190 --> 00:51:32,140
still in development that as far as I am

00:51:30,099 --> 00:51:34,809
aware is still in development we are

00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:36,520
basically if you send our by step or

00:51:34,809 --> 00:51:41,200
application table and you have other

00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:45,040
preferences i think it thank you a 400

00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:48,150
texts on your 406 if it doesn't have the

00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:51,730
one that you specified first I think if

00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:54,579
we have no fancy car company illegal je

00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:58,089
suis place so it is that much more your

00:51:54,579 --> 00:52:04,720
thumbs probably the first one gets joke

00:51:58,089 --> 00:52:05,950
I don't know so just if you guys don't

00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:08,440
you guys no matter one follow-up

00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:12,069
question and the suspected page 30 I

00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:13,869
mean it's only broken if I use the

00:52:12,069 --> 00:52:17,410
building pressure or can i use Vance and

00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:19,450
say something like very except yes you

00:52:17,410 --> 00:52:25,140
can do that but the coordinates be aware

00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:30,869
of that as well and 24 is the webisodes

00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:34,450
and for the link relations okay actually

00:52:30,869 --> 00:52:36,640
that's really kind on the base URL new

00:52:34,450 --> 00:52:41,160
followers thinking actually remember

00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:45,790
you're backstage right so it is

00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:53,280
currently automatically created based on

00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:53,280
what where the site we could look into

00:53:03,660 --> 00:53:15,369
yeah he would um I think you kind of

00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:17,770
into this by the first question but I

00:53:15,369 --> 00:53:19,900
just want to hear more one of the things

00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:23,380
I really like about the service module

00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:25,030
is the authentication plugin ability

00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:27,940
because we are clients are after a

00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:30,540
dedicate with basic off Santa mole and

00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:33,400
cookie up and we have to check although

00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:35,369
just refine your honor offender gatien's

00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:39,160
buggins and so we can talk more about

00:53:35,369 --> 00:53:41,859
how you're going to handle there with 28

00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:45,550
because pretty op only is going to be

00:53:41,859 --> 00:53:47,980
major blogger in adopting this yes it is

00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:50,890
I'm so we're trying to give it out of

00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:52,660
rest module because it itself might not

00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:55,510
be concerned about that and other system

00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:58,720
I use the same attacks in yourself so

00:53:55,510 --> 00:54:01,420
what we will try to do is to make it

00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:04,570
really a qualitative can be used by of

00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:07,150
the other models and yeah if there will

00:54:04,570 --> 00:54:08,770
be some mechanism look into the system

00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:11,710
and check the request for other

00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:13,240
authentication credentials but yeah we

00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:15,430
also need to make the taste better wear

00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:17,560
and what the authentication plugins are

00:54:15,430 --> 00:54:19,330
looking for because the page says it's

00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:22,150
very based on find this is an

00:54:19,330 --> 00:54:24,760
authenticated request or not yeah that's

00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:27,220
the problem it's currently it's a little

00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:29,550
bit broken but we don't work if you want

00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,550
to know

00:54:40,910 --> 00:54:47,759
so that actually typed in with a another

00:54:45,329 --> 00:54:51,170
question that was on Twitter which is

00:54:47,759 --> 00:54:53,009
why we are not supporting foot and

00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:54,960
there's actually a couple of good

00:54:53,009 --> 00:54:59,700
discussions as why we're not supporting

00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:01,979
foot one is flunking that Larry posted

00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:04,109
called putting on foot I'm going to

00:55:01,979 --> 00:55:08,279
tweak there you are eyes for URLs for

00:55:04,109 --> 00:55:09,690
these so he posted an unexplained asian

00:55:08,279 --> 00:55:12,269
of why we are not supporting foot and

00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:14,130
there's also on Roy fielding and till

00:55:12,269 --> 00:55:16,349
tonight hosted something called it the

00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:18,269
previews package where he basically said

00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:20,099
you know you often don't actually want

00:55:18,269 --> 00:55:23,960
to use foot so i just want to mention

00:55:20,099 --> 00:55:27,630
those using put for content deployment

00:55:23,960 --> 00:55:31,049
so that you can actually have the same

00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:34,410
identifier or okay so you can have same

00:55:31,049 --> 00:55:36,150
level identified because like uuid you

00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:37,950
can actually deploy that without using

00:55:36,150 --> 00:55:55,259
foot but you're looking for the same

00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:57,960
local identifier then I think we have

00:55:55,259 --> 00:55:59,999
decided to use you ID in your eyes

00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:03,029
because it's so long and cut with a

00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:06,119
human readable and the page and also to

00:56:03,029 --> 00:56:09,349
follow the GV ID is that you might they

00:56:06,119 --> 00:56:12,960
might not be unique overall entity types

00:56:09,349 --> 00:56:14,969
so they they try to be but a technical

00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:17,910
issues I mean yeah the probability

00:56:14,969 --> 00:56:19,650
probability is really low still but it

00:56:17,910 --> 00:56:23,599
makes the system of more complex to

00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:26,249
detect which entity type is actually

00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:28,650
going to be posted for example are going

00:56:26,249 --> 00:56:30,630
to be updated so you would have to be

00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:32,800
great with all HD tables to find out

00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:37,540
what what is this late

00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:40,480
okay one other question are we hoping to

00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:43,840
one day web pages through the west to

00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:45,760
the rest'll module so you're talking

00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:49,000
about like having blocks in addition to

00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:50,860
the actual note i mean the can

00:56:49,000 --> 00:57:02,290
always learn directly to web browser

00:56:50,860 --> 00:57:04,690
should not be served yeah yeah so that

00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:07,620
the comment was that we no distinction

00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:11,320
between the API and the usual HTML page

00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:13,960
and I agreed to a certain extent but the

00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:15,760
powerless we serve HTML mostly s cages

00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:17,650
and that's more than just below there

00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:19,720
are blocks around it there are menus and

00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:24,310
whatnot so that is actually very

00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:29,560
different i guess and yeah if it works

00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:31,960
for you thanks m that is what it said

00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,790
what a complete speedo parents services

00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:36,010
or groups for a title stuff like that

00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:38,110
that you guys like fully fully bootstrap

00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:41,500
just alike spit is that bad teams now I

00:57:38,110 --> 00:57:43,090
can start our journey developments on

00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,730
your rear end or whiskey in general that

00:57:43,090 --> 00:57:47,860
pets that's hella with that problem

00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:50,260
there for the whole of its important

00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:52,390
part try to split up to the coil is a

00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:55,000
collectible books well in a way that it

00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:57,060
is more lightweight but yeah we are

00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:00,640
operating on the holy books back to walk

00:57:57,060 --> 00:58:04,120
the current account implementation group

00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:06,100
ahead into play quad so yeah we have to

00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:08,440
load stuff that we need so we can avoid

00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:10,990
that normal here that the XP API has a

00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:14,070
lot of dependencies being because it

00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:14,070
means to lower got stuff

00:58:16,370 --> 00:58:22,830
the whole point of it as universal

00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:26,010
resources to make it easier for who

00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:27,990
feeds the wizard it completely I don't

00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:30,510
you think that by basically providing

00:58:27,990 --> 00:58:32,910
you can sit with your eyes like for load

00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:36,990
count Commons blocks user info on the

00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:39,750
fourth he gets hard other developers the

00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:41,760
right code there are excellent so you're

00:58:39,750 --> 00:58:44,130
saying that we should use the thing your

00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:48,090
I section both for both nodes and users

00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:53,280
or organ um so and you wouldn't have

00:58:48,090 --> 00:58:56,250
liked node in the URI for example you

00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:59,700
ideas in it um you'll be very simplified

00:58:56,250 --> 00:59:02,040
unified and basically anyone who's

00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:05,370
driving it up will be able to consume

00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:08,790
that data we're using the same code

00:59:05,370 --> 00:59:10,710
instead of writing this Sylvia when I

00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:15,450
screen as that practice is to actually

00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:16,680
specify what crimes are entries you're

00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:18,390
working upon that I think that's

00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:20,490
actually considered developer it's you

00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:22,590
know a developer experience win when you

00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:26,430
actually specify that you're talking to

00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:28,080
a certain kind of entity and also you

00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:31,530
wouldn't be able to reuse code totally

00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:34,080
because different entities might have

00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:36,000
different link relations so there's a

00:59:34,080 --> 00:59:38,900
lot of stuff that actually is specific

00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:42,680
to the domain model of that particular

00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:45,270
entity so you will necessarily want to

00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:52,520
have sandwich generically working across

00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:52,520
users and nodes and very slow because

01:00:06,470 --> 01:00:10,920
because we fun driving it for example

01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:13,770
physical that's posted until five in any

01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:17,609
knives kilometers nose blocks users I

01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:19,589
basically buy my clothes five times but

01:00:17,609 --> 01:00:24,089
already want to put out a feeler data

01:00:19,589 --> 01:00:25,349
very easy I'm a table that discussion if

01:00:24,089 --> 01:00:26,670
you want to see that discussion we can

01:00:25,349 --> 01:00:28,589
continue affecting her there are a lot

01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:30,000
of people that would disagree with the

01:00:28,589 --> 01:00:31,980
idea that that occurs developer

01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,280
experience there's a lot long posts that

01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:36,839
actually recommend the opposite so that

01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:42,930
I think that discussion we can have

01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:47,330
maybe afterwards stating content is just

01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:51,720
like in the wards or what's the status

01:00:47,330 --> 01:00:55,530
because the DUI even or the stage actor

01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:59,390
you can't really so we have you you IDs

01:00:55,530 --> 01:01:03,359
and they actually do you know basically

01:00:59,390 --> 01:01:12,510
the uuid is actually ingested and used

01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:13,950
when you're opposed any more questions

01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:16,890
there were a few people that actually

01:01:13,950 --> 01:01:19,020
asked questions on Twitter about you to

01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:21,900
go over those questions now people are

01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:24,330
okay so yeah there were people asking

01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:27,900
about the gate put impact and i will

01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:30,150
post those two blog posts but basically

01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:31,950
when you're doing a foot there's time a

01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:33,810
strict semantics the foot you're

01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:35,280
supposed to replace every day and so

01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:38,210
that's why Roy fielding actually said a

01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:42,720
lot of times we'll use post enough life

01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:45,119
and so we figured that we don't know

01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:46,830
what people are going to be doing what

01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:48,060
field people are going to attach and

01:01:46,830 --> 01:01:50,580
whether or not they're writable and

01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:52,800
whether or not you know over all these

01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:55,349
other things so it's safer to go with

01:01:52,800 --> 01:02:00,380
patch we think we can actually apply by

01:01:55,349 --> 01:02:00,380
the semantics of it more more faithfully

01:02:01,799 --> 01:02:07,229
somebody asks if there was a crud

01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:10,109
reviews like basically if you're going

01:02:07,229 --> 01:02:15,059
to be able to edit your views using rust

01:02:10,109 --> 01:02:18,469
and that becomes biggest tea and we're

01:02:15,059 --> 01:02:18,469
not really reporting from big entities

01:02:18,499 --> 01:02:25,019
yeah now that configuration is entities

01:02:22,799 --> 01:02:28,019
like user-created sees it might be

01:02:25,019 --> 01:02:34,049
possible i have tried it actually but it

01:02:28,019 --> 01:02:35,699
could be feasible fight with you one of

01:02:34,049 --> 01:02:38,689
the arguments we actually had while we

01:02:35,699 --> 01:02:41,189
were discussing that was you know

01:02:38,689 --> 01:02:43,769
configuration you can already do it

01:02:41,189 --> 01:02:45,749
Annie able and then you know use gift or

01:02:43,769 --> 01:02:47,039
something to get it back to your site so

01:02:45,749 --> 01:02:51,109
it's quite a more and make more sense

01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:51,109
for config to actually manage it and

01:02:55,009 --> 01:03:00,630
question the BPRD jeffrey showed is that

01:02:58,109 --> 01:03:08,519
how easy it is to create like a customer

01:03:00,630 --> 01:03:12,179
soldier that's maybe not identity yes at

01:03:08,519 --> 01:03:14,309
least i hope i guess i guess people who

01:03:12,179 --> 01:03:19,709
run into problems but yeah we try to

01:03:14,309 --> 01:03:21,509
make it as easy it together so there's

01:03:19,709 --> 01:03:23,699
another question if i use use in da to

01:03:21,509 --> 01:03:26,789
limit fields and i still load it from

01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:28,979
the back and we actually have not looked

01:03:26,789 --> 01:03:32,219
deeply enough into the views integration

01:03:28,979 --> 01:03:34,729
to say i don't think so good i think you

01:03:32,219 --> 01:03:37,079
can just use those that use caching

01:03:34,729 --> 01:03:39,349
abusive use with beeps all that grows

01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:41,699
have some sample somewhere that should

01:03:39,349 --> 01:03:46,799
work the same for the rest displayed

01:03:41,699 --> 01:03:50,910
plugin yeah is it if using get items in

01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:54,499
both cases on the function get items so

01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:54,499
whenever dr. exact

01:03:57,130 --> 01:04:03,339
somebody asked you to talk more about

01:03:59,619 --> 01:04:05,230
our use of csrf tokens and specifically

01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:08,410
the fact of the things via Perry over

01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:11,319
imported yet yes if there's something

01:04:08,410 --> 01:04:13,480
similar like for me the avatars you have

01:04:11,319 --> 01:04:16,150
to verify that that both requests that

01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:19,450
is performed is actually made by that

01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:21,069
client or not on behalf of someone so

01:04:19,450 --> 01:04:24,309
that the usual exploit that you have to

01:04:21,069 --> 01:04:26,470
go to something an external side band it

01:04:24,309 --> 01:04:28,930
executed some JavaScript awesome flash

01:04:26,470 --> 01:04:30,640
and you can turn 15 the size of the

01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:32,289
travel script is already executing and

01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:34,299
then sending your post request on your

01:04:32,289 --> 01:04:36,630
behalf to your actual people site and

01:04:34,299 --> 01:04:39,819
what happens if you are loveliness

01:04:36,630 --> 01:04:41,369
administrator at website that request

01:04:39,819 --> 01:04:44,650
will be performed with your

01:04:41,369 --> 01:04:47,109
administration so it could do a lot of

01:04:44,650 --> 01:04:51,519
harmful humbly request village back for

01:04:47,109 --> 01:04:53,769
updates like in a very not nice way on

01:04:51,519 --> 01:04:56,019
your behalf that's why we have to talk

01:04:53,769 --> 01:04:58,779
back to server to retreat for token and

01:04:56,019 --> 01:05:00,759
then add that moonquest so that it is

01:04:58,779 --> 01:05:04,150
this act knew that it is actually

01:05:00,759 --> 01:05:08,680
actually our original request that is

01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:10,839
intended to design yeah a couple other

01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:13,089
frankerz flew to safeway i guess in

01:05:10,839 --> 01:05:30,569
general uses similar error is not the

01:05:13,089 --> 01:05:30,569
same or with so if you want

01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:52,560
there are different api's that do that

01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:54,810
there are people who talk about how to

01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:57,030
do that is pleasing get of Prayer earth

01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:58,800
we are not currently supporting that

01:05:57,030 --> 01:06:00,859
that's something that could be supported

01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:04,079
thinking true I don't think that were

01:06:00,859 --> 01:06:06,109
you know core we're trying to limit what

01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:09,180
we put into gorgeous curves we have to

01:06:06,109 --> 01:06:10,920
making that through the years and so

01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:13,430
still not that scared experimentation

01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:15,180
we're really looking to compare it to

01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:27,119
yeah there's definitely that mean that

01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:29,280
people do so the comment was that I

01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:33,359
meant was that in Restless supposed to

01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:35,670
be a granular API yeah i think we try to

01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:37,829
be just as generic as possible in Drupal

01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:40,380
core and just output everything that use

01:06:37,829 --> 01:06:42,720
has access to by default if you want to

01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:44,430
output something different just without

01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:48,060
the field for example I guess it just

01:06:44,430 --> 01:06:50,040
right you are you're only normalize the

01:06:48,060 --> 01:06:53,490
anomalous rock or for the civilization

01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:55,140
system easily get rid of that I get a

01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:56,819
lot of people will do it because yeah

01:06:55,140 --> 01:07:01,130
there's a lot of gravel notes that you

01:06:56,819 --> 01:07:01,130
might want to show to your public

01:07:03,890 --> 01:07:08,069
another thing that you could do is

01:07:05,700 --> 01:07:10,470
actually write full name genera that is

01:07:08,069 --> 01:07:16,890
a resource plug-in and then prepares the

01:07:10,470 --> 01:07:19,160
entity before it gets to zero ok any

01:07:16,890 --> 01:07:19,160
other questions

01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:29,210
there was one person asking about the

01:07:22,849 --> 01:07:32,210
authentication so I don't know you are I

01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:36,049
think the question was just if I could

01:07:32,210 --> 01:07:38,329
elaborate Marcus 12 education I'm aware

01:07:36,049 --> 01:07:40,519
if there is a special handler in

01:07:38,329 --> 01:07:42,499
castleton using authentic nation so just

01:07:40,519 --> 01:07:45,619
play around for that levels greater with

01:07:42,499 --> 01:07:52,970
that not education so I not really

01:07:45,619 --> 01:07:59,059
familiar with that yeah well if

01:07:52,970 --> 01:08:01,190
statement will do just do it okay any

01:07:59,059 --> 01:08:02,829
more questions we're also happy be after

01:08:01,190 --> 01:08:06,789
your questions afterwards if you want

01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:06,789
