THRIVING IN A WORLD OF CHANGE: FUTURE-FRIENDLY CONTENT WITH DRUPAL

There's always another redesign. There's always another new must-have front-end design effect. There's always another platform, a new screen resolution, the latest device. Underneath it all, there's content. What if we could get away from the cyclical churn, the constant reinvention? What if we could stop throwing the baby out with the bathwater? Instead of trying to get all new content every time there's a redesign (or worse, shoving crappy old content into stylish new clothes) it's time to plan for the future.

In this session, Karen will explain how Drupal is the future of adaptive content. She's not saying that like she's some kind of Drupal fangirl (though she is.) She's saying that as a long-time information architect, content strategist, and user experience designer, who sees content through the eyes of the people who create it and maintain it. She'll explain why—from her perspective—Drupal's content modeling tools and flexible UI make it a powerful tool in our fight against the future.
