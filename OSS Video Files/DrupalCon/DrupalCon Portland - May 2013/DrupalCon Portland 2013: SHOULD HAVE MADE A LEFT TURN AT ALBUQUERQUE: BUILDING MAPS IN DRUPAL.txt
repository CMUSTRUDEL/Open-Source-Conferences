Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: SHOULD HAVE MADE A LEFT TURN AT ALBUQUERQUE: BUILDING MAPS IN DRUPAL
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	Online mapping has experienced a renaissance in recent years due to the efforts of OpenStreetMap, MapBox, and various open-source libraries maturing into very capable platforms for application building. We're not just building maps either, but complex applications that allow for user interaction, exploration, and end user data analysis. However in some ways, building geographically aware experiences in Drupal has continued to be an exercise in frustration.

Join us for a series of case studies and an expert Q&A session focused on the challenges of building useful geospatial applications in the Drupal ecosystem. We'll address strengths and weaknesses of integrating various platforms into Drupal, development approaches regarding locally stored vs remotely accessed data, and map out a way forward for Drupal 8.
