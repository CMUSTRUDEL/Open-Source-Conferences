Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: SHOULD HAVE MADE A LEFT TURN AT ALBUQUERQUE: BUILDING MAPS IN DRUPAL
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	Online mapping has experienced a renaissance in recent years due to the efforts of OpenStreetMap, MapBox, and various open-source libraries maturing into very capable platforms for application building. We're not just building maps either, but complex applications that allow for user interaction, exploration, and end user data analysis. However in some ways, building geographically aware experiences in Drupal has continued to be an exercise in frustration.

Join us for a series of case studies and an expert Q&A session focused on the challenges of building useful geospatial applications in the Drupal ecosystem. We'll address strengths and weaknesses of integrating various platforms into Drupal, development approaches regarding locally stored vs remotely accessed data, and map out a way forward for Drupal 8.

okay everybody sorry about that brief

00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,089
delay welcome and thanks for attending

00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,589
one of the late sessions of the last day

00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:10,380
here we're very excited to have you all

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:12,929
here and we're very excited to talk

00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:15,000
about the exciting things going on in

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:18,960
Drupal mapping and hopefully get you all

00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,520
excited as well I'm Nate Parsons and I'm

00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,100
going to be sort of emceeing this event

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,539
and i am the the least least lit of

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,369
these luminaries i have to say these are

00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:28,439
the the exciting guys who are sort of

00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,480
moving forward with a lot of the drupal

00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,830
mapping and they can share a lot of

00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,820
really interesting things with us today

00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:38,969
and we're going to start off today

00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:40,559
talking with rick about what the state

00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,730
of drupal mapping looks like just from a

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,899
high overview and then we're going to

00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,719
get into the exciting things that are

00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:58,370
being done with drupal mapping today so

00:00:45,719 --> 00:01:02,940
reckoning in hand review thanks night

00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:04,080
hello and welcome to my presentation my

00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:05,850
name is Rick de Bourgh I'm from

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,000
Melbourne Australia where I run the

00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,920
fling collective where we continue to

00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,369
have great fun with Drupal and maps in

00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,630
particular you've come here because you

00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:20,369
want to take your next step into Maps

00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:23,220
maybe your next step is to create your

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:26,009
first map or maybe you've been there

00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:29,970
done that and you are ready to cluster a

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:31,530
hundred thousand markers we've got all

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:35,790
these bases covered with this wonderful

00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:38,939
team here for my mini presentation I

00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:44,820
hope to do I hope that you take away 2

00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:48,299
points 1 a handy map starter kit and to

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:54,479
a desire to take your next step into

00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:57,030
maps so let's begin just like you can't

00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,180
have a school bus that goes at the speed

00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:03,000
of a Ferrari or a Ferrari that seat 65

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,149
people you can't have everything in the

00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:10,229
one map so you have to sit down with

00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:13,590
your client listen to their requirements

00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:16,230
and prioritize the feature list

00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,230
and balance that against the timeframes

00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:23,569
and the costs and once you've done that

00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:29,069
you take your feature set to drupal.org

00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:31,019
and you look at the project pages and

00:02:29,069 --> 00:02:35,819
the document a ship's documentation

00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:38,129
pages you probably go like ah so many

00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:45,019
modules and they all have similar names

00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:47,489
as well it can be very confusing you see

00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:50,880
Drupal my plant is a bit of a jungle I

00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:54,180
try to make a diagram here but it's not

00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:56,910
nearly complete what it shows is it's a

00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,640
mess I try to bring a little bit of

00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:04,890
order in it with on the left-hand side

00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:06,989
we've got a silo for the coordinate

00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:10,640
storage modules and on the right-hand

00:03:06,989 --> 00:03:13,980
side we've got our map rendering modules

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:18,239
the big ones being Google openlayers and

00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:21,209
leaflet and in the middle there's this

00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,030
bit usually views based that takes your

00:03:21,209 --> 00:03:27,600
locations from the left turns them into

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:31,230
Marcus applies the tooltips the color

00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:35,489
coding and all the rest of it and super

00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:38,880
imposes them on your map tiles and so

00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:41,900
your job is to find a path from the left

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,790
to the through the middle to the right

00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:48,810
problem is many of those paths don't

00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:52,400
really don't exist and the situation is

00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:55,650
further complicated through these

00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:58,200
bachelor call and auxiliary modules that

00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,970
do handy stuff on the input side like GL

00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:03,359
coder or beautiful stuff on the output

00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:05,760
side like marker clustering and they all

00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:09,560
combat their own constraints and so that

00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:14,430
you can't have any of this with any that

00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:16,889
there is however one module in 0 to give

00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,560
you an example say you've got the

00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:21,450
location module and you're using your G

00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:24,570
map and it works fine nothing wrong with

00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:25,670
that setup but then you're ready to put

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:28,050
some

00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:30,600
fresh new lipstick and look on that old

00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:32,520
google face and you've read about the

00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,020
leaflet mark a cluster module you think

00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,550
this is cool I want to use that our

00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,970
leaflet and leaflet marker cluster only

00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:49,860
work with geo field there is a module

00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:51,960
though a slide has gone missing that's

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,510
okay there is a module which is right in

00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,220
the center here account highlight

00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,830
highlighted it's called IP geolocation

00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:02,190
views and maps that allows you to use

00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:06,390
any of the four input coordinates

00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:09,770
storage methods map modules to connect

00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:12,750
those two any of the three map rendering

00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:14,520
engines and so it's no surprise that I

00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:19,590
recommend that as part of the starter

00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:22,110
pack but don't just believe me on my

00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:24,060
journey through my plans I've talked to

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:26,790
a lot of people and they've come up with

00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:28,380
similar solutions and I've asked them

00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:30,930
whether they want it to be on this slide

00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,720
so I'm sure there'll be more than

00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:36,510
willing to share their experience with

00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:43,710
the map starter kit and or a very

00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:46,800
similar setup so in closing for my maps

00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:49,680
data kit I would recommend geo field for

00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,090
your latitude and longitude coordinates

00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:55,560
storage views because you can't avoid it

00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:58,590
leaflet because it's lightweight and

00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,960
mobile optimized for mobile and IP

00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:02,550
geolocation viewers and maps because of

00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,550
the reason I just mentioned but also

00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:10,979
that it brings a few handy features of

00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:12,660
its own including some of the context

00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:15,300
sensitive stuff that Reese mentioned

00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:16,680
where he said if I go to a website it

00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,330
should know that I'm in denver and then

00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,390
do something with it like put up an ad

00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:24,419
or put my visitor marker on the map and

00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:27,660
stuff like that so what's not to like

00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:31,250
for your next step into Drupal meting

00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,250
land thank you

00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:48,660
hi everyone I'm Paul the era jhoola

00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:52,520
Drupal on twitter and i'm going to show

00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:55,470
you i'm going to talk about openlayers

00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:58,110
i'm here to to show you that open the

00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:01,139
year is not dead it's still maintained

00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:05,010
still 41 years now I'm the maintainer of

00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:06,900
upper layers and I will show you the new

00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:11,160
stuff and the upcoming stuff in

00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:14,400
openlayers to point x + 3 point X so

00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,770
first of all the two point X branch is

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,840
the stable branch of openlayers the one

00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,810
that you should use if you start mapping

00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,900
from today the tree point x is still

00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:29,910
highly experimental and it's still under

00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:32,610
development so as we only have five

00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:34,470
minutes per person here I cannot make

00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,990
live demo so I will only show you

00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:38,640
screenshots but if you want to talk to

00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:43,380
me after the presentation i will show

00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:45,960
you those demo life on my computer so

00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:49,800
the first new stuff in openlayers is the

00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,630
unified and main user interface so if

00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,850
you install openlayers for the first

00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:55,680
time you'll see those tabs layers maps

00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:57,870
projection and styles and you'll see

00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,200
that they all have the same aspects the

00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:04,380
same style so this is the layer page the

00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:07,110
maps page the projection page the style

00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,990
page so we are using CTools export UI

00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:12,260
and this allows us to create those

00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:18,050
administration page really easily and

00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:18,050
it's really clean in the code also so

00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:23,580
second things is the behaviors of the

00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:27,750
the behaviors display improved into the

00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:29,720
map edit form so it is the old way of

00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:32,909
displaying those behaviors in map in the

00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:36,270
map edit form this is the new way it's

00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:39,599
cleaner it's it's better and there is

00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:45,070
really less code than before there is a

00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:47,320
major cleanup new pop-up style

00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,990
so this is the old way of displaying

00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,820
pop-ups into openlayers which is a white

00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:55,690
pop up with a red button on the right

00:08:51,820 --> 00:09:01,870
top right this is the new way this is a

00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:06,370
bit more beautiful this is modern next

00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:09,070
the new behaviors this is interesting so

00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:11,470
you have first the graticule behaviors

00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:14,080
which allows you to display parallels

00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,690
and meridians on a map you can customize

00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,180
the color of the lines the everything

00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:22,630
you can customize a lot of stuff and you

00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:24,910
can display it on any map you want then

00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:26,770
the hover behavior this is when you are

00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:29,620
displaying features on a map like this

00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:32,380
map you have a couple of features on it

00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:35,740
when you pass your mouse on one of the

00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:39,420
feature the hover behaviors allow you to

00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:41,830
allows you to change the icon and

00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:46,510
replace it by another icon this is

00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:48,250
really handy the compass behavior see on

00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:51,520
the top of the right on the top right of

00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:54,190
the map you have a compass and when you

00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:57,190
move when you pan on the map the compass

00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:59,200
chain change the orientation you can

00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:04,000
change the icon you can change a lot of

00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:07,800
stuff also the Refresh layer strategy

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:11,260
behavior this is a map provided by

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:13,630
another module for openlayers which is

00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:15,940
called open weather map it's it's

00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:20,110
displaying information about the weather

00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:22,870
and so on and this map has the Refresh

00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:25,540
layer strategy behavior enabled it means

00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,790
that every 16 seconds the layer will

00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:30,390
refresh automatically and you will have

00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:37,840
a beautiful animated map of the weather

00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:39,400
on your site so to save and edit button

00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,900
this is a small feature but this is a

00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,720
time saver when you are working with

00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:46,000
maps so you are not going back to the

00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,770
map list when you hit and save you can

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:53,770
click on save and edit and edit them up

00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:56,350
again dynamic markers so dynamic markers

00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:57,300
is when you are displaying markers on

00:10:56,350 --> 00:11:00,300
your map and you

00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,430
want the image to be customized so for

00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,430
example this map is displaying two

00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:08,190
markers and the image of the markers the

00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:11,700
red images are coming from a field from

00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:13,680
an entity and you can change the size of

00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:19,760
it through the image styles of Drupal

00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:23,040
and so on I told you it was faster so

00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,620
the new layer type in openlayers binged

00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,720
layer type is now that the earth is now

00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:32,790
into openlayers it has replaced the

00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:35,040
virtual hers from Microsoft mapbox layer

00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,600
types is also into openlayers you don't

00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:41,579
need any more modules to get them

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:43,529
working and an image layer type it means

00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:53,910
that you can upload an image as a layer

00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:55,829
into openlayers another new stuff is the

00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:58,560
contextual links so when you are editing

00:11:55,829 --> 00:12:00,540
a map when you over your mouse on the

00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,880
map you'll see on the right some edit

00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,470
links so you don't have to go back to

00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,329
the administration interface to edit a

00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:09,899
map you have all the links on the right

00:12:06,329 --> 00:12:14,100
edit clone export and revert if you edit

00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:17,370
if you have a date at the map custom

00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:19,440
projection this is a big new features

00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:22,170
that has been implemented in openlayers

00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,740
by by a friend August exclaim from

00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:28,230
Germany and it allows you to display

00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:33,930
custom projections on map maps with

00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:36,660
custom projections this is it and of

00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:40,529
course Ajax you can now display your

00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:42,660
maps using Ajax on forums and on pages

00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:44,430
and unfortunately there is no

00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,140
demonstration but that if you want you

00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:49,140
can talk to me after the presentation

00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,880
I'll show you all of that well that's a

00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:57,980
bit of everything the new stuff in

00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:57,980
openlayers that this

00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:13,840
hi guys my name is a Tom nightingale i

00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:18,820
am from vancouver bc and i work for

00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:21,070
affinity bridge so i'm going to talk

00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:23,890
about a couple of techniques we commonly

00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:26,020
use across all the libraries for

00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:28,780
visualizing geo data and the format's

00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:32,080
that we use and i'd like to talk about

00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:34,360
some advanced interactivity techniques

00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,270
that we've been working on it if the new

00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,890
bridge so typically when we are

00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:41,920
visualizing we've got a bunch of Geo

00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:45,480
data that we've collected somehow put

00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:48,610
into Drupal there's two types two

00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:51,220
methods in which we can send the data to

00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:55,450
the browser and render on screen the

00:13:51,220 --> 00:14:02,260
most common approaches would be vector

00:13:55,450 --> 00:14:04,870
data rendered as an SVG graphic or you

00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:08,190
can also rasterize your data into a

00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:11,770
bitmap image and serve that up its tiles

00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:13,690
vector data can come in a variety of

00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:16,810
formats there's more formats than you

00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:19,030
can count but more often than not when

00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,530
we're dealing with the web we tend to

00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:24,730
stick to the plain text format such as

00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:30,030
wkt well-known text geo jason keyhole

00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:31,960
markup language k ml which both our main

00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:34,500
mapping libraries open layers and

00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:38,200
leaflet have or provides support for

00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:39,900
fixed at is great because it's it's like

00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:44,020
the raw data it's very easy to process

00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:45,820
manipulate style but there are some

00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:48,250
downsides to it can be very it's the raw

00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:51,100
data so it can be very both have a very

00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:53,530
large footprint in sending over the wire

00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:56,080
to your client the rendering is done

00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:59,020
client-side which can be a plus for your

00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:02,770
server people and boon for your end

00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:04,600
users and so typically when we have very

00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:06,750
large amounts of data

00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,889
the best way to get that into our

00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:12,399
clients browsers is actually by

00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:14,740
rasterizing into bitmap images and

00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,540
serving them to the client as tiles once

00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:18,459
that image that data has been rasterized

00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:25,149
into an image where browsers handle

00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:29,860
images very well there r us Roger

00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:34,089
rasterized image is a consistent size

00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,990
it's just your typical 256 256 so

00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:37,649
doesn't matter how much data you've

00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:40,569
stuffed in there you also benefit from

00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:44,500
images being fast to load cashable at

00:15:40,569 --> 00:15:47,680
the HTTP layer that kind of thing so

00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,720
moving on to interactivity in the part

00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,079
or traditionally with our Drupal modules

00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,569
and with maps in general inter

00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:57,069
activities kind of being limited to

00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:58,420
putting markers on a map we've got a

00:15:57,069 --> 00:15:59,829
bunch of point data we've rented them as

00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,170
markers on a map and we have a little

00:15:59,829 --> 00:16:04,329
pop-ups when you click click or hover on

00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:07,269
you on your Marcus and I mean that's

00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:09,610
effective but it's a little overused I

00:16:07,269 --> 00:16:12,000
think and you know with the state of

00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:16,110
JavaScript today this and the other

00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:19,509
javascript javascript libraries in the

00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:23,019
info on the internet there's a bunch of

00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:25,120
other really cool stuff we can do so one

00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:28,600
of my favorite libraries for data

00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,819
visualizations is d3.js d3 stands for

00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,160
data-driven documents it's a library

00:16:30,819 --> 00:16:40,120
developed by Mike Bostock who does some

00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:41,880
really cool stuff and it it's a really

00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,889
useful tool when it comes to creating

00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:47,019
really interactive awesome SVG based

00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:49,089
graphics I got a couple examples I'd

00:16:47,019 --> 00:16:52,660
like to quickly demo if they will work

00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:55,810
for me not that one this one hasn't

00:16:52,660 --> 00:17:00,220
loaded to try to begin here we go so uh

00:16:55,810 --> 00:17:01,750
this is really big this I we're just

00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:04,569
going to look at it all seemed out a

00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:09,159
little bit I've loaded the it's not what

00:17:04,569 --> 00:17:11,260
I wanted to do so in 2010 in September

00:17:09,159 --> 00:17:12,699
2010 in New Zealand and Christchurch

00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:14,689
there was a very large earthquake I

00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:16,669
think it was 7.1

00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:19,000
magnitude and it caused a lot of

00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:22,189
destruction to the city of christchurch

00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:25,009
they're currently rebuilding at the

00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:26,870
moment the new zealand government has

00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:29,450
released a bunch of the information

00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:31,039
collected about the earthquakes and that

00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:33,500
you can download and consume and i've

00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,690
sort of pulled all of the earthquake

00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:39,080
data of earthquakes that are greater

00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:40,399
than three point 0 magnitude for the

00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,860
month of September there are a lot of

00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:44,419
aftershocks after the big one and you

00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,710
can see I've rendered them on this time

00:17:44,419 --> 00:17:48,139
series along the bottom of the map here

00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,960
using d3.js the time series is

00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:53,690
interactive we can click in drag and as

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,549
we drag and create sort of a date range

00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:59,240
we can sort of dragged through and

00:17:55,549 --> 00:18:02,600
filter filter and slick sort of query

00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,610
the data I guess filtered by range now

00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,799
this is all outside of Drupal it's just

00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,330
what we're doing in JavaScript and then

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,580
we can also click on individual

00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:13,250
earthquakes and sort of see some

00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:15,679
information about them so that's d3j is

00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,539
playing very nicely with leaflet I've

00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,990
also got another data set from the city

00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:22,879
of vancouver and they someone's gone out

00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:26,149
and collected information about all of

00:18:22,879 --> 00:18:29,450
the graffiti in the city and where it

00:18:26,149 --> 00:18:33,679
sort of most prominently occurs and I've

00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:36,200
fed that data into d3.js and you can see

00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:40,759
here I've used a technique called heck

00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:43,789
spinning to dump that data into buckets

00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:46,039
based on proximity and you can see where

00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:48,710
the hexagons are a darker red that's

00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:50,179
where there's more frequent occurrences

00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:53,049
of graffiti and Vancouver it's a good

00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:57,080
way of it's kind of like a heat map of

00:18:53,049 --> 00:19:01,580
visualizing your data thanks for the

00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:03,980
presentation finally at affinity bridge

00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:06,080
we've been working with a nonprofit

00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:10,940
organization called peace geek peace

00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:13,100
geeks they have a mission to strive to

00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:15,710
empower organizations promoting peace

00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:18,230
and accountability and human rights with

00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:20,480
technology tools and training they've

00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:25,490
been developing a distribution for

00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,269
Drupal that collects clicks and maps

00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:30,559
instant

00:19:26,269 --> 00:19:32,359
it's for various locations and we were

00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,580
tasked with building a sort of a mapping

00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:37,159
component that had some features that

00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:38,749
they wanted to see some clustering they

00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:42,489
wanted to be able to filter on the data

00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:44,599
the data had multiple dimensions to it

00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:46,669
they wanted to be able to configure it

00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:50,509
as well there a data model wasn't set in

00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:51,919
stone so I've used d3.js and another

00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:55,429
library called cross filter which

00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:58,309
provides very quick and efficient sort

00:19:55,429 --> 00:20:00,529
of slicing and dicing of the data set to

00:19:58,309 --> 00:20:06,499
produce this instrument map we've got

00:20:00,529 --> 00:20:15,589
here I believe in reports should mean it

00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:17,450
was quite prepared should load and if we

00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:19,339
zoom the bulk of that this is just

00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:23,299
sample data in here at the moment most

00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:26,179
of it's in Uganda we zoom in here you

00:20:23,299 --> 00:20:27,499
can turn off the clustering and you can

00:20:26,179 --> 00:20:29,539
see we've got a set of data points and

00:20:27,499 --> 00:20:31,159
similar to the Christchurch map we've

00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:34,059
got a time line filter along the bottom

00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:37,789
here which I can click and drag on oops

00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:42,829
works much in the same way and then on

00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:46,450
the right hand side scroll so ways it's

00:20:42,829 --> 00:20:49,999
not going to let me that's disappointing

00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:52,129
you can sit can I don't oh yeah right I

00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:54,529
see if I just click up there there we go

00:20:52,129 --> 00:20:58,369
down the sidebar here I've us we can

00:20:54,529 --> 00:21:00,739
also filter by other dimensions on the

00:20:58,369 --> 00:21:03,289
data so these this is actually just a

00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:05,419
taxonomy vocabulary that we're filtering

00:21:03,289 --> 00:21:08,629
on terms that the data is tagged by as

00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:12,979
you can see as we filter the the map is

00:21:08,629 --> 00:21:14,839
updated and the the totals down the

00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:17,690
right-hand side here and the timeline at

00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:18,979
the bottom are also all updated

00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:21,139
dynamically and that's the kind of stuff

00:21:18,979 --> 00:21:23,920
we can achieve with JavaScript because

00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:28,380
it's super awesome and

00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:28,380
that's all from me thank you very much

00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:40,510
hi so my name is Patrick Hayes I'm with

00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:43,480
Stanford University and I'm going to be

00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:46,150
co-presenting with Joseph here and we're

00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:49,240
going to be talking about kind of more

00:21:46,150 --> 00:21:52,390
advanced mapping techniques we've both

00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:55,390
being along with David smiley who works

00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:57,280
on Apache Solr been developing a

00:21:55,390 --> 00:22:00,040
technique for building maps that scale

00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:02,650
to millions or actually many millions of

00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:04,980
data points and actually be able to

00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:06,850
represent that data to users so

00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,370
basically the problem is how do you

00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:13,090
build a map with millions of data points

00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:14,890
and traditionally what Tom talked about

00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:16,150
what's rasterizing it generally what you

00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:18,880
do when you want to build big maps is

00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:21,910
rasterizing them in tiles and that is

00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,040
great but it doesn't work if you want if

00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:26,680
you're constantly updating that data if

00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,840
it's real time data or if you want it to

00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:32,040
be searchable or filterable by end users

00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:34,270
so there's basically two problems here

00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,370
that we have been working on a solution

00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:38,350
for and the first program was

00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:41,230
cartographic how do you graphically show

00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:44,590
a user with millions of data points and

00:22:41,230 --> 00:22:46,560
this is not a good answer so we're going

00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:49,480
to be showing you two different ways of

00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:51,220
shove making a map with millions of data

00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,170
points or hundreds of thousands of data

00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,660
points that actually shows all the data

00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:58,510
and yet also makes a really clean

00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:01,030
interface um the second problem is

00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:02,290
technical how do you actually scale to

00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:04,630
millions of data points while keeping

00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:07,810
the map searchable and filterable and

00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:10,270
basically trying to make it live and in

00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:13,120
real time so the answer to these

00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:15,190
questions is to use a search engine like

00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,460
Apache Solr you could the same

00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:21,220
methodology could be applied to using

00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:24,070
elastic search or sphinx or any other

00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:26,560
search engine that has grouping or

00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:28,240
clustering abilities I think he'll show

00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:29,770
you it with my sequel to it's a little

00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,760
bit slower but the fundamental idea

00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:36,190
works so the basic idea is to use a jew

00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,800
hash grid and so what geo hash is is

00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:39,420
based

00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:42,150
it's two different things at once it's a

00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:47,250
grid of the whole world we slice the

00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:49,380
world into 24 bits and we take each of

00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:51,840
those slices and we subdivide those into

00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:54,240
more so basically down here is an

00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:57,900
example geo hash at the bottom by you

00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,300
for Pru and as that what that means is

00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:03,270
that each each character along that geo

00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:04,650
hash is making the grids smaller and

00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:05,610
smaller and smaller and smaller and

00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:08,520
further and further and further

00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:11,010
subdividing it and once you get to about

00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,470
a length of nine gio hashes length nine

00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:17,640
gio hashes about the size of about the

00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:19,380
size of a pizza so the which means that

00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,110
you can actually use geo hashes as both

00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:25,140
coordinates really long Joe hashes but

00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:26,880
you can also use geo hashes as bins so

00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,290
at shorter things you could think of geo

00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,360
hashes of bins that you can fit stuff

00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:32,910
into and that's exactly the property

00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:36,300
that we take advantage of in order to

00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:38,850
index or stuff into either solar or my

00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:42,510
sequel so basically what you do for any

00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:44,370
given record you create nine fields one

00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:46,140
through nine and you simply take the

00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:47,880
longest geo hash and put that into

00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,740
number nine and that works as a

00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,120
coordinate and then you go all the way

00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:54,600
up getting less and less and less

00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,130
accurate but most interesting more and

00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:00,320
more and more points fit into these

00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:04,070
common bins and then once you have that

00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:05,940
you can use faceting so for example

00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,880
depending on your zoom level you're

00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:11,790
going to want to facet on a different

00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:13,710
accuracy with more or less bins and so

00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:15,210
basically what you can do is use when

00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:18,420
you're displaying the map you query

00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:21,840
solar saying give me the top 50 results

00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:23,670
but also facet on these geo hash bins so

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,820
you get a summary count of everything

00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:28,500
that the user is looking at and I'll

00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:31,320
show you what it looks like and then

00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,540
finally once you have your facets into

00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:35,390
these bins you can retranslate those

00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:38,460
back into latitude and longitude and

00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:43,260
from there I can show you a live demo of

00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:48,720
what this looks like so

00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:52,200
zoom out so so what we have here is the

00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:56,390
green is a actual results coming from

00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:58,920
Apache Solr and the red is a heat map of

00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:01,740
this is a database this is the data set

00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:04,520
of about fifty thousand results and so

00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:07,230
we show the user the top 50 most

00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:09,270
relevant results but we also show them a

00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:11,310
representation of that other fifty

00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:14,100
thousand that they're not seeing as this

00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:17,880
heat map and so if I do a search for for

00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:20,490
example earthquake this is a this is a

00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:27,120
database of peer-reviewed articles

00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:34,230
written about geological topics see this

00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:37,950
will work Internet's a bit slow there we

00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:40,650
go so for earthquakes we can see there's

00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:43,320
a lot of results but interestingly if I

00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:45,000
go over to so the green is the most

00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,880
relevant results which are fully

00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,820
interactive and the red is the summary

00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:53,220
data which we get from these facets and

00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:55,920
so for example if we look at Taiwan over

00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,290
here we see that it and basically the

00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,900
red invites the user to zoom in to see

00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:02,400
more data saying we couldn't present all

00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,500
the data to you because there's just too

00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,360
much data but what we can do is we can

00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:09,260
suggest that there is more data here to

00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:12,870
find so then if I do zoom in to Taiwan

00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:14,730
we actually get the all the green data

00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:17,430
points which presents the actual day

00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:19,410
that Birchers didn't so and Joseph is

00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:22,020
going to show you another example of

00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:23,100
this and it's just the same methodology

00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,800
but just a slightly different

00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:28,380
visualization of a way of accurately

00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:34,290
displaying millions or hundreds

00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:37,830
thousands or millions of data points yes

00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:39,720
oh hi I'm Joseph Dominic da co and I've

00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:42,900
been working basically on the same topic

00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:47,310
the last year so let me get the

00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:49,380
presentation started yeah so this is

00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:52,710
just another way of representing in this

00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:55,170
case 100,000 items that we put on Drupal

00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:56,790
jobs recruiter installation using

00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:59,160
server-side clustering

00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:01,700
and this is how this is how it basically

00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,960
looks like so whenever you zoom out

00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:06,180
points will be aggregated on the server

00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:09,210
side and the JavaScript library will

00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:11,580
just issue a bounding box request in

00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:13,860
order to fetch the that data that is

00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:17,880
available on on the current view port

00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:22,380
and the server side will based on the on

00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:24,210
the configuration return the results in

00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:27,680
order to allow the user to drill down

00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:30,330
the data and now we are in Portland and

00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,850
we are seeing in this case I'm just

00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:35,310
outputting the ID of the items but

00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:37,470
definitely as you've seen before you

00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:41,280
would just do a pop-up and show all the

00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:43,620
data that's relevant to the user so how

00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,380
did we go there I was writing my master

00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:50,610
thesis on server-side clustering with

00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:53,730
Drupal and so I was researching cluster

00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:57,540
analysis geo visualization and came up

00:28:53,730 --> 00:29:00,710
with the ideas that already were talked

00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:03,960
about in the solar community so as

00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:06,510
Patrick I decided to use to you hash in

00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,030
knowledge in order to group items based

00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:11,220
on the zoom level and take advantage of

00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:15,540
the gradual precision property that you

00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:17,520
has to hash has of course Drupal is a is

00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:19,980
a great contrabass and we have already

00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:23,010
seen that there exists quite a number of

00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:25,380
modules so the second tasks that I would

00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:28,800
take a bond was integrate into the

00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:30,480
existing Drupal stack so this is

00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:32,370
basically what they came up with I will

00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,750
not go into details because we're very

00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:37,260
short on time but it basically

00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:40,830
integrates in geo field views to you

00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:44,100
Jason view Search API and solar so that

00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:46,020
was quite a big task and this is

00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,300
positive at some point but this also

00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:51,540
requires a lot of glue code to get it

00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:55,860
working and the performance evaluation

00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:57,390
shows that a damned PHP implementation

00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:00,780
of the class during algorithm clearly

00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:04,710
won't work the MySQL clustering already

00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:06,690
works up to like 100,000 items then then

00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:09,570
the clustering within the database will

00:30:06,690 --> 00:30:10,290
get slow as its prayer requests we don't

00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:12,690
really store

00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:15,840
himself we just have the hierarchical

00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:19,140
spatial information present and but

00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,420
fortunately we have great tools outside

00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:23,490
of Drupal like solar and so we can have

00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:25,650
quite performance class during with the

00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:28,110
solar engine and and there's already

00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:30,780
cool connectors for like search api and

00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:34,800
apache solr for for integrating drupal

00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:37,080
into the solar engine finally I would

00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:39,300
like to share some lessons that I've

00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:41,940
learned doing during this journey

00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:44,970
writing matisse assange EU cluster which

00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:48,930
is integration is great because you can

00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:50,880
take advantage of so many modules you

00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,680
can use leaf lettuce visualization

00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:54,600
component but you could also use open

00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:57,990
layers of gmaps that's perfectly

00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:01,560
possible but at the other hand at the up

00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:03,120
at the other hand side Drupal really

00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:07,200
shines at being a content management

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,060
framework and some if you process real

00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,920
big data in Drupal things are getting

00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:14,790
slower and slower especially if you try

00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:17,460
to integrate with views you guys might

00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:20,040
might know that loading fields and

00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,750
loading entities is really slow so keep

00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:25,620
that in mind when working with data in

00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:27,570
Drupal and as as rick was saying in the

00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:30,360
very beginning you should really think

00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:32,880
about the story you want to tell and how

00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,860
the use case will work out and not just

00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,770
have a look at what technologies are

00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:39,870
there but rather get your story clear in

00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:43,710
order to make customers happy and make a

00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:46,410
successful business of course yeah so

00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:49,290
prioritize you can also rasterize data

00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:51,800
have a look at map box and that's for me

00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,800
thank you

00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:10,610
hi so my name is Brandon and I'm a

00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:12,350
developer of phase 2 and i'm one of the

00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:13,610
maintainer zuv geo field and a couple of

00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:17,090
other mapping modules this is my

00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:19,070
coworker Nate he is also obviously as a

00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:20,780
co-worker would be another developer or

00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:23,600
a developer you what do you doing face

00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:25,130
to do i do a lot of coding and i do a

00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,440
lot of sort of figuring out what our

00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:28,610
clients want out of things and so

00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,560
brandon and i work really closely

00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:32,630
especially in the mapping space to sort

00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:34,490
of figure out how to tie these things

00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:37,040
together and one of the things that

00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:38,720
we're sort of learning is we kind of get

00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,100
more and more involved in doing

00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,050
interesting mapping projects for our

00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:43,580
clients is that there are not that many

00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:46,190
people in the drupal world who are

00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,970
helping to to work on mapping but

00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:49,250
they're doing some really interesting

00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:50,690
things and so part of what i wanted to

00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:52,190
do is get involved a sort of help bring

00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:54,020
some more sunlight to this and sort of

00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:55,370
show all the cool things that these guys

00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:57,260
are doing and also get some more other

00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:59,300
people to help join the cool kid

00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:02,150
community here sir yeah definitely I

00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,950
mean we we really don't I mean I can't

00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:05,150
speak for everyone I suppose but we

00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,530
don't really want to be the cool kid

00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:11,270
community club you know like that's

00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:13,250
that's kind of dumb and you know we you

00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:14,480
know we want to have other people come

00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:17,060
in and join because I mean frankly

00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,070
maintaining this long list of modules is

00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:21,350
kind of hard you know and you know we

00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:23,780
you know more hands make lighter work

00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:26,750
basically so what we're kind of looking

00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:28,250
for is or we kind of want to talk a

00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:31,310
little bit about just community in

00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:33,890
general and how to you know how to get

00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:35,060
involved who to talk to and then some

00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:39,800
things that we kind of want to do to

00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:41,450
expand out so you know besides the

00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:49,610
people on the panel oh and if your

00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:53,690
name's on the slide surprise so we have

00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:58,460
a few other people that so love is love

00:33:53,690 --> 00:34:03,590
in the audience somewhere no yes I guess

00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:06,560
not okay so i think shout is a company

00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:08,470
here in portland and love specifically

00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,270
maintains the leaflet module what

00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:13,750
another data visual or mapping

00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:17,200
visualization map or module and it's a

00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:20,740
really interesting library so ranier I

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:25,030
know I've seen ranier around I don't hey

00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:26,530
what's up I see you Rainier has also

00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:29,619
been involved with the mapping community

00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:31,540
for a while he's maintainer of the WMS

00:34:29,619 --> 00:34:35,220
module and has done a lot of really

00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:39,399
interesting work doing doing some neat

00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:43,359
neat mapping community things and then

00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:46,570
Jeff who's over there hey Jeff it Jeff

00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:50,679
is another developer who's the

00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:51,760
maintainer of view co Jason and my

00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:56,290
understanding is looking for a co

00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:58,090
maintainer so yeah so I mean we're all

00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:59,440
you know all of us you know have a lot

00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:01,090
of things that were you know we're

00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,670
involved with and would you know would

00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:07,090
love you know to talk to you if about

00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:09,940
any of the particular aspects of mapping

00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:12,160
that were involved with so you know if

00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,960
you're interested in like making it look

00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,220
pretty like with a visualization are

00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,650
showing something interesting in that

00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:19,060
you know we're happy to talk about that

00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,290
you know we're also happy to talk about

00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:22,180
you know how do I get all this

00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:24,070
information into Drupal and to do it in

00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:25,780
a sane matter that doesn't you know

00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:29,770
break laws of space and time and that

00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:33,070
sort of thing from a community building

00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:35,050
standpoint we had a few ideas as far as

00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:38,170
like what we kind of wanted to to bridge

00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:39,460
out and do yeah and I think when we're

00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:41,200
sort of looking into you know there's a

00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,520
couple of pieces we want to make mapping

00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,470
more accessible for people because

00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,210
mapping is really cool and really useful

00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:47,680
and a lot of people have you know sort

00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:49,810
of geographic problems they're trying to

00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,369
show and this panel is from all over the

00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:53,619
world I mean it just sort of shows what

00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:54,670
a big problem this is and one of the

00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:56,440
things we want to do is sort of make

00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:57,640
that that onboarding a lot easier and

00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,960
his Rick showed that it's a little

00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,369
overwhelming when you look at all the

00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,349
modules tied together and how they're

00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:04,119
wired and all of that so we're really

00:36:02,349 --> 00:36:05,920
interested in sort of develop developing

00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:08,050
better sort of on ramps and starter kits

00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,820
and that's I mean than anybody of any

00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,290
sort of experience level could really

00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,490
help us with and if you want us to kind

00:36:11,290 --> 00:36:13,990
of help you walk you through your first

00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:15,550
project that could be a great way for us

00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:16,960
to document some of the starter kits and

00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:18,280
some of the things that we as people

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,720
have been doing a lot of mapping may

00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,940
over

00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,890
get some of the impediments yeah i mean

00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,930
if you've ever built something with any

00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:26,430
of our modules and you had like five

00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:28,290
wtf's in the middle of something you

00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:31,830
know please you know let us know because

00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:33,119
we may not may not just be obvious yeah

00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:34,680
and then the other thing is the way the

00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,810
documentation is currently sort of

00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,940
describes doesn't really show you what

00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:40,349
sort of active what's widely used and

00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,849
sort of which pieces should fit together

00:36:40,349 --> 00:36:43,619
how and so one of the things that we've

00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:45,599
been working on is sort of developing a

00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:47,099
sort of better evaluation matrix just to

00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,840
sort of let people know what's active

00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:50,369
what's what ideas are sort of being used

00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:52,140
by many people and there might be a lot

00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:53,790
of documentation on and what things

00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:55,080
might need you to sort of step in a

00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:56,580
little bit more and say hey this is a

00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,320
pretty interesting and unique problem

00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:59,670
that I have and I might need to get more

00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,900
help around building that out as a

00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:02,760
module or helping to get the community

00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:06,540
more involved and helping maintain that

00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:10,050
or make that interesting definitely yeah

00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:12,140
so I guess the the very short version of

00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:15,300
it is you know it takes a village and

00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:17,040
you know we we need your help and you

00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:19,170
know we would love to really get the

00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,730
people involved it you know you don't

00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:22,320
have to be a coder you know if you own a

00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:23,790
business you know you probably have

00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,130
people who are coding for you you can

00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:28,020
have them do it you know that's the easy

00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:30,930
way honestly but you know if you're not

00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:32,790
like that then you know if you're just

00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:35,670
interested in the subject in the in the

00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:36,930
problem space you know you can you know

00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,790
you can go through and read

00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:40,710
documentation you can you know test

00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:42,540
things you can come up with new ideas I

00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:44,220
mean you know you know we we enjoy

00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:46,530
coming up with we enjoy coming up with

00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,910
stuff but you know we can't think of

00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:50,900
everything you know if there's a problem

00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:54,119
that you know you think might be more

00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:57,390
broadly than like your specific use case

00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:59,730
then you know you know we love to tackle

00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:01,200
those kinds of problems yeah and I think

00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:03,210
this is the other thing about mapping is

00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,320
sort of a connection to a wider world I

00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,790
mean as you just saw from all the

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,200
technologies that are being used and

00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:08,430
utilized there they're all sorts of

00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,650
interesting things you'll get to know

00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:12,359
about you know postgres is often used as

00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:14,339
a database back-end you know there's an

00:38:12,359 --> 00:38:16,140
enormous variety of very powerful

00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:18,150
JavaScript libraries that come into play

00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:20,250
here and they're all these high-end

00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,630
professional systems like ArcGIS and

00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:23,400
things like that behind the scenes that

00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:24,990
are creating the sort of source layers

00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,609
and base maps that are being used and

00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:28,470
imported to decorate and put your data

00:38:26,609 --> 00:38:30,119
onto and then they're the user interface

00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:31,859
tools and Drupal itself to actually

00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:33,660
decorate an add data to those maps and

00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:35,520
all those things are interesting and we

00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,200
could use your particular area of

00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,660
interest or expertise and you could see

00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,130
see the world this way so we'd love to

00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:43,950
have your help and we hope you're as

00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:47,250
excited about this as we definitely is

00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:49,170
that our last life yes so how can you

00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:50,339
help actually I mean it's fun to say

00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:53,910
that we need your help and then not give

00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:58,200
you any follow-up information but so

00:38:53,910 --> 00:39:00,060
there is a group group drupal.org /

00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:03,540
location and mapping that's kind of been

00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:06,030
the central location or it's it's been a

00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:09,510
location anyway for for a lot of the

00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:11,810
overall community discussion around just

00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:13,920
mapping and that kind of thing I and

00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:15,869
this is going to going to be the the

00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,450
touching point where we're going to

00:39:15,869 --> 00:39:20,580
start looking at revamping what's there

00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:23,099
and trying to you know as a community

00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:27,420
expand and just make the mapping in

00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:29,369
Drupal world a better place yeah yeah

00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:30,690
thank you all and come to grab us

00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:36,750
afterwards and we'd love to talk you at

00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:39,089
the all thanks yeah sure so we do have a

00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:41,190
little bit time and we wanted to do a

00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:43,920
Q&A so if you want to queue up here and

00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:45,089
ask questions otherwise you know we can

00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,869
definitely talk about whatever you want

00:39:45,089 --> 00:39:50,130
um yeah great I learned some things and

00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:52,890
I hang out with you a lot to the last

00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:56,670
few days I know about a year ago we had

00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:58,650
office hours yeah I spent some time and

00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:01,290
I see during it I think would be a

00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:03,390
really good idea to hear now plan a date

00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:06,560
and time for our next office hours and

00:40:03,390 --> 00:40:08,930
then allow people who I

00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,760
now behind me who are all going to go to

00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:13,640
Drupal or can download modules and

00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:16,700
experiment with it and then in two weeks

00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:19,010
from now or so we meet an IRC and we

00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:21,830
start assigning tasks because yes

00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:23,570
there's a lot of stuff to do but we have

00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:26,480
to put names to who's doing the

00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:28,760
documentation who's going to do a sample

00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,100
install or a sample distribution of

00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:33,860
sample website whatever we have to put

00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:35,870
names to tasks because yeah we do have a

00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,490
massive amount of modules and we can do

00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:39,920
really really really cool stuff with it

00:40:37,490 --> 00:40:42,110
and we just have to market ourselves a

00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,580
little bit better but it's going to

00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:44,960
require some work and I think there's

00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:48,110
plenty of people who want to spend

00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,480
diamond and do work but we have to be a

00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:52,810
bit more specific after after this I

00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:55,460
know what the FU agenda with you I

00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:57,350
couldn't agree more with everything that

00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,330
you just said so that sounds fantastic

00:40:57,350 --> 00:41:08,120
and if you guys are okay with like two

00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:13,160
weeks then here we go on IRC on freenode

00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:15,170
net pound drupal dash geo is I think

00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:17,320
there's a lot of discussions that happen

00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:19,910
there so if you're interested in mapping

00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:24,980
that's generally a place on IRC to come

00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:28,400
hang out I really like the peace the

00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:30,530
geeks for peace Matt and I work for

00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,390
action against hunger and that's kind of

00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:35,060
similar to that interactivity that we

00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:37,100
want could you give us an idea of I kind

00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:40,010
of manage developers I don't at myself

00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:45,650
how many hours was that to kind of

00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:50,510
develop and implement so how many hours

00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:54,650
I in building that map I put quite a lot

00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:56,570
of hours into developing it's not built

00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:59,080
so there's a caveat here it's not built

00:41:56,570 --> 00:42:01,490
on top of the existing leaflet module

00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,230
the existing leaflet modules great at

00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:05,450
what it does but it's a little bit

00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:08,300
limited if you want to provide that kind

00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:13,100
of integration with other libraries and

00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:14,630
stuff so I have and I we've eventually

00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:16,700
arranged to meet up with the leaflet

00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:18,289
maintainer maintained as hopefully after

00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:22,459
this discussion and habit

00:42:18,289 --> 00:42:25,279
go with them I i I've put quite a lot of

00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:27,410
work into kind of prototyping a maybe a

00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:29,479
leaflet to point o or a way that we

00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:31,369
could start doing that to basically

00:42:29,479 --> 00:42:33,109
provide I've called at leaflet framework

00:42:31,369 --> 00:42:34,880
but provide an underlying framework so

00:42:33,109 --> 00:42:37,189
you can builds more richer more

00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,819
interactive stuff on top of the leaflet

00:42:37,189 --> 00:42:42,919
module that all of that work is actually

00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:44,539
up on github right now it's under the

00:42:42,919 --> 00:42:46,459
affinity bridge github account and it's

00:42:44,539 --> 00:42:47,719
called leaflet framework so go check

00:42:46,459 --> 00:42:50,569
that out that will certainly shave a

00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:51,589
bunch of hours off and definitely paying

00:42:50,569 --> 00:42:53,689
me if you have any questions

00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:56,689
documentation is probably minimal it's a

00:42:53,689 --> 00:42:59,299
prototype but as far as like to take

00:42:56,689 --> 00:43:04,880
leaflet framework and build what a demo

00:42:59,299 --> 00:43:06,679
today I'd say 20 hours 30 hours yeah

00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,319
because for us obviously our budget are

00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:11,359
limited so yeah what we ended up doing

00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:13,489
is just going for an M bed and using

00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:15,709
matte box and using a very simple you

00:43:13,489 --> 00:43:19,309
know yeah just for like an interim

00:43:15,709 --> 00:43:21,499
solution but from my point of view

00:43:19,309 --> 00:43:23,059
having something kind of a bit more

00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:25,009
developed like you're describing that we

00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:27,409
can plug in and very user-friendly is

00:43:25,009 --> 00:43:29,719
just would be amazing for nonprofits

00:43:27,409 --> 00:43:31,880
like around yeah totally and i know i

00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:33,289
know the piece geeks guys are I mean

00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,059
there is overlap there's other projects

00:43:33,289 --> 00:43:36,979
out there who shaheedi is one of them

00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:38,479
and there was another guy that we talked

00:43:36,979 --> 00:43:41,329
to at the boss I didn't get to talk to

00:43:38,479 --> 00:43:42,709
but I hope to meet up with him later who

00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:45,679
is developing a similar kind of

00:43:42,709 --> 00:43:47,029
distribution i think in drupal there's a

00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:48,890
lot of overlap there and I know the

00:43:47,029 --> 00:43:51,769
piece geeks guys are quite interested in

00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:55,239
talking with others and collaborating as

00:43:51,769 --> 00:43:55,239
well great thanks

00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:05,769
yes just like my point of view on this

00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:11,230
discussion about sustainability of

00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:13,119
mapping modules it obviously each of us

00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:15,760
we are developers we are scratching our

00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:19,180
own niche and we already do quite a

00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:21,910
decent job in integrating against each

00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:23,740
other like formally if you you really

00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:27,339
should check out the book by Alan Pat

00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:29,440
solo and forget that a name like drupal

00:44:27,339 --> 00:44:32,289
mapping it's already two years old but

00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:35,619
it's still very accurate and it talks

00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:38,710
about how we shifted from very

00:44:35,619 --> 00:44:41,260
monolithic mapping systems into like an

00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:43,869
ecosystem that that is basically two you

00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:46,269
field and integration and modules that

00:44:43,869 --> 00:44:48,640
work quite well together but what I

00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:51,640
think that what we really would need is

00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:54,460
like a process management so somebody

00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:57,609
who's not a developer and who is

00:44:54,460 --> 00:45:00,549
passionate for for mapping come talk to

00:44:57,609 --> 00:45:03,789
us or leads that process in order to

00:45:00,549 --> 00:45:07,119
just get us going and plan the future

00:45:03,789 --> 00:45:10,329
together because yeah we we are tight on

00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:13,029
skeletal as always and mapping is it is

00:45:10,329 --> 00:45:16,029
usually just like an extra nice to have

00:45:13,029 --> 00:45:19,240
so the project like the budgets are not

00:45:16,029 --> 00:45:21,339
that big in mapping with Drupal yeah

00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:22,779
just a slight addition to that it's nice

00:45:21,339 --> 00:45:26,140
having the only Mike over here and not

00:45:22,779 --> 00:45:28,140
having to pass that around you know as

00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:30,549
much as it pains me to say you know

00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:32,349
having eight or nine developers together

00:45:30,549 --> 00:45:36,549
we could probably use a project manager

00:45:32,349 --> 00:45:37,779
or two so and I just have to say that

00:45:36,549 --> 00:45:40,150
one of the things I'm really optimistic

00:45:37,779 --> 00:45:42,940
about about Drupal mapping is the state

00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:44,980
of it right now is it's now an ecosystem

00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:47,319
as opposed to the monolithic location

00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:49,319
gmat module it seems really seems like

00:45:47,319 --> 00:45:52,720
we're gonna actually a really awesome

00:45:49,319 --> 00:45:54,970
state right now where we have a lot of

00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:56,829
the bases covered and there is an

00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:59,740
ecosystem of developers trying new

00:45:56,829 --> 00:46:00,880
things and and also the ecosystem of

00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:03,759
developers that are committed to

00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,410
interoperability which is really awesome

00:46:03,759 --> 00:46:10,240
and a little bit different than what we

00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:12,009
had in Drupal 6 so yeah hi I appreciate

00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,930
your comment that it's very difficult to

00:46:12,009 --> 00:46:18,220
find specific answers to specific

00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:19,569
use case questions about mapping and it

00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:21,369
seems like whenever I come to a Drupal

00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:24,579
presentation I'm mapping is always about

00:46:21,369 --> 00:46:27,550
taking points and putting on map points

00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:29,410
of data but in the case of a traditional

00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:32,380
like an election map red states blue

00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:34,119
states I know how to do it in JavaScript

00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:36,640
but is there a Drupal is there a

00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:38,410
recommended Drupal way to get to that or

00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,849
a set of modules that we should be

00:46:38,410 --> 00:46:44,680
looking at to do something like that

00:46:39,849 --> 00:46:46,180
sure so the geo filled module is is it's

00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:50,950
one of the ones that I maintain and it

00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:53,050
is a it stores wkt values so you can

00:46:50,950 --> 00:46:55,329
drop in you know anything from a point

00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:56,920
to you know the entire United States of

00:46:55,329 --> 00:46:58,480
America I wouldn't recommend dropping

00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,309
the entire United States of America into

00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,980
one field but you certainly could do

00:47:00,309 --> 00:47:04,630
that if you wanted and then from like a

00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:06,460
display stand point you should be able

00:47:04,630 --> 00:47:08,470
to show that either through open layer

00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:11,740
the openlayers module the leaflet module

00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:12,819
and if you need to do something custom

00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:14,170
which if you're talking about like an

00:47:12,819 --> 00:47:15,849
election map at this point you would

00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:18,369
probably need something custom on top of

00:47:15,849 --> 00:47:21,790
that what was the module you mentioned a

00:47:18,369 --> 00:47:23,740
geo filled GE oh if I yield gia filled

00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:26,829
with openlayers hmm and that will like

00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:29,140
you to take a state and then yes the

00:47:26,829 --> 00:47:30,369
outline of that and have it clickable or

00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:33,400
turn change the color of it or something

00:47:30,369 --> 00:47:37,750
like that yes do we have anything that

00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:38,680
will take like census data or anything

00:47:37,750 --> 00:47:45,940
like that where you don't have to

00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:47,079
directly put it into the yeah so so what

00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:50,619
you could do is you could there's a

00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:53,619
module out there called geo coder and it

00:47:50,619 --> 00:47:55,720
can take you can upload files like if

00:47:53,619 --> 00:47:57,910
you have a KML file you could use that

00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:59,859
to basically you have a file field where

00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:01,990
you upload your kml and you have geo

00:47:59,859 --> 00:48:04,599
coder which translate that kml into a

00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:06,640
geo field and the affinity bridge folks

00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:09,819
who are sitting just here we're working

00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:12,010
on shapefile integration so doing

00:48:09,819 --> 00:48:14,740
something similar where you can go from

00:48:12,010 --> 00:48:16,780
a shape file to a geo field so and I

00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:19,079
think we have support for GPX files for

00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:21,849
KML files they're working on shapefiles

00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:23,710
so there's there's a lot of options up

00:48:21,849 --> 00:48:25,960
there for getting data in and you know

00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:27,069
we support points lines polygons I think

00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:29,650
very soon

00:48:27,069 --> 00:48:31,989
when GOP HP goes to 2 point 0 will have

00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:34,449
3d stuff in geo field to so that'll be

00:48:31,989 --> 00:48:38,589
very cool okay thank you my can I just

00:48:34,449 --> 00:48:42,959
quickly add so that was you covering a

00:48:38,589 --> 00:48:42,959
lot of the storage of the data

00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:47,380
traditionally like rendering things

00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:49,479
other than markers on a map that can has

00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:50,519
been difficult because your browser the

00:48:49,479 --> 00:48:53,109
browser's have been particularly

00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:55,390
efficient at rendering lots points and

00:48:53,109 --> 00:48:57,039
when you get polygons it's like one

00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:58,599
polygon could be equivalent to 100

00:48:57,039 --> 00:48:59,829
markers and there's just one polygon if

00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:01,869
you have every state it can be very

00:48:59,829 --> 00:49:04,690
heavy browsers getting much better

00:49:01,869 --> 00:49:06,999
though these days and you can obviously

00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:09,269
simplify a lot of these polygons of you

00:49:06,999 --> 00:49:12,160
can apply some constraints to your data

00:49:09,269 --> 00:49:14,289
that's totally things like the election

00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:18,759
map or if you want to do like choropleth

00:49:14,289 --> 00:49:21,130
map map or more thematic mapping I don't

00:49:18,759 --> 00:49:23,680
have any concrete solutions for you

00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:26,319
right now in Drupal but that's kind of

00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:27,880
where I was hoping and hoping to severe

00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:30,539
head towards I've got some examples

00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:32,829
outside a Drupal using things like d3.js

00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:37,779
which are great tools for thematic

00:49:32,829 --> 00:49:40,569
mapping so yeah keep keep an eye on that

00:49:37,779 --> 00:49:43,900
one and if you didn't want to not to

00:49:40,569 --> 00:49:46,119
keep adding to this answer but you can

00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:48,430
also avoid just storing it a triple in

00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:51,759
general I mean you can load like a KML

00:49:48,430 --> 00:49:53,199
file or something like that and and not

00:49:51,759 --> 00:49:54,609
run it through the database in general

00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:56,979
and just plop it straight onto whatever

00:49:54,609 --> 00:50:01,599
map and that may be more performant for

00:49:56,979 --> 00:50:03,420
you depending on your use case this is a

00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:07,839
follow-up to that question and that is

00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:12,459
is there any tool Drupal or not that

00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:14,650
lets you just click and create the the

00:50:12,459 --> 00:50:19,299
boundaries of a polygon that you could

00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:20,259
use in a drupal solution I guess Tom do

00:50:19,299 --> 00:50:21,880
you want to talk about your awesome

00:50:20,259 --> 00:50:26,920
leaflet input because that's pretty

00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:29,400
awesome yeah so they have been a bunch

00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:31,690
of modules that provide basically input

00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,550
into into a map click

00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:36,940
can like WYSIWYG style input but with a

00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:39,609
map I am responsible for leaflet widget

00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:42,849
which I apologize to everyone everyone

00:50:39,609 --> 00:50:44,230
right here I published about six months

00:50:42,849 --> 00:50:49,210
ago and then subsequently haven't

00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:51,640
touched I had some constructive feedback

00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:54,670
earlier today though that apparently if

00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:57,819
you bring in that so leaflet widget is

00:50:54,670 --> 00:51:01,050
uses leaflet library to handle the

00:50:57,819 --> 00:51:03,910
drawing and the map rendering and

00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:05,890
leaflets being leaflet and the leaflet

00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:08,710
draw extension have been an active

00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:10,750
development over the last 12 months and

00:51:08,710 --> 00:51:13,210
so a lot has changed between when I was

00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:14,380
working on leaflet widget and we're leaf

00:51:13,210 --> 00:51:15,730
that drawer is that today but I heard

00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:17,410
today that if you bring in the latest

00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:19,750
version leaflet draw and drop it in that

00:51:17,410 --> 00:51:22,810
leaflet widget module it still sort of

00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:24,069
works and I totally plan to bring

00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:27,040
everything up to speed now that there

00:51:24,069 --> 00:51:30,069
are actual final releases for leaflet

00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:31,990
draw so so a bit of a work in progress I

00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:34,240
think there's also no conveyors yeah in

00:51:31,990 --> 00:51:37,569
openlayers to point X there is the

00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,310
openlayers openlayers jus kno jus field

00:51:37,569 --> 00:51:41,140
openlayers module or is it openlayers

00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:43,329
duo field i forget which way it goes but

00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:45,010
basically it just provides a openlayers

00:51:43,329 --> 00:51:47,470
powered widget for geo field that lets

00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:50,890
you click and draw polygons or lines or

00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:53,050
whatever it is configurable so that

00:51:50,890 --> 00:51:58,270
works today it depends on would thank

00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:59,680
you yeah hey I was really interested in

00:51:58,270 --> 00:52:03,190
the work you were doing with the binning

00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:04,599
of aggregating and clustering and sort

00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:06,520
of following up on the question of about

00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:08,170
election stuff in states what I'd like

00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:09,819
to really be able to do is aggregate

00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:12,400
based on arbitrary boundaries like a

00:52:09,819 --> 00:52:13,960
city a county so I would have like a

00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,910
shape file or a well-known text that

00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:18,190
would define cities counties zip codes

00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:20,500
and be able to take point data and

00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:22,750
aggregate them into those buckets is

00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:24,940
there is there a path to that now or

00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:28,270
soon what's the best way to attack that

00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:30,190
so the way to do that is this there's a

00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,990
module that I started on a fitting

00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:34,750
bridge is taken up called sync post kiss

00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:35,650
and it's a little bit complicated it

00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:37,780
does require a little bit technical

00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:40,400
skills but I think it basically works

00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:43,190
basically the idea is that

00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:44,779
you import your data so post jess is a

00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:46,579
database where you can do spatial

00:52:44,779 --> 00:52:50,119
queries where you can do spatial queries

00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:52,549
like tell me I have this database of

00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:54,770
states and tell me which point this

00:52:52,549 --> 00:52:56,329
state is an orc I have a you know a

00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:59,180
county and tell me which counties this

00:52:56,329 --> 00:53:01,039
state is in and basically what you can

00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:04,220
do with that is you would have an extra

00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:05,900
field on your note saying like which

00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:08,000
state or which county or whatever and

00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:10,220
then basically you when you save the

00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,349
note it goes over into post chest via

00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:14,240
the sink post just module sink post just

00:53:12,349 --> 00:53:16,760
figures out what bin that belongs it

00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:18,170
into and then sends that back and I

00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:20,089
think I think there are some tutorial

00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:21,470
other is there a tutorial first sink

00:53:20,089 --> 00:53:24,589
post chest that tells you how to do that

00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:28,490
no no documentation is really like so

00:53:24,589 --> 00:53:30,140
apologies again yes so maybe this is a

00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:31,910
good good indication that we need to

00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:34,730
better documentation around sink post

00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:38,059
yes it's it's mainly kind of there for

00:53:34,730 --> 00:53:40,730
developers so you definitely don't get a

00:53:38,059 --> 00:53:42,859
point-and-click solution but kind of it

00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:45,260
is a problem that has me figured out and

00:53:42,859 --> 00:53:46,970
was it with a bit of grease you should

00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:53,240
be able to get it done great thank you

00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:56,150
yeah so so geocoded seems really

00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:59,049
promising I haven't used it before but

00:53:56,150 --> 00:54:01,279
are there is it a good solution for

00:53:59,049 --> 00:54:03,470
importing and being able to get

00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:07,430
geolocation data from like address

00:54:03,470 --> 00:54:09,349
fields or something like that yes is it

00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:11,299
does have any limitations like is it a

00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:12,859
PHP library that kind of connects via

00:54:11,299 --> 00:54:16,160
API or something like that to some

00:54:12,859 --> 00:54:18,170
external yeah so the service it connects

00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:19,849
into I think it has its pluggable so

00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:20,960
it's just uses a CTools plugin to say I

00:54:19,849 --> 00:54:23,510
think there's like seven different

00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:26,599
services now something like that so you

00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:28,940
can go to Google you can go to its yeah

00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:30,410
yeah who's gone now there's being so

00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:35,720
there's being there's yahoo there's a

00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:38,160
Yandex if you're in Russia there's math

00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:40,470
West yes there's a mapquest

00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:44,190
and there's a few other specialty ones

00:54:40,470 --> 00:54:47,520
for like pulling like exif data off of

00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:49,500
photos and that sort of thing from my

00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:52,829
research on on let's just say Google

00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:56,220
like I know they have a restriction / 24

00:54:52,829 --> 00:54:58,440
hours it's like 2,300 but a lot of a lot

00:54:56,220 --> 00:55:00,660
of these imports are that I'm hoping to

00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:03,030
do or going to be bigger than that are

00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:04,410
there ways that we can like kind of get

00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:05,940
around now I mean you guys have hundreds

00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:09,180
and thousands I now don't you don't use

00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:10,589
Google hey I would love to I would love

00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:12,510
to hear do you have any suggestions for

00:55:10,589 --> 00:55:15,569
paid services or anything like that that

00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:16,980
even if it wasn't paid libraries

00:55:15,569 --> 00:55:21,359
anything that we can use to help get

00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:23,490
that location data I think there's like

00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:27,930
one approach that you shift to

00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:29,670
client-side geocoding basically sure so

00:55:27,930 --> 00:55:31,829
the clients will will use their own

00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:33,930
eyepiece and that will get get you off

00:55:31,829 --> 00:55:36,809
the limits but if you really need to

00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:39,089
import big big data and geocode it I

00:55:36,809 --> 00:55:41,569
think you just go for a professional

00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:44,819
service right yeah at phase two we did a

00:55:41,569 --> 00:55:46,319
project a while ago where we had to deal

00:55:44,819 --> 00:55:50,760
with a similar problem as far as like

00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:52,109
importing a lot of data in and dealing

00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:54,420
with the geocoding and what we basically

00:55:52,109 --> 00:55:57,029
did was we batch processed it so we

00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:59,369
would only do X number of imports per

00:55:57,029 --> 00:56:00,990
day we had the luxury of being able to

00:55:59,369 --> 00:56:04,289
do that over the span of like a month

00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:06,059
versus having to do it every day it's

00:56:04,289 --> 00:56:07,710
not the most it's not the best solution

00:56:06,059 --> 00:56:10,950
in the world but I got the job done for

00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:13,230
what we needed I would echo the the

00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:15,119
client side if that's an option for you

00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:16,650
I it doesn't sound like that's your

00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:20,160
particular use case am I reading that

00:56:16,650 --> 00:56:23,220
wrong honestly I'm really hoping to use

00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:25,829
it more with like retail locations for

00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:29,160
brands and a lot of these brands have

00:56:25,829 --> 00:56:30,900
over 12,000 locations they usually want

00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:33,690
to be able to do the import and export

00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:35,490
themselves so like I can map it in the

00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:37,410
geolocation is where I die every time

00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:40,849
and I'm like Brian let me help you out

00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:43,559
all I'll dissect your you know your feed

00:56:40,849 --> 00:56:44,140
chop it up and then I try to run it and

00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:46,120
then

00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:48,060
I'm a kind of it yeah it sounds like you

00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:49,750
have an actually a relatively similar

00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:51,850
situation that we were talking about

00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:53,890
with our client we're like I mean like

00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:56,890
do those locations change all that often

00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:58,810
I don't once i'm in i'm good and i could

00:56:56,890 --> 00:57:01,090
I've got a great interface for being

00:56:58,810 --> 00:57:03,250
able to update really easy with Ajax and

00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:04,870
things like that but now it's it's

00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:06,700
mainly just the import/export that you

00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:09,160
usually do it only about once every

00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:11,740
quarter if that so it's really like that

00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:13,480
those use cases once every month but

00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:16,150
each one of them does this it's like

00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:17,590
routine death for me one of my pet

00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:19,180
projects that I kind of want to do in

00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:22,320
geo coder at some point is implement

00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:25,960
caching to help with that so if you have

00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:28,240
you know like if you're trying to encode

00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:29,530
like the same place several times then

00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:31,390
that would help with that particular

00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:35,950
thing because you went ping Google every

00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:38,980
time you would ping your own cash but my

00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:40,900
advice in your situation would be to do

00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:43,390
the batch processing that's not

00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:44,830
something that you would have to do a

00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:46,750
little bit of elbow grease on your site

00:57:44,830 --> 00:57:49,650
to get that code going that hasn't been

00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:54,280
pushed back out and apologized for that

00:57:49,650 --> 00:57:56,080
but but yeah I would bat try to batch

00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:57,580
cross that all over the span of a few

00:57:56,080 --> 00:58:01,300
days or weeks or whatever it takes to

00:57:57,580 --> 00:58:03,520
get that done okay and besides just add

00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:07,050
version do you do any of you have any

00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:09,510
experience or recommend any paid service

00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:14,020
besides the ten thousand dollars a month

00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:25,180
g Google geo locations I think do we

00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:32,460
support G names or not jeans um ask that

00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:32,460
man back there what it

00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:53,190
if

00:58:56,449 --> 00:59:11,880
and they don't have really limitations

00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:12,930
on it oh so basically be on the lookout

00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:16,469
for you guys are kind of actively

00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:19,349
working towards a module four is is that

00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:21,509
what I'm hearing that would be awesome

00:59:19,349 --> 00:59:25,829
I'll see you hey thanks a lot you guys

00:59:21,509 --> 00:59:27,539
yeah thank you well it's wanted to say

00:59:25,829 --> 00:59:28,799
thanks the scene what you guys are all

00:59:27,539 --> 00:59:31,559
doing in different ways with mapping is

00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:33,299
really incredible with the Apache Solr

00:59:31,559 --> 00:59:35,039
example that's something that we're

00:59:33,299 --> 00:59:36,420
playing with for the first time I just

00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:38,729
didn't know if there was a good resource

00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:41,249
for solar meets mapping for the demo

00:59:38,729 --> 00:59:42,569
like I saw the URL link was crazy long I

00:59:41,249 --> 00:59:44,759
didn't get it down I just didn't know if

00:59:42,569 --> 00:59:47,809
they were if it's on groups if it's on

00:59:44,759 --> 00:59:52,019
that Drupal group and just trying to

00:59:47,809 --> 00:59:55,349
like my my thesis contains hundreds of

00:59:52,019 --> 00:59:57,959
resources linked and in this particular

00:59:55,349 --> 01:00:00,150
presentation I've linked to the

00:59:57,959 --> 01:00:03,660
presentation by David's my leaf who is

01:00:00,150 --> 01:00:05,819
leucine solar developer okay he's

01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:08,880
talking about Solaris am I getting the

01:00:05,819 --> 01:00:12,299
like the what is your particular

01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:14,839
interest mapping a lot of data not

01:00:12,299 --> 01:00:17,279
caching using the mapping solar

01:00:14,839 --> 01:00:19,349
integration and Mike solar experience is

01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:22,640
not super extensive yeah so I think

01:00:19,349 --> 01:00:25,619
David smiley and his presentations or

01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:28,859
get a hold on him and and then enter

01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:31,170
enter two of us be great cool outside of

01:00:28,859 --> 01:00:33,449
that too i'll make sure that slides and

01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:36,259
all the links and stuff get somewhere on

01:00:33,449 --> 01:00:39,420
online will probably post them on the

01:00:36,259 --> 01:00:44,849
can't know the dribble con site and then

01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:47,249
on the group's drupal.org i'd also like

01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:48,779
to thank all of you guys for stepping up

01:00:47,249 --> 01:00:51,059
and especially when the dev see guys

01:00:48,779 --> 01:00:54,299
moved on i really appreciate all the

01:00:51,059 --> 01:00:57,119
work you've been doing in there can you

01:00:54,299 --> 01:01:00,269
tell us a bit about Matt boxed our meal

01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:04,199
and whether it has any relationship to

01:01:00,269 --> 01:01:05,700
Drupal any way that it could be used it

01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:07,250
does it build static

01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:12,540
is it a tool of a billion static Maps

01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:15,450
yeah oh sorry jump the gun so the matte

01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:17,640
box approach they I touched on the

01:01:15,450 --> 01:01:21,930
raster approach near us Rosie data into

01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:24,690
tiles and serve that up that is the

01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:29,310
angle that the dip seed mapbox guys are

01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:31,260
really going there I think where they

01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:33,810
were they really parted from Drupal and

01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:35,790
where their solutions aren't so ideal

01:01:33,810 --> 01:01:39,000
for Drupal has Drupal's a great content

01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:41,220
repository and it's we've got great crud

01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:45,030
right we can create update delete over

01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:47,460
and over again which actually poses

01:01:45,030 --> 01:01:48,510
quite a challenge for mapping stuff

01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:52,380
because there's quite a lot of

01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:54,480
processing over here involved with you

01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:56,940
don't put anything Zhaan a map or calc

01:01:54,480 --> 01:02:01,860
doing things like geo like intersection

01:01:56,940 --> 01:02:05,400
calculations or whatever so to sort of

01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:08,670
pull all that together the matte box

01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:12,650
approach doesn't doesn't work so well

01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:15,300
with dynamic data but could you use

01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:16,740
unless you had a specific use case let's

01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:18,770
uh no school district or something or

01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:22,680
some boundaries which weren't available

01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:25,470
through being or wherever could you use

01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:27,810
that Oh absolute and then use that as a

01:02:25,470 --> 01:02:30,180
base map and then throw your markers

01:02:27,810 --> 01:02:32,850
where else you want to do using Drupal

01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:34,530
yes and I if you come talk to me after I

01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:42,330
can show you some cool examples where we

01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:44,280
had on it Thanks yeah yeah sure so so

01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:46,170
Matt box is really good for like base

01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:50,070
layers and static overlays and that sort

01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:51,750
of thing and like when you're talking

01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:54,390
about it with Drupal specifically the

01:02:51,750 --> 01:02:57,000
openlayers module you can import

01:02:54,390 --> 01:02:59,010
mattebox layers on top of them are into

01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:02,970
that just like you can like Google or

01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:05,460
open street map layers as well leaflet

01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:08,610
also handles that I would also suggest

01:03:05,460 --> 01:03:12,120
checking out a project called a cart 0

01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:15,470
DB which is a very similar stacked

01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:17,730
amount box but it's

01:03:15,470 --> 01:03:19,859
live rendering versus having to

01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:21,599
pre-render things there's not fantastic

01:03:19,859 --> 01:03:23,069
Drupal integration support with it right

01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:26,400
now but it's a really interesting

01:03:23,069 --> 01:03:27,630
solution for doing you know more dynamic

01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,630
type of mapping where you need to do

01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:34,140
like filtering and that sort of thing

01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:36,599
yeah can I have one small sink I believe

01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:38,069
the way it works with mailbox one way it

01:03:36,599 --> 01:03:40,559
can work is that you can create your own

01:03:38,069 --> 01:03:42,329
canvas and you can publish that under a

01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:44,190
particular code well there's a little

01:03:42,329 --> 01:03:48,180
module called leaflet matte box if you

01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:50,069
put that code in into the dialogue there

01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:52,950
then you can use for instance a starter

01:03:50,069 --> 01:03:54,660
kit that I showed with that backdrop

01:03:52,950 --> 01:03:56,700
with that canvas in and it will

01:03:54,660 --> 01:04:06,390
superimpose the marks correctly on that

01:03:56,700 --> 01:04:08,040
canvas I work in the public sector a lot

01:04:06,390 --> 01:04:09,960
of governments federal state and local

01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:12,780
are using Drupal and their websites City

01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:14,849
of Austin has a Drupal site now but a

01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:16,950
lot of people working in government

01:04:14,849 --> 01:04:23,609
especially municipal local level are

01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:25,650
using ArcGIS I'm kind of curious maybe

01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:28,349
some relative comparisons between where

01:04:25,650 --> 01:04:30,690
ArcGIS is and what the Drupal offering

01:04:28,349 --> 01:04:32,910
is right now and what we need to occur

01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:35,160
with sort of some milestones or

01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:37,500
thresholds when you be reached with

01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:39,290
Drupal development to where it's almost

01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:41,700
on par where we might begin to see some

01:04:39,290 --> 01:04:45,270
local and county governments making that

01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:49,740
switch over um it depends on what you're

01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:53,160
using our for if you're using it to do

01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:56,819
like actual like more traditional GIS

01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:59,130
work like building buffering Maps doing

01:04:56,819 --> 01:05:01,710
like the analysis stuff I don't think

01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:03,630
Drupal will ever be a replacement for

01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:06,540
that I think really the competition is

01:05:03,630 --> 01:05:09,750
between quantum GIS and arcgis and

01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:11,760
they're kind of equivalent I think

01:05:09,750 --> 01:05:14,730
Drupal where drupal might shine is kind

01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:17,130
of more replacing not so I don't think

01:05:14,730 --> 01:05:21,000
Drupal will ever be something to replace

01:05:17,130 --> 01:05:24,210
a desktop GIS where it might be going in

01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:25,890
the future is kind of as a data

01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:28,890
repository

01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:31,890
and I could see the possibility at some

01:05:28,890 --> 01:05:33,870
point in the future of using Drupal as

01:05:31,890 --> 01:05:36,900
your database at record for storing

01:05:33,870 --> 01:05:39,270
geospatial data where then you might

01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:41,850
have quantum GIS or ArcGIS plug into

01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:44,970
that but they are kind of slightly

01:05:41,850 --> 01:05:47,970
separate domains i would say does that

01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:50,160
make sense can i just i'm not super

01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:52,490
familiar with arcgis but i know recently

01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:56,850
in the last 12 months they've released a

01:05:52,490 --> 01:06:00,330
javascript api they have a server stack

01:05:56,850 --> 01:06:03,450
i believe and the javascript api there

01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:05,220
is definitely a lot of overlap with the

01:06:03,450 --> 01:06:06,840
stuff that is being done with like

01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:10,590
leaflet or open layers and their

01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:13,050
javascript api and also they have a

01:06:10,590 --> 01:06:17,010
rastering component that would compete

01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:19,140
with matte box as well so without I

01:06:17,010 --> 01:06:22,590
haven't actually played with myself I've

01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:26,270
just seen some other systems built

01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:29,130
without the ArcGIS JavaScript library

01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:30,660
and I from what I can tell there's

01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:32,730
actually ArcGIS has pretty good

01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:35,490
interoperability with services like

01:06:32,730 --> 01:06:37,320
matte box or Google or even your own

01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:40,250
custom layers if you want to go that

01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:44,670
route so you can you could render layers

01:06:40,250 --> 01:06:46,350
from Drupal or you get your data overlay

01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:48,510
layers from Drupal and throw them on top

01:06:46,350 --> 01:06:50,640
of an arc GIS map using something like

01:06:48,510 --> 01:06:53,030
openlayers or the arc Jarius library I

01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:59,730
think if anyone knows more about it I

01:06:53,030 --> 01:07:01,440
button that's true we have a true and

01:06:59,730 --> 01:07:03,030
there just to throw one other point

01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,640
under that I mean one of the things that

01:07:03,030 --> 01:07:07,050
we see a lot of our proprietary systems

01:07:05,640 --> 01:07:09,030
in government being replaced by open

01:07:07,050 --> 01:07:11,010
source solutions in terms of making data

01:07:09,030 --> 01:07:12,450
more available to citizens and and

01:07:11,010 --> 01:07:14,370
that's really one of the areas where

01:07:12,450 --> 01:07:15,750
this could be a huge impact which is to

01:07:14,370 --> 01:07:18,150
say that a lot of governments have

01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:20,430
access to data stores either in triple

01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:21,780
stores or an AP is or databases that

01:07:20,430 --> 01:07:25,280
collect over the years or even on paper

01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:27,810
and providing a really inexpensive and

01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:29,430
easily accessible way for citizens to

01:07:27,810 --> 01:07:30,870
see that data and then become interest

01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:34,020
in that data and maybe even use that

01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:36,720
data via API feed separately from the

01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:39,000
map is one of the really great benefits

01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:39,550
of this is showing citizens what their

01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,410
governments

01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:42,970
are providing and creating for them and

01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:44,470
I think that's one of the areas that at

01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:46,780
least at phase two were really focused

01:07:44,470 --> 01:07:55,300
on trying to sort of replace enterprise

01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:57,280
expensive solutions with so I'm creating

01:07:55,300 --> 01:08:00,040
maps where I've got to interact with

01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:02,950
several million polygons and have them

01:08:00,040 --> 01:08:05,220
be filterable and and searchable so that

01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:08,740
geo hash really sounds interesting to me

01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:10,270
so first question is is there an easy

01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:11,800
way to use that with openlayers i'm

01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:16,930
using openlayers right now and a

01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:20,830
postgres back in sure so the set up that

01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:23,770
I've currently is using vuze jo Jason to

01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:25,839
output a clustered result and the only

01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:27,609
difference from a normal geo Jason feed

01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:32,940
is that the clustered result contains

01:08:27,609 --> 01:08:35,380
the size of markers so you would need to

01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:38,470
consume the data in your openlayers

01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:43,569
JavaScript library and the drupal module

01:08:38,470 --> 01:08:45,850
and then it really depends like all of

01:08:43,569 --> 01:08:49,210
the box it should just display all the

01:08:45,850 --> 01:08:51,730
markers but without any it's it's not

01:08:49,210 --> 01:08:53,560
aware of the of the items being

01:08:51,730 --> 01:08:56,440
clustered because it doesn't know about

01:08:53,560 --> 01:09:00,010
the extra property that I've added so

01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:03,160
you would just alter the open layers I

01:09:00,010 --> 01:09:05,950
don't know behavior to to visualize

01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:08,410
these items and as far as I know maybe

01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:11,850
Paul is more aware of with openlayers

01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:15,640
you can already based on attributes

01:09:11,850 --> 01:09:20,020
alter the styling so I think that's like

01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:25,210
five to ten hours away of being on your

01:09:20,020 --> 01:09:27,730
particular website implemented and this

01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:30,370
kind of related but right now I was kind

01:09:27,730 --> 01:09:33,310
of scared to get this huge database of

01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:38,260
polygons into Drupal so it's sitting out

01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:40,600
and being served up by geoserver is is

01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:43,630
that done am i doing something wrong

01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:45,339
because now I also I like that he had to

01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:48,520
not put too much into Drupal because

01:09:45,339 --> 01:09:51,010
Drupal will just get slow so maybe you

01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:53,200
should just take the ideas that we have

01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:55,000
created and probably have a look at

01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:56,770
quick solution because his is not that

01:09:55,000 --> 01:10:01,180
tightly integrated into the Drupal stack

01:09:56,770 --> 01:10:05,230
and because the algorithm itself is it's

01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:06,520
rather simple yeah so yeah I mean if you

01:10:05,230 --> 01:10:08,620
don't need to bring it into Drupal

01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:10,600
there's no particular compelling reason

01:10:08,620 --> 01:10:13,270
to do so I mean you can probably index

01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:15,910
those things the key is to just get them

01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:17,410
indexed into solar and so indexing into

01:10:15,910 --> 01:10:20,650
solar doesn't necessarily have to go

01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:21,850
through Drupal and I think for you the

01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:23,530
tricky I think there's probably too

01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:24,910
tricky things for doing what you want to

01:10:23,530 --> 01:10:26,110
do and this is actually a problem I

01:10:24,910 --> 01:10:29,650
would be really interested in because

01:10:26,110 --> 01:10:32,380
it's tricky so with a point you know

01:10:29,650 --> 01:10:34,030
there's there's one there's only one geo

01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:36,040
hash a particular level level that

01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:38,490
represents that point but for lines and

01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:41,170
polygons at a particular geo hash

01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:44,950
resolution that line or polygon is going

01:10:41,170 --> 01:10:49,180
to go through a variety of geo hashes at

01:10:44,950 --> 01:10:51,730
that that detail level so the algorithm

01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:53,320
that I showed for pinning things would

01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:57,160
have to be modified slightly to kind of

01:10:53,320 --> 01:11:00,760
be a multi field where each each set is

01:10:57,160 --> 01:11:03,520
actually a set of multi-field geo hashes

01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:05,950
and that multi-field would be the the

01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:08,290
all the geo hashes that the line or

01:11:05,950 --> 01:11:10,050
polygon go through and then the other

01:11:08,290 --> 01:11:13,360
thing probably you'll run into is

01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:16,920
displaying I mean even if you want to

01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:19,090
display a thousand or 100 polygons

01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:20,320
that's a lot of data to serve so you

01:11:19,090 --> 01:11:23,680
might want to think about pre

01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:25,780
simplifying some of those polygons so

01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:28,930
when they're stored into solar or stored

01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:31,090
into whatever intermediary data base

01:11:28,930 --> 01:11:34,060
you're querying from run them through a

01:11:31,090 --> 01:11:35,400
simplification algorithm so that when

01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:37,930
they're actually displayed to the user

01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:40,060
even if it's only this big on the on the

01:11:37,930 --> 01:11:42,730
map you don't need to have if the

01:11:40,060 --> 01:11:45,010
original source polygon has 10,000

01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:46,360
points and but it's only tiny in this

01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:48,220
tiny little corner of the map you don't

01:11:46,360 --> 01:11:50,140
need to display all 10,000 points you

01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:52,000
could you know simplify that down to 100

01:11:50,140 --> 01:11:54,820
points and only when they zoom in would

01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:57,250
they actually see the full hi Radz shape

01:11:54,820 --> 01:12:00,100
of that polygon so I think there's kind

01:11:57,250 --> 01:12:01,940
of two interesting problems there yeah

01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:04,730
right now i'm doing a

01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:06,560
whatever the st centroid and then just

01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:07,969
dealing with that right we're finding

01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,440
things and then shipping back the

01:12:07,969 --> 01:12:11,650
polygon and they're all pretty simple

01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:14,270
polygons are just real estate parcels so

01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:15,620
yeah i'm i'm fighting that sounds like a

01:12:14,270 --> 01:12:19,100
reasonable solution and that's what we

01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:20,719
did with the with the demo here is these

01:12:19,100 --> 01:12:25,370
are actually a lot of these see these

01:12:20,719 --> 01:12:27,170
are there's a these are boxes here you

01:12:25,370 --> 01:12:30,080
can see and see these are actually

01:12:27,170 --> 01:12:31,699
polygons or just box polygons but what

01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:34,610
all the only thing we're indexing here

01:12:31,699 --> 01:12:36,380
is is the centroid and so I mean there's

01:12:34,610 --> 01:12:37,790
some edge cases where you something

01:12:36,380 --> 01:12:39,800
should technically appear in the map but

01:12:37,790 --> 01:12:41,510
isn't but it doesn't but generally I

01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,949
think most users will notice the

01:12:41,510 --> 01:12:45,050
difference between indexing the whole

01:12:42,949 --> 01:12:46,190
thing and indexing just the centroid for

01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:47,600
most use cases I think it's probably

01:12:46,190 --> 01:12:51,739
good enough to just work with the

01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:53,570
centroid and I'm gonna be here for the

01:12:51,739 --> 01:12:55,130
Sprint and I was just wondering if I'm

01:12:53,570 --> 01:12:57,110
gonna be doing something general or if

01:12:55,130 --> 01:12:58,610
I'd be lucky enough to have one of you

01:12:57,110 --> 01:12:59,960
guys that's going to be doing some

01:12:58,610 --> 01:13:03,620
Sprint's or being around for the

01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:05,989
Sprint's to do more specific stuff yeah

01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:08,630
I personally would love to i'm i'm here

01:13:05,989 --> 01:13:13,010
till tuesday actually so we were based

01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:15,530
sprinting from Friday to Sunday but I've

01:13:13,010 --> 01:13:26,090
I don't know in which way we're going to

01:13:15,530 --> 01:13:27,320
sprint for me great thanks yeah so if

01:13:26,090 --> 01:13:30,710
there aren't any more questions I really

01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:32,900
appreciate you guys coming to watch us

01:13:30,710 --> 01:13:35,150
talk and all that and you know feel free

01:13:32,900 --> 01:13:37,280
to hit any of us up afterwards either in

01:13:35,150 --> 01:13:40,370
person or online you know we're all

01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:42,489
pretty google so otherwise thank you

01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:42,489
guys
