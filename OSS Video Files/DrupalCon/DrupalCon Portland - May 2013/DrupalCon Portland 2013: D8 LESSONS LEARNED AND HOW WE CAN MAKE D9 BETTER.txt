Title: DrupalCon Portland 2013: D8 LESSONS LEARNED AND HOW WE CAN MAKE D9 BETTER
Publication date: 2013-05-28
Playlist: DrupalCon Portland - May 2013
Description: 
	After a year of "project managing" Drupal 8, I've learned a lot with some fellow PM's who support me on a weekly basis - Ashleigh & Shyamala. I've also started having retrospectives with the team, so it's great to get their direct feedback and share common trends on these projects.

This proposal is essentially a post-mortem for core development from a non-technical perspective. I'd like to share with you my experiences, both good and bad, and ways I think we could do better.

Some basic problems we'll cover are:

- Community disinterest in project management, difficulties we face in planning and organization ("I don't have time", "I don't know where to begin" etc)
- Problems around managing volunteer projects (unreliable deadlines, plannings that aren't, resource issues)
- Problems around managing core projects (lack of visibility into issues, unpredictability and sheer size of the beast)

I also have a vision of how I'd like to see Drupal 9 core development change, and resources are a big part of that. We have a ladder of expertise to climb in order to build and foster adoption of our Drupal releases, and we're missing key rungs.

I hope to share with you my ideas about:

- What we are doing now to solve the build & upgrade issue (how to get people to build & use the next version)
- How we coule organize teams to maximize support for core development
- What we need to build those teams

I think it's an ideal time to brainstorm with people in the room as well during Q&A to make the most of the time as a group.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,759
so if you are here to see d8 lessons

00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:08,370
learned and how we can make d 8 9 better

00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:12,599
are sorry g9 better then you are in the

00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:15,059
right room so I'm Shannon vitesse hi I

00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,529
work for commerce guys and I've been

00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:19,080
doing project management for a long time

00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,029
and I've been doing some project

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,760
management under plate which is why this

00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:26,849
all came about because I was able to get

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,769
some information from the team about how

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,260
things were moving and a lot of ideas

00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:33,360
kind of turned out of that especially at

00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,980
triple con Munich lots of conversations

00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,360
were happening around how could we

00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:38,100
improve this what are the problems that

00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,590
we're having so obviously that was a

00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,239
long time ago and lots of things are

00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,649
changing evolving but I still feel like

00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,870
those core conversations that were

00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:49,350
happening are still relevant today so

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:52,350
that's why this happened so obligatory

00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,410

00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,219
services we're doing a kind of challenge

00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,110
where you have to go around and get

00:01:02,219 --> 00:01:06,240
something from each partner and then you

00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:08,729

then you know obviously what am i doing

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,020
up here so I've been project managing

00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,330
and I feel like I've been being a little

00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,860
bit crappy because I've been working a

00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:29,009
lot so if you're interested in working

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,450
on Drupal 8 please do come and talk to

00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,630
me and give me your card I'm recruiting

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,759
actively all the time so we're looking

00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,810
for people to help and I'm just

00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,060
basically trying to get the word out

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,119
about things that I think this is easy

00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,340
for me to do point out trends point out

00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:46,229
issues and that's why we're here to talk

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:49,649
so feel free to join the conversation

00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:52,110
it's basically going to be like what's

00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:54,869
going on right now how are things

00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,659
looking in the in the drupal initiative

00:01:54,869 --> 00:02:00,600
like set up the process that we're using

00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:02,460
what is it how's the organization what

00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,649
are the teams doing what if we did

00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:06,570
something different and then talking to

00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:09,479
you about like what is involved in that

00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,849
so here's what I think we're doing today

00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,160
we have people at the bottom and I

00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:14,900
apologize for the small text

00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,110
so people at the bottom who I consider

00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,910
abstainers they use the software but

00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,040
they're not really involved they're not

00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:24,830
actively building things they're not

00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,830
actively building core they are just

00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:30,200
kind of they're using it and that's a

00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:31,520
big group then you have your novices

00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,470
which are people who don't have a ton of

00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,670
experience but you know they've done

00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:36,160
some things and they've got a little bit

00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:38,480
of experience and they're able to do

00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,560
limited things so we can't use them a

00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,380
whole lot but we have a lot of those

00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,750
people and we like those people so keep

00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,280
coming but then we have another level

00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,380
which I'm calling tier 2 which is

00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,240
beginners and so they have experience

00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:51,890
and they can do stuff but they haven't

00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,570
worked on core extensively and they

00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:54,770
don't really know about the process and

00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:57,710
that's where people like Jess are

00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,970
awesome because core mentors and you can

00:02:57,710 --> 00:03:00,260
go to Drupal at Oregon search core

00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:02,510
mentors they will give you all kinds of

00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,680
information there beginners are really

00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:06,020
useful to us because they are people

00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,260
that we can turn into experts which is

00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:11,120
the next level and experts and beginners

00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:13,190
are kind of cruelly missing in our

00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,040
triangle as far as i can tell today and

00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:17,360
then you have initiative owners which

00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,730
are kind of these awesome people up

00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,800
front who are doing things and over here

00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:24,380
they're interspersed so initiative

00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,240
owners are I think you know carrying the

00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:27,890
torch for what they want to do and

00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,780
trying hard and they're getting totally

00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:32,510
run over by all the work that needs to

00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:34,280
get done and burned out so our current

00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:36,350
organization right now is pretty much an

00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,750
initiative owner with some help and I

00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:40,430
think there are a few problems that are

00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,500
involved in this so this is the current

00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,840
organization right now so you've got

00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,420
initiative owners at the top they've got

00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,950
a couple of experts working with them

00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:52,250
usually maybe a few more than just two

00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:53,840
but not not usually like five or six or

00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,130
ten experts that are working with them

00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,270
usually it's just a couple of people

00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:58,730
that are just really awesome really

00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:01,580
dedicated so they're they're bearing the

00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:04,370
brunt of all the work and these people

00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,570
are you know also helped out by some

00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,190
reviewers which are all the little

00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:08,510
diamonds underneath and those people are

00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,830
awesome too they help them get things

00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:11,660
done well it's not like there's a

00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,190
million of those people it's limited in

00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,620
the initiatives and so this is a problem

00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:17,359
for us because we're missing those those

00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,450
two key groups and these are people that

00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,220
we can kind of level up and teach and

00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:23,960
bring on board so the current

00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,720
organization also has a couple of other

00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:29,150
parts which are obviously like

00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,520
people like me who try to do project

00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,140
management which is right now very

00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,360
limited so it's basically down to

00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:37,400
communication and then people who do

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,640
committing and finally people who do

00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,080
front end things so that's the second

00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,520
group and finally you have a third group

00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,370
which is just other community peoples

00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,410
people do ladders teachings you know how

00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,960
to get involved with core people work on

00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:52,250
funding and people who do all kinds of

00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,750
awesome design stuff and then all the

00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,160
other community members just a random

00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:56,810
person comes in and reviews one thing

00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,070
then leaves and just like this is too

00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,440
hard I can't do it or whatever I'm

00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,360
lumping them into that kind of other

00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,400
community people so this is how are

00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,920
working today and it's a little bit hard

00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,790
because obviously the people in that top

00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:13,820
level are really doing all the main hard

00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:16,040
stuff all the time so they're the most

00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,470
prone to all these different problems so

00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,970
burnout and well poisoning we're picking

00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:21,260
the same people to do the same things

00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,280
because they got core management

00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,630
knowledge meant and they've got all this

00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,000
background info and they know how this

00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,710
works says I had to work on that so they

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,150
keep on having to you know pick the same

00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,560
people to do the same things and they're

00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,690
getting really really burned out and

00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,400
then they also have lack of information

00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:36,980
for the public because these people are

00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,180
so knowledgeable they can't always take

00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,820
the time because they're really

00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,440
overburdened to do all this stuff to

00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,570
like give a weekly update of what's

00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,310
going on in the initiative so everyone

00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,800
else is like when are we getting drupal

00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,690
8 they don't know anything about what's

00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,790
happening or maybe they get some

00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:54,410
information but it's you know maybe not

00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:56,270
in the digestible format that they need

00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,590
so I mean pm's could really help with

00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:59,000
that but they're hard to come by and

00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,729
we're all really busy and blah blah blah

00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,440
so that problem exists and then we have

00:06:01,729 --> 00:06:06,380
some poor like interaction and

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,150
dependency issues because again the same

00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,430
people are really burdened with all the

00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:12,350
same work it's hard for us to take the

00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:15,500
time to sit down for two hours and say

00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:17,300
okay in the next month where are the

00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,250
dependencies that are going to affect us

00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:21,410
what is the biggest risk right now and

00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:24,380
we're doing some of that but not enough

00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:26,479
in terms of being able to like plan for

00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,729
them it's more just reaction like we're

00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:32,030
okay we're on fire here what do we do

00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:33,500
about that type of stuff and then that

00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:35,780
also leads to really hard to play in

00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,220
schedules issues so it's it's almost

00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:39,180
impossible right now in the current

00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:42,000
setup to actually plan any

00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:45,479
because people are not reliable myself

00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,639
included hey to do stuff because we're

00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:49,080
all volunteers so planning a volunteer

00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:50,880
project is really tough because we don't

00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,430
have any funding we can't organize

00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,870
correctly and also it's just really hard

00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,220
to onboard newbies because we got those

00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,850
two levels that we're missing but we

00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,889
don't necessarily have the

00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:01,530
infrastructure to teach them how to do

00:06:58,889 --> 00:07:04,139
stuff so I wanted to talk to you about

00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:05,490
an idea that came out of Munich which

00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:08,009
was you know how could we organized

00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:11,280
teams for the next round of Drupal

00:07:08,009 --> 00:07:13,470
development and maybe even something

00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,050
that we can use during the last legs of

00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:17,699
Drupal 8 that would be awesome if people

00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,199
would kind of rise up and get this done

00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:20,520
but I'm not going to hold my breath I'm

00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,620
just thinking more d 9 this would be

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,789
cool so I think that it would be really

00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:26,940
cool if we could have three groups

00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:29,370
helpers builders and organizers or sorry

00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,680
designers so the helpers are people who

00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:34,229
are going to help organize things and

00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,020
communicate and fund so these are all

00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:39,750
the support mechanisms and people like

00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,910
initiative owners I don't think want the

00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,070
burden of that on top of having to do

00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:46,199
all the architecture and all the big

00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:48,030
heavy lifting and all of the like

00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:49,740
onboarding and teaching and documenting

00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:51,539
an upgrade path building and all of that

00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,139
I think if we can have a group of

00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:56,159
helpers that would be really cool

00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:57,630
builders would be people who obviously

00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,180
are doing all the building and testing

00:07:57,630 --> 00:08:02,460
and documenting and reviewing and

00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:06,389
designers are people in my mind who

00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:08,550
would be doing you xui reviews usability

00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:10,620
all kinds of really awesome things that

00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:12,900
are not incorporated enough into the

00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,570
initiatives right now but also very very

00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,770
important so let me tell you a little

00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:19,080
bit more about this vision and then we

00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:21,300
can have a conversation so the first

00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,699
group helpers I see it as project

00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,550
managers so coordinate document

00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:28,979
milestones then there's people who teach

00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:31,440
so they would find the education gaps

00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:33,150
like where do people get stuck where do

00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,520
they not know how to learn how to do

00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,320
something help build ladders that they

00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:40,680
can learn those things and then find new

00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,089
mentors and track those KPIs and finally

00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,250
in communicators people who will meet

00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:46,350
with groups communicate about their

00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,329
progress and basically keep all the rest

00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:50,040
of us who are not in the issue cues

00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:50,600
every single day like watching what's

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,250
happening

00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,380
kind of up to speed on how things are

00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,060
going like well we're getting close to

00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:58,250
the end or you know we're really far

00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,470
away that type of high-level thinking is

00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,940
not easy to communicate unless you're in

00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,970
regular contact need more of those

00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:07,790
people so that's what communicators are

00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,470
to me and then finally funders I think

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:11,120
it's really important to have funding in

00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:14,509
order for this method to be sustainable

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,459
because it's so hard to plan a volunteer

00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:17,389
team you don't know where they are you

00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:20,089
don't know when they're going to be

00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:21,529
available something personal something

00:09:20,089 --> 00:09:22,910
professional might come up and Trump

00:09:21,529 --> 00:09:25,430
whatever they're doing volunteer at any

00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:27,050
given moment so it's just impossible to

00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:28,910
plan for without funding but if we could

00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:31,310
fund people and we have been funding

00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:33,800
people especially Greg it just makes it

00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,029
easier so I think that that's a really

00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,310
important part and then you'd have tier

00:09:35,029 --> 00:09:39,380
1 and tier 2 so this is basically people

00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,509
who are interested but don't know what

00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,949
to do and then tier 2 would be people

00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:45,410
who have been doing a little bit of it

00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:48,199
and who can help the tier 1 people kind

00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:51,110
of learn more so that's what I see as

00:09:48,199 --> 00:09:53,389
helpers and then you have builders which

00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:54,860
I really think is the key to this having

00:09:53,389 --> 00:09:56,750
multiple levels of builders is where

00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,160
we're going to see the most success and

00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,589
you'll have initiative owners who are

00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,480
there to do architecture monitor

00:10:00,589 --> 00:10:04,639
progress unblock issues help find

00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,290
teachers and funders and and help with

00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:07,939
coordinate with communicators and

00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,529
project managers on what needs to

00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:11,420
actually happen in the initiative I see

00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:13,639
these people as the leaders they're

00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:15,110
there to set the strategy and they're

00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:17,060
there to communicate about the strategy

00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:19,939
and the progress of it of that vision

00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:23,120
and then the experts I see is people who

00:10:19,939 --> 00:10:24,769
are there to do the awesome stuff so

00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,970
this is a bit of a switcheroo from what

00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:28,100
we're doing right now cuz right now it's

00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:31,610
like the initiative owner is the expert

00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:33,380
and I think we need to have them be in a

00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:35,930
different level than the experts experts

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:37,610
are people who can do stuff and this is

00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:40,189
where we're cruelly lacking people right

00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,959
now funding might help with that so

00:10:40,189 --> 00:10:44,410
these people code stuff they maintain

00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:47,240
things they do summaries they do

00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:49,310
trainings they find people they do they

00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:51,920
can do all kinds of things tier 2 would

00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:53,839
be a certain level of beginner who have

00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,130
some limitations they're not yet experts

00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,899
but they're pretty well up there maybe

00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:59,149
they can train tier 1 or maybe they can

00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:00,649
even train novices and then you

00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:01,880
obviously have people who are just

00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:02,819
getting started who need some

00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,489
documentation

00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:07,229
so that's how I see the builders group

00:11:05,489 --> 00:11:09,829
these are people who are actually doing

00:11:07,229 --> 00:11:12,569
things in terms of you know code and

00:11:09,829 --> 00:11:14,100
then finally designers where I'm sorry

00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:15,869
I'm lumping it into this category if

00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,309
that makes any of you man but there was

00:11:15,869 --> 00:11:19,470
the best category that I could come up

00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:21,929
with I see this is people who really

00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:24,359
care about how things work for the user

00:11:21,929 --> 00:11:28,199
and who care a lot about usability and

00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:30,119
user experience so I see that it's a

00:11:28,199 --> 00:11:31,949
little bit tough for me to really define

00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:34,019
what that should look like but i'm

00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:37,410
thinking like the-- murs designers you

00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:38,970
Xers unite to find ways to review the

00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:40,470
work that's coming out of the code so

00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:42,749
they'd have to work closely with project

00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,279
manager and with an initiative owner on

00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:46,559
the progress of one is the right moment

00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:48,089
to step in when is the right time to

00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,470
really start talking about you I I know

00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:51,660
it's a challenge we face right now in da

00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:53,339
it's not super clear and I think that

00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:55,350
having some more structure on this would

00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:57,539
be great so if anyone in here is working

00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:58,589
on that type of content I'd love to talk

00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:00,059
to you afterwards I'm just get your

00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:03,379
feedback or maybe even during the

00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:05,789
session since it is a conversation so

00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:07,559
basically the big difference between

00:12:05,789 --> 00:12:10,439
what we're doing now and what we what I

00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:12,479
want to do is that right now we don't

00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:15,839
have a clear plan and we're just kind of

00:12:12,479 --> 00:12:17,879
like going about as best we can so we

00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,369
plan a little bit we don't really know

00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:22,199
how to train anybody to get started it's

00:12:20,369 --> 00:12:25,769
more like core mentors please come save

00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:28,049
us teach people how to get started and i

00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:30,269
think you know in an initial initiative

00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:33,029
level it would be great for them to have

00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:35,399
each their own core mentor a non border

00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:36,569
a person to help for the people

00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,879
interested in what they're doing instead

00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:41,039
of you know just one group that has to

00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:43,559
kind of cover all areas and you're all

00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:45,269
over the place in triage so I think

00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:46,379
that's where where we are right now and

00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:49,439
it's really hard to train because we're

00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:50,429
all too busy doing doing things d9 I

00:12:49,439 --> 00:12:52,529
think would be great if we could

00:12:50,429 --> 00:12:55,649
actually plan ahead like know more about

00:12:52,529 --> 00:12:57,509
what the goals and milestones are based

00:12:55,649 --> 00:13:00,839
on what didn't get into d8 for example

00:12:57,509 --> 00:13:02,100
and then decide if we like the

00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:04,019
initiatives and how that's going maybe

00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,819
we can do another round of funding and

00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,549
try and get a set group of teams I think

00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:11,939
at least the initiative owners and at

00:13:08,549 --> 00:13:14,100
least three experts should be funded for

00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:16,180
every single initiative and if we can't

00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:20,300
do that

00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:21,650
yeah um if we can't do that then I think

00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,910
that we're just relegating ourselves to

00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:26,870
the same fate that we've already had

00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:29,720
which is try your very best but you know

00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:31,670
no guarantees I don't think that's what

00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:33,080
anyone wants so I think that that's

00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:35,900
going to help us and I really think

00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:38,120
education is key to this methodology

00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:41,710
working having a way to bring people

00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:44,180
into the fold is important especially

00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:47,660
with each release how much more

00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:49,400
complicated and how much more you know

00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,990
interesting and awesome is getting it's

00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,620
also getting much harder to teach people

00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:56,000
so we need those steps so there are a

00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,470
few dependencies and questions that i'm

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,900
going to put out there for us to discuss

00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:02,840
and then i'm going to shut up um so

00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:05,900
basically like initiatives need these

00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:08,150
trends so what if what if you disagree

00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:10,130
with initiatives not everyone likes this

00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:11,750
idea so right now if you're not familiar

00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:16,250
with it initiatives are basically

00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:18,440
different groups of goals for features

00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:20,270
like whiskey and views and all this

00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,740
stuff so not everyone agrees with

00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,480
initiatives if you disagree I want to

00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,120
hear from you to know like why you

00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:28,370
wouldn't want to keep doing that ladders

00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:31,790
is another one so ladders initiative I

00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:33,980
think it's not got its legs yet it's sea

00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:36,080
legs it's still trying to find people to

00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:38,180
stay involved I was involved briefly but

00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,190
got pulled away in a bunch of stuff so

00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,540
maybe that's happening to everybody so

00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,370
basically ladders is a teaching

00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,900
initiative that says I'm going to learn

00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:46,580
how to do something I'm going to

00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,960
document it and then I'm going to share

00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,670
it and then i'm going to teach someone

00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,320
else how to do it and then they become a

00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:53,780
mentor to someone else and they tell two

00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,730
friends and they tell two friends type

00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,440
of thing it's a great concept and i

00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,910
think that it would be really cool if we

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,530
could do this but I think there's also a

00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:02,150
dependency like we need to do this now

00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:04,610
if we're going to be able to use it in

00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:06,290
the next round so we'd need a massive

00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:08,450
following to get on board and that

00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:10,250
sounds kind of tough to do and then

00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:12,830
finally the big ugly question of funding

00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:16,580
like who do we ask who gets what how

00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:19,520
much how much do we need it's just all

00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,899
very hairy who manages the money it's a

00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,339
big problem in

00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:24,410
in this environment especially because

00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:25,999
we're open source and we're nonprofit so

00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:28,069
we can't just say oh just write me a

00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:31,220
check I'll deal with it no it's like

00:15:28,069 --> 00:15:34,009
really a tough issue to solve so that's

00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:36,470
a whole other question and I'm

00:15:34,009 --> 00:15:37,699
interested in whatever ideas you have

00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,579
and these are some alternatives because

00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:43,040
what I just said is super ambitious so

00:15:40,579 --> 00:15:45,559
maybe we could try like funding one

00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,839
initiative or like one resource in each

00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:50,240
initiative instead of all for that might

00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:53,569
be a little bit more realistic trying to

00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,220
leverage several parts of visibility to

00:15:53,569 --> 00:15:56,569
get interest so really a lot more

00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,910
communication about what we're trying to

00:15:56,569 --> 00:16:02,920
do to help people who are you know

00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:05,360
busting their bums almost a day or

00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,850
trying to get funding and help them get

00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,670
the really good reasoning of why this is

00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:12,589
going to make a huge difference maybe we

00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:14,990
could focus on letters that's another

00:16:12,589 --> 00:16:17,230
way instead of you know trying to get

00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:21,499
the money we could try to get the people

00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:22,879
and then finally just combining roles so

00:16:21,499 --> 00:16:24,949
this is kind of the route where we're at

00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:28,100
right now it's like p.m. / communicator

00:16:24,949 --> 00:16:29,360
or / coordinator / whatever um and

00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,160
that's a way that we can have fewer

00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,189
people involved to do these things so I

00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,329
think these things still need to happen

00:16:33,189 --> 00:16:36,470
individually so like you should have

00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:38,449
someone to communicate but you should

00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:41,509
also have someone to organize and if you

00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:43,579
that can be two people that's better but

00:16:41,509 --> 00:16:46,699
um worst case scenario little keeping

00:16:43,579 --> 00:16:48,559
one person so then finally trampoline

00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:52,370
off ladders and letter ease to get

00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:53,929
special educational perks basically have

00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:55,459
their employer sponsor what they're

00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:58,399
doing which is what commerce guys does a

00:16:55,459 --> 00:17:01,999
lot so we've got several employees who

00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:04,669
do a lot of you know core work and it's

00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:05,929
a great way to try and get the help so

00:17:04,669 --> 00:17:08,689
those are some ideas that are a little

00:17:05,929 --> 00:17:11,419
bit less ambitious and that's everything

00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:13,279
that I had for today so now we can talk

00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:15,110
about stuff so things to kick us off

00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:17,899
that conversation I'm really curious to

00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:20,419
know first of all do you have any

00:17:17,899 --> 00:17:22,880
questions about the d8 organization

00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:24,230
right now and these ideas on d 9 and

00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,329
then second i'm really interested in

00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,919
having conversation about what do you

00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:30,289
think about the feasibility of these

00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,149
teams and these roles does this like

00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:34,720
even make sense to you or does this

00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:34,720
sound weird

00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:47,360
someone answer you yeah Mike do DC is

00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,850
organizing all of these things is that a

00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,620
role for the DA or is that a role for

00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:54,559
the community and self-organizing teams

00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:56,450
or for a company to oh you mean like who

00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,700
becomes the initiative owner and who

00:17:56,450 --> 00:18:01,460
becomes the project management lead and

00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,950
who becomes whatever exactly um okay

00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,600
that's a good question so I think right

00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,890
now we're doing it in a kind of

00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,620
self-organizing way and it's very

00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,480
organic I think that's the best way it's

00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:14,210
a scratching your own edge community and

00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,520
if you want to take a big chunk of your

00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:18,290
life and devote it to Drupal I hate you

00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,760
should be allowed to do so nobody should

00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:21,740
stop you so I don't think it should be

00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,500
the DA coordinating and organizing I

00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,900
think maybe in terms of funding that

00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,660
might get trickier because the DA or

00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:32,299
some other entity would need to handle

00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,549
the funding for that so maybe it's like

00:18:32,299 --> 00:18:37,730
the community decides and then that

00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:41,150
person gets funding support in order to

00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:42,650
do it so the DA is actually prohibited

00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,910
from trying to shape the direction of

00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:45,500
core development that's like part of

00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:46,790
their charter so I think that's

00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:49,190
something important unless you know we

00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:50,900
wanted to change that it in some people

00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:52,790
suggest there should be like a different

00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,610
organization that's responsible for that

00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:57,070
um but something else that I think I

00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:00,230
might disagree a little bit is that

00:18:57,070 --> 00:19:01,790
there's there's something to be said for

00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:03,410
being willing to work on something but

00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,210
you get people who are a lot more

00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,370
committed when you when you ask them

00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,110
when you ask them say I've noticed that

00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:12,110
you're interested in this and you try to

00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:14,600
empower them to be a leader to be an

00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,890
authority in a particular area so I

00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,630
think that just saying that it will

00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,010
happen organically I mean I think that

00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:21,919
you get people interested in organically

00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:23,750
but I think that um then like nominating

00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,250
them to be someone and do something and

00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,020
giving them responsibility and control

00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:28,669
over it makes them feel a lot more

00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:30,320
successful and then they'll give you

00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:35,150
more time without feeling burnt down

00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:38,450
about it so totally agree with you me

00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:40,850
first so uh what jess is saying is

00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:42,840
really relevant to ashes talk that was

00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:45,540
on diversity in how

00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:48,480
underrepresented groups don't volunteer

00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:50,730
themselves for things they just don't so

00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,520
if we want some diversity in leadership

00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:55,380
we might have to recruit and ask because

00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,100
they won't volunteer themselves they

00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:00,900
don't have any like you know there's no

00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:04,470
pictures of people that are like them in

00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:06,210
whatever way like is like so I think

00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:08,370
that's true for the for some of the

00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,910
under level but I think for like the

00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:14,370
lead top tier people they need to come

00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:16,350
of their own free will I don't think we

00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:18,300
could ask someone like hey Larry do you

00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:25,490
want to be an initiative owner it's like

00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:30,030
it oh that's what he did to you Wow okay

00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:33,380
all of you I am wrong most of the Drupal

00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:35,910
8 initiative leads currently were

00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,890
invited to be so by juries based on

00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:40,410
things we were already great ranting

00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:43,170
about doing some some of us louder than

00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:46,020
others some of us who are more willing

00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:47,970
than others but we were all appointed by

00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:50,540
juries based on trends he was seeing

00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:53,340
that part I don't think is a problem

00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,840
definitely getting the team like you're

00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:57,990
describing behind those people and

00:20:54,840 --> 00:21:00,120
making sure that those people have the

00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:01,830
back the backing authority to be able to

00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:06,740
then coordinate the team and get things

00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:08,910
done I think is critically important so

00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,950
it's building out that structure

00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:12,450
accepting that structure is the

00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,490
challenge I think figuring out who's

00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:17,070
going to be part of it is an easier

00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:18,480
problem to solve hmm to an extent like

00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:20,850
they have the will but not the means

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,830
yeah you know like greg was willing to

00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:24,300
you know throw himself into

00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:28,950
configuration management because he's

00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:31,350
just that crazy um but that did you

00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:32,370
unless he'd had you know support from

00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,720
his employer at the time to do so

00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:36,480
probably would not have been able to do

00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,780
so not everyone has an employer who has

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,510
the willingness or financial capability

00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:44,100
to put someone fifty percent encore for

00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:47,580
a long period or a hundred percent

00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:50,780
format so those employers that can have

00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:53,870
off to them but not everyone does and

00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:57,020
that's where I could I think the

00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:58,580
which parts of the team get funding and

00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:02,170
how much I think that's really the

00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:04,370
trickiest problem followed closely by

00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:05,240
accepting that there this structure

00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,100
would be there and that would be

00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,870
Direction setting for core even if it's

00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,070
still coming down from drees it's much

00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:12,800
more top-down that we've done in the

00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:15,170
past the first year of Drupal 8 was a

00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:17,900
lot of painful arguments and discussions

00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:20,690
about that you know this isn't bottom-up

00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:23,330
grassroots how dare you and it took a

00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:24,920
very very long time and not the small

00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:26,900
amount of blood to get past that and so

00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,640
we need to make sure we can keep doing

00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:30,140
that yeah I didn't add that into the

00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,460
presentation but it's such a good point

00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,320
that like even when your initiative

00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,240
owner and we've seen this under blade

00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,040
that doesn't mean everyone just lines up

00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:40,130
behind you and decides to do what you're

00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:42,260
doing and you guys need some support

00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:45,290
that is top-down and need the authority

00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:48,020
in order to make those decisions and get

00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:50,090
consensus obviously it's not overlook

00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,920
that but I'm easier to build consensus

00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:54,140
when you're building consensus from a

00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:58,190
position of authority from a position of

00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:59,270
first among equals just the process

00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:04,070
becomes smooth or even if the end result

00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:06,050
is the same hmm thanks that's Larry if

00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:08,559
you don't know Larry you can know him by

00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:08,559
his vest

00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:18,710
so I'm gabbar AA and I want to talk

00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:21,980
about the money question um so there's

00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:25,180
like three or four reasons that I did

00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:29,060
not go into the money thing for the am I

00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:30,770
so the first is that was a lot of as

00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:32,690
I've heard and as I've expected there

00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:36,200
was a lot of overhead to get money so if

00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:38,570
you ask Greg he took a lot of time to to

00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:40,310
pitch his stuff and two proposals and

00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:42,650
you know venting arguments and

00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:45,050
expectations and figuring out how you

00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:47,330
propose at all and then the next thing

00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:50,210
is the the entity that handles the money

00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:52,250
so if I would take money then I would

00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:53,990
need to pay taxes on top and I will lose

00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:56,390
like a third of the money at least on

00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:58,160
paying taxes for my government so I

00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:00,530
would not take that would not be a good

00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,390
idea so we would need to have an entity

00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:04,790
that's not the DA because the DA is

00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:07,250
prohibited right directing core

00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:08,420
development so they might not be able to

00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,010
handle this money and we don't really

00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,930
have an entity that can handle this

00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:13,520
money so we have to create one so which

00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:15,800
is why it's so hard figure out some kind

00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:18,050
of adds entity that will not that will

00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,390
be able to handle it money and just

00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:22,790
funnel it through and the third one is

00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:25,010
was the low and Larry said is who gets

00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:27,890
the money and how they get the money and

00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:29,840
how that's decided it's like if you're

00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:32,510
doing a sprint then you're flying in

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,250
people and like maybe some some people

00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:35,690
the company will pay for them others

00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,160
they don't have a company they need to

00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:39,290
pay for themselves if they are

00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,790
freelancers think they earn money but

00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,930
they don't have money to fight if there

00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,970
are students they don't earn money

00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:45,830
there's all those hard questions there

00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:47,660
are of course they're one of answers to

00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:49,490
them so there's no clear rule that we

00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,350
can set I think yeah I mean there's a

00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:53,360
lot of possibility for mother things

00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:54,890
they're right and I think just to

00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,060
piggyback on the last thing that you

00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:57,860
were saying about like companies

00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:00,710
sponsoring people like commerce guys

00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:04,040
sponsored me to be here and about 15 of

00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:07,310
my colleagues which is awesome and yay

00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:10,250
um but not everyone is so lucky but at

00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:11,840
the same time like if um like Chris who

00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:15,140
is initiative lead owner and works for

00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:17,300
Herkimer skies if he weren't if you were

00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:19,460
able to get a scholarship would commerce

00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,390
guys fund him is the tricky question

00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:22,830
there when you're getting into like

00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:24,750
money because obviously like

00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:27,779
saving 10 grand a year or whatever and

00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:29,549
flights and whatnot is kind of nice for

00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:31,710
a company so I think it gets really like

00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:34,470
so hard when you start talking about

00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:35,940
funds because then you have the chicken

00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,440
before the egg issue of they have

00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,700
funding today but will they have funding

00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,640
tomorrow if they find out that they can

00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:44,610
get a scholarship it's also Harry so I

00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:48,539
mean honestly if I were to decide today

00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:50,700
it would be something like look at who's

00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:53,909
in a company that is getting Karma for

00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:56,789
doing a lot of work and then balance

00:25:53,909 --> 00:25:59,070
that like 5050 with people who are

00:25:56,789 --> 00:26:01,260
making a really big contribution who

00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:03,419
can't go themselves and I think we have

00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:07,860
to favor people who would on board and

00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:10,529
become experts over things like you know

00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:12,899
random person who does stuff once or

00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:14,820
twice if someone is habitually committed

00:26:12,899 --> 00:26:16,889
to an initiative I think that's a great

00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:19,080
sign of someone who should be funded

00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:21,059
because then maybe they can become you

00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,529
know a lieutenant to the initiative

00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:23,850
owner or something and I obviously think

00:26:22,529 --> 00:26:25,830
initiative owners should be funded

00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:28,830
because you guys are so critical to the

00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:30,539
entire process I mean would any of you

00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:33,480
even accept that if you could get a year

00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:52,860
of funding to work under bully yeah yeah

00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:54,539
yeahs for a year yeah yeah yeah that's

00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,950
not that's the hard question so I think

00:26:54,539 --> 00:26:57,779
the hard question is what you do elite

00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:05,450
you later right so so I mean if we're

00:26:57,779 --> 00:27:05,450
gonna exactly

00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:15,700
right now just to repeat that for

00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:17,740
everyone in the back um funding and like

00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,510
giving up your job to do this for a

00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,920
short time is different for a freelancer

00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:23,590
than someone who has a full-time job

00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:25,420
it's just not the same commitment so I

00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:27,220
mean that's just where it gets really

00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:29,170
tough and I think in order to have the

00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,820
success that we need like we need you

00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:32,800
guys to be available it's really hard

00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,840
when you have a second job besides

00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,120
Drupal initiative owner and you can't

00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,410
always be around to support and you know

00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:41,890
help because you need to earn the dolla

00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:43,120
dolla right so I mean it's tricky and

00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:45,460
there's at least two more points that I

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,230
wanted to mention about money as the

00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,360
other the other one which dovetails into

00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:51,700
what you said is that if if comers got

00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,590
if if Chris or me would come on a

00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,360
scholarship would we get a scholarship

00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:57,250
since we're already working for aqua and

00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,559
comers guys and our Korean Commerce guys

00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:02,170
are here to have their big presence at

00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:04,390
the booth and market their company so I

00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:06,550
would be get paid for come because we

00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:08,290
also are Koreans and cameras guys people

00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:09,970
and you know yeah this is a wishy-washy

00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:11,290
question yeah like I don't get son died

00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:14,470
there wave and so I don't need a

00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:15,850
scholarship but maybe like if if my boss

00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,679
heard that I can get a scholarship maybe

00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:18,820
he wouldn't offer to send me you know

00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,170
and then I'd be like oh she did I need

00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,340
to get a scholarship for some time I

00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,570
mean you we don't know how it's gonna

00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:25,090
turn out and then the other thing is

00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:27,700
like the you who gets the money is we

00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:29,590
have volunteers who work a lot coming up

00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:32,950
that are coming up from the from the

00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:35,440
beginner part from from down and what's

00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:37,660
the point when when they are at a point

00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,900
where where we find in stem and how do

00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:42,550
we tell so we have in da mi we have

00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,920
quite a few people who just grew out of

00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:47,020
out of being totally new contributors

00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:50,140
and they're like in that they we have

00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:51,400
people who are like two percent they are

00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:54,309
mentioning two percent of the core

00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:56,230
comets in Drupal 8 which is huge and as

00:28:54,309 --> 00:28:59,290
they just were an unknown two months ago

00:28:56,230 --> 00:29:01,059
or three months ago so it's that's a

00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:04,360
hard question there yeah maybe it

00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:08,380
becomes like rolling funding short-term

00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:11,950
funding hmm tough it's a high Christoph

00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:13,480
um initiatives were really interesting

00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:15,490
for Drupal 8 because can you get a

00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:17,380
little bit closer to the mic okay so

00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:19,540
initiatives were really interesting for

00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,740
me enduring Drupal 8 development because

00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,510
it

00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,660
got me really deeply involved into

00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:27,809
Drupal core but I'm now talking from

00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:31,260
from a field API perspective as a cone

00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:32,850
maintainer our plan we had a really nice

00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,830
slide this morning during our session

00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:36,840
the plan for jubilate for field api was

00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:40,080
just sit back and relax and basically

00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:42,330
just I mean that was in I mean really a

00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,640
failed API is in core and you can do a

00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:46,559
lot of stuff and then suddenly triple-a

00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,990
decides to rewrite everything and then

00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,809
we have to do and we have to follow that

00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:54,179
and we are not really an initiative but

00:29:51,809 --> 00:29:56,250
there's a lot of work and I mean a lot

00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:57,630
of stuff touches what greg has been

00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:00,360
doing but there's also the Perkins

00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:03,090
plug-in system so do you see some place

00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:06,000
for sub systems in core that are not an

00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:07,740
initiative and we actually really need a

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,510
lot of help on that part as well I mean

00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:12,660
just basically only me and watch it and

00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:14,910
maybe to other peoples but we don't have

00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:17,790
that visibility I mean really p I need

00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:19,350
to be converted but it's not open and

00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:21,090
public I mean so you bring up a really

00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:23,309
good point at what point does something

00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:26,100
deserve initiative status essentially

00:30:23,309 --> 00:30:28,890
right yeah I think my personal choice

00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:31,140
would be when the work load exceeds four

00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:33,090
to five people working their asses off

00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,620
then it kind of seems to me like it

00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,880
deserves attention because that means

00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:38,400
lots of people going to need to review

00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:42,330
it and comment on it and make sure that

00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:45,360
it works with everything else yeah right

00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:47,670
now I'm if we could get a decent team

00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,679
together like if that's I think the

00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:51,270
point of having a team if you're an

00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,280
initiative it's because you need a team

00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,990
of people so I think if you're getting

00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:56,490
to that point where you're doing the

00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:58,920
work of three or four people and it's

00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:00,450
burning you out you could use a team you

00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,309
should probably be an initiative and if

00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:04,740
that means that we have like 20

00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:07,410
initiatives for Drupal nine so be it

00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:16,170
fund everyone get your done and be

00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:17,940
awesome so I sat in a bunch of core

00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:20,100
conversations now and the topics keep

00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,830
coming up the subject keeps coming up

00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:25,740
about we need the resources and if we

00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:27,510
can actually do a funding and oh yeah we

00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:31,549
want to get a lot of new people involved

00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:36,510
in core is core contributors and

00:31:31,549 --> 00:31:38,190
so one of the points that I think that I

00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:39,779
think needs to be considered like you're

00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,070
talking about for Drupal 9 like oh I've

00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:42,779
got this great idea we're going to have

00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:44,490
the initiative owners and we're going to

00:31:42,779 --> 00:31:46,710
have this many experts are going to fund

00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:48,090
this many people for each of the

00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:49,500
initiatives and we've already started

00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:52,500
touching on some of this stuff here with

00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,360
the idyllic I'm a freelancer and so

00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:56,429
there's also been talking other sessions

00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,750
about like oh yeah so just demand I

00:31:56,429 --> 00:31:59,880
think it was Greg who actually said

00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:01,860
demand that your employers pay for your

00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:03,870
you know you are a resource that's in

00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,309
demand so demand that your employers

00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:08,039
will pay for some of your time to work

00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:09,720
on core well there's people like me that

00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:10,740
are the freelancers that like you you

00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,360
know we don't really have that situation

00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,539
we can just demand that somebody's going

00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:17,340
to hire us and pay us money to work on

00:32:14,539 --> 00:32:22,080
doing core stuff and again we're

00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:24,360
freelancers so if I'm volunteering my

00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,980
time doing stuff and I understand what

00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,710
any volunteers or not gonna pay but like

00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:30,179
I don't have a salary and the time that

00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:33,240
I volunteer to do things I'm not gonna

00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:35,880
be making the money so yeah everyone

00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:37,440
know it really no I understand but so

00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,880
like when you hear the toggle yeah we

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,590
want to get more people involved in core

00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,179
and we want to be able to fund things

00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:43,980
and so that you know that's the thing

00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:45,269
that like for a person for me it's like

00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:46,230
yeah that would be awesome to be able to

00:32:45,269 --> 00:32:47,820
get some funding so that I could

00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:49,289
actually work on Drupal and do stuff

00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:51,090
with this but then it does bring up the

00:32:49,289 --> 00:32:52,500
questions because like who d you know

00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,789
you need some of these experts on the

00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,039
project but when you're looking at these

00:32:53,789 --> 00:32:57,419
experts like Larry and the question has

00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,279
already brought up so even the idea of

00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:01,289
funding Larry okay so if you're going to

00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,610
fund Larry because he puts in a ton of

00:33:01,289 --> 00:33:04,470
work and he really knows what he's doing

00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:08,130
that's great he's being rewarded for it

00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:10,529
but then you're not meeting the goal of

00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:11,700
getting new people involved that could

00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:13,500
then maybe pick up some of the work

00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:15,450
later on and then there's also the other

00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,159
issue like even the idea funding Larry

00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:18,570
like when Greg brought up like yeah but

00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:20,730
are you willing to quit your job for a

00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:23,190
year if we find you for a year so this

00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:26,250
the the idea like oh let's get funding

00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:28,350
and let's add more resources has another

00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:31,289
component to it is like then those

00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:32,340
practical aspects of like when you're

00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:33,690
talking about who gets the money you

00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:35,519
asked me like what initiatives get the

00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:37,529
money but there's a big there's another

00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,700
question as well as like but who are the

00:33:37,529 --> 00:33:40,260
people that you're going to be paying to

00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,330
do because there's a pros and cons of

00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:44,220
like you guys don't know who i am and

00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,920
sure i'd love to be step up and say yeah

00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:47,080
pay me too

00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:49,300
work on Drupal but you guys are going to

00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,380
want to look to somebody who's like but

00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,730
we don't know him and we don't know

00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,960
these may be good at this we don't give

00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,340
them the money so we want to look to the

00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,250
people who have already proven

00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:59,110
themselves now then you're tying

00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:00,370
yourself to the situation of like

00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,570
they're invested and you aren't bringing

00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:03,040
new people into the process so there's

00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:04,180
an there's another layer of this that I

00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,510
think that you need to think about is

00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:09,160
like the disparate of this how how the

00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:11,080
dispersal of the money would work

00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:12,040
there's tons of people in the community

00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,780
like me I'd say yeah that would be

00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:26,350
totally awesome for me to be able to get

00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:28,390
paid to work on true bold but that's

00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:30,040
true of any job personal personal growth

00:34:28,390 --> 00:34:32,020
and job development is always our own

00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:33,700
personal responsibility on our own time

00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:35,350
and so you know if that means

00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:37,870
contributing the patches so that you get

00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:40,090
visibility or taking a class to learn a

00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:42,190
new technology or building a personal

00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:43,780
project to get more visibility those all

00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:45,460
fall into the same things yeah like

00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:47,770
that's why I think it should be tiered

00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:49,390
because if you're like your situation

00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:51,669
you're a freelancer you're interested in

00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:53,770
working on this you're willing to commit

00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:55,210
to it if someone can fund you because

00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:56,880
you just can't afford to stop all your

00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:59,170
freelancing work and do it full time I

00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:02,260
completely understand that neither can I

00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:05,050
so I think the best way to go about that

00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:08,410
is to have you start at the beginner

00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:09,820
tier so you start reviewing patches and

00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:11,620
you work with jess and all the awesome

00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:13,780
people doing core mentoring and they

00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:15,700
will help you start out and then when

00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:17,800
you feel comfortable you move on to the

00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,660
next level and you help document where

00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:22,420
you came from and how you got to where

00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:24,070
you are so that that that learning path

00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:27,070
can start to begin for everyone else

00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:29,560
that is a critical component to the

00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:31,510
entire project if we don't have people

00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:34,840
doing that teaching other people how to

00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:37,690
learn what you did then we're kind of

00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:39,940
screwed so it's a it's a huge task it

00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:41,950
has to be crowd-sourced it has to be a

00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,660
group effort and if you want to get to

00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:45,190
the point where you feel like you're an

00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:47,020
expert I think you need to start at

00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:50,050
those levels unless you're just like a

00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:52,060
crazy genius and you can just go

00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:53,860
straight to the top in which case you've

00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,970
probably already like committed major

00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,430
patches and got the fizz

00:35:54,970 --> 00:36:00,700
ability that you wanted so deciding who

00:35:57,430 --> 00:36:01,930
gets funding is tough is it's a bear but

00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,180
at the same time I think that like

00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:06,250
experts are critical to the project

00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:07,660
success initiative owners are critical

00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:10,900
to the project success if we want to

00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:12,910
reduce all the pain points those two

00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:15,190
pieces are needed more than anything

00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:16,440
else so i would start there and i think

00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:19,990
the initiative owners are going to be

00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,730
really key into helping decide who they

00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:23,800
want in that core group of people

00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:25,840
working with them every day or every

00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:28,120
week or however much you know funding

00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:30,070
they have to get those people regularly

00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,980
on their team and I think that they know

00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:34,300
who they who they need to work with

00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:37,210
Larry said like finding the people it's

00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,710
not hard getting them to do this stuff

00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:40,840
is hard because either they need

00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:42,880
training or they need time work right so

00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,950
I now agree with all that I'm not I told

00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,500
I'm centered you're saying so but then

00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:49,360
what that brings you back to is because

00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,130
the reason I bring this up is that a lot

00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,020
of the talks has been here like all our

00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:55,450
problems are going to be solved if only

00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:58,840
we would have funding for that's me what

00:36:55,450 --> 00:37:02,530
I'm saying nobody is saying that but

00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:03,880
there's um which you get back to and I

00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:04,810
agree with your idea that you need to

00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,950
put in your time you need to prove

00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:07,240
yourself they need to personal growth

00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,980
but then that puts a person like Larry

00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,540
in the position that I'm like okay yeah

00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:12,040
I want to make my way up the ladder here

00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,780
but I'm not going to give 10 hours a

00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,040
week or 20 hours a week to pull that I'm

00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:16,360
gonna you know maybe I wanted to

00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,230
something for an hour week and then put

00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,520
something like they're in a position

00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:21,240
because he made the comment he's like if

00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:23,230
I've got 50 people for one hour apiece I

00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,960
really can't get anything done with that

00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:32,800
I'd rather have the 10 people for five

00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:34,450
hours of peace larry has access to

00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,290
experts who have access to frightening

00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:42,010
but anyway anyway yes thank you for your

00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:45,430
comment I have like two pages of notes

00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:53,470
here I don't even know where to start

00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:55,720
everyone else sit down I actually

00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:59,350
sympathize a lot with the last speaker I

00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:01,240
of course did quit my job to get funded

00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:03,400
for Drupal core and managed to do it

00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,920
successfully as a freelancer and I did

00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,910
but but I mean I had all of the

00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,500
downsides that

00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:10,299
that were brought up I did give up

00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:13,380
thirty five percent of that income

00:38:10,299 --> 00:38:16,000
straight to the federal government I did

00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,799
suddenly at the end of that find myself

00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,329
with no money and wondering what I was

00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:22,390
going to do now with my life because

00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:24,880
unlike normal I mean you know normally

00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:26,200
you're freelancing and you you're

00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,690
reaching the end of a gig and you're

00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,190
shopping for next gigs and I was at the

00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:31,960
end of this gig but i'm not really a

00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:33,730
freelancer i'm just a guy who got a

00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,109
bunch of money to work on core and now

00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,910
all of that money is about to be gone

00:38:35,109 --> 00:38:38,500
and I'm like well do I want to fund

00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:40,390
raise some more do I want to get a real

00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:43,000
job do I want to be a freelancer to

00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:44,799
which the answer of all was no but but

00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,750
that's a personal decision you know and

00:38:44,799 --> 00:38:48,369
I mean a lot of a lot of a lot of stuff

00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:52,119
comes down to priorities in your life

00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:54,490
and things like that but you know I I

00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:57,400
sympathize a lot and obviously not not

00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:58,990
all of the 1012 200 people who

00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,880
contribute patches to Drupal core are

00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:03,220
going to get funded I think that's a

00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,930
realistic thing to say I guess I'll

00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:12,279
leave my comments to the most

00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:14,140
controversial ones I in your slides and

00:39:12,279 --> 00:39:16,450
larry was saying this to you sort of had

00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:19,660
an initiative lead and then a team and I

00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:21,369
think that's the wrong model I think I

00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:23,559
think the initiative lead should be a

00:39:21,369 --> 00:39:26,950
team and I think that the way that the

00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:28,720
views team did that is really excellent

00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:31,990
and should really be used as our model

00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,490
because I don't believe in and I don't

00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:36,460
think it works well with our community

00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:38,500
that that the single vision of one

00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:40,569
person should be should be going top

00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:42,490
down to all of these people you should

00:39:40,569 --> 00:39:44,020
have you should have I like the idea of

00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:46,720
having a variety of viewpoints in a

00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:48,970
variety of skill sets together coming to

00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:50,710
these conclusions as a small group and

00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,809
then branching those off to the greater

00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:56,140
community and it actually helps a lot

00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:59,200
because you know I when I when I

00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:02,410
launched my 350 comment thread about

00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,480
file formats for cmi I was the only one

00:40:02,410 --> 00:40:07,000
sitting there trying to manage that and

00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,859
you know within eight hours I wanted to

00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,839
shoot myself I had nobody else took fall

00:40:08,859 --> 00:40:12,460
back on but if you've got a team of

00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:13,869
people you can all come out you can all

00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:16,329
respond to different questions depending

00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:17,500
on your expertise and everybody can sort

00:40:16,329 --> 00:40:19,059
of take the brunt of it and when

00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:20,600
somebody gets burnt out they fall apart

00:40:19,059 --> 00:40:22,640
and somebody else can come in and

00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:25,670
vacation you don't be thinking about it

00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:27,440
and stuff like this and I think I think

00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:29,150
having a team a small team of equals

00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:31,820
leading each project is a really really

00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:33,710
important thing right so this IO block

00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:36,290
you want like three or four of those

00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:38,030
yeah basic and then of like five or six

00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:39,350
experts in that case because different

00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:41,510
people working with different groups

00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:43,220
well to some extent that melds because

00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:45,770
in the case of the views team they were

00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:48,230
the experts as well and they did a lot

00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:49,550
of the work but they also had a lot of a

00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:51,860
lot of people underneath them

00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:53,270
contributing up as well as that's not

00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:54,830
sustainable if you want to do the other

00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:56,960
stuff like the communication

00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:58,730
coordination long-term planning all that

00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,650
is hard to do all at once mean you know

00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:02,270
that it is all hard to do all at once

00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:06,110
but you have you have people with

00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:14,720
specific skill sets in there that's

00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:16,910
right so what I just interrupted Greg to

00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:18,590
say was that you do not happen to tell

00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:20,360
Jenny you don't have to be the lead

00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:23,570
architect to also be the person who

00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:25,550
oversees like the strategic integration

00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:27,440
with larger entities and that's all

00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:29,390
because I did the second part and

00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,830
definitely not the first ever because I

00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:32,540
mean if you have a cross-functional team

00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:34,310
of four people and one person is really

00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:36,020
good at being the communication and

00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:37,220
project management part one person is

00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,660
really good at being the technical

00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:40,280
architect and one person is really good

00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,900
at the front end side and then one

00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,580
person is kind of a generalist who helps

00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:45,500
work on in review patches I think that's

00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:47,240
a really really strong team that you've

00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,950
got there especially if some of those

00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,540
skills translate among the other members

00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:53,150
so that they can fall back on each other

00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,800
when they need to I mean this prospect

00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:56,240
this concept of cross-functional teams

00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:59,450
has been very popular in software

00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,160
development in a good for the last few

00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:03,470
years and I think it's super and I think

00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,850
it totally applies to us of course that

00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:06,470
comes to the problem where we have no

00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:08,030
project managers and designers and

00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:10,070
things like that but that's a recruiting

00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:12,290
problem that's rails but do you have the

00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:15,300
recruiting problem on your level right

00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:17,490
now um for

00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:19,770
like could you tomorrow come up with a

00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:23,330
team of three or four people to support

00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:26,910
you I could if I had a way to fund them

00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:28,950
hahahaha you know I mean I mean you know

00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:31,620
the only know who you would want like on

00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:33,150
that teams this is actually I mean I've

00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:35,670
already got I've already got four major

00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:38,670
contributors to cmi there's like me Alex

00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:40,170
son and B jeebus right now now that's

00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:45,240
not as cross-functional as I might

00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:47,280
necessarily like but um yeah it's more

00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:50,550
it may be more dysfunctional than

00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:55,230
cross-functional but uh cross

00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:57,540
dysfunctional yeah yeah but um but but

00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:59,970
the concepts the concepts are still

00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:01,890
there and you know I really wish that we

00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:03,120
hit that I'd started with a team of four

00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:04,590
people it wouldn't have been those four

00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:06,750
people because i didn't really know any

00:43:04,590 --> 00:43:08,160
of them at the time but and started

00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,510
funding the whole team from the very

00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:12,510
beginning instead of just coming up with

00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:14,070
that for myself at the end another

00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:18,110
really controversial thing i want to

00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:23,660
bring up is the fact that um 10 seconds

00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:27,480
as a community we are extremely

00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:32,220
suspicious of centralization and that's

00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:37,050
a huge problem okay it's a huge problem

00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:39,090
because it's really really really

00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:40,950
difficult to do the kind of fundraising

00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:42,900
that we're talking about without some

00:43:40,950 --> 00:43:45,960
sort of centralization and without some

00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:49,290
sort of organization behind it and the

00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:51,300
kind of businesses that typically drive

00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:53,940
our community namely service businesses

00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:56,940
to be honest don't have the kind of

00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:58,860
funding or all the time to be able to

00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:00,500
fund at the level that we need and they

00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:03,000
don't have the long-term vision either

00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:05,430
their servant their their businesses are

00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,230
very cyclical they tend to have to put a

00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:09,870
lot of money away to get through the

00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:11,640
downsides of the cycles and it's very

00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:14,220
it's very hard for them to devote

00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:17,610
significant resources beyond say you

00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:20,430
know ten percent of someone's time to to

00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:21,870
this kind of contribution unless they

00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:23,520
want to take away for people's ten

00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:25,380
percent and give it to one person which

00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:27,100
doesn't necessarily work out in all

00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:29,780
situations

00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:31,310
you know I've talked a lot about how

00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:32,600
I've talked to members of other open

00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:34,280
source projects for a long time about

00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,900
their funding models and almost all of

00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:38,390
them have a commercial entity behind

00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:40,760
them and while there's a downside to

00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:43,520
that you know i mean the Fedora project

00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:45,020
has it written into their there a clause

00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:46,490
that their Board of Directors has to

00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:48,230
have at least two members from Red Hat

00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:50,510
and it's a representation of redheads

00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:53,120
dedication of resources to the project

00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:54,920
but on the other hand it means that

00:44:53,120 --> 00:45:02,060
there are dedicated resources to the

00:44:54,920 --> 00:45:03,590
project and you know vision coherent

00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:05,270
focused vision is not necessarily

00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:08,240
something the Drupal community has been

00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:11,270
very strong at over the years and and

00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:14,960
while I understand the suspicions around

00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:17,330
centralization and around focusing power

00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,330
and you know sort of ideals around

00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:22,460
around a specific group I think it's

00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:24,050
going to be very very very difficult to

00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:26,630
achieve our goals if we don't figure out

00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:29,030
some way to do that and I mean it just

00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:30,230
the monetary side is like you know I

00:45:29,030 --> 00:45:32,650
think that we could probably convince

00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:34,430
the DA just sort of be the fiduciary

00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:35,870
representative of an initiative like

00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:38,030
they because they do that with Drupal

00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:39,680
camps right now actually they they hold

00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:41,270
the bank account for the drupal camp and

00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,330
and act as the money pit' to the

00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:45,770
granting yeah right and so the camp

00:45:44,330 --> 00:45:47,300
people collect money and they just

00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:52,460
provide a bank account in a legal entity

00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:54,950
to hold it but I mean without some sort

00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:56,780
of organization collecting money I mean

00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:57,980
you know but the scale of money that

00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,180
we're talking about i think things are

00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:01,000
going to be really difficult and i think

00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:03,650
that's something that we as a community

00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:05,360
given the size that we've grown to are

00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:07,280
going to have to really really think

00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:10,580
about over the years okay let me recap

00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:13,220
what I won't say the a-word let me recap

00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:15,590
what you just said so not one person as

00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:18,140
a figurehead at the very top of the tier

00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:21,130
but a team of you know two three maybe

00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:24,910
even four people working as a hive mind

00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:28,610
and then having a group an entity that's

00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:30,470
responsible for the money management so

00:46:28,610 --> 00:46:32,930
that you guys don't get taxed to death

00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:37,370
and get screwed basically and then

00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:39,290
having a way to make it acceptable to

00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:40,069
the community that some people are

00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:42,019
getting funded for

00:46:40,069 --> 00:46:43,849
things that some people aren't and that

00:46:42,019 --> 00:46:45,410
and that you know all of that and then a

00:46:43,849 --> 00:46:47,539
lot of that funding is being centralized

00:46:45,410 --> 00:46:49,190
in one place right and that that that

00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:53,479
may also mean that that one place has a

00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:58,269
greater voice is evil I'll leave the

00:46:53,479 --> 00:47:03,140
rest of my notes for later okay yay

00:46:58,269 --> 00:47:07,430
thank you Greg sure for a beard yes

00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:10,369
let's so we already do have some funding

00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:11,749
models that live in parallel to what's

00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:15,829
getting proposed here we've got the

00:47:11,749 --> 00:47:20,269
large-scale Drupal project that aqua has

00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:21,709
running that if I sure so my

00:47:20,269 --> 00:47:24,650
understanding of the large-scale Drupal

00:47:21,709 --> 00:47:28,219
project is that large organizations like

00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:30,469
NBC have contracts with a Korea that

00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:33,140
involve hosting and other services and

00:47:30,469 --> 00:47:35,900
it involves a sum of money that is

00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:37,999
pooled for common interests I don't know

00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:40,249
exactly what that funds but I imagine

00:47:37,999 --> 00:47:43,519
it's things like large-scale performance

00:47:40,249 --> 00:47:46,339
because large sites like NBC have

00:47:43,519 --> 00:47:49,160
similar needs I don't think there's

00:47:46,339 --> 00:47:51,259
anything stopping say a consortium of

00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:55,339
colleges from starting a nonprofit that

00:47:51,259 --> 00:47:57,440
could fund fixes that colleges need and

00:47:55,339 --> 00:48:00,109
that may not line up to you know a

00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:02,299
non-profit funding just whiskey but if

00:48:00,109 --> 00:48:04,579
we had a nonprofit that was interested

00:48:02,299 --> 00:48:07,069
and making Drupal better for all

00:48:04,579 --> 00:48:09,140
universities multiple universities could

00:48:07,069 --> 00:48:12,289
give money directly to that nonprofit

00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:13,940
that nonprofit could then fund whatever

00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:16,160
they want they could give ten percent of

00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:18,259
their money to whiskey ten percent to

00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:21,229
mobile we don't need we don't

00:48:18,259 --> 00:48:22,699
necessarily need one funding model to

00:48:21,229 --> 00:48:25,309
rule them all there's there's nothing

00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:28,009
stopping anyone right now from creating

00:48:25,309 --> 00:48:30,799
a nonprofit dedicated to making Drupal

00:48:28,009 --> 00:48:32,420
run better on shared hosting I'm just

00:48:30,799 --> 00:48:34,699
about to add to what you're saying

00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:38,479
because like why is everyone talking

00:48:34,699 --> 00:48:40,910
about funding as in giant entity X yeah

00:48:38,479 --> 00:48:43,339
funds twenty percent of someone's salary

00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:45,769
what about crowdfunding we are huge we

00:48:43,339 --> 00:48:49,009
are millions of people why can't we

00:48:45,769 --> 00:48:52,080
crowdsource this bit you know sure we we

00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:53,890
could you so we could even

00:48:52,080 --> 00:49:04,120
didn't you raise much money in

00:48:53,890 --> 00:49:06,100
kickstarter no okay okay so maybe that

00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:08,140
model doesn't work but maybe it also

00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:11,080
doesn't have the same visibility like da

00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:13,330
has a lot of visibility at the drupalcon

00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:16,330
maybe if there was a be a core

00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:18,220
benefactor you know badge that you can

00:49:16,330 --> 00:49:20,050
put on your site or it goes on your tag

00:49:18,220 --> 00:49:22,390
or something and you donated five bucks

00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:26,440
to help work on color if a million

00:49:22,390 --> 00:49:29,890
people do that what right you'd have to

00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:31,960
like that's implied so what I'm saying

00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:33,970
is we don't necessarily need one entity

00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:36,370
to rule them all we already have de

00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:39,280
facto entities like Commerce guys that

00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:42,510
funds the open source project drupal

00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:45,340
commerce that is a funding model for

00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:48,280
supporting open source but they're an

00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:50,560
entity right they have taxable issues

00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:53,140
and things like that sure so what I'm

00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:55,750
saying is to my knowledge there is no

00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:57,420
legal barrier stopping anyone in this

00:49:55,750 --> 00:50:01,630
room from creating a nonprofit dedicated

00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:03,910
towards solving issue X in Drupal and I

00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:07,170
think the the large mental hurdle that

00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:09,550
we have is if we start a funding agency

00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:11,620
the Drupal community will push back

00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:14,620
against whatever centralization there is

00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:16,180
that that nonprofit could be dedicated

00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:19,680
to solving the least controversial

00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:23,860
issues in Drupal it can be dedicated to

00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:25,510
fixing the oldest code in Drupal if the

00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:27,580
mental hurdle we have right now is that

00:50:25,510 --> 00:50:29,950
funding by its very nature is

00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:32,040
controversial someone in this room could

00:50:29,950 --> 00:50:37,720
start a nonprofit dedicated solely to

00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:39,760
fixing Drupal wtf's only yeah I mean

00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:41,560
they they could but how many people

00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,630
actually take that step I feel like if

00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:45,850
there was an entity dedicated to

00:50:43,630 --> 00:50:49,480
handling just the fundraising and then

00:50:45,850 --> 00:50:53,410
the like delegation and the allotment of

00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:55,810
that funding is a crowdsourced decision

00:50:53,410 --> 00:50:58,780
or a consensus based decision that would

00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:00,550
take a lot of the so-and-so cap money

00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:02,140
and I didn't kind of crap out of it

00:51:00,550 --> 00:51:04,360
because it would be a group decision I

00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,910
think that that would make it a lot

00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:07,190
easier

00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:09,770
to manage versus like you want to do

00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:11,300
something go start a non-profit how do I

00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:14,150
do that I think I think it'd be really

00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:15,950
motivated I think it's a great idea I'm

00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:18,200
not going to shoot down your idea it's

00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:19,670
awesome go do it right what I'm saying

00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,380
is I don't personally have the

00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:22,910
motivation but if all of us just keep

00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,680
saying we need an entity we need an

00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:26,660
entity we need an entity we're not going

00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,650
to get one until someone just makes one

00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:30,430
yeah I think we have to have

00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:32,780
infrastructure to make that happen I

00:51:30,430 --> 00:51:34,580
just want I just want to give you data

00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:37,280
because the best about LSD and you have

00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:40,550
ideas about what my logical night

00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:42,470
finance I think aquia is not does not

00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:44,330
want to brag a lot about it because

00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:47,690
we're not doing it so that people see we

00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:49,520
are all doing all that stuff part of it

00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:52,010
is because the central control problem

00:51:49,520 --> 00:51:53,510
that Oh acquiesce funding all this stuff

00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:56,720
so everything's controlled by our quia

00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:59,750
but there's been there's been funding

00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,760
for things like that from the new node

00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:03,290
edit form all through to the views

00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:07,550
initiative to configuration management

00:52:03,290 --> 00:52:09,680
to two parts of whiskey so different

00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:12,020
people in different areas were have been

00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:14,240
funding and helped by funds from LSD

00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:16,550
they are individual blog posts about

00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,770
their work mentioned this funding

00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:20,450
there's no like central list of all this

00:52:18,770 --> 00:52:22,250
stuff that's being funded so it's not

00:52:20,450 --> 00:52:24,050
secret information but it's not

00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:25,730
something that that uh Korea wants to

00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:26,840
brag about because they don't think it

00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:33,320
support there's a point in bringing

00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:35,980
about it hari ok so I'm somebody who has

00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:39,920
quit their job to work on Drupal 8 yay

00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:44,900
um what's your name I think spot oh hi

00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:48,650
Alex I just met him but I've been like

00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:51,440
saying his name for a year so um it's

00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:53,480
we're not really confronting one of the

00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,370
facts that core development has become

00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:58,340
professional can you get closer to the

00:52:55,370 --> 00:53:00,470
mic so core development is professional

00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:03,700
we are behaving professionally you

00:53:00,470 --> 00:53:03,700
actually have to face the mic

00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:10,660
yeah easier to talk to you facing it so

00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,670
core development is a professional

00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:14,950
activity now and there are big companies

00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:17,380
involved in funding people to work on it

00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:19,780
and the reason that we don't let the DA

00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:21,640
fund it is because we think it's got

00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:24,790
some direction on it but companies have

00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:26,590
direction encore so there is a conflict

00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:29,410
of interest already so get over

00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:33,640
ourselves we have to create some entity

00:53:29,410 --> 00:53:35,800
to do it I want to ask a question why do

00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:38,170
you think companies have input into core

00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:40,060
because Commerce guys has like zero

00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:51,250
input into core Chris decides what he

00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:53,680
wants to do oh okay so you're saying um

00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:56,530
Commerce guys would fund something that

00:53:53,680 --> 00:54:00,880
we think will benefit us in that way

00:53:56,530 --> 00:54:02,530
yeah so sure right right but actually I

00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,120
don't know that that's really benefiting

00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:09,180
Commerce guys directly I think they just

00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:14,470
they're just like we should fund core it

00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:16,090
eventually that's why I started working

00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:17,830
on serum eyes because I was deploying

00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:20,020
massive sites and I was struggling with

00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:21,700
features and I was working for capgemini

00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:23,050
really really big company and I wanted

00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:25,090
to go solve that problem so is easier

00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:28,330
for capgemini in the future to do it so

00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:35,440
they funded me it was one more thing

00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:43,330
that's kind of completely slit that's

00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:48,070
gone sorry Oh welcome back yeah actually

00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:53,440
that's a good I don't know five minutes

00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:56,700
before with a break right I know mine so

00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:56,700
long I've got

00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:06,349
and this back um so it was about the

00:55:02,809 --> 00:55:07,849
both for the gentleman who said that he

00:55:06,349 --> 00:55:09,650
was interested in being a true he was

00:55:07,849 --> 00:55:12,440
interested in contributing and being

00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:14,180
involved but in a freelance schedule

00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:17,720
didn't feel like he had the time to

00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:18,890
devote to it um and also about the

00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,569
funding question in general so I think

00:55:18,890 --> 00:55:22,579
that something that we can that we can

00:55:20,569 --> 00:55:25,640
do more of a middle ground is like

00:55:22,579 --> 00:55:27,079
micrograms and this can take the form of

00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,069
like you know two hundred dollars or

00:55:27,079 --> 00:55:30,559
five hundred dollars that you give

00:55:28,069 --> 00:55:33,740
someone to work on one issue this is

00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:35,779
this is something that um well nevermind

00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:38,029
i probably can't say it but um there's

00:55:35,779 --> 00:55:40,569
also there's also the idea of giving

00:55:38,029 --> 00:55:43,010
someone a specific you know a specific

00:55:40,569 --> 00:55:44,660
donation or contribution contributions

00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:47,720
that we were supposed to use to do

00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:50,119
something particular like checks like

00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:52,190
paid for my airplane ticket to barcelona

00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:56,210
so that I could go to Barcelona to help

00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:58,490
solve problems for views in cm I um he

00:55:56,210 --> 00:56:00,289
just gave that contribution they gave it

00:55:58,490 --> 00:56:02,960
directly to me because there was a trust

00:56:00,289 --> 00:56:04,819
there but that kind of small funding you

00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,650
know $300 five hundred dollars a

00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:08,869
thousand dollars it is also useful

00:56:06,650 --> 00:56:11,089
especially for people who aren't ready

00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:13,510
to you know quit their full-time job and

00:56:11,089 --> 00:56:17,539
work on core or sign in sector 10 k if

00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:19,339
right and if there's um if you know if

00:56:17,539 --> 00:56:20,869
you already have some minimum level of

00:56:19,339 --> 00:56:22,369
like I've let me the way the way we've

00:56:20,869 --> 00:56:23,690
got people in an open source communities

00:56:22,369 --> 00:56:25,460
through their contributions so you

00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:27,740
already have to have some minimum level

00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:29,210
of work to demonstrate that that you're

00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:31,190
going to you know make good use of

00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:32,930
funding you get but I think that for

00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:35,029
people who are people that we already

00:56:32,930 --> 00:56:37,400
have trust in and we know do will do

00:56:35,029 --> 00:56:39,619
good work um you know that that's like

00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,849
our interview process right and I think

00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:42,529
that it's so that that kind of thing I

00:56:40,849 --> 00:56:44,869
think is possible and i also just wanted

00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:46,130
to mention a bit on how using Core was

00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:49,160
funded because i think there's a lot of

00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:51,680
misconceptions about it um and this is

00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:53,900
kind of a response to your point Shannon

00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:55,279
so our community chip and raised

00:56:53,900 --> 00:56:59,660
thirteen thousand dollars which is

00:56:55,279 --> 00:57:02,660
amazing but the most well-known module

00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:05,299
in the world only raised thirteen

00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:06,559
thousand dollars like on so half of a

00:57:05,299 --> 00:57:09,799
thirteen thousand dollars went to fund

00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:11,780
my time and I was living like like you

00:57:09,799 --> 00:57:13,940
know practically

00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:16,580
poverty level like I I worked out a

00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:18,830
situation with my employer where um I

00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:20,120
would you know work five hours a week

00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:21,230
from them which is very generous of them

00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,550
because they knew they were kind of

00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:24,230
screwing me over and that I was going to

00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:26,810
leave soon so that was sort of a fair

00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:28,220
way of patting me on the back that was

00:57:26,810 --> 00:57:32,180
probably not the best way to say that

00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:34,010
but um but I work at situation and then

00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:36,320
i was paid with chip and money for the

00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:37,880
summer um and it wasn't a lot of money

00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:40,490
and a and it was just enough to like

00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:41,480
make my rent and feed myself um but I

00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:42,500
was willing to do it because I was

00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:44,810
really excited about what I was working

00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,920
on I was it was still a dream job and I

00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:47,900
think that a lot of people are in that

00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,820
situation where they deliberately

00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:52,070
deprive themselves of things that they

00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:53,930
would get through employment because

00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:54,800
they they really enjoy that the work

00:57:53,930 --> 00:57:59,810
that they're doing and they care about

00:57:54,800 --> 00:58:02,870
it um but I don't I well you know I

00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:05,240
 maybe this is but on the other

00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:06,860
hand I'm Sam wait let me say this that

00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:08,300
people in the back in here it's

00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:11,180
that people have to deprive themselves

00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:13,220
in order to work on court amen I made a

00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:15,200
decision I made a personal decision you

00:58:13,220 --> 00:58:17,600
know and I I don't regret it at all

00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:20,150
because what happened is at the end of

00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:21,170
that summer uh there's a situation where

00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:24,800
I wasn't going to have access to the

00:58:21,170 --> 00:58:26,390
funding anymore and I for went through a

00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:27,770
brief period of panic where I you know

00:58:26,390 --> 00:58:29,360
I'm oh my god I'm gonna get evicted I

00:58:27,770 --> 00:58:31,280
don't know it's going to go on here but

00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:34,280
at that point when when it became clear

00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:36,560
that VDC was about to lose a quarter of

00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:40,310
its contributors before views was merged

00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:42,230
in aqueous stepped up and and funded me

00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:44,540
on the niña wasn't he certainly wasn't

00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:45,500
full time but I got you know like eight

00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:47,090
thousand dollars from aqueous

00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:49,160
significantly more than I got from the

00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:50,630
chip in and that was for the next

00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:52,580
segment and then for the third segment

00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:55,430
of the release cycle tengen actually

00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:56,630
funded me and so it even though the

00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:59,180
community chip and raised a lot of money

00:58:56,630 --> 00:59:01,270
which is amazing the amount of money it

00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:03,140
raised compared to these these large

00:59:01,270 --> 00:59:05,090
companies with an interesting open

00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:06,230
source who are have their entire

00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:10,130
business model built around an open

00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:11,330
source project you know contributed a

00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:14,840
lot more the funny and that's that's

00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:19,340
just me like three companies so aired

00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:22,040
fish zip tech and um oh yeah new digital

00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:23,390
partnership thank you see they all work

00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,670
for different places now Daniel doesn't

00:59:23,390 --> 00:59:26,970
but on

00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:30,130
three companies actually funded like

00:59:26,970 --> 00:59:31,240
like a third to a half of those three

00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:32,230
guys died and they've got their heads

00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:35,740
down and they're not even paying

00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:37,720
attention but um and that are you in the

00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:39,460
back I mean the value the value of

00:59:37,720 --> 00:59:41,319
funding them was a lot a lot greater

00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:43,809
than the value of funding me in terms of

00:59:41,319 --> 00:59:45,369
just the number of developer hours that

00:59:43,809 --> 00:59:47,619
they you know their companies didn't

00:59:45,369 --> 00:59:50,440
build them for so so basically like

00:59:47,619 --> 00:59:53,859
community chip ins great idea but not

00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:57,250
necessarily for large-scale fundraising

00:59:53,859 --> 00:59:59,290
and mostly big companies well companies

00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:01,990
tend to chip in more than your average

00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:05,020
person in terms of the total sum is the

01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:06,760
summary of what you're saying then more

01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:10,420
than the aggregate of people okay yeah

01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:12,520
that makes sense wait how are we doing

01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:22,869
on time do we want to run through the

01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:28,450
break okay do you want to set up yeah

01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:30,609
you can take over while we chat so a lot

01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:32,200
more things like I was thinking the line

01:00:30,609 --> 01:00:33,549
that I could say but the law does is

01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,260
lets try and think about ways to be

01:00:33,549 --> 01:00:37,540
creative about how to how to go off and

01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:38,710
incentivize people to go off into to

01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:40,450
work in core there's a lot of different

01:00:38,710 --> 01:00:42,339
ways we can do it it's not just about

01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:44,349
finding money to go up and pay people

01:00:42,339 --> 01:00:46,270
full time if the micro grants is a

01:00:44,349 --> 01:00:48,520
really good idea if there's a way to go

01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:51,130
off and simply provide advertising or

01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:53,799
some sort of company recognition on

01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:55,079
drupal.org so you can identify who the

01:00:53,799 --> 01:00:57,400
companies who've gone off and

01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:59,589
contributed the the work that I've done

01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:01,990
on accessibility and Drupal I've gotten

01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:03,940
absolutely no contracts from that the

01:01:01,990 --> 01:01:05,950
video of putting the hundreds if not

01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:07,480
thousands of hours and a lot of

01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:09,430
companies have benefited from that work

01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:11,020
it hasn't been open concept that is

01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:12,430
benefited from that work it would be

01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:14,349
good if there was some way to go up into

01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:16,869
two I mean there are people who are

01:01:14,349 --> 01:01:19,240
talking about ways that that the

01:01:16,869 --> 01:01:21,339
accessibility is really a marker for for

01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:23,260
people to one of the differentiates

01:01:21,339 --> 01:01:26,500
Drupal from other CMS is in the sales

01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:27,910
the sales cxo meeting on Monday I really

01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:29,740
like to see some of those people go up

01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:31,270
and say well here's an expert let's draw

01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:33,730
in those experts and try and find ways

01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:35,470
to not just some accessibility but on

01:01:33,730 --> 01:01:37,119
views and just people who hear

01:01:35,470 --> 01:01:39,580
made it serious time and energy to that

01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:40,570
but there's no way on drupal.org to to

01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:43,119
acknowledge that and there's not a

01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:44,500
culture that is where we're seeking out

01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:46,210
each other's experts we're finding those

01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:48,190
people who have really contributed a lot

01:01:46,210 --> 01:01:50,619
to bring them in to go up and solve a

01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:51,940
problem okay Justin I got to cut you off

01:01:50,619 --> 01:01:53,650
because we're running out of time and I

01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:55,240
have to go really soon because

01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:59,290
apparently the baath people like lawyer

01:01:55,240 --> 01:02:01,060
Shannon so just to come back to your

01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:02,619
point and justice point about micro

01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:04,270
funding I was just having a conversation

01:02:02,619 --> 01:02:06,550
with people yesterday about these two

01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:10,240
things and the idea that we had was to

01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:12,970
do um like benefit dinners for micro

01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:15,040
funding and karma distribution at the

01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:17,410
same time and then for like the people

01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:19,090
there's some debate about creating

01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:20,530
leaderboards and like people who

01:02:19,090 --> 01:02:21,910
contribute more than others like giving

01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:23,410
them more recognition I mean of course

01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:25,690
we want to like pat people in the back

01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:31,090
and make them like recognize them for

01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:33,520
their contribution and for their code

01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:34,990
contribution there's also an element

01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,180
where I think we can do more to reach

01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:39,220
out to the culture outside of the Drupal

01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:41,230
shops and say how do we get people who

01:02:39,220 --> 01:02:42,910
are using Drupal to go off and find ways

01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:45,580
to contribute to the effort there's a

01:02:42,910 --> 01:02:46,990
lot more that that like in the effort to

01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:49,089
go from fundraise to bring presents you

01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:51,130
hear all of that money came from the

01:02:49,089 --> 01:02:53,109
Drupal community almost exclusively that

01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:54,430
money came from within our ranks it

01:02:53,109 --> 01:02:56,020
didn't come from the people like the

01:02:54,430 --> 01:02:58,000
government's and the universities and

01:02:56,020 --> 01:02:58,900
other agencies who are benefiting from

01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,270
the work that's being done on

01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:02,680
accessibility is being done from us and

01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:04,720
within our ranks and we have to look

01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:06,640
outside our ranks and think big so like

01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:08,290
how do we bring other people into go out

01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:10,270
from to fund to make this happen because

01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:12,460
we can't just keep you know get asked

01:03:10,270 --> 01:03:13,960
each other to give more money so going

01:03:12,460 --> 01:03:19,780
outside of the Drupal community to raise

01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:21,130
funds yes star so really really quick

01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:23,020
guys I think we can probably only take

01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:25,990
like two more questions than I have to

01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:27,730
go so sorry this is my first grupo con I

01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:29,500
represent one of these larger

01:03:27,730 --> 01:03:30,900
organizations we do three billion

01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:32,650
dollars a year in revenue

01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:34,839
congratulations or six hundred million

01:03:32,650 --> 01:03:38,920
dollars we are betting our business on

01:03:34,839 --> 01:03:43,330
Drupal as a large corporation I can tell

01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:45,849
you that unless the community comes up

01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:48,650
with a way where we can and companies

01:03:45,849 --> 01:03:51,260
like mine can contribute in a way

01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:54,200
easy for us to give we don't have we

01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:55,940
don't have necessarily specific agendas

01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:59,210
we're a member of large-scale drupal

01:03:55,940 --> 01:04:02,000
we're so many other stuff I think you

01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:02,960
need to as a community figure out how

01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,380
you're going to deal with some of the

01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:07,819
stuff where you going to put the money

01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:10,220
throw out all the issues about control

01:04:07,819 --> 01:04:13,039
you need someone simply do the project

01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:15,289
management the the helping to organize

01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:17,210
the all of the administrative stuff even

01:04:15,289 --> 01:04:19,010
if that organization did nothing other

01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:22,849
than just hired people whose job it was

01:04:19,010 --> 01:04:25,069
just to help answer emails that

01:04:22,849 --> 01:04:27,069
administrative background in and I think

01:04:25,069 --> 01:04:30,049
this era thing you do is you need to

01:04:27,069 --> 01:04:33,020
this has already been solved mozilla

01:04:30,049 --> 01:04:34,940
Linux Foundation my sequel I mean

01:04:33,020 --> 01:04:37,339
there's a plethora of communities out

01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:42,200
there who have solved this problem why

01:04:37,339 --> 01:04:44,329
are you trying to solve it again this is

01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:46,700
the first step to that but I hear what

01:04:44,329 --> 01:04:48,770
you're saying so we should find the

01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:51,470
people who will get the infrastructure

01:04:48,770 --> 01:04:55,970
together and fund them first they can

01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:57,470
continue on basically so obviously i

01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:59,059
enjoyed your presentation but one of the

01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:01,279
funny things is that committers went on

01:04:59,059 --> 01:05:05,349
your thing and there are really source

01:05:01,279 --> 01:05:08,510
right now they were the big c I'm

01:05:05,349 --> 01:05:09,440
crowdsourcing where the funding goes in

01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:11,920
the committee is a really good idea

01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:14,329
rather than crowdsourcing the funding

01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,160
right crowd sourcing the what instead of

01:05:14,329 --> 01:05:18,170
crowds are independent where the funding

01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:19,760
goes rather than oh yeah so using the

01:05:18,170 --> 01:05:23,150
crowd to decide who gets it instead of

01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:25,359
asking them for money cool thanks

01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:25,359
everyone

01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,620
