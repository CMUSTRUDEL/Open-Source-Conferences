copernica which is a marketing

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:45,149
automation and gym and guitar which is

00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:49,370
analytics currently because we feel what

00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:51,570
data is is important not just to deliver

00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:54,210
rightful a solution also ongoing

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:59,550
marketing kind of relevant timely

00:00:54,210 --> 00:01:06,330
marketing unique the regulator p i'm

00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:09,750
going to be said i am a base I'm the

00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:12,570
head of money had socks tools and will

00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,659
give a little bit on overview we are

00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:18,060
what we do and Barclays project so we're

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,939
the international grassroots football

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,970
division of not United with commercial

00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:26,939
there are four pillars to that the

00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,100
Academy the foundation charter arm

00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,500
center of excellence in on what we do

00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,119
around the world and we put amelie

00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,340
delivered to two children ages eight to

00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,799
eighty but we've delivered to drill no

00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,729
younger and two people to 80 years of it

00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:44,939
we are in jet or a loop on time we are

00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,740
but we call an authentic experience when

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:49,320
I said that means that what we deliver

00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,750
on the field two children of all

00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,759
abilities is essentially the same

00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,310
training practices that matches that

00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,469
refers to even academy good boy every

00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:01,439
day but we do it in a way but the

00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:03,710
children have to take part but they feel

00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:08,030
like everybody draw as

00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:11,330
to play might I'm actually employed by

00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,610
nike nike run much needed socks tools as

00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:16,370
part of a wider long-term merchandising

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,830
agreement the nike uses my twenties of

00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:23,600
the school's to karate much night of

00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:26,450
ground around the world as you ever meet

00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:30,380
thousands of children in any part of the

00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:33,890
world and our programs generally

00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:36,050
speaking operated with experts partners

00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:38,690
in territories we have a relatively

00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:42,790
small team Manchester we do all

00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:44,690
of the strategy the curriculum and

00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,370
quality control to make sure it's

00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,950
delivered in the right manner all talked

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,540
with norm of our own coaches family sent

00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:53,330
from Manchester do work for us all over

00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,489
the world do these partners exactly

00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,470
party to territorial hours to print a

00:02:55,489 --> 00:03:01,670
scalability that our small team in our

00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:05,330
own want to be able to deliver but we

00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:07,850
have identified ace with small team that

00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:11,480
clearly digital opportunity for us to do

00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:15,470
we reach forum light and in rivaling we

00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,120
found that were both very much like mind

00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:21,260
getting leader structures and we were

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,420
trying to pursue we created this project

00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,120
in order to ensure that we had

00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:28,100
consistency against all of the different

00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,920
operators we have around the world and

00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:35,600
hopefully then pants and synergies for

00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:37,459
everyone's benefit we have about 10

00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,019
parts around the world in various

00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:43,190
locations which are coming to a second

00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:45,440
and then we went into this very hard

00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:48,560
each one of those operators and along

00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,260
website with some creep on boat engine

00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,200
some of us engines and some it to walk

00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,760
quickly so degree in isolation we can we

00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,769
say look you know that's not going to

00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:01,280
benefit everyone leave all this together

00:03:57,769 --> 00:04:02,730
is not our main aim you a set of the

00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,900
main site and then

00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:08,640
now we're rolling out Papa mini-site for

00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,239
to give a sense of where we operate we

00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,120
have full-time operators in India China

00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:18,919
Singapore and in place and then we have

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:23,010
seasonal camps as well in places like

00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:25,080
Scandinavia it's all these partners of

00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:29,810
different goals of different needs when

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,810
we try to do easy CPS orphan centrally

00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:35,039
so just to give you an idea with the

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,910
product description or the impossible

00:04:35,039 --> 00:04:42,750
task the term that we gave being torn

00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:45,210
rivaling week eight where we saw realty

00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,830
pretty consistent to be present to

00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:50,820
elevate the random mugging artichokie

00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:52,650
schools it needs a central these

00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,150
problems energy but essentially from its

00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,400
end you need to build and roll up to

00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:00,539
each individual bauxite with initial

00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:03,120
product and don't know control the drive

00:05:00,539 --> 00:05:04,770
standardization across reporting because

00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,050
we would have got different types of

00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:10,849
rebirth wonderful project coffee with

00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,849
this will have one single essentially

00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,930
we've got three global size that we need

00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:20,580
to merge develop demote nonsense the

00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:22,229
front men traffic easily and boy I want

00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,820
to do is we said earlier network wants

00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:26,370
to sell unique product to need a local

00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:28,500
markets depending on cultural

00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,630
differences the needs of the football in

00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,800
those countries we have different

00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,820
products so you can actually we could

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:37,740
write down that perfect project and I'll

00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:40,200
doing it our own this consistency and

00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,110
this is Central and hopefully my team

00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,669
century Manchester could increase often

00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:49,229
called collaboration and support for

00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:51,180
parts or fear along with more after two

00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:53,190
terms the requirement just keep it

00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:59,760
simple Windley very naughty side note

00:05:53,190 --> 00:06:03,720
the region I need to be able to be on PC

00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:07,139
be unexpected multiple charges in court

00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:10,770
ferenc's responsively because obvious

00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:13,830
they want you see now and will Barton

00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:18,990
automation features oh yeah I'm going to

00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:21,750
contact me to go for top-notch fantasy

00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:25,890
43 for selecting say the way correct

00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:27,469
amount of oxygen fantastic job for us so

00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:31,940
I'm going to Hunter PK now to explain

00:06:27,469 --> 00:06:31,940
homemade sensitive than we wanted

00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:41,520
actually mainly livened Canada so we

00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:44,729
started off with with a base rookie

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,969
Commerce module I was super modules and

00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:49,620
be kind of before we embark on our

00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:54,450
developing this project delivery this

00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:56,039
project we know commerce really well and

00:06:54,450 --> 00:07:00,389
we've done many many projects using

00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:06,330
commerce so drupal commerce became a de

00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:08,370
facto default solution because as multi

00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:10,950
stood the project and its requirements

00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:14,430
it became obvious them would it really

00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:16,650
flexible checkout system and and drupal

00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:21,270
commerce does not really well win with

00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:24,180
extra pains we needed to validate forms

00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:25,830
as they were being filled I'm gonna fill

00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,409
the slides i'm going to show you that

00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,180
the multiple steps to check out and

00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:32,669
there's a lot of information gathering

00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:36,029
during that process before the checkout

00:07:32,669 --> 00:07:37,979
and after the check out so dr. commerce

00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:43,830
is quite strong it doing that we also

00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:46,200
used views extensively and i'll cover

00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:50,430
some of that later and also the ability

00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:54,060
to handle many payment I'm so that was

00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:56,719
also kind of a strong part of what

00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,880
people pumps in together the other idea

00:07:56,719 --> 00:08:01,969
whether key things were and are using

00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:05,610
the entity and geography will appear

00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:10,760
because of the nature of multi steps and

00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:12,600
multiple and the data sets we acquired

00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,960
views

00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:20,910
huge number reports very custom and

00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:22,740
because views uses fields with custom

00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:27,840
entities and especially because we're

00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:29,670
storing their details so the main kind

00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,090
of thing was broken down into eight

00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:43,770
steps during the project planning stage

00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:45,930
and the requirements were as vegas so we

00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,730
then proceeded on to the next step which

00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,590
was to actually designing the use of

00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,750
journeys so that was kind of first steps

00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:53,760
or understand broadly or the plant wants

00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,830
and then would try to make sense of it

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,220
by actually finding out the journeys

00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:03,420
typical user journeys and invariably you

00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:06,230
know a visitor would would end up giving

00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:12,390
to the side viewing and of course

00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:13,890
absolutely the basket checkout and then

00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,900
along that process through a lot of

00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,340
details been captured so I'm going to

00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,890
detail up some of those a little bit

00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:22,320
later and then the key key thing about

00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:25,080
this project was in the way through

00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,300
Congress was used which is once you

00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:30,210
create an order in Drupal it invariably

00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:34,580
cannot be modified but the system

00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:36,960
actually the mites United required was

00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:41,940
that the order could be modified

00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:43,980
afterwards okay so a number of things

00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,140
can become me the order afterwards so

00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,080
this was quite unique or we believe it

00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,880
teammate so first episode optimizing

00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,960
check out to the first step invariably

00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,880
is ready standard these days where you

00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,770
capture just an email address because

00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,560
that then enables you if the parties are

00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:03,740
abandoned because of the complex nature

00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,180
of the forms phone filling was required

00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:10,050
all that information usually is not

00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:11,850
available at hand by the user so they

00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:14,130
may offend in the basket at some point

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:18,360
in the in the process so we made sure

00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:20,440
that discussion university gave us the

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,150
ability to

00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:24,730
to then communicate with them

00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:26,650
automatically so I'll cover a bit of a

00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:29,050
little bit later and once you completed

00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:31,390
Lee booking you then would come back and

00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,590
view your orders and actually the system

00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,180
will tell you what sort of things you

00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:36,460
coming them and what are the things you

00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:38,860
need to do or what are things you need

00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,530
to book more on top of a connection

00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:45,880
order so the same order gets modified

00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:48,460
most of the times so the first thing we

00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,510
get dressed or what data will be put

00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,950
into capture so in this case we were

00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:56,440
looking to capture parents details or

00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:59,020
guardians details child's details and

00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,780
only main a gender & medical details

00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:04,840
some of this data is actually used to

00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:07,180
validate whether they are appropriate

00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:10,810
for that particular time so like age is

00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:12,790
used in that way also the details of the

00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:15,760
person transacting which men may not

00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:18,850
necessarily be the parent or guardian so

00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:20,110
again it's a third party also the

00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,110
ability to actually have multiple

00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:25,630
product types so we were selling courses

00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:27,820
amps airport transfers weekend stays

00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:30,520
with export letters because a lot of the

00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,290
kids come from all over the world and

00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:35,410
they may require visas to enter the

00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:39,790
United Kingdom and also multiple payment

00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:43,510
methods so editing an order multiple

00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:45,040
times was it was a big challenge are you

00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:49,000
guys familiar with commerce in the

00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,410
weight worse now okay well it could do

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,540
this okay it's a huge amount of

00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:55,210
customization break and away the other

00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:57,070
complication that was added was the

00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:59,350
ability because of the value of the

00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:02,170
order if these are high value products

00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:04,720
so typically a top-end courses over

00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:07,810
2,000 here yes she causes the table 2

00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,780
pounds 3,500 pounds it's difficult the

00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,370
people essentially calling on girls who

00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,650
need to eat their cheese to pay over K

00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:18,930
you design so initially just to get the

00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:22,839
booking then they can take apart payment

00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:26,110
and to help and then they can come back

00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:29,200
and pay off the balances not only that

00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:30,100
they can also come back and purchase

00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,360
extras

00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:36,100
I expected with a camper the other big

00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,660
thing was also the ability to actually

00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:42,040
check out without paying anything at all

00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:44,170
and I think that's a bit crazy right but

00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,970
actually works because if the Liao's

00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,290
people just go to the checkout and then

00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,690
they've gotten in or did we come back

00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,519
and pay and it could pay a little come

00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:55,329
back get and pay with our unspoken

00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:57,190
credit cards and search also the admin

00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:58,779
staff can also want to receive them

00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,149
times if you can apply depends on the

00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:05,259
customer okay so they can do that

00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:07,529
manually the big be a threat to the

00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:09,819
system was the ability to order excuse

00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:12,519
these are all kind of upsells and

00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:16,509
cross-sell not cross sucks but upsell to

00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:18,339
do the extras to the camp itself so

00:13:16,509 --> 00:13:20,920
think that airport transfers we can stay

00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:22,569
as much difficult and soft case so these

00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,600
are all things we can sell up to it and

00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:32,709
they can be attached we will order the

00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:35,800
reference number is the same always so

00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:38,560
just to kind of recap so what if I one

00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:42,339
global site many partners lights the

00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,920
site database shares users orders in

00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:49,029
contact okay so it was a very kind of

00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:52,360
integrated system each site or a

00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:58,600
homicide has a unique set of programs so

00:13:52,360 --> 00:14:01,750
we used a number of families are two key

00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:03,579
module these is probably 50 60 modules

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,860
and some custom modules were also

00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:07,750
developed for the system but the main

00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:11,170
access currently you familiar with the

00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:13,839
main access module yeah so that was used

00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:15,279
it used to control commissions because

00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,699
what we wanted with a system where

00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:21,130
global admin role could go at any site

00:14:18,699 --> 00:14:23,949
whereas localized and Ben could only

00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:26,949
control and modify and manage the local

00:14:23,949 --> 00:14:29,050
science we also used the workbook module

00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:34,630
I think some guys will be familiar with

00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:36,939
a transfer and also to control the the

00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:39,399
content workflow as to our country could

00:14:36,939 --> 00:14:40,809
be published locally less in India and

00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:42,019
it would either be then be pushed into

00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:48,559
the global site

00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:50,749
or vice versa the the other big

00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,649
requirement which others intestine was

00:14:50,749 --> 00:14:57,559
apart from the b2c element of the system

00:14:53,649 --> 00:15:03,220
we also needed a b2b system because

00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:03,220
apart from being able to sell local

00:15:03,309 --> 00:15:09,529
compound not local caps we also have

00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:11,540
field agents sells field agents we have

00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:15,920
sales agents around the world which

00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:19,549
could be they could be stated travel

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:22,160
agents it could be especially sport two

00:15:19,549 --> 00:15:24,410
agents and they also themself in

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,299
whichever tochi there an expert for

00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:29,660
group bookings how it's beneficial to

00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:31,129
them they might organize the travel for

00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,420
transfers themselves so it's business

00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:33,739
for them it's great for rules because

00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,809
then we maybe get rather than one

00:15:33,739 --> 00:15:37,850
individual booking will get 20 or 30 to

00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:39,980
music group and we also know how to keep

00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:42,110
leader to take a lot of anywhere than

00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:45,769
rich in that we've going over to the UK

00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:46,999
for us okay got to mention this in the

00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:49,009
early stage of the project that we

00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:51,319
needed this work so this was kind of

00:15:49,009 --> 00:15:54,259
another mini application within the

00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:56,779
application itself where major could

00:15:54,259 --> 00:16:00,040
come along and actually make block

00:15:56,779 --> 00:16:05,990
bookings and then fill out those details

00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:08,079
by a blogging a csv file the agents also

00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:10,730
had slightly different payment options

00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,629
their roles would also signify work

00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:16,459
being work commissions they received

00:16:13,629 --> 00:16:18,980
they also generate invoices of each

00:16:16,459 --> 00:16:20,660
booking that they made either as full

00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,910
booking or as part booking for each

00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:28,160
child so that could supply invoicing

00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:31,009
directly to the tires also we used

00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:33,559
another key body we used was the drupal

00:16:31,009 --> 00:16:36,259
message module which was used which

00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:41,480
automatically generates emails to chase

00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:44,149
the payments for on a Penant for

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:48,940
administration menus were i customized

00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:53,110
we use workflow using workbench

00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:56,890
I am also the admin role allowed orders

00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:58,390
to be amended by by having staff and the

00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:00,580
other kind of nifty little feature which

00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:02,740
which is under Drupal is to ability to

00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,060
log changes every time you touch the

00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,189
Lord and put something on it it will

00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:07,870
create a lot with the order so we viewed

00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:09,400
it underneath there's a lot of all the

00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,319
activity that can automatically

00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:15,130
generated by the system that becomes

00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:17,199
very useful and also if somebody were to

00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:19,270
cancel an order again it can be handled

00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:23,230
automatically with an email and very

00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:25,810
simply the customer the reporting engine

00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:29,110
was developed there are many many

00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:31,120
reports that were specified about 25

00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:34,410
different reports which we have all down

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:38,280
until NGOs which did the role of 25

00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:40,300
definitely port so you could for example

00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:43,510
abundant basket was a kind of key

00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:46,150
feature how to manage content parts was

00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:49,630
a key feature a requirement up front so

00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:52,810
those are is a report that we use with

00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,430
great views that allowed the admin staff

00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:57,180
to actually come and use that as a

00:17:54,430 --> 00:18:00,310
reiteration tool either then and

00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:02,230
afterwards so the system itself will

00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:04,270
manage the abandoned parts so try a

00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:05,950
time-delayed emails i'm going to show

00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:08,740
you adam everyone quite complicated

00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:11,050
which does that process and there are

00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:14,530
many many of the things that they had in

00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:16,240
can draw information the control because

00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:18,910
some of it is operational some of its

00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:21,940
for sale service for marketing for

00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:25,090
example operational reports we have kind

00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:27,940
of an insurance report for example so

00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:30,190
this report would specify this

00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:34,150
requirement insurance company would list

00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:35,800
children and treat them in a troops for

00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:41,490
the purpose which holds makes a danger

00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:41,490
while they in the cal in the NHS care

00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:51,580
for marketing we developed a multi-step

00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:53,169
many many multi-step emails which will

00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:55,840
generate depending on where you are in

00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:58,720
the checkout or if you had a reject or

00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,429
if you had bought an extra and so on and

00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:03,279
so on and there are many many many many

00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:05,019
of these resilient a great example of

00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:07,899
one of those and if you're not using

00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:10,360
that you should use the message module

00:19:07,899 --> 00:19:14,370
because it's fantastic configurable

00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,370
module for exactly this kind of purpose

00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:21,190
also all the data that were collecting

00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:23,409
while transactions users and so on was

00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:25,659
also being pushed into the Copernican

00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:28,210
our cultivation idea which was then

00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:30,279
which is then used now to actually

00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:35,710
automate a lot of the other marketing

00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:38,259
outside of the transactions we're also

00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:40,750
now in the second phase of this project

00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:43,480
where we're actually helping MSS with

00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:47,740
email marketing social media sir to

00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:51,960
display remarketing and landing pages

00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:54,549
based on what we call kind of optimizing

00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,950
pages as you go along so you look at the

00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:58,600
forms of very spiky pages and if they're

00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,840
not quite right we experiment and we

00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,669
optimize and create landing pages we're

00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,850
also going to be introducing website

00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:08,289
tracking which is more akin to scoring

00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,909
people as the land you create the

00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:13,779
profile and you score them based on

00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:16,600
their journey doing deficits as a single

00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:19,720
or multiple visits and when you know who

00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:23,169
they are when they put something in the

00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:25,779
basket you then attached all of the

00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:28,539
history browsing as you decide to the

00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:30,549
profile so that then gives us an insight

00:20:28,539 --> 00:20:33,039
and then we're preparing for next season

00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:34,720
where we will then know what the typical

00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:37,179
journeys look like what are the top 10

00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,889
days like that and try and optimize them

00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:43,600
so this is very much a private business

00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:44,919
application that actually is optimized

00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,500
or we won't opportunity to deliver

00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:49,850
maximum raffia

00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,380
so this is a diagram most and i'll show

00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:55,190
you so this is tip of you somebody's

00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:56,510
actually put a camp book are trying to

00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:59,090
book a camel and put them in the basket

00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:02,510
for it's 88 compound which is English

00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:04,760
and football language which is a

00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:07,309
specific course that teaches football

00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,960
and also English language it's not tapes

00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:10,730
that complete the configuration China

00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,880
and they're not very good with English

00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:19,640
so they get total shocker as well as

00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:22,940
English so it's a great selling so this

00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:29,750
is a kind of automated messaging example

00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:32,570
we developed using but essentially it's

00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:35,090
a workflow as to you've paid not paid

00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:38,330
how much it you pay these emails are

00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:40,010
time delayed so you know seven days

00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:42,020
later what happens 40 days later what

00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:45,110
happens based on your previous session

00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:48,140
or reaction and the ultimate goal is to

00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:51,140
get them get the user through this time

00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:54,980
based thing get the payment and prepare

00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:59,929
them send a child to the camp so it

00:21:54,980 --> 00:22:04,660
works really really well so it's gonna

00:21:59,929 --> 00:22:08,120
present what have impacted actual phone

00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:10,700
so as BP said it's been a lot of work is

00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:13,040
going to so far and I'm stop yeah we're

00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,260
always looking to to optimize whether it

00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,929
be the front and the back end the

00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:20,049
experiences that we've all accounts

00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:23,510
before just do a bit of an idea before

00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:26,030
we see the successes so far which you

00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:29,000
know forever bills of any huge really do

00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:32,390
we were hoping to project but certainly

00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,520
the render tree so we see this turn up

00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:35,900
school five percent versus a yeah

00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,870
that might seem like a relatively small

00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:41,179
increase book then the external marks

00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:43,790
have not changed all that much the beets

00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:47,929
in this 33 work a few people that use

00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:51,080
the website before they're going to use

00:22:47,929 --> 00:22:53,240
it I conversion rate because he's such a

00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,060
high-value product you know we don't

00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:59,670
need to sell

00:22:54,060 --> 00:23:01,230
than to actually promote conversion rate

00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,720
in the shins better time we didn't

00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:06,660
finish project now which obviously this

00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:10,440
stage of the soil in right now for the

00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:15,540
sauruses the huge impact purchasing

00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:17,460
fights in our revenue that's something

00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,810
that we've been up high before we have

00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:21,240
nothing to do that we didn't know you

00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:24,000
some more doing.on and pandan what I was

00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,010
it they've gone the opportunity now copy

00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,500
of email account if you different

00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:30,780
messages of the gun to come back also

00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,460
females don't work have the detail so we

00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:34,470
can contact them we can form and we can

00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:36,210
email them personally we can use all

00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:38,970
manner of ways try to close them to

00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:44,640
common purchase so if I kind of jump in

00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:46,740
revenue for us it's been huge something

00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:49,680
that we probably we had an idea for me

00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:53,070
started in realizes Justin the scheme

00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:55,410
line of the administration the reducing

00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:57,780
of costs not just for essentially and

00:23:55,410 --> 00:24:01,680
how it h cube also for all parts around

00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:03,930
the world they they all pay we sweeten

00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:06,570
be centrally great invest in this fall

00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:08,310
apart inspire horizon speak to be boxes

00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:12,150
which was a fraction of what they paid

00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:14,130
for them on their own websites with 20

00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,780
times more ability to do things there

00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,430
are foremost and maybe even did our

00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:22,380
e-commerce before but now we're getting

00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:25,230
to speak with them it's an increasing

00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:27,480
revenues the mobile devices which I mean

00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:30,180
anybody who's doing a building that

00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:33,750
flavor is responsive uncles and is

00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:35,340
that's that's huge was well we find one

00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:40,070
more people who are using our website

00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:42,150
and dirty well BB mobile or tablet

00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:46,530
something that will try to encoding or a

00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:50,670
more forbidding states as well or not PK

00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:54,510
to the negative and positive stuff you

00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:57,300
call them tickets to me so there are

00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:59,820
along the way we made some assumptions

00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:01,380
that were probably incorrect and during

00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,440
the discovery phase we probably do a

00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:06,649
pinta slippery enough

00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,929
and we focused actually a lot of our

00:25:06,649 --> 00:25:11,210
focus initially was on user journeys and

00:25:08,929 --> 00:25:13,669
the flexibility that was required by the

00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:16,370
system but those were love you know the

00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:18,590
same the petals of the detail and it

00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:20,240
proved true there were some aspects that

00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:22,429
we didn't discover until we were halfway

00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,039
through the project and then back to

00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:26,750
work rework some of the best which is

00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,309
quite typical for a complex project like

00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,500
this because sometimes it's just not

00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:37,940
possible to stop everything but we

00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:39,940
should cry or didn't you know Drupal's

00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:43,610
because the way to approval is

00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:48,019
flexibility and many ways of doing the

00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:51,289
same thing right so we didn't hold it in

00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:53,419
focus enough on how we store the data or

00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:56,389
not because how are we going to ever use

00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:58,399
it so if you start from what you need

00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:59,480
you can then decide on how we can expose

00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:02,000
tough and how we going to eat it

00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,950
afterwards so data structure was very

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,509
important in the time variety of it was

00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:09,799
important we also actually towards the

00:26:08,509 --> 00:26:11,690
end of the project you discover them

00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:14,809
there are some aspects that were missing

00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:16,519
we haven't discovered so part payment

00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:18,200
was one of them which is a challenge in

00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:20,690
its own right somebody will tell you if

00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,490
you work with group commerce have you

00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:24,379
done part remnants it's difficult one

00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:26,919
okay there is a ready-made module a

00:26:24,379 --> 00:26:30,019
defect so we have to write a ton of work

00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:34,039
and those other aspects also especially

00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:35,330
taking part in US bank deposits and all

00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:37,429
those kind of stuff you know that that

00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:39,710
would discourage fairly later on after

00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,240
the project all you can point out so

00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:43,879
both of the kind of things that I think

00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,289
discovery is very important because

00:26:43,879 --> 00:26:47,059
sometimes the time will not tell you

00:26:45,289 --> 00:26:49,629
everything if you not ask the right

00:26:47,059 --> 00:26:51,950
questions you don't discover it and

00:26:49,629 --> 00:26:55,519
sometimes you just don't know to ask my

00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:57,529
question so no talking actually is very

00:26:55,519 --> 00:27:02,500
important you know to talk more tryna

00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:04,909
work things through a little bit more so

00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:07,850
let's face what what are we doing so

00:27:04,909 --> 00:27:09,470
we've already done three sites i think

00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:13,090
we're about to launch inlay something

00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:15,550
logical yes so India is being launched

00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:16,900
launched a glee last month and we

00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,700
already have some global site and the

00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:21,070
YouTube site so we're kind of launching

00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:22,540
one on a site per month but I think you

00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:25,390
can accelerate that so I think with the

00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:28,390
next three months faisal project will be

00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:30,520
complete we're also implementing a

00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:34,660
content strategy to try and get more

00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:36,220
traffic to the site and then this is an

00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,570
ongoing process every three months we

00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:40,060
look at the customer journeys are

00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:43,060
optimized for them and hopefully improve

00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:46,510
the conversion conversion rates and then

00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:49,000
the key thing is and always wanted it

00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:52,780
like a you know elimination time in

00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,570
passing colorful dashboard management so

00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:57,580
the Edmondson coloring some plastics and

00:27:55,570 --> 00:28:00,040
all that just to see to have to deliver

00:27:57,580 --> 00:28:02,710
the metrics that he wants to keep an eye

00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,870
on but delivered in a graphical form so

00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:07,120
we're below for building in dashboards

00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:10,810
and live an application that is being

00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:13,930
built by labelling all because go check

00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:19,030
it out described by bi th double I ve

00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:21,730
com so I think it kind of hope it's been

00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:23,440
useful for you guys if you've any

00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:27,580
questions will take a few questions I

00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:30,460
think we've got 30 time you're no

00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:31,990
technical questions for me please metro

00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:37,690
is our technical i'm at the business

00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:43,750
another occasion so well first born and

00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:50,670
raised Evertonian head of internationals

00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:50,670
an Evertonian saw three creepers promote

00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:57,700
your time releases

00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:01,150
was that all mayonnaise completely by

00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:03,970
that the message module talk about it

00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:06,940
was Drupal what manage your actual email

00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:10,300
going out yes yes all the transactional

00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:11,770
emails and under the emails and payment

00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,809
anything related dependent them so

00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:15,520
everything that is that is generated

00:29:13,809 --> 00:29:18,270
within Drupal using the procedure and

00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:21,550
did you find much of a performance

00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:23,770
people the right to alter manager well I

00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:26,230
think those these are not high volume

00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:30,400
emails so you know you're probably

00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:31,929
sending out maybe touch levels but maybe

00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,230
no more than fifty hundred emails per

00:29:31,929 --> 00:29:44,230
day so it wasn't usually have a huge

00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:46,450
impact on application right just a

00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:48,730
question I ran that role as for your

00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:58,120
partner sauce what sort of energy did

00:29:48,730 --> 00:30:01,000
you go with it why are you let's interns

00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:03,010
of it they describe the rollouts be more

00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,610
underneath beta switch partners needed

00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:08,140
it deserves really subpar thority more

00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:10,210
adding the curve in terms of e-commerce

00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:12,010
so we're comfortable with them keeping

00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:13,960
their websites in the shorter until week

00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:17,410
we got some of the ones that have more

00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:19,510
of a need did you have a house for about

00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:21,240
training rollout strategy for the

00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:23,820
partner sites I'm sure if indescribable

00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:27,360
yeah we've had them over to Manchester

00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:30,130
variety also prepares video tutorials

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,600
documentation you know we we have to

00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:33,040
hold them under the short term as well

00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,270
so we'll do a bit of that fold and from

00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:37,059
lunch as well to help them through the

00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:39,460
process of using it as well so each seat

00:30:37,059 --> 00:30:41,530
seeks it's not a fast process because we

00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,270
were effective these are more on

00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:45,220
websites this is their business engine

00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:46,840
and the walkways sowing seeds holding

00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,030
their hand for publicly you know the

00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:50,330
rollouts I guess certainly very lovely

00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:52,490
table

00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:53,750
for us the easy planets that make each

00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:55,519
other comfortable with it and also

00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:58,460
making sure to get most out as time goes

00:30:55,519 --> 00:31:00,140
by them did you with the documentation

00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,120
if you have it by phone online and

00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:06,679
offline sort of experience or did he

00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:09,230
build documentation till I'm in the main

00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:11,720
way we deliver this is through to

00:31:09,230 --> 00:31:14,899
actually speak screen capture and then

00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:17,779
put it works alright so more visually

00:31:14,899 --> 00:31:19,250
rather than actually having worked so we

00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:20,690
took the screen take orbit written as

00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:23,269
well so obviously while the heads up

00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:25,340
computer maybe we can be taken off their

00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:27,380
screen shown them deal World War work

00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:30,080
with through the actual administration

00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:32,289
systems Austin see how to use it and one

00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:50,659
more question how you guys can impeach

00:31:32,289 --> 00:31:53,899
global priority features feature request

00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:58,460
those countries every actually all the

00:31:53,899 --> 00:32:00,710
features are available in all for all

00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,720
our sites so there is a degree of

00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:05,360
civilization here we try and not

00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,460
customize each runner site to that

00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,700
practically the main thing that they

00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:14,179
live in customized is content and

00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:17,630
product but beyond that now creatures

00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:19,850
are the future set is decided centrally

00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:22,549
by HQ always sit to the knees because we

00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:24,380
understand the laws to move maybe the

00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:25,610
mom got the sophistication that we're

00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,769
trying to bring to this well for the

00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:29,330
handbook oh yes logotypes once were what

00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:30,679
repetitive and all odds are promoting

00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:32,779
then we'll try and look at it on it on a

00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:35,779
three-month page took a lot of things

00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:37,880
that would like everyone submit their

00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:39,440
ideas now if there are things that the

00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,330
reason for everyone needs that will

00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,889
probably film that sensually even

00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:45,440
individual parts do something themselves

00:32:42,889 --> 00:32:47,600
in wuxi travel for their business then

00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,510
we'll let them fund it file I think so

00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,399
there will be potentially possible

00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:56,120
things but not difficult several the

00:32:52,399 --> 00:33:00,700
needed resting but menu features of them

00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,700
Robert all sizes whether the use of

00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:16,840
hi so all the reporting is that all done

00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:21,340
in with use yes most yes it is in fact

00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:23,230
yes yes it is possible it really is it

00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:26,500
requires artwork button but it is

00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:29,350
possible and also will also got export

00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:31,510
creatures so when you create a view for

00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:34,240
something we go to export the data so

00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:36,790
you can just take it it just is it so

00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,500
and also in there in the ruin views you

00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:41,440
can add filtering and so there's a lot

00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:44,320
of flexibility in views and there are

00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,030
some advanced features within within

00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:50,650
views that you can use to generate dish

00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:54,460
books I work with nonprofit and just

00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:56,920
like you we our product is relatively

00:33:54,460 --> 00:34:00,340
valuable sponsorships it's relatively

00:33:56,920 --> 00:34:02,320
high long-term value and so just like

00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:05,320
you we have a fairly low converge great

00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,630
for our product my question is when

00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:10,510
you're looking at optimization have you

00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:12,639
been able to implement my body's testing

00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:14,020
AP testing or multivariate testing with

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,520
the conversion rate like that or if you

00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:21,580
use other methods of our transition yes

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:24,550
we've already in fact in fact within a

00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:26,020
couple of weeks I think even be treated

00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:30,300
within a couple of weeks of side one

00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:33,550
life we noticed that those a drop off

00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:36,310
during the journey because the counts

00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:40,929
were not visible but it should be so we

00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:43,210
actually might have merged couple of

00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:47,110
steps into one into one step and cut out

00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:50,320
device up so we constantly look to do

00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:52,149
split testing constantly so any key page

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,389
during the journey or even its landing

00:34:52,149 --> 00:34:57,040
page is optimized and test it but this

00:34:55,389 --> 00:35:00,100
is an ongoing process this never stops

00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,330
of course you tell you is woven on the

00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,190
biggest pain when it comes close to

00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:05,800
anything constantly looked at the

00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:07,480
website every hour they're thinking

00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,170
that content better can be placed at

00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,580
that particular module out camp in a

00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:15,910
better place that might be more visible

00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:17,470
and it's not easy it's also we have not

00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:19,510
necessarily thought that consumers

00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:21,790
sometimes you only find out by moving it

00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:22,990
and doing it and then you realize would

00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:26,800
you let the rapid season all the wrong

00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:28,450
decisions PK SE q no u fellow called the

00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,640
mountain gate that I are moving about

00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:33,310
too much for you don't really finish

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,730
more than any other side what or you're

00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:39,370
using the quarter what are you using for

00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:42,640
the testing always google webmaster

00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:44,350
tools are you yes because again there is

00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:48,100
no troop of modules like the search for

00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:49,780
you i know and i'll be honest with you

00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:51,850
something that's been in the back of my

00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:55,540
head for a very long time in fact we

00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:57,820
lastly developed we started to develop a

00:35:55,540 --> 00:36:02,170
female a new theming engine for triple

00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:03,790
seven which kind of unfinished what are

00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:05,590
the key features of this was the ability

00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:09,100
to actually create pages on the fly

00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:10,870
which to do the edges with tests but we

00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:12,790
kind of shout that because the amount of

00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:16,120
energy that was required to keep it up

00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:18,430
to date and then reduce responsible it

00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:20,860
just became a bit too much into this

00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:28,470
because it is also agreed pieces so we

00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:31,560
can kill it yeah I keep thank you

00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,560
anybody else

00:36:34,289 --> 00:36:43,390
yeah but not difficult on please okay

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,859
with yours yeah your partner sites do

00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:47,079
they have responsibilities diffusion

00:36:44,859 --> 00:36:49,450
denied access and certain rights that

00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:50,920
they have responsibility or I guess

00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:52,869
we'll come to asset management all

00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:55,569
images and all that sweet stuff how did

00:36:52,869 --> 00:36:58,869
you guys get sharing content and images

00:36:55,569 --> 00:37:00,910
across the web site shows it okay so

00:36:58,869 --> 00:37:03,400
like image libraries and so on bear

00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:07,450
their share so it's a central repository

00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:09,880
for access that you need content and

00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:12,670
then just be created on a per domain

00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:15,369
basis and then you may decide you may

00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:18,609
have the role that says you can publish

00:37:15,369 --> 00:37:23,529
this elsewhere or part of your own local

00:37:18,609 --> 00:37:25,059
site so invariably you know if there is

00:37:23,529 --> 00:37:28,180
a news is something which is of interest

00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:31,329
globally that can be pushed into HQ

00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:33,160
where pump technology will then decide

00:37:31,329 --> 00:37:35,049
whether to publish their art so there it

00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,999
is tweak it and the publishing globally

00:37:35,049 --> 00:37:39,369
so the Indian publicly comes on that

00:37:36,999 --> 00:37:42,670
side and we make tools but we love to

00:37:39,369 --> 00:37:46,210
say yes it's okay we'll pull over how

00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:48,700
did you go out there come to SEI sharing

00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:50,349
that content from the grapple site for

00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:53,589
the practice on to the global soda juice

00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:57,219
boxes sonic albania so clear absolutely

00:37:53,589 --> 00:38:00,190
so because what i say can weaken whoever

00:37:57,219 --> 00:38:01,869
decides who is actually publishing the

00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:04,719
content or creating the content we

00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:06,519
decide where it might be of use and even

00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:10,239
you may review ever find that drought

00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:12,670
when the publish content globally the

00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:15,249
indian market images I perhaps for

00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:18,279
interest into India and they can pull

00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:21,479
that story in action publishing that's

00:38:18,279 --> 00:38:21,479
tricky thank you

00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:27,739
well thank you for attending this

00:38:25,619 --> 00:38:30,089
session I hope you found it useful and

00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:32,489
if you need any more information well

00:38:30,089 --> 00:38:36,299
you can actually afford to get my email

00:38:32,489 --> 00:38:40,219
and stuff so anyway if you're not

00:38:36,299 --> 00:38:44,099
running down its peak a ltl UK com or

00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:46,609
converse is live in DVD com thank you
