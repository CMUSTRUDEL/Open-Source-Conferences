	00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:07,560
alright so welcome everyone to our

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,410
business showcase we're going to be

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:13,469
discussing personalization and Drupal

00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:16,379
which is actually a topic that I think

00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:18,840
will appeal to almost any brand any

00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,150
business any industry and so what we

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,760
tried to do is assemble a panel of

00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,980
experts that are kind of on the

00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:29,310
forefront of using personalization in a

00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,399
Drupal context we have Lee Hammond from

00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:35,550
interscope records Erin Peterson from

00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,480
Time Inc and Mike lamb from Pfizer so

00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:41,820
sort of representing a good

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:44,789
cross-section of b2c b2b and MEP media

00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,550
entertainment business my name is David

00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,680
many I'm part of the Aqua lift product

00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,170
team a talk via which is our

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,820
personalization offering but I thought

00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,860
I'd do is kind of kick off today a

00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,629
little bit around just the fundamentals

00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,239
of personalization some things to keep

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,670
in mind and especially why Drupal is

00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,619
particularly well-suited sort of a more

00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:07,920
open approach to bringing data together

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:10,950
and using that to more effectively

00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,140
target consumers customers and get

00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,220
people to write content and information

00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:17,100
and then what we'll do is sort of move

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:19,259
into a panel format so in order to sort

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,780
of tap into the to the brain trust we

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:23,520
have of here we'll have a couple of seed

00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,810
questions to kick things off but

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,030
definitely want to keep things

00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,470
interactive so if you're if there are

00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,229
questions that come up as we go through

00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,670
especially in the panel section yeah

00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,610
feel free to use the mic fits in the

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:39,030
center here and we'd love to have you

00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,079
ask anything that's on your mind all

00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,420
right so we're going to start off with

00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,240
sort of a what is personalization why

00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:48,149
it's important and why an open approach

00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,670
really matters and then we'll sort of

00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:53,939
dig in to each one of the customers we

00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,070
have here and sort of get a sense of how

00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:57,570
they're using Drupal today how they're

00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,479
using personalization what kinds of

00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,820
things they're thinking about doing now

00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,860
and in the future and then we'll open it

00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,369
up after that for questions from you

00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,790
guys so just sort of starting off on a

00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:13,170
what is personalization I think most

00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:14,310
most industries both team

00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,300
just across a variety of different

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:20,459
businesses have fairly common challenges

00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,709
albeit their uses of personalization may

00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,860
be completely different but the fact is

00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:28,290
it's all around getting a quality volume

00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:31,500
of content produced and in front of the

00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:33,690
right type of user as we know people

00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,209
evaluating products on a typical website

00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,370
built in Drupal there are technical

00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:41,160
evaluator looking for more technical

00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:43,170
content there might be marketing users

00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,019
looking for the business value or the

00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:47,940
impact of a particular product towards

00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:49,739
their business serving them the right

00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,660
content and at the right time and

00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:53,940
they're buying journey is one of the key

00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:57,720
reasons why personalization can really

00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:59,610
can really help so obviously about

00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,560
delivering a great digital experience

00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,860
Drupal's phenomenally well suited to

00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,420
cutting-edge digital experiences but

00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,940
it's also more than just the web right

00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,680
and this is another area where dribble

00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,540
can really help take some of the

00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,180
insights gathered from someone

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:16,769
interacting with a web page and then be

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,870
able to serve them content across

00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:21,079
different channels so maybe it's a

00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,390
targeted email campaign maybe it's

00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:26,220
interconnection through a social

00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:28,140
metaphor could be even shifting contest

00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,780
context to something like a call center

00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:32,700
so when someone's searching for content

00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,340
on a website that they aren't finding

00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,440
how do you be more proactive in terms of

00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:39,570
shifting the context from the web

00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,680
conversation maybe to a call center

00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:43,019
conversation because you know that

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,320
person may call in for some additional

00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:48,570
detail segmentation is also an

00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:52,230
incredibly important starting point and

00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:54,510
an incredible important piece of success

00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:56,430
around a personalization story it's

00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,989
really helping understand what your

00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,750
audience is doing when they come to the

00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:02,160
site it's one thing to say people are

00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,750
logging into the site and we know who

00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,850
they are because they purchase products

00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,280
or things of that nature but what about

00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:10,230
anonymous users right and most of the

00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:12,120
traffic coming to a typical website

00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:13,709
these people aren't logging in they're

00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,530
not identifying themselves or not

00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:18,600
filling out forms but they may be doing

00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:20,609
research may be looking at products they

00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,830
may be trying to educate themselves they

00:04:20,609 --> 00:04:24,870
could even be constituents coming to a

00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,120
local government site looking for

00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:29,160
information so how do we make sure that

00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,199
we can create an experience that's

00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,729
compelling to them that's engaging for

00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,050
them that serves them the right

00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:37,560
information that's really one of the

00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:40,169
goals of personalization as well so it

00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,860
really boil it down it's these three

00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:45,750
things and we feel sort of in this order

00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:47,520
that understanding your audience sort of

00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:49,350
building up that unified customer

00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,660
profile about what your audience is

00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,810
doing on the site what content they're

00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:57,030
consuming how they got there and

00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,889
anything including the real-time data

00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,930
that's available for example what time

00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:03,090
of day it is with geolocation they're in

00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:04,979
what kind of device they're coming to

00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:07,260
the site with so if that's a smartphone

00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:09,780
a tablet they're coming through a laptop

00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:12,139
all this stuff can be really critical in

00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:15,860
deciding what content to present them

00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:20,520
the segmentation that I mentioned is key

00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:22,110
anyone who is looking at segmenting an

00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,699
audience typically looks at a known

00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:26,310
audience right so like for people that

00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:28,320
have responded to an email campaign or

00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,960
of you know bought a product from us

00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,450
before that's the easy group of people

00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,919
to segment the anonymous traffic is even

00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:37,289
more important to segment so really

00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:40,110
understanding who's coming to the site

00:05:37,289 --> 00:05:41,580
who is your highest value customers what

00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,860
kind of content are you going to present

00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,220
them and once you understand the

00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:48,270
audience you understand the segments

00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,940
then you can actually start optimizing

00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:53,160
that site so whether that's through more

00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,590
behavioral targeting understanding what

00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,669
a user is doing sort of anticipating the

00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,039
journey that they're on and then

00:05:56,669 --> 00:06:01,440
presenting content to them at the right

00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,289
point in that journey or doing something

00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,820
like running a navy test or a

00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:07,440
multivariate test to sort of test

00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,810
content and messaging and to see what

00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,400
resonates with that audience so those

00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:16,680
are kind of the three pillars of

00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:17,970
personalization that that we see so you

00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,050
guys are probably seeing the eyestrain

00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:24,360
chart Scott Brinker's famous for the

00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,789
chief martec technology landscape bottom

00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,770
line there is an absolute ton of

00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:31,979
marketing technology that's available

00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:33,479
roughly 1,800 different systems and

00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:35,550
platforms that are available today and

00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:37,169
Drupal is incredibly well suited to

00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:39,030
connecting with these systems out of the

00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:40,560
box right because there's generally more

00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,720
modules

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,850
or agility in the Drupal community to

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,350
connect to these systems and the in a

00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,230
series of modules available to connect

00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:51,419
these systems is freely available but

00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:54,180
then when you go into an omni-channel

00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:55,560
world again looking at the website and

00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:59,190
personalizing the website but then

00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:00,690
looking at other channels as well so

00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,520
while Drupal is incredibly well suited

00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:04,530
and you can do a lot at the JavaScript

00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,250
layer interconnecting different data

00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:09,840
sources to make choices on the website

00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:12,389
it's also really important to have rich

00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,740
api's and the ability to do sort of

00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:19,889
system to system connections things like

00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:23,250
marketing automation tools where a lot

00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:25,680
of demand jenilee gen marketers live CRM

00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:27,990
systems which are important to the

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,660
Salesforce it's your record of your

00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:32,550
customer base and bringing the data from

00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,979
these systems together to build an even

00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:38,790
richer profile of that customer so

00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:41,790
starting off with basically anonymous

00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:44,130
traffic moving through to a known user

00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:45,810
and then augmenting the data from

00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,310
existing systems that you have that

00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:50,160
really sort of builds the richest

00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:52,320
possible profile and the advantage is

00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,660
that all of the teams within your

00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:58,350
business can rally around that single

00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:01,440
integrated view right I think digital

00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:02,789
marketers traditionally are closest to

00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,110
the website and having a good

00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:06,870
understanding of what content is

00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,700
consumed on that site is important but

00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,260
there's lots of marketing teams there's

00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,760
lots of lots of people that have a

00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,919
shared interest and what that customer

00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,780
is doing including your Salesforce how

00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,430
do you get a shared view it's by

00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:21,630
federating that dated together in a

00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:25,289
single spot so just sort of looking at

00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:27,470
the journey right typically customers

00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:30,030
coming to a website are going to be

00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:31,860
clicking on a content coming there by a

00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:34,530
key words coming there through search

00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,779
engines may be responding to an email

00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:39,479
campaign that you send out but they're

00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:42,209
still relatively anonymous to you right

00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,339
at some point they're going to sign up

00:08:42,209 --> 00:08:46,920
for a newsletter they're going to add

00:08:44,339 --> 00:08:48,360
their email address to a forum for more

00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,670
information they might buy a product

00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,920
when you have some unique identifiers

00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,790
they kind of move in

00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,680
known world and you can kind of merge

00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:00,290
the anonymous tracking that you've done

00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:04,970
of that user with their known identifier

00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:06,470
which you can then use as a key into the

00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,480
other data sources that you might have

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:11,209
in the enterprise right and using Drupal

00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,470
to bring that information together so

00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:14,870
it's all around building that unified

00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:16,940
customer profile and as we go down from

00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,860
your most traffic being anonymous users

00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:20,690
to the more detailed traffic at the

00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,670
bottom it's basically that continuum

00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:26,630
that personalization can really help

00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:28,519
with as I mentioned it's not just the

00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,230
website and it is really really

00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:32,180
important to make sure that you're

00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:33,709
grabbing the insight from all the

00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,089
channels and the touch points that your

00:09:33,709 --> 00:09:37,699
customers are interacting with you

00:09:35,089 --> 00:09:39,050
around sure the web is probably where

00:09:37,699 --> 00:09:41,360
most people are doing their primary

00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:43,339
research but again are they coming

00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,260
through mobile devices primarily or is

00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:46,910
there a certain tendency or a time of

00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,500
day or a certain point in their journey

00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,720
that they use a different kind of device

00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,699
or interact with you in a different way

00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:56,269
and how do you optimize the experience

00:09:52,699 --> 00:09:57,740
to that so if you look at a typical

00:09:56,269 --> 00:09:59,779
journey map I mean these things are

00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,180
pretty complex right there multi-channel

00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:04,519
there's a bunch of different touch

00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:06,230
points that a customer will have with

00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,320
your particular site and with your

00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:10,910
particular brand at any given point and

00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,610
bridging that anonymous visitor traffic

00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:16,279
with the known user systems that you

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:18,350
have is really sort of the goal that

00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:20,690
personalization has and why Drupal is

00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,519
really well-suited to sort of bringing

00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:26,750
and bridging those worlds together in

00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:28,279
those channels together so the unified

00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:30,140
customer profile was the first pillar

00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,300
the second piece is really around

00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,890
segmentation so this is really

00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:36,079
understanding what your audience is

00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,819
doing through the behavior that they

00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,319
exhibit because again if you know who

00:10:37,819 --> 00:10:41,149
they are that's one thing if you don't

00:10:39,319 --> 00:10:43,160
because they're not telling you who they

00:10:41,149 --> 00:10:44,300
are it's only through behavior that

00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,940
you're going to understand what they're

00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,010
really up to so being able to track some

00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:52,060
basic situational data where they are

00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:54,350
what time of day it is things like that

00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:56,120
behavioral data in terms of how often

00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,519
they come back to the site when they

00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:00,860
come back how long do they spend what

00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:03,260
kind of content they look at what kind

00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:04,690
of interest do they have and bridging

00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,000
that on to

00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:08,890
more of a multi-channel profile in terms

00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,050
of what else are they doing on social

00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:14,380
channels what do we know about them from

00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:16,180
our CRM system have they contacted our

00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:20,020
call center for help previously things

00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:21,940
like that then the third pillar is

00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:24,250
optimization so once you have the data

00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:25,900
collected once you have an understanding

00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:28,960
of what your audience is doing and what

00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:30,460
sort of segments they fall into how do

00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,470
you use that data how do you make it

00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:34,690
actionable right so it's all around

00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:37,420
surfacing that information in the

00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:40,630
analytics tools that most of your teams

00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:42,580
are probably already using right so that

00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:45,130
could be something like GA google

00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:47,080
analytics that could be integrated

00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:49,450
reporting within the drupal environment

00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,040
or it could be direct access to the data

00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,110
that's being collected I think that's a

00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,390
really important tenet is keeping that

00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:58,330
data open and making sure that you can

00:11:55,390 --> 00:12:00,430
access it in a unified way is also

00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:01,930
really important because otherwise well

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,550
we're sort of breaking down the data

00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,320
silos of where all this customer

00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:07,630
information is you don't want to have

00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,310
reporting silos on top of that right

00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,750
because if you have to look at 15

00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,700
different places to figure out what your

00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,980
customers doing it doesn't make you very

00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,450
agile and doesn't make you sort of able

00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:18,490
to take take advantage of the best

00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,920
opportunity so there are different

00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,270
reporting and analytics strategies but

00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:28,480
these are the ones that we definitely

00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:30,190
see we see most often and then of course

00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,720
if you understand your audience and what

00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:34,600
they're up to you then running a

00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:36,640
directed test like an a/b test or a

00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,920
multivariate test definitely something

00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,650
that a lot of people are looking to do

00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:43,540
in a personalization context but running

00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:45,070
a test to a general audience generally

00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:47,640
not that effective like asking the world

00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,180
do you like this better or this better

00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:51,339
generally doesn't give you a

00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,570
statistically significant result but

00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:55,360
once you understand your audience

00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:57,640
segments if you run tests against those

00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,800
segments then you're generally getting a

00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,260
very relevant result and usually much

00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,300
quicker as well so that's kind of the

00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,400
process that we see most of our

00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,860
customers take when they're tackling

00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:12,190
personalization especially within their

00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:14,020
drupal site so i wanted to pause there

00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,490
in case there are any questions just on

00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,089
the fundamentals but what i wanted to do

00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:20,370
is sort of shift gears to the panel

00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:22,410
introduce our speakers and sort of dig

00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:24,749
in more around how they're using Drupal

00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,720
today and what they sort of see the

00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:30,329
promise of personalization within their

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,170
within their respective companies so if

00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:38,759
that's ok any questions at this point

00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:40,529
nope great all right Lee look in here

00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:43,170
who you are and what you're up to you

00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:46,249
hear me ok is perfect thank you so I'm

00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:49,050
leeham a network and interscope records

00:13:46,249 --> 00:13:52,860
that's home up a lot of artists I'm sure

00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:55,649
you know lady gaga I'm an m5 imagine

00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,329
dragons so I manage the official

00:13:55,649 --> 00:14:01,370
properties for those artists again

00:13:57,329 --> 00:14:04,110
Eminem calm lady gaga calm these are

00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:06,029
umbrella marketing sites and more and

00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,730
more becoming direct ecommerce sites as

00:14:06,029 --> 00:14:15,899
well that's something we're adding to

00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:17,759
the mix and the sort of speak to one of

00:14:15,899 --> 00:14:21,449
the problems that we wanted to solve a

00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:26,459
Drupal was the managing a big portfolio

00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:29,399
sites at scale and this is a high-touch

00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:31,949
hi bran business so each of the artist

00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:34,529
wants a snowflake and I need to make it

00:14:31,949 --> 00:14:37,290
up here like I have a machine behind it

00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:38,970
but make snowflakes so I do feel like

00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,860
drupal multi-sector bullets of the

00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:48,540
products we use for mafia make that a

00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:50,819
possibility in reality and so now that's

00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:52,829
sort of the framework as aquaworld a

00:14:50,819 --> 00:14:53,939
personalization that that land with a

00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:57,779
couple other things that we've been

00:14:53,939 --> 00:14:59,579
spending our time on I mean honestly the

00:14:57,779 --> 00:15:02,879
music experience for fans is so

00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:05,339
fragmented that the artist site is sort

00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:07,470
of a catch-all which should be a good

00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:09,600
thing but oftentimes we don't really

00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:12,089
know why you're here are you here for

00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,069
the tour because again and in fact not

00:15:12,089 --> 00:15:16,829
only is a catch-all I work at a

00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:18,749
recording label but I'm one of the

00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:21,029
business partners to an artist we sell

00:15:18,749 --> 00:15:22,390
her Lady Gaga's recordings but she has a

00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:25,750
separate merge company

00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:27,790
booking agent and endorsements and yet

00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,830
we are the emissaries for her brand and

00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,960
fans want to come find out a lot of

00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:34,990
different things there so some ways i'm

00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:37,120
using left to just ask a basic question

00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:39,430
why are you here do you want to buy

00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,170
something do you want to and also i want

00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:42,310
to do want to buy a t-shirt you want to

00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:45,340
buy tickets do you want we look at some

00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:47,890
videos for my like some photos the

00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:50,020
learnings from that then combine that

00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:52,780
with i also want to tell marketing what

00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:55,000
you want them to do is not maybe not

00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:58,570
what they want to do and this is allowed

00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:00,340
us to say we all know that we only get

00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:04,600
that one of our revenue streams is when

00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:09,040
they buy the new album at itunes or that

00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:11,020
target but when the context for these

00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,970
users is they're coming to an artist

00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:15,070
site they probably what I've learned is

00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:16,000
they probably know where itunes is but

00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:18,010
they're coming to the site for a

00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,600
different experience but I have to tell

00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,820
even internally and I think this is

00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,010
going to be just a little billy

00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:26,290
conversations here with lift lift

00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:27,970
cohorts is that it's as much about

00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:30,640
personalize the experience for the user

00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:32,020
committed the side is it is teaching our

00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:33,670
internal marketing teams you got new

00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:37,600
tools here you have to think differently

00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:39,790
you have to you know what and so for me

00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,050
I just want to make sure what I gave you

00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:43,050
four slides is what I'm talking about

00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:48,910
that's good so far yeah so those are the

00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,560
kind of my learnings and then and we're

00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,420
starting with very lightweight cases

00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,910
like I said why are you here and doing

00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:57,130
multivariate testing is this working in

00:16:54,910 --> 00:17:00,610
i'll give you a cup at hawk examples

00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:02,920
where we took a carousel of harold

00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:05,230
banners that were loading up and turned

00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:08,380
them into persistent randomized testing

00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:09,910
then the one that we had thought was the

00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,130
going to be the winner of the itunes

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:13,900
banner on street date nobody cared about

00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:16,570
that the video that was two months old

00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:19,329
was still the winner even in that sort

00:17:16,570 --> 00:17:21,820
of surprised me my ass it's media but we

00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:24,910
thought well that video is played out so

00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:26,620
i like to say to marking this is sort of

00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,690
having a dance because i want to come in

00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,700
to kind of don't buy again we will all

00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,660
make money when we have more fans engage

00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,490
with the brand we

00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:35,530
have to draw a direct line and quickly

00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,000
haven't leave the site so I need more

00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:39,940
data like that I think we're still in

00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,560
early days here and even in the case

00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,870
where the number one thing is driving

00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:45,310
something then when I said well let's

00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,890
try three different creative let's

00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:51,460
figure out a different way to work with

00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:53,950
that and then when it comes down to the

00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,120
next level personalization is great at I

00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:56,620
know where you live and I know this

00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,560
artist is coming over the next two weeks

00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:01,900
here's a concert highly relevant the

00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:06,010
more we can extract the name of the

00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:08,680
local venue even better and then because

00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:10,600
we know device we we know that and I

00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,600
iphone users going to be an iTunes user

00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,730
and Android user well most like could be

00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,910
at Google play's or you know but we can

00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:21,070
customize in that regard and then as we

00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:22,570
get that anonymous to know we know

00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:24,310
you're a male or female that's where we

00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:26,320
could have some I mean this is

00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:27,850
definitely like a walk run and I feel

00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,830
like this is at the run okay we're going

00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,300
to get creative for male or female we're

00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:34,360
going to do different things because we

00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,230
know that we are also doing something

00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:38,560
that I'm not going to spend a lot of

00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:42,700
time on but when we do register users we

00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:44,890
are at registering them with social

00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,230
profiles and that can Facebook and

00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:50,080
Twitter and then we are expanding on

00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,370
that insight about that user and asking

00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,410
their permission to say can we look at

00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:56,710
other artists you like on facebook on

00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:59,320
Twitter on and that's giving us a really

00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:01,480
360 view of you as a music consumer I

00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,000
know you came to this artist site as an

00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:07,090
Eminem fan and I could maybe expand

00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,980
genres but if i look at your social

00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:10,510
profile I know exactly which artists and

00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:13,930
it will definitely go beyond hit ball

00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:16,900
and so I have a one-to-one you like

00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:18,970
these artists and then Interscope as a

00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:21,420
music company and universal as a big

00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:23,770
parent company we are using that data to

00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:25,810
talk to music consumers and make sure

00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:28,390
that we're putting in our music in our

00:19:25,810 --> 00:19:31,840
artisan and speaking staying relevant

00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:33,100
throughout the cycle so that's a I would

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:36,940
definitely say that's the most

00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:38,050
aspirational part of that before I

00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,060
handle up to you

00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:43,650
get to that I did I did find some

00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,650
affinity with one of your guys in that

00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,870
you know we are working with very narrow

00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:51,730
brands I'm working on artist site so

00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:53,710
there is a limited HP I may know you

00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,720
love Katy Perry but I can't really use

00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:57,640
it in this context I'm sure you have a

00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,220
lot of drug brands but you can't cross

00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,410
promote them right that's but anyhow

00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:04,120
that's these are all sort of these are

00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:06,100
nice problems to have and they're down

00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:09,030
the road here okies that's that's

00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:11,200
probably below hanging fruit for there

00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:12,610
yeah we can dig in a little more around

00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,760
that because I think that's a great

00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:17,650
topic but Mike did you want to give us a

00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:21,550
little bit of an idea what visors up to

00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:23,380
show so on the shower i'll do my drupal

00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:25,120
intro so if i have been using drupal as

00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,130
our standard technology for building web

00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,380
applications for about three years now

00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:31,270
is the beginning of 2012 we said this is

00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,130
just our standard now and at that point

00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:35,020
we had about 60 systems that we

00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,490
consolidated so we spend a lot of time

00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,930
just consolidating from different

00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:40,360
content management systems get into one

00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:43,180
platform again just likely people want

00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,560
snowflakes we built about 1200 assets of

00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:46,420
the last session the last two of those

00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,760
three years and we tried not to build

00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:50,340
1,200 snowflakes again right so a lot of

00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,480
efforts competing going in for trying

00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,830
consolidate this and convince brown

00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,120
managers that the thing that you want is

00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:56,920
actually not completely different from

00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,540
the things somebody else wants so you

00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,250
can put these newer capabilities in

00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,660
place and then use them across across

00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:04,000
the platform

00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,980
so on the platform itself we'vewe've

00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,420
benchmark to be forty percent faster and

00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:09,700
sixty percent cheaper than those

00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,070
previous approaches we can solid eight

00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,650
of those platforms and now we have 86

00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:15,940
brands and forty 40 markets on Drupal

00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:18,070
right so this is a really good

00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:19,960
foundation for us to say we have this

00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:22,150
capability we saved a bunch of money by

00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,590
consolidating it we can build websites

00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:26,170
really fast let's take it to the next

00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:28,090
level and build some new capability and

00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:30,760
of course personalization is top of that

00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,750
agenda well I'd say it's kind of similar

00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:33,700
to what what you were talking about

00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,800
there is we built twelve hundred

00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,810
properties right this isn't pfizer com

00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:39,970
one big property that's on Drupal and

00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:42,070
that set that's 1200 individual

00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:43,870
individual properties and then a lot of

00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:46,090
content within them so if you imagine if

00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:47,650
you're a customer advisor that we have

00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:49,450
lots of different types of customer

00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:51,310
trying to navigate that to get the right

00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:53,050
content for you it's can be challenging

00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,700
so that's what we're trying to try to

00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,590
address here is if you want to come to

00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,820
us or if we're if we're marketing to you

00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:59,230
at least make sure what we're getting

00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,690
into the right place and we're getting

00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:07,420
the continents most most relevant to you

00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:09,370
and so what did I its annual food you

00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:11,470
cover that one room so focus on the far

00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:13,600
far greater relevance of content for the

00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:15,040
user so an example would be for doing if

00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,010
we're doing email marketing right simply

00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:19,690
for marketing content to to a user we

00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:21,430
want to course focus focus on making

00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,800
that relevant and personalizing it and

00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:25,870
that's not a DM I'd rather than whatever

00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:30,250
it is it's really use the data we have

00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:31,570
on that person to make it relevant if

00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,920
we're sending someone an email we

00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,810
probably have some data on them already

00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:37,780
we have some some things we can use and

00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:39,160
you if you have that there's a whole

00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:41,100
bunch more you can do than if you've

00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,799
course we met just anonymous people

00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:45,210
turning up to your side and the first

00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:46,530
stage of what we're trying to do is is

00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:47,970
simple things that users are going to

00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:49,980
expect if you receive an email from

00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:52,020
Pfizer and we've managed to do a good

00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,820
job and personalize it for for you if

00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:55,230
you click on one of the links in in that

00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,910
email as you talk about this different

00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:58,679
systems you're crossing across across

00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,970
here don't let them click on that link

00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:01,380
and then see something completely

00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,120
irrelevant for them right that's that's

00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:05,700
not going to give somebody a good user

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:07,020
experience and sometimes crossing across

00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,700
the different systems the things can be

00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,900
challenging but using some of the

00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:12,600
technology we're talking about here you

00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:14,640
can make that a lot easier so figure out

00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,890
who you're targeting with which content

00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:21,480
get the content to them and then have a

00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:22,980
good good user experience so

00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:25,440
multi-channel lots of different channels

00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:26,909
we can focus on right now we're focusing

00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,409
on web with Drupal because we have a lot

00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:30,140
of Drupal and we were doing email

00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:33,179
marketing so these are two focus areas

00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:34,650
pfizer have lots of different customers

00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:36,539
we have healthcare professionals who may

00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:38,010
prescribing our products we have

00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:39,900
patients who might be taking those

00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:41,909
products we've got caregivers of people

00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:44,549
who might be taking one of our products

00:23:41,909 --> 00:23:45,780
we have consumer brands so chapstick and

00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:48,570
and these kind of things have a

00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:50,460
completely different different audience

00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:52,710
so across those different types of

00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:54,929
audiences and different types of users

00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:56,789
we have very many different options and

00:23:54,929 --> 00:23:58,740
strategies if you imagine chapstick

00:23:56,789 --> 00:24:00,299
being at one end of the scale some of my

00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,090
turnip of chapstick calm from the

00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:05,130
facebook page we don't know who they are

00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:07,140
we can we can try some things there on

00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:08,880
the other end of the scale we work in

00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,919
lots of different markets in many of

00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,440
those markets to visit our web

00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:15,210
properties and see information on

00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,799
pharmaceuticals you have to validate the

00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:19,220
your healthcare professional so that

00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,929
gives us it's always been a challenge of

00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,250
it's been a huge barrier so if somebody

00:24:21,929 --> 00:24:24,390
wants to visit one of our websites in

00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:26,159
that situation they could have really

00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:27,630
invest in registering improving I am a

00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,850
professional healthcare professional

00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:32,490
before seen in the content so hopefully

00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:34,950
now we can take take bear and say okay

00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:37,080
you've invested you've given us some

00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:38,250
data we can actually use that to say

00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,660
once you're in we can actually give

00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,580
something that's relevant to you rather

00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,660
and you're in and now you get to hope

00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,970
that's the right property that you're

00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:50,400
after and then good luck finding the

00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:53,130
content that's the hope yeah that's

00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:55,260
great thanks Mike and I guess just to

00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:57,180
round out things here Aaron what is your

00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:00,570
perspective from from Time Inc what are

00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:04,110
you guys so we are roughly where pfizer

00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:06,210
was 2013 we started just over a year ago

00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:09,720
moving all of our worldwide sites to

00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:19,800
Drupal we have we also have 86 brands

00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:21,030
worldwide six brand Club of here so my

00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,310
core engineering tubes are four

00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:25,170
different locations and for us moving to

00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:28,050
Drupal means that we have a consistent

00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:29,520
framework with which we can which we can

00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:32,400
approach the experiences are building

00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,740
for our audiences and when we think

00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,690
about our audience is a time we think

00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,130
both about the end user audiences that

00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:40,950
people who are coming to us for content

00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:43,110
and also our editorial teams we believe

00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:44,820
very strongly that our editorial teams

00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:47,490
our users as well and that we have to

00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:49,800
think about their needs as being primary

00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:53,060
alongside the needs of our third-party

00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:55,890
audiences when we think about

00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,300
personalization at time we think about

00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:59,970
it from the perspective of a media

00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:02,640
company where in the u.s. roughly half

00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:05,100
of all people in the US will visit a

00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,660
time brand in any given month where we

00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:09,150
have over 100 million unique visitors

00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:11,130
worldwide every month and where our

00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,720
portfolio brands range is well beyond

00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,520
what people typically think of when they

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,770
think at the time people in Time

00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:19,240
magazine Sports Illustrated all the way

00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:22,760
over to sunset and rugby

00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:24,560
Southern Living when we think about our

00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,450
audiences then we think about we have

00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,650
this audience this audience most people

00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:29,030
in this room like razor yeah did you

00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:31,820
read Time magazine when you were in

00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:33,650
elementary school yeah we all right time

00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:35,900
magazine I don't necessarily all read

00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,130
Time magazine today so how do we go

00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,870
ahead and how do we provide that

00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:41,270
experience that people are used to

00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:42,860
coming to major news weaklings to get

00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:46,070
how do we provide that context and I

00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:48,590
view on the world and be able to inform

00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:51,230
the content that we provide our

00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:53,570
audiences very important for us if for

00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:56,030
example you are a sunset user and you're

00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:58,820
going to come and look on sunset content

00:26:56,030 --> 00:27:00,320
it's very very useful for you if we know

00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:01,850
the temperature zone that you're living

00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:04,220
in or if we have some of the basic

00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:06,410
weather information about where you're

00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,420
living so that we can serve up content

00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:11,030
that is incrementally more relevant for

00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:13,130
you and for us personalization takes the

00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:15,470
form not necessarily of how can we sell

00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:17,630
you more stuff but how do we craft and

00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:20,169
engaging content experience that really

00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:22,509
gives you what you're looking for

00:27:20,169 --> 00:27:24,759
that allows you to engage more discovery

00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:26,169
and less engagement in searching for

00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:28,869
things they are looking for and from

00:27:26,169 --> 00:27:30,909
editorial perspective our ability to

00:27:28,869 --> 00:27:33,009
forecast what our editorial team wants

00:27:30,909 --> 00:27:35,200
at their fingertips and put that right

00:27:33,009 --> 00:27:37,779
in there CMS makes it easier for our

00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,519
editorial team to to create experiences

00:27:37,779 --> 00:27:42,129
and curated experiences whether those

00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:43,539
are content or a loser video or whatever

00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:46,239
files in dimensions that they were

00:27:43,539 --> 00:27:47,799
creating and get those pieces together

00:27:46,239 --> 00:27:50,289
and get that content right in front of

00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:53,649
audiences who really appreciate and with

00:27:50,289 --> 00:27:55,809
whom it's really going to resume the way

00:27:53,649 --> 00:27:58,690
that we're using personalization today

00:27:55,809 --> 00:28:00,820
is in its pro walk run things we're

00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:04,119
talking about about this before as a

00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:05,919
company we have we have a lot of data

00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:07,419
and information around our audiences and

00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,970
that helps us paint a picture and an

00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:11,950
understanding of core audiences are both

00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:13,509
as individuals and as groups and the

00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:15,279
challenge for us now is how many take

00:28:13,509 --> 00:28:18,009
that understanding of core audiences are

00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,989
and then apply that toward giving them

00:28:18,009 --> 00:28:23,249
that content experience in that very

00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:23,249
personal and very rich why

00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:29,630
yeah that's great so we're all at

00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:31,130
different role at different points of

00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:32,930
entry kind of to the personalization

00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:35,690
story so I wanted to sort of kick off

00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:38,390
the panel with some of the results or

00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:40,250
early results or at least benefits or

00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:42,410
impacts that you've seen personalization

00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,180
having so we've talked about you know

00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:45,560
some of the things that can help sort of

00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:48,170
stitch data together and things like

00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:50,600
that but what's what have you seen as

00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:51,770
help you guys move the needle in your

00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,770
respective businesses or what do you

00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:57,470
anticipate it'll help most with and it

00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:59,870
anyone can jump in and saraly so I've

00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:01,280
jump in to say excuse me when we started

00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:04,010
out with personalization we were we were

00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,420
very excited and when when these

00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,800
products started to mature especially

00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,660
when they were built into built into

00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,400
Drupal we were very excited about the

00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,260
potential and we went and spoke to lots

00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,540
of people about what could happen with

00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:16,910
this and we read a lot of research and

00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:18,470
there was one hoping come courting

00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:22,210
arrival so he's a Juniper Research that

00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:24,200
said an email that is personalized again

00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:27,710
targeted content for a particular user

00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:29,600
is 19 times or drives 19 times more

00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:31,610
engagement than the one with the blast

00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,470
email right so we were quoting some of

00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:35,330
these statistics in the case and then we

00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:36,980
tried a few pilots and there was just

00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:39,020
bit in the middle we're very nervous so

00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,940
like okay we've quoted that this is what

00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:43,790
what could happen and what really does

00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:46,280
happen and we was representative those

00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:48,020
numbers which which drives a lot of

00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:50,330
interest in continuing continuing this

00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,620
it is hard to do like there's we've

00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,240
learned about the market is and their

00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,560
their abilities to understand and

00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,290
implement this technology so it's hard

00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:58,790
to do on a large scale but the numbers

00:29:57,290 --> 00:30:01,100
that we've seen are definitely aligned

00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:03,580
with with published research on some

00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,580
very impressive

00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:11,190
fantastic actually on that front row if

00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:14,410
you guys have anything else to interject

00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:16,570
around results but one of things I want

00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:19,090
to dig into to is just around the sort

00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:21,010
of the the culture of optimization are

00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,750
getting teams to kind of think about how

00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:25,030
to do this on an ongoing basis because I

00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:26,650
know if it's just a set it and forget it

00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:28,240
it's probably not going to drive any

00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:30,700
meaningful results of our time so what's

00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,790
really doing it in a prescribed

00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:37,930
iterative way so I'd love to hear more

00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:40,510
about you know timer interscope what you

00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:42,160
guys have found effective so I think we

00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:43,750
brought it up when he was speaking and I

00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,390
think that was a really good way to set

00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:48,730
it in when from an engineering

00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:50,860
perspective we decide that we're going

00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:53,140
to deploy mechanisms to allow teams to

00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:54,610
engage in personalization it's not a

00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,160
matter of building a future and just

00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:59,200
shipping a future putting that tool

00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:01,540
putting that feature out there within a

00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,300
corporate environment means that rolls

00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:06,160
all around you change what people can do

00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:08,410
and how they can achieve success and how

00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:11,410
they hire peers within the organization

00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:13,390
to find success begins to change you

00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:16,240
gave a really good example of how it

00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:17,710
used to be about reaching your thinking

00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,270
about people you're reaching online as

00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:21,250
customers and getting them to engage in

00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:22,990
a conversion but it's really about how

00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:25,410
do you build that rich relationship if

00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:28,320
you know that someone's a lady gaga

00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:30,060
acts and you know that they're on itunes

00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,650
now what can you put in front of them

00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,990
that allows them to engage more deeply

00:31:31,650 --> 00:31:36,080
with Lady Gaga as a brand and not feel

00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:38,490
as though as someone who's really

00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,320
passionate about lady gaga but you're

00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:42,510
just trying to sell that that end use or

00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,560
something that you really are being

00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:46,440
thoughtful about how you're approaching

00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:49,020
them from the perspective of time that

00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,510
means that as we roll out the ability to

00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:53,460
engage in anything from a be testing to

00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:56,700
begin to do algorithmic generation of

00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:58,920
content it means helping that people

00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,560
internally understand how to use these

00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:04,200
tools it completely changes the workflow

00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:06,510
and it can change workflow and way that

00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:08,580
can be very nerve-racking to for example

00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:11,850
editorial teams a lot of times editorial

00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:13,620
teams here personalization and what they

00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:15,420
interpret that to be is you're going to

00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:17,520
have machines start to figure out what

00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:19,560
content goes out in front of audiences

00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:22,160
and we've all been in a position where

00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:24,660
we've had an algorithmically generated

00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:26,160
assessment of what content we want to be

00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:28,980
in front of us at any given moment and

00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,990
it isn't as powerful as the assessment

00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,460
of an editor in terms of this is

00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:34,290
something that would be really engaging

00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,970
for this audience or this swath of

00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:40,020
audience today I'm just gonna make a

00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:41,790
joke because I I know how much I imagine

00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,590
it by that time he's really respected

00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:46,470
news brands and you hear personalization

00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:50,460
you go to BuzzFeed about those which

00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:52,380
means up that's good sorry yeah sorry I

00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,720
was just saying that if I was at her was

00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:57,270
that if I was a journalist from time II

00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,410
can i hear personalization you're gonna

00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:00,270
you're going to take us down the

00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:02,610
BuzzFeed and Huffington Post we're just

00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:07,380
gonna opposed side boob shot to every

00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:09,540
headline massive flick through no no no

00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:11,310
I know you're not I'd say I'm just I'm

00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:14,460
sorry if that's like off-color joke I

00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:16,530
just mean I Huffington Post Huffington

00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:18,270
Post started as a legitimate news

00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:20,460
publication and then they just followed

00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:23,130
the consumer to their lowest common

00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:24,360
denominator and yet you there was

00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:28,740
something right and what they were doing

00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:31,080
yeah it's just that there is a line year

00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:34,110
about where a journal will get ruling

00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,940
the brand with chasing

00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:37,710
honestly and for those weren't aware i

00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:40,260
used to work at AOL i used to work with

00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:42,690
the huffington post even certainly there

00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:44,790
was a period in 2009-2010 where these

00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:46,140
tools were rudimentary tools and the

00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:49,350
manner in which they were applied was a

00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:51,210
fast primitive but i think now if you go

00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:53,970
to having opposed or if you go to a buzz

00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:56,220
feed cats aside you're going there with

00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:57,480
an expectation that the content that is

00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,600
going to be put in front of you it's

00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:02,340
probably going to be of interest to you

00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:04,590
the elections are coming up for example

00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:06,240
and we want to be going to election

00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:08,250
sites will want to go into new sites we

00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,869
want to be getting at the very least

00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:12,060
election results that are personalized

00:34:09,869 --> 00:34:13,980
in the sense that they're derivative of

00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,629
my local floating environment not

00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:18,780
necessarily somebody shoveling

00:34:15,629 --> 00:34:20,940
contacting the editorial teams that we

00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:23,100
work with the time are among the best

00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:24,300
and longest standing best editorial

00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,159
teams that are available if you look at

00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:27,300
the team at Time magazine for example if

00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,460
you look at the team at Sports

00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,960
Illustrated they're never going to be in

00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,340
a position where they're going to be

00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:36,149
letting content be generated

00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:38,879
algorithmically even putting the

00:34:36,149 --> 00:34:40,440
engineering team certainly terms of the

00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,780
decision making visit about contents

00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,460
coming from but if you are on the Sports

00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,530
Illustrated team and you have the

00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:48,960
opportunity to have populating into your

00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:50,639
dashboard as an editor a personalized

00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,200
feed of this is stuff that's going on

00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,550
right now that's interesting in the

00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,859
sports world that you as an editor

00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,450
should be aware of it allows the editor

00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:58,800
to have a broader view and a faster

00:34:57,450 --> 00:35:00,930
filter on what's going on it and allows

00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,880
the editor decide this is the content

00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:04,560
that we really interesting useful my

00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,210
audience right now and unless the

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,950
editorial team be faster on the draw and

00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:08,680
getting that content in front of the

00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:10,750
audiences

00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,849
hey that's a much more nuanced and

00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:15,190
effective mechanism for using

00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:19,170
personalization and dish definitely

00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:21,250
don't want to take site must be correct

00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:23,140
you don't want to take the human element

00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:24,490
out of it right because I mean after all

00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,260
we're all human we all want to read

00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:28,450
stuff from other humans that's the meta

00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:32,559
communicating so I would have completely

00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:34,329
agree with that yeah and it really but

00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:37,569
it really does speak to the capabilities

00:35:34,329 --> 00:35:41,109
here our headline and personalized

00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:43,569
headlines at headline testing and if the

00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:45,010
criterias click through and again I'll

00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:48,910
give you a different example from my

00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:51,160
world the the curious how social media

00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:53,260
and Facebook and Twitter and those teams

00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:56,170
in work with this because in my world

00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:58,839
they're all the same team in music there

00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:01,809
is no the edit the digital marketing

00:35:58,839 --> 00:36:06,780
person is wearing so many hats the

00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:10,420
digital ad spend the owned media the

00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:13,690
social media and what's often

00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:15,579
challenging is that they want the

00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:17,380
workflow to be as easy to publish on

00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:19,480
Twitter as it is on the website and so

00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:21,730
Drupal you mean I have to do a be

00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:26,109
testing and this and that's I i I'm

00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:28,329
starting to think about two ways of

00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:30,549
handling that that where we we do have

00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:32,319
analysts and some people who do some

00:36:30,549 --> 00:36:34,869
additional analyst work and bringing

00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:37,059
them in to augment the digital marketing

00:36:34,869 --> 00:36:38,559
team that's over taxed as it is and so

00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:39,790
you want to run a test let us run a test

00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:41,650
for you give us the contact you were

00:36:39,790 --> 00:36:43,690
going to post on here and we're going to

00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:45,970
try some variations for you and report

00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:47,920
back would be because i'm adding

00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:50,170
basically a human service even though

00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,270
they could do it themselves i think this

00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:56,549
is the crawl phase to get to get them to

00:36:52,270 --> 00:37:01,270
go we can do things differently here and

00:36:56,549 --> 00:37:02,890
and i forgot what the side i think i

00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:05,950
remember can I try and answer you guys

00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:07,390
have the patience for this answer so

00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:08,049
when you you a great example you brought

00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:11,049
up the space

00:37:08,049 --> 00:37:13,179
so not only are audiences fatigued about

00:37:11,049 --> 00:37:15,609
having your relevant algorithmically

00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:17,439
generated content shovel their way but

00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:19,329
the social engines are recognizing this

00:37:17,439 --> 00:37:21,519
as well as take facebook or leave

00:37:19,329 --> 00:37:23,829
facebook facebook has done a remarkable

00:37:21,519 --> 00:37:25,719
job at the last six months or so and

00:37:23,829 --> 00:37:27,630
making sure that the content that users

00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:29,469
see in front of them on facebook is

00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:32,769
personalized and sensible and reasonable

00:37:29,469 --> 00:37:34,420
content from the perspective of time we

00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:37,029
generate an enormous amount of content

00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:39,339
that we do see circulate through

00:37:37,029 --> 00:37:41,229
Facebook and so it's very valuable as

00:37:39,339 --> 00:37:43,239
from the perspective of the editorial

00:37:41,229 --> 00:37:45,309
team that really only has a time to

00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:47,109
master and use one CMS but they're able

00:37:45,309 --> 00:37:48,880
to create a piece of content and CMS

00:37:47,109 --> 00:37:50,259
pushed out through any distribution

00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,910
mechanism that's good a lot of them to

00:37:50,259 --> 00:37:53,799
reach an audience and do so in the way

00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:55,449
that's effective for that audience the

00:37:53,799 --> 00:37:56,469
headline for example that you might want

00:37:55,449 --> 00:37:57,429
to penned into an article that

00:37:56,469 --> 00:37:59,199
somebody's going to pick up from

00:37:57,429 --> 00:38:00,369
facebook it's probably different than

00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:02,259
the headline that you're going to want

00:38:00,369 --> 00:38:03,910
to generate for article and put on the

00:38:02,259 --> 00:38:08,049
headline of a print magazine interviews

00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:10,329
and a new standard airport and start to

00:38:08,049 --> 00:38:12,729
do that and I know is that part you are

00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:14,650
well I could ask is that is that through

00:38:12,729 --> 00:38:16,479
some of the lift products or is that

00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:17,999
just sort of your workflow but that's

00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:20,619
really great because to me these are

00:38:17,999 --> 00:38:23,319
these are separate these are repetitive

00:38:20,619 --> 00:38:26,709
tasks log into Facebook publish your log

00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:29,199
into this log into that our expectation

00:38:26,709 --> 00:38:31,630
is eyes we hit go from crawl walk to run

00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:33,249
that we get run lift is going to be

00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:35,049
really important part of that it's

00:38:33,249 --> 00:38:37,299
important for us that we're using tools

00:38:35,049 --> 00:38:39,279
that are easy to use fast implement my

00:38:37,299 --> 00:38:41,349
expectation is that just as our needs

00:38:39,279 --> 00:38:43,209
are maturing the technical capabilities

00:38:41,349 --> 00:38:44,439
of lift arm attorney as well and one of

00:38:43,209 --> 00:38:46,160
the reasons are placing about here is

00:38:44,439 --> 00:38:49,380
that we think we're going to get

00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:50,820
so and I don't haven't you reminded me

00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:54,540
where I was going with this which was

00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:59,580
simply that sorry no I'm sorry no I hope

00:38:54,540 --> 00:39:03,450
this is interesting this is will buy you

00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:05,400
all yeah so what there isn't part of me

00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:06,810
that says you know what Facebook does is

00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,910
all our marketing people put in their

00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:11,640
Facebook post and they pray or they buy

00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:12,960
audience to see it and Facebook

00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,730
determines whether it's relevant or not

00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,680
based on in the attention they see and

00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:18,150
there's a part of me that just like

00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,770
we're doing with those hero banners

00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:21,930
we're saying let's load them all up and

00:39:19,770 --> 00:39:23,880
see which one is the winner when it

00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:26,190
comes to the other content the news

00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:28,470
items tour dates of videos I kind of

00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:30,630
want to say load it all up in the same

00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:32,610
with email and we'll let the algorithm

00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:35,160
figure it out which takes the onus off

00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:37,110
of them of the marketing person thinking

00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:39,960
about two different headlines multiple

00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:42,720
creative because it's making their head

00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,730
explode and I don't know i think that's

00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,210
miss underutilizing the capabilities of

00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:50,840
headline testing but in a resource taxed

00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:52,950
environment there's an appeal to me of

00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:55,740
following down that trend that Facebook

00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:57,330
is doing which is and even unless it

00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:00,390
sounds it's Facebook you buy search

00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:01,590
advertising on Google but though well if

00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:05,010
you're not getting clicked you're coming

00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:07,920
they won't take your money so I look at

00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:09,540
those where I was going with that it's

00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,890
sort of an information retrieval problem

00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,150
at that point right that's less about

00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:13,890
content that's more about information

00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:15,270
retrieval you guys go into your mapping

00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:17,490
today you're looking for restaurant

00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:19,080
dinner not only do you want it to know

00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:20,700
that you're in LA and not wherever you

00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,200
live if you don't live in LA but at this

00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:24,120
point you expect that so there's some

00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,820
degree of information retrieval that as

00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:28,890
audiences we welcome and desire and look

00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:29,640
forward to but I think that's different

00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:31,890
than

00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:33,630
the editorial view toward selecting

00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:35,609
content and informing and enriching

00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:40,109
people when they're coming to content

00:40:35,609 --> 00:40:42,390
right so it looks like we've had a

00:40:40,109 --> 00:40:43,769
audience member patiently waiting so if

00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:45,869
you've got a question for us we'd look

00:40:43,769 --> 00:40:48,049
really I I work in health care so I have

00:40:45,869 --> 00:40:51,660
a question for the gentleman from Pfizer

00:40:48,049 --> 00:40:53,220
our user testing has told us that most

00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,260
of the people coming to our site and

00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:58,470
looking at content are looking for a

00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:01,529
family member a parent a child so it's

00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:03,839
not necessarily for them how do we

00:41:01,529 --> 00:41:08,039
personalize how do you personalize for

00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:10,829
caregivers or parents or you know so

00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:13,140
sometimes we have entire sites where a

00:41:10,829 --> 00:41:15,269
parent or caregiver is the audience

00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:18,809
especially if you have a pediatric

00:41:15,269 --> 00:41:19,950
vaccine for example the the entire

00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:21,269
audience is ignorant here they're gonna

00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:24,269
be a healthcare professional or going to

00:41:21,269 --> 00:41:26,099
be a parent and I would say we it's not

00:41:24,269 --> 00:41:28,589
really it's not really different apart

00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:30,720
from many of those websites because of

00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:33,450
the type of content that we have is so

00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:34,950
so focused depending on depending on the

00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:36,569
use use case this is where we've kind of

00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,859
done personalization in in all

00:41:36,569 --> 00:41:40,140
technologies where you turn up in the

00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:41,670
first pages who are you like your health

00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,569
care professional or your caregiver are

00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:44,640
you going to be taking this product

00:41:42,569 --> 00:41:46,769
yourself because of content in the other

00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,750
areas it's just completely completely

00:41:46,769 --> 00:41:51,029
irrelevant what I'd say is we can

00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:52,289
completely change our approach to how we

00:41:51,029 --> 00:41:53,940
build those kind of sites are rather

00:41:52,289 --> 00:41:55,259
than having just an information

00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:57,420
architecture that drives you one of

00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:59,190
these three ways we can cross things

00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:01,109
across those three all those multiple

00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:03,240
categories using this kind of kind of

00:42:01,109 --> 00:42:05,130
technology and even take a hint as to

00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:06,000
who they are before they arrive rather

00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:09,539
than having to have them necessarily

00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,160
inform us but it's a good example where

00:42:09,539 --> 00:42:12,779
you have very very different types of

00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:15,029
content depending on the user so

00:42:12,779 --> 00:42:15,900
personalization is critical because you

00:42:15,029 --> 00:42:17,549
show them something that's just

00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,849
completely irrelevant sometimes

00:42:17,549 --> 00:42:23,430
completely inappropriate and you start

00:42:20,849 --> 00:42:25,079
with email to get them there or it

00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:27,269
depends so if we know the user then

00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:30,509
obviously email is a great is a great

00:42:27,269 --> 00:42:32,190
great method and maybe we even know if

00:42:30,509 --> 00:42:33,900
we carefully have their email address

00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:36,690
maybe we had we already have some data

00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:38,030
for these kind of websites is really

00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:39,230
people just turning up so

00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:41,480
I have an idea based on what they're

00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:42,650
searching for for example it's really

00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,420
going to be when they've heard about a

00:42:42,650 --> 00:42:45,830
product that their child's going to have

00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:47,990
maybe it's on the internet immunization

00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:49,790
schedule or something like that or it's

00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:53,690
a condition that I searching for for a

00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:57,400
friend or whatever then they get some

00:42:53,690 --> 00:42:57,400
idea of that through search results

00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,780
alright great well is there any other

00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:09,440
questions god I'd like to tackle this

00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,440
white this one there

00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:35,390
we haven't we have not had issues asking

00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:40,990
for those permissions it's it's it again

00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:40,990
it's in general that's not been an issue

00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:55,220
well for a while in fact we first did

00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:57,410
not start at this capability we saw the

00:43:55,220 --> 00:44:00,050
value in in that social signal that we

00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:02,780
almost slipped too far we didn't offer

00:44:00,050 --> 00:44:04,460
an alternative way to create an account

00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:06,260
and then we added traditional log in I

00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:08,990
would meaning you want to an email

00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:11,630
password combination and no so that's

00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:14,180
that's a depending on the artist in the

00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:16,460
site it can vary but let's just say it's

00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:19,490
about a one-in-five prefer to go down

00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:23,390
that path so that's and then as far as

00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:27,020
storage we are federating that across

00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:31,730
all of these across universal and that

00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:33,740
allows us to do central identification

00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:37,359
across not only the interscope portfolio

00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:40,190
sites but other other technologies CMS's

00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:42,140
email service providers and what we're

00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:45,170
doing with that is basically creating

00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:47,450
Ali Hammond profile his top five artists

00:44:45,170 --> 00:44:51,560
that can go to the marketing system that

00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:54,260
can use it so exacttarget can then say

00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:56,000
and we can create dynamic custom email

00:44:54,260 --> 00:45:00,290
there and I think that in terms of look

00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:02,420
a walk run or a crawl walk email is

00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:05,480
really well-suited for personalization

00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:07,190
in some ways a lot of the context is

00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:08,750
easier to talk about multiple artists

00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:11,570
that don't make sense on Lady Gaga calm

00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:12,950
and there's no runtime challenge of I'm

00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:14,630
going to go through this big I think you

00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:17,270
guys are solving the runtime challenges

00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:20,450
of lots of decisioning to draw that page

00:45:17,270 --> 00:45:21,920
but a year or two ago it was like you

00:45:20,450 --> 00:45:24,490
nobody has to wait for that email to be

00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:27,490
composed did I answer the two questions

00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:27,490
yeah

00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:32,620
good um this is kind of related it's

00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:34,510
it's it's more an ethical question than

00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:36,940
anything else I guess you know given

00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:39,970
given social login the information you

00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:43,840
have access to its social login I'm not

00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:46,690
really sure like how much of opting in

00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:50,470
anymore is really informed consent so I

00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:52,470
guess my question is really how well do

00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:55,270
you draw the line at some point between

00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:57,850
what's kind of creepy and not creepy in

00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:59,860
terms of of the information you you

00:45:57,850 --> 00:46:01,630
gather about about your visitors and

00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:04,690
like where do you draw that line if that

00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:06,370
does come up along the way dreese

00:46:04,690 --> 00:46:08,290
actually did a presentation on this in

00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:10,210
his keynote drupalcon latin america

00:46:08,290 --> 00:46:11,710
right and that he think had a slide

00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:13,390
which was like the line is don't be

00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:15,160
creepy I know that doesn't like to find

00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:17,470
the define the line but it's a major

00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,880
consideration here it says as we've got

00:46:17,470 --> 00:46:19,990
more into this kind of technology and

00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,580
understanding this kind of technology

00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:23,650
it's kind of frightening what you can do

00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:25,900
with it so it's a massive consideration

00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:27,670
as you as you implement this kind of

00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:29,410
technology and be very respectful of the

00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:31,120
data you have then making sure that you

00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:33,220
using in a ways that's really going to

00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:35,470
benefit the customer rather than being

00:46:33,220 --> 00:46:37,060
really creepy this is one of the places

00:46:35,470 --> 00:46:39,850
where I'd helps us and normally

00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:41,680
enormously to be a global team about a

00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:43,540
third of my engineering team comes out

00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,330
of comes out of lending out of Europe

00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:47,410
and the perspective on privacy in Europe

00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:49,240
is very very different than the

00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:53,500
perspective on privacy in the US for

00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:55,510
time what we think about always is boys

00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:57,670
our audience what does our audience want

00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:58,750
from us how do we help our audience find

00:46:57,670 --> 00:47:01,090
the information they're looking for

00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:03,130
whether it's sports scores or planting

00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:05,950
or how to paint your living room this

00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:08,050
year and what I find is that

00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:10,420
consistently companies that think about

00:47:08,050 --> 00:47:11,800
audience first and what does this

00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:14,650
audience point for me or what does his

00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:16,270
user one from Bay and how do they want

00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:17,650
to engage with me in a relationship so

00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:18,289
getting the point where you're providing

00:47:17,650 --> 00:47:19,640
the opportunity

00:47:18,289 --> 00:47:21,410
where if they don't want to engage with

00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:23,599
you through a social login don't make

00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:25,099
them engage with social login often the

00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,959
opportunity if they want to build that

00:47:25,099 --> 00:47:28,669
relationship with you to be able to go

00:47:26,959 --> 00:47:29,809
in through an email address of thinking

00:47:28,669 --> 00:47:32,119
about it for an audience first

00:47:29,809 --> 00:47:33,650
perspective and about building that

00:47:32,119 --> 00:47:35,630
long-term relationship with the audience

00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:38,299
not just how do I capture an email

00:47:35,630 --> 00:47:40,369
address before they pivot from the page

00:47:38,299 --> 00:47:45,160
is really important that tends to keep

00:47:40,369 --> 00:47:48,259
people honest and I was going to say

00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:50,150
that I had a just an antigenic

00:47:48,259 --> 00:47:51,529
conversation when we're illustrating our

00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:55,189
technology to one of our product

00:47:51,529 --> 00:47:57,019
managers and and there is a there's a

00:47:55,189 --> 00:47:58,819
cup should preface this there's a

00:47:57,019 --> 00:48:01,459
company out there called songkick

00:47:58,819 --> 00:48:04,130
confused it it's you provide a social

00:48:01,459 --> 00:48:06,589
signal and it delivers concert alerts to

00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:08,749
you based on windows artists it looks at

00:48:06,589 --> 00:48:11,599
your facebook likes or your music plays

00:48:08,749 --> 00:48:14,539
and it's and it's a pure play around

00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:16,189
concert information and I basically

00:48:14,539 --> 00:48:19,309
without naming them I said we can do

00:48:16,189 --> 00:48:20,509
that with albums and merchandise and we

00:48:19,309 --> 00:48:22,640
could take the signal coming from

00:48:20,509 --> 00:48:24,380
facebook or this and the product manager

00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:25,279
because that's creepy and I said yeah

00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:27,999
that's creepy but what do you think

00:48:25,279 --> 00:48:32,509
about songkick and she said I love song

00:48:27,999 --> 00:48:35,329
so you know I do think it's personalized

00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:38,539
it is a service it does involve some

00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:40,329
intrusion and I think you are trying to

00:48:38,539 --> 00:48:42,890
you have to present it as a service and

00:48:40,329 --> 00:48:44,929
well we don't have all these probably

00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:47,209
not as much polling and resources as

00:48:44,929 --> 00:48:49,909
time every time we do end up a

00:48:47,209 --> 00:48:52,099
personalized target eat meal open rates

00:48:49,909 --> 00:48:54,890
go up and more importantly opt-out rates

00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:56,689
pretty much go to zero nobody feels like

00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:58,880
that message is not relevant to them or

00:48:56,689 --> 00:49:00,769
stop telling me about this I can tell

00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:02,269
you the anonymous emails where you're on

00:49:00,769 --> 00:49:05,630
a mailing list and we tell you about 20

00:49:02,269 --> 00:49:07,400
things and it is just got big opt-out

00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:11,329
right stop telling me to be about some

00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:12,769
kind of care about so I think and I

00:49:11,329 --> 00:49:15,079
think things are people are maturing to

00:49:12,769 --> 00:49:16,400
where they expect personalization so and

00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:17,809
people are maturing to the where they

00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,779
are in creepy about the other

00:49:17,809 --> 00:49:23,329
and slack here I'm sure hop from here

00:49:20,779 --> 00:49:25,369
uses slack and somebody decided to stay

00:49:23,329 --> 00:49:28,160
on every slack channel the same post

00:49:25,369 --> 00:49:30,140
chose like seriously that mean that that

00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:33,829
was not useful or personalized or

00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:35,029
thoughtful for me as a slack user and we

00:49:33,829 --> 00:49:41,689
all sort of had those antibodies

00:49:35,029 --> 00:49:44,869
developed at this point so my question

00:49:41,689 --> 00:49:47,329
was around tools and also make versus

00:49:44,869 --> 00:49:49,369
buying so which tools did you folks

00:49:47,329 --> 00:49:52,609
evaluate when you were thinking about

00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:54,859
personalization and and what was the

00:49:52,609 --> 00:50:00,650
process and what did you venture

00:49:54,859 --> 00:50:01,999
eventually end up selecting so so we got

00:50:00,650 --> 00:50:04,400
quite excited about personalization and

00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:05,779
a/b testing when we started the digital

00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,579
platform information that was tells

00:50:05,779 --> 00:50:09,289
three years ago so we were we were into

00:50:07,579 --> 00:50:11,449
it was one of the things on the list of

00:50:09,289 --> 00:50:13,519
people might be interested in this and

00:50:11,449 --> 00:50:15,380
we tried to we tried a couple of tests

00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:18,140
with one consumer brand in the US where

00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:19,699
we we took a multivariate a be

00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:21,799
multivariate testing tool and then try

00:50:19,699 --> 00:50:22,849
to implemented with this brand and it

00:50:21,799 --> 00:50:24,769
will separate from the content

00:50:22,849 --> 00:50:26,869
management system so it's the same I was

00:50:24,769 --> 00:50:29,089
I was going down the path of give these

00:50:26,869 --> 00:50:30,619
guys access to control their content at

00:50:29,089 --> 00:50:33,979
the same time as I try and personalize

00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:35,900
it in the separate tool and creating and

00:50:33,979 --> 00:50:37,759
publishing content is not easy it's it

00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:40,640
just isn't creating publishing regulated

00:50:37,759 --> 00:50:41,900
content is hard as well and when you

00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,249
have your content than something

00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:46,089
distributed across many different

00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:49,130
systems it becomes impossible it's just

00:50:46,089 --> 00:50:50,719
it's so so hard to do so we did this

00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,339
experiment and it kind of worked as in

00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:54,259
like the result from the AP test bullet

00:50:52,339 --> 00:50:55,699
would look good but it was so hard to

00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:58,189
achieve it that we kind of put that back

00:50:55,699 --> 00:50:59,569
on back on on the shelf and it wasn't

00:50:58,189 --> 00:51:01,429
until much later on when we working with

00:50:59,569 --> 00:51:02,869
a queer and then there's lots of

00:51:01,429 --> 00:51:04,429
conversation about like an app where you

00:51:02,869 --> 00:51:06,799
call that like a shadow CMS we got

00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:07,910
content here and content there and when

00:51:06,799 --> 00:51:10,849
we when we learn and have discussions

00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:12,289
about the fact that the content the

00:51:10,849 --> 00:51:13,930
content creation workflow can be the

00:51:12,289 --> 00:51:15,640
very same workflow the world

00:51:13,930 --> 00:51:17,589
teams two with with moving to this

00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:19,480
battle in the first place it was like a

00:51:17,589 --> 00:51:20,829
kid it's time now we can actually do

00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,980
this and this is this is going to be

00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:24,910
possible so we've been kind of

00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:28,300
partnering with a queer on that journey

00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:30,040
with lift as that tools become available

00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:32,819
then implementing it within that same

00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,819
same workflow

00:51:38,789 --> 00:51:43,709
especially in the pharma environment

00:51:40,859 --> 00:51:45,660
with the websites you guys are so highly

00:51:43,709 --> 00:51:50,130
regulated with what you can say in what

00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:53,459
you can't say how are you getting past

00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:54,749
that to do personalization because from

00:51:53,459 --> 00:51:57,119
my experience you got to go through a

00:51:54,749 --> 00:51:58,739
two-week regulatory review before

00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:01,529
anything's good change on your websites

00:51:58,739 --> 00:52:05,999
so and then how do you get that

00:52:01,529 --> 00:52:07,949
submitted past that area if our if our

00:52:05,999 --> 00:52:10,279
regulatory processes were two weeks I

00:52:07,949 --> 00:52:13,349
think would be very very happy with that

00:52:10,279 --> 00:52:15,299
they could be many many months at that

00:52:13,349 --> 00:52:17,160
times and it's it's it's a key question

00:52:15,299 --> 00:52:18,179
to our success here and what I would say

00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:20,369
is when we're implementing this

00:52:18,179 --> 00:52:22,049
technology it's not just about picking a

00:52:20,369 --> 00:52:23,160
technology and then putting in place

00:52:22,049 --> 00:52:25,619
you've got to look at the entire picture

00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:27,809
of what needs to happen in order for a

00:52:25,619 --> 00:52:29,880
user to use it and I so so creating and

00:52:27,809 --> 00:52:31,199
publishing content is hard creating and

00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,509
publishing content and a regulated

00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:36,869
industry who said he is very very hard

00:52:33,509 --> 00:52:38,759
and it was it was I see this the same

00:52:36,869 --> 00:52:39,869
challenge as we had when we went down

00:52:38,759 --> 00:52:41,759
the path of responsive web design

00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:43,829
because everybody was expecting a

00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:45,359
website looked like this and that was

00:52:43,829 --> 00:52:46,619
approved and that was fine and then

00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:48,150
suddenly you think you look across

00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:50,519
different devices and looks very

00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:53,069
different and that was difficult for us

00:52:50,519 --> 00:52:55,109
to get our legal team to understand and

00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:56,819
figure out that the way you can't change

00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:58,859
this the website is going to look

00:52:56,819 --> 00:53:00,119
different on different devices and get

00:52:58,859 --> 00:53:02,219
tooling in place to be able to support

00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:04,049
the approval knowing that some very

00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:05,549
important things like this text is no

00:53:04,049 --> 00:53:07,859
longer right next to this text it's

00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:09,269
below it make sure we're all comfortable

00:53:07,859 --> 00:53:10,679
with exactly what's happening there and

00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:13,679
that required some falling to make that

00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:15,719
to make that work we're doing the same

00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:18,329
thing with with personalization so we're

00:53:15,719 --> 00:53:19,439
investing in some talling to get ahead

00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:21,089
of this because it's going to be

00:53:19,439 --> 00:53:22,619
critical we can't say hey this is your

00:53:21,089 --> 00:53:24,209
tool go create five different versions

00:53:22,619 --> 00:53:25,829
of this content we're going to mash it

00:53:24,209 --> 00:53:28,589
up and expect that to be a responsible

00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:29,849
thing to do there's there's a lot of

00:53:28,589 --> 00:53:31,349
work behind making that happen and

00:53:29,849 --> 00:53:34,009
that's part of our whole personalization

00:53:31,349 --> 00:53:34,009
journey

00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:37,690
word is this is actually back to the

00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:40,270
kind of that I heard the kind of bill

00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:41,680
versus the build versus by discussion

00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:45,070
earlier on this is something what we're

00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:48,310
building for ourselves as it's it's a

00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:51,370
very hard problem to solve making some

00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:52,900
some positive progress that I'd like I

00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:55,930
said I bet spent some time with your

00:53:52,900 --> 00:54:00,070
team last night and I would be amazing

00:53:55,930 --> 00:54:01,780
to me the chapstick or I no other Pfizer

00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:05,560
products have so much in common with

00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:07,300
Lady Gaga and Eminem and your scrutiny

00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:08,680
even forget the regulation you have

00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:10,690
strong brand manage they're not

00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:13,510
protecting the brand yep and they're

00:54:10,690 --> 00:54:15,910
used to approving this is it not these

00:54:13,510 --> 00:54:17,610
variations are and when I demo these

00:54:15,910 --> 00:54:19,570
capabilities with lift and

00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:22,390
personalization my product managers

00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:25,750
again we're emissaries we are one part

00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:28,150
of the ecosystem so I we've managed lady

00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:31,030
gaga an fnm but there's a manager and so

00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:33,190
like okay I've got to go to the manager

00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:35,380
and get them to approve this and so

00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:38,230
we're all looking at this workflow is

00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:40,810
being a challenge but I do think that's

00:54:38,230 --> 00:54:43,030
where we are today you go a year out

00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:44,920
it's like I'm going to hear why don't we

00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:46,930
have this now what can we do but you

00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:48,730
know we're just everybody's getting

00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:51,490
expected it and the forward leaning

00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:53,650
managers know this they know that

00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:56,080
there's testing and targeting through

00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:59,080
all other parts of the ecosystem on

00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:00,790
Facebook Twitter commerce so they know

00:54:59,080 --> 00:55:01,960
that they get it when I before I haven't

00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:03,820
even finish the sentence we're going to

00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:05,140
do this but there are other people are

00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:07,150
saying I don't want two different

00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:09,850
pictures and we have the same issue with

00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:12,160
responsible yep yeah and you can't you

00:55:09,850 --> 00:55:14,320
can't ignore these things I so so with

00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:16,120
the true story on responsive is when we

00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:18,520
swim we first moved to Drupal we

00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,690
installed the Drupal on one site the

00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:22,180
very beginning we had to install the

00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:23,470
drupal module mobile tools and people

00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:25,870
might remember the sister this is a

00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:28,030
module any happy MDOT websites it would

00:55:25,870 --> 00:55:30,100
sit see would redirect you if you were

00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:31,780
on a mobile device and we use this

00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:33,370
module to redirect people on a mobile

00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:35,230
device to a patient said please don't

00:55:33,370 --> 00:55:36,310
access the store you can't access this

00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:38,740
page on a mobile device

00:55:36,310 --> 00:55:40,360
because the lawyers weren't comfortable

00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:41,920
with with Howard the content was placed

00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:43,750
and it was for some for some sensible

00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:46,960
reasons it's a kind of response but just

00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:47,920
that the response I did right you had

00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:49,600
the spectrum what we're talking about

00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:51,400
here at giving the user a great customer

00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,630
experience I didn't think that people

00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,980
probably don't think you could get that

00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:55,780
far down the other end of the scale of

00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:58,180
what we're doing to our users in that

00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:59,500
case so that's where we had two equals

00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:00,610
it was great for us coming to

00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:03,670
personalization go through that

00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:05,260
experience of we don't get to say no to

00:56:03,670 --> 00:56:06,910
this we don't we don't get to switch

00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:08,290
this off for the internet we've got to

00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:09,790
make this work so we had to solve the

00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:12,850
problem it was hard problem to solve and

00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:13,390
we solved it and it didn't it meant that

00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:15,280
when we were talking about

00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:18,040
personalization this was top of mind of

00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,900
how we're going to deal with this and we

00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:21,100
look what kind of doing this journey at

00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,870
the same time that you can't put

00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:25,570
personalization and I think this is it's

00:56:22,870 --> 00:56:27,220
I don't know across other industries but

00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:28,660
a regulated industry is very very

00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:30,880
difficult so that's why we've had to

00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:32,770
kind of in parallel with saying okay

00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,300
it's much easier now with the

00:56:32,770 --> 00:56:36,430
personalization told him being part of

00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:38,110
the CMS to implement that we've been ok

00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:39,700
let's go solve this other hard problem

00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:42,730
which may we have to solve for ourselves

00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:44,080
is we haven't seen like the market

00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:46,450
responded with some solutions to those

00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:48,730
kind of things yeah I think this is the

00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:50,980
most of you guys and Pfizer solved a lot

00:56:48,730 --> 00:56:53,170
of very interesting problems but it's

00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:54,850
this workflow problem of how do you get

00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:57,760
all those individual constituents and

00:56:54,850 --> 00:57:00,619
every single brand to go along

00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:02,150
yeah i think the the trick there is and

00:57:00,619 --> 00:57:06,380
the trick without with the platform has

00:57:02,150 --> 00:57:08,809
been it's i like to say it's been 100%

00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:11,329
carrot 0% stick right so we didn't get

00:57:08,809 --> 00:57:12,559
we didn't say okay fires i have 60

00:57:11,329 --> 00:57:14,930
content management systems there's this

00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:16,670
like call to say it makes sense for us

00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:17,900
to consolidate this you must do this

00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:19,250
that wouldn't have worked right would

00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,150
convince ourselves it was the right

00:57:19,250 --> 00:57:22,640
thing to do but it wouldn't have worked

00:57:20,150 --> 00:57:24,410
so our success has been based on the

00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:26,059
fact that the brand teams want to come

00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:27,950
and work with us so you have to be very

00:57:26,059 --> 00:57:29,359
focused or not checking a box and saying

00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:30,680
hey you've got personalization now but

00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:32,390
give it to them in a way that actually

00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:34,430
works which means you need to consider

00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:35,869
the entire the entire process and

00:57:34,430 --> 00:57:37,190
there's sometimes there's gaps in that

00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:42,980
process that you've got to go and

00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:45,020
innovate to plug all right we're almost

00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:46,849
at the end of the allotted time here so

00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:48,800
i just wanted to pass to see if anyone

00:57:46,849 --> 00:57:52,609
else has the additional final thoughts

00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:55,780
or questions otherwise i guess we can we

00:57:52,609 --> 00:57:55,780
can wrap up yeah

00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:07,990
cookie stuff I mean sorry you can't do

00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:11,200
the we were talking about the type of

00:58:07,990 --> 00:58:12,910
cross property things you need a third

00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:14,470
party party cookie to make that work and

00:58:12,910 --> 00:58:15,670
in Europe most countries you have to

00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:17,859
have an opt-in to have third-party

00:58:15,670 --> 00:58:19,210
cookie which means users don't opt in

00:58:17,859 --> 00:58:20,590
they don't say yes which means unless

00:58:19,210 --> 00:58:21,990
you click set things up properly you've

00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:24,670
got nothing right you've got no

00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:27,099
statistics on the user and I think it's

00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:28,210
good to kind of have that in Europe and

00:58:27,099 --> 00:58:29,950
kind of if you're building a global

00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:31,630
platform to be mindful of what what

00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:33,790
isn't isn't creepy for the other markets

00:58:31,630 --> 00:58:35,050
as well there's a good reason why people

00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:36,310
are saying like don't be doing this

00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:39,070
because the users have no idea that

00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:40,660
you're doing that it's good to make sure

00:58:39,070 --> 00:58:42,880
that you can be responsible in the other

00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:45,190
boxes and we've just started looking at

00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:47,140
that we're very respectful of it it's

00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:48,880
very thoughtful and something that we're

00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:50,410
now working into our roadmap team the

00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:51,880
whirling in that crawl stage because

00:58:50,410 --> 00:59:01,590
it's something we have to be responsive

00:58:51,880 --> 00:59:05,170
to mostly worried about the u.s. I will

00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:06,670
Mike what's funny to me anecdotally as

00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:08,440
I've had these tough conversations with

00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:10,990
Germany which one of the most strict

00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:12,580
about what we can do and then I go to

00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:14,109
their properties and I see Facebook

00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:17,050
widgets and Twitter widgets that follow

00:59:14,109 --> 00:59:19,619
would like and so I I just I'm sometimes

00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:22,119
frustrated that that person you know

00:59:19,619 --> 00:59:25,660
they're delivering data to Facebook and

00:59:22,119 --> 00:59:26,680
Twitter and not to the company of the

00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:28,810
Prophet they're trying to market with

00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:31,470
but that's I understand the reality

00:59:28,810 --> 00:59:31,470
there it's just

00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:37,849
