Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Drupal at Sea with Princess Cruises
Publication date: 2015-05-13
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	First launched with our ship, Royal Princess, in 2013. Princess@Sea is an industry first, passenger facing digital experience platform for Princess Cruises built on Drupal. It fundamentally changes the way passengers access information onboard our ships. Connected to every passenger facing screen onboard. It serves as the default page on the vesselâ€™s wifi allowing passengers to access the ships' schedule of events, stateroom account, itinerary, deck plans for the vessel, instant messaging, and personalized cruise planner. It has become the informational hub for passengers on board.

This project wouldn't have been possible without the foundation that Drupal and the Drupal community has provided.  In this session we will outline the process we use to create an implement Princess@Sea as well as unique challenges in setting up a platform that takes Drupal on a journey to exotic and remote locations around the world.
