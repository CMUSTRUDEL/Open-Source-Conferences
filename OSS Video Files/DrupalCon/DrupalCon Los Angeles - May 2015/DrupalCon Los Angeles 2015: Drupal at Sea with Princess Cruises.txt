Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Drupal at Sea with Princess Cruises
Publication date: 2015-05-13
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	First launched with our ship, Royal Princess, in 2013. Princess@Sea is an industry first, passenger facing digital experience platform for Princess Cruises built on Drupal. It fundamentally changes the way passengers access information onboard our ships. Connected to every passenger facing screen onboard. It serves as the default page on the vesselâ€™s wifi allowing passengers to access the ships' schedule of events, stateroom account, itinerary, deck plans for the vessel, instant messaging, and personalized cruise planner. It has become the informational hub for passengers on board.

This project wouldn't have been possible without the foundation that Drupal and the Drupal community has provided.  In this session we will outline the process we use to create an implement Princess@Sea as well as unique challenges in setting up a platform that takes Drupal on a journey to exotic and remote locations around the world.

we'll kind of stretch out the intro a

00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:07,470
little bit to give people time to sit

00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:12,660
down both thought we might as well get

00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:14,360
started here we're from Princess Cruises

00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:17,310
we're gonna do a little talk here about

00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:20,520
Drupal at see how we're using Drupal on

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:25,859
board our ships which is kind of a cool

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:30,510
interesting weird use case for Drupal so

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:32,489
this is a subu and I am Nate and we're

00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:36,530
to the project leads for princess etsy

00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:41,160
which is our guest facing experience app

00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:42,420
on board the ships our twitter handles

00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,980
are down there at the bottoms of feel

00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,289
free to add us we love talking to people

00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:49,649
and sharing you know helpful tips we've

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:52,379
had and so on so a little bit of history

00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,300
about princess kind of put in context

00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,170
what the environment we're working on

00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:01,520
this is our 50th anniversary this year

00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:04,890
we were founded in nineteen sixty-five

00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:10,080
we have 18 cruise ships operating around

00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:14,939
the world and we carry over 1.7 million

00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:20,270
guests each year so a lot of people

00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:22,740
actually will know us as the low boat

00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:26,130
Cebu always gets upset when I do that so

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,900
I always do it he has to do it uh it was

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:32,299
you know pretty popular show that ran

00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:34,530
from 1970 seventh and 1987 we actually

00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:37,229
incorporated that into our 50th

00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,790
anniversary celebration this year had

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:41,700
actually a lot of the cast come out and

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:46,350
do the christening and naming ceremony

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,670
of regal princess our newest ship so to

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,310
kind of give you a little idea of what

00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,680
these ships are like and the kind of

00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:56,159
size of the infrastructure that we work

00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:59,540
with royal princess was the first ship

00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:03,240
we deployed our application on in 2013

00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:07,110
it itself took three million man-hours

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,899
to construct it's made of 37 thousand

00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:13,280
tons of steel

00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:16,610
it has almost 2,500 miles of electrical

00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,349
cable running throughout the ship to

00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,930
paint at that wonderful white color

00:02:18,349 --> 00:02:26,780
takes ninety-five thousand gallons of

00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:28,299
paint and it has a 14-ton anchor and to

00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:32,840
give you a little idea of the scale of

00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:37,430
the brand in total every month at

00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:42,409
princess we serve 14 million slices of

00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:45,889
pizza on board the ships million and a

00:02:42,409 --> 00:02:48,109
half gallons of soda pop 1 million

00:02:45,889 --> 00:02:51,230
cookies which I've definitely added to

00:02:48,109 --> 00:02:53,209
that number and this is kind of a

00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,970
frightening one out of them 1 million

00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:58,430
cookies only 120 thousand bananas

00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,629
reserved to so you can see where

00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:05,000
people's priorities are with their

00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:08,480
onboard and enough ice cream to fill an

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,810
olympic-sized pool which is kind of a

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,220
lot when you think about it so what are

00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,540
we doing with Drupal so I'm going to

00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:17,629
show a little video here this is

00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,489
actually made by Acquia with us to kind

00:03:17,629 --> 00:03:22,220
of promote what we were doing on board

00:03:19,489 --> 00:03:24,829
the ship and how we're using Drupal

00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:27,310
overall so two minute long is a good

00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,310
introduction

00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:34,739
a princess we pride ourselves will be in

00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:36,719
the destination experts we strive for

00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:39,060
creating a meaningful passenger

00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:41,370
experience the company has been in

00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,640
business for for many years in fact in

00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:47,609
2015 it will be our 50th anniversary we

00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,799
have a fleet of 18 ships delivering an

00:03:47,609 --> 00:03:52,290
incredible product to our passengers

00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,959
every single day our ships are getting

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,090
bigger and more complex princesses seem

00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,709
really has kind of fundamentally changed

00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,209
the way the passenger can find

00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:01,739
information on the ship when they get on

00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:03,090
board and they're looking at this

00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,220
application it is to show them

00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:06,780
everything from events to itineraries I

00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,389
mean constancy is the hub of everything

00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:12,810
they're doing on board the ability to

00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:15,900
have a reliable technology delivery

00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:18,239
platform for us is key in Drupal really

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,030
allowed us to do that using Drupal as

00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:22,919
base we've been able to basically deploy

00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:24,990
the app and then we can continue

00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,630
building on that for the future whenever

00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:29,970
there was a new idea of being floated

00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:33,270
out by the team there was a lostalready

00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:36,000
the answer packaged somewhere within the

00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:39,000
community I believe we wouldn't be able

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,159
to do this without the support of Drupal

00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,380
community every passenger facing screen

00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:45,150
on the ship is connected to presidency

00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,620
and therefore can pull and you can want

00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,120
to create a customized experience so

00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,010
when you get on board the ship and you

00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,389
open our application you know you're not

00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:53,310
seeing the same thing as everybody else

00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:55,169
if you're a foodie you're seeing events

00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,820
that are more specific to the kind of

00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,680
your interests and that way it creates a

00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,110
unique experience for every cruise

00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,870
passenger open source definitely gave us

00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:06,120
the opportunity to move a lot faster on

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:07,590
our project we can roll out any ship

00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,760
within a month's time which is really

00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,070
great one of the things that really

00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,639
excites me about this project is that we

00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,439
have a real opportunity to

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,590
you improve the passenger experience

00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:19,870
overall from the moment they book to

00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,180
after they get off the ship and have

00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:32,110
that experience be a memorable one for

00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:33,460
the rest of their lives so there we go

00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:37,120
that's what we're doing with Drupal

00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:39,849
thank you very much no so the

00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,289
application it is Princeton see that's

00:05:39,849 --> 00:05:43,300
the name of it will go into a little bit

00:05:41,289 --> 00:05:45,819
more detail about it over the course of

00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:49,779
this presentation but we've deployed now

00:05:45,819 --> 00:05:51,340
on to 11 ships next week actually

00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:54,639
tomorrow Davis who's sitting right over

00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:58,180
there flies out to Hong Kong to install

00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:02,110
it on sun princess I think right son

00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:04,050
yeah so I'll be number 12 will be on the

00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,819
rest of the fleet by the end of the year

00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,169
and like we've kind of said already

00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:10,120
Drupal really powers our guest

00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:14,620
experience platform that we're building

00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:18,909
out on the ships so what is for instance

00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:21,189
II you know it's many things um it's a

00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:22,870
way for the passenger to experience the

00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:24,159
events on board and see the events and

00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:26,289
the schedule of events and all that

00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:29,139
stuff a way for the passenger to look at

00:06:26,289 --> 00:06:32,550
their bill at any time during the course

00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:35,589
of the voyage it is a multilingual

00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:37,240
experience for the passengers some of

00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:39,399
our friends from lingotek are here right

00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,370
now and they definitely have been a key

00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:43,839
part of making this happen for us we'll

00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:47,020
talk a little bit more detail about that

00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:49,810
later on but it's a key component for us

00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,889
and our newest thing which is actually

00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,779
something that would have been possible

00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:55,120
without this platform on board is

00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:59,770
messaging and allowing passenger to

00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:02,860
passenger messaging for free so before

00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:04,810
we get too far into the details of what

00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:07,899
princess he is every story has a

00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:09,580
backstory so we're going to look back a

00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:14,110
little bit and talk about how we got to

00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:18,189
where we are so we started with Drupal

00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:22,860
in 2007 Drupal 5 building a shipboard

00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:25,149
crew intranet it was a success because

00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,200
Drupal really was a platform that

00:07:25,149 --> 00:07:28,390
allowed our

00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:32,140
crew members to collaborate with each

00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:34,270
other ship the ship it can be kind of a

00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,400
solitary experience when you're on a

00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:38,140
ship your kind of cut off from the rest

00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,760
of the world and your channels of

00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,290
communication are actually very limited

00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,600
so they really like the fact that they

00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:46,530
could post things to their friends on

00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:50,500
different contracts on different ships

00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:52,960
based on that success we then rebuilt

00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:56,200
the entire corporate intranet which was

00:07:52,960 --> 00:08:05,860
both ship and shore side and merged it

00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:07,870
all into one for portholes it was really

00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,450
an extension of what we had done with

00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,800
cruise connections and taking all this

00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:14,170
stuff that we had in an old content

00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,440
management system shoreside and merging

00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:21,760
that into connections and based on those

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:26,410
successes in 2012 princess was getting

00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:28,510
ready to fund do the final steps in the

00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:31,570
build and roll out of our newest ship

00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:33,910
royal princes and they wanted to have an

00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:36,790
interactive guest experience platform on

00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:38,050
board so they send it to our team

00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:40,210
because we were able to build out these

00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:46,300
things with people very quickly and

00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:48,220
effectively so at the time we thought we

00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:51,460
were building kind of a responsive

00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:56,680
website that would allow the passenger

00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:59,440
to view their bill and their events in a

00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:03,430
mobile phone so we really thought we

00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,200
were just building a website but as we

00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:08,170
started looking at what princess of see

00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,270
actually was and started looking at all

00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:12,940
the different areas of contents the

00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:15,220
different business units the different

00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:18,760
content workflows and curation that we

00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:21,340
would have I added on to that looking at

00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,130
the different systems that Drupal on

00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:27,160
board would be tying into like video on

00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:30,820
demand or digital signage the printed

00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:32,080
newsletter all of these things we kind

00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,570
of started suspecting that we were

00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:38,260
building something more more than just a

00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:39,089
website and then something interesting

00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:41,620
happens

00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:43,389
we went to drupalcon Portland while

00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,100
we're in development was actually in a

00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:48,639
break between we were out at the

00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:51,910
shipyard looking at the ship and

00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:54,459
installing things on the ship and we saw

00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:57,610
two keynotes there one was drees keynote

00:09:54,459 --> 00:09:59,350
that year highly recommend going back

00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:02,199
and watching it it's really interesting

00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:06,759
looking at a two years later the key

00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:09,160
thing for us was really a defined what

00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:12,339
we were trying to achieve he talks a lot

00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:16,660
in that keynote about digital and being

00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:19,480
digital and Drupal being digital and the

00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:22,980
other keynote we saw that really changed

00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:25,360
our perspective was from Karen McGrane

00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:28,690
again highly recommend watching that

00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,250
it's awesome but really what we took a

00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,250
bit away from that was this whole idea

00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:34,569
of separating content from presentation

00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:38,139
doing cope that's what we were already

00:10:34,569 --> 00:10:40,690
starting down the path for that so we

00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:43,620
had kind of an aha moment and that was

00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:46,000
that we should have a slide full of cats

00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:49,240
but really we did have like an aha

00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,709
moment at this point we had a new

00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:55,839
perspective on what we're doing in

00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:58,540
building and that was that what we were

00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:01,870
building was really in the center of all

00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:04,420
of these different pieces of technology

00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:07,899
on board that we were touching the VOD

00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:10,720
system or kiosks the mobile phones

00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:13,959
tablets desktops the printed newsletter

00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,370
and all of that and that Drupal was

00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:18,010
going to be the center at the center of

00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:21,839
all this and maintaining content for all

00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:24,550
of this stuff so we realized something

00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:28,300
that we were actually doing was causing

00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:31,949
a digital transformation on board the

00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:34,689
ship and what is digital transformation

00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:37,120
that is I'm going to read this directly

00:11:34,689 --> 00:11:39,040
because it's a pretty good quote the

00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,230
process of shifting your organization

00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,709
from a legacy approach and that can be

00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:46,329
technology or just business processes to

00:11:44,709 --> 00:11:50,260
new ways of working and thinking about

00:11:46,329 --> 00:11:51,780
digital social media mobile and all

00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:54,430
these emerging technologies

00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:58,030
so it really breaks down to is kind of

00:11:54,430 --> 00:12:01,450
three key areas transforming operational

00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:04,920
processes transforming business models

00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:08,290
and transforming customer experiences

00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,780
and we really knew we were doing that

00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:13,780
already so we decided to really embrace

00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:17,100
that make it a core part of what we were

00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:20,530
doing so transport transformation of

00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:24,040
this nature is you know more than just a

00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:26,230
technology or a set of tools you know

00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,540
you have to start challenging some of

00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:30,160
your own assumptions and one of the

00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,710
assumptions that we had was you know

00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,330
what were we actually building and as a

00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,340
note we're going to show a lot of these

00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,590
kind of behind the scenes slides so I'll

00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,660
kind of say what they are this was

00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:44,140
actually regal princess being built in

00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:46,540
montville Coney Italy we was taken from

00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:49,950
royal princess as we were leaving the

00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:55,270
shipyard this is about a year out from

00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:56,770
its inaugural so when we talked about

00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:58,960
transforming our thinking and this is

00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:01,540
kind of why this slide works for us here

00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:03,880
is that you know we were building a

00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,860
platform and not just a product a

00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:10,720
project you know we were laying the

00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:12,580
foundation for that end user experience

00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,850
that was going to connect to all these

00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:20,200
different things and we were responsible

00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:22,450
for that end user experience so once

00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,980
you've done that you transform the idea

00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:29,140
of what you're building that has big

00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:31,990
ramifications and this shot here is from

00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:34,210
Ron royal princess during its voyage

00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:36,640
from the shipyard to Southampton for its

00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:39,160
naming ceremony and what you see here is

00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,080
basically as much of the crew that could

00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,930
be packed into the open decks as

00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,340
possible it's all sorts of people their

00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:50,020
senior staff members there's

00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:54,790
accommodations there's cooks and deck

00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:56,500
and all that kind of stuff so that's the

00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:58,360
next step we had to do is kind of

00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,250
transform our idea of what the team was

00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:03,850
you know we're building something that

00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:08,050
would benefit the passenger

00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:11,139
and would have that we would be involved

00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:16,480
in from into ends from concept to

00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:17,620
delivery and so when you look at this

00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,810
these are the people that are actually

00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,639
delivering the products to the passenger

00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:23,860
that are actually giving them the

00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:26,529
vacation experience and we were having

00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:29,199
to expand the scope of who we consider

00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:32,980
part of the project team or the platform

00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:35,139
team all the way from us working on

00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,730
these initial wireframes and coming up

00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:38,800
with ideas all the way to these people

00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:41,170
actually interacting with a passenger

00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,519
day-to-day and helping them use the

00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:44,589
application and getting feedback from

00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:49,389
them and really bringing them into the

00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:51,579
process oh and one more note on that

00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:53,170
slide before I move on but you know part

00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:55,660
of that is especially with Drupal is

00:14:53,170 --> 00:14:56,910
that these people are also the people

00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,149
that are going to make this product

00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:02,259
successful the project the platform

00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:04,000
successful in the end because they are

00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:06,699
the ones who are going to be maintaining

00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,850
the content on board and maintaining the

00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:12,759
ship site so without them being actively

00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:17,589
involved and engaged the project itself

00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:22,269
could fail so this slide here is the

00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:25,630
data center / broadcast center on regal

00:15:22,269 --> 00:15:26,920
princess they've got all the different

00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,990
satellite channels coming and they can

00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:31,089
monitor there's a whole other Bank of

00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:33,730
screens where they have monitoring for

00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:35,920
all the servers and all that stuff so

00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:38,290
when you're dealing with you know a

00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,029
large distributed team like this you

00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:41,500
also have to like think about how you're

00:15:40,029 --> 00:15:44,350
going to transform your communication

00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,000
strategy you know figure out ways you're

00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:50,290
going to be agile with the distributed

00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,569
team and we do that you'll we sat in a

00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:54,069
couple presentations yesterday if you

00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:55,990
see the same kind of tools everywhere

00:15:54,069 --> 00:15:59,290
you know JIRA confluence for

00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:01,870
documentation slack or HipChat for

00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:03,670
instant communication and other tools

00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,709
slack works awesome for us we were doing

00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:09,160
deployments we can have a constant

00:16:05,709 --> 00:16:10,449
stream of what's going on on board when

00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,189
we're dealing with our offshore teams

00:16:10,449 --> 00:16:14,920
are working with people in other

00:16:12,189 --> 00:16:16,060
locations screen sharing GoToMeeting

00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:22,480
WebEx whatever

00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:24,040
very critical okay so this one is

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,040
unfortunately he had to go home early

00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:30,520
but this is a guy from our team Jerry

00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:32,650
he's on royal princes here during the

00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,660
last one percent of a deployment for

00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:36,910
something he's actually testing card

00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,950
swipes and he's in a hard hat because

00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:41,230
this is actually a construction zone at

00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:43,150
this point there's a people welding

00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:46,720
stuff painting stuff sanding stuff all

00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:48,970
that on the ship at this point and we

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,440
like this slide a lot because you know

00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:52,000
the idea here is that you're

00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,700
transforming how you execute on the

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,070
product or the project mode and deliver

00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,300
features and this is definitely

00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:59,500
something you wouldn't expect to be

00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:02,280
doing if you're just building software

00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:06,190
you know he's physically out on the ship

00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:08,770
testing the equipment this is where

00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:12,430
really like Drupal really starts coming

00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:14,800
into play for us we're able to build

00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:17,620
stuff out very quickly early on show it

00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,180
to our business very quickly get there

00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,040
ok on it and then take it from a

00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:22,570
proof-of-concept all the way to the

00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,750
final feature that's going to be

00:17:22,570 --> 00:17:29,680
delivered messaging was one of those

00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:32,530
that started out that way it was a test

00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:35,550
of some modules ratings and reviews is

00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:35,550
kind of coming up that way to

00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:40,540
AppDynamics we're using that to monitor

00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,010
and see the performance of our servers

00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:46,050
see where we may be having issues

00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:50,910
automatically correct stuff stashed for

00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:53,370
code-sharing be hat for feature testing

00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:57,480
and of course we're moving into

00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:57,480
angularjs right now as well

00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:06,890
so this photo here is regal princess off

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:10,309
the coast of Italy somewhere probably in

00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:11,660
a tender ports so we'll come back to

00:18:10,309 --> 00:18:15,710
this in a moment but look at the scale

00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:18,289
here what you see over on the left-hand

00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:21,200
side is a tender boat actually coming up

00:18:18,289 --> 00:18:24,380
to dock with the ship and exchange

00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:26,750
passengers in and passengers out so if

00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,700
you think about this right here is a

00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,990
gigantic ship it's too big to even fit

00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:32,330
on screen you have this tiny little

00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:34,789
tender poor boat coming up and that's

00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:36,830
the conduit of people getting in an on

00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:41,870
and off the ship when we're anchored

00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:44,539
like this so you know transforming the

00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:45,530
way you deliver and in this case we like

00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:48,140
this because it talks about the

00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:50,450
constraints that we have this image that

00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:51,799
we have a ship out at sea and we have to

00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:55,429
figure out how to that we can be

00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:58,850
flexible fast execute things

00:18:55,429 --> 00:19:03,020
consistently we use tools like saltstack

00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:06,710
for configuration management of course

00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:08,150
Drupal is a key part here we basically

00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:10,039
make the assumption that we're not going

00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:12,620
to be able to physically do anything

00:19:10,039 --> 00:19:13,850
human cannot interact with the server on

00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:16,130
board the ship it all has to be

00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:21,530
automated so we leverage things like

00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:23,419
features and migrates drush heavily for

00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:27,740
making backups and being able to recover

00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:30,230
if a deploy goes wrong we're actively

00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:33,580
looking at docker right now to more

00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:37,030
standardized our environment on board

00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:39,710
and make it more flexible than it is now

00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:41,120
like I said before we used rush heavily

00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:44,750
let's throughout our entire deployment

00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:47,780
pipeline there's a lot of really cool

00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:50,530
features we also use it as a means of

00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:55,309
feature flagging to so that we can build

00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:58,010
new features in modules have them on in

00:19:55,309 --> 00:20:00,440
certain environments and often others so

00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,850
when we're ready to activate a brand new

00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,100
feature on board the ship we can just

00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:05,840
include that as part of our deploy and

00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:08,360
brush handles the actual

00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,720
activation of that thing for us it's

00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,520
really pretty cool Jenkins actually you

00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,919
know of course manages all the actual

00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:18,860
orchestration pieces there and we

00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,860
heavily use vagrant on our local local

00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:23,900
boxes one thing to note here is we

00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,809
actually run jenkins and salt stack on

00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:30,140
board the ship just because in case some

00:20:26,809 --> 00:20:31,850
of the deployment fails we have Auto

00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:34,880
roll back to the previous known became

00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:37,190
known good version because we probably

00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:39,320
may not even able to connect to the ship

00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:41,899
and then debug so it has to auto

00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:43,970
rollback and self heal so that's that's

00:20:41,899 --> 00:20:46,399
one point to note here yeah that's a

00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:47,929
real critical point too because I will

00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:49,880
go into it in a second actually it's a

00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:51,470
really good time to bring this up

00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,200
because that's actually one of our

00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:55,610
biggest constraints and this photo is a

00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,720
nice lead-in because our biggest

00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:02,750
constraint really is that we have you

00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,490
know a sure sign master repository of

00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:07,880
all corporate approved content and

00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:10,750
Drupal and then we have all these 18

00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:14,690
other Drupal instances running out there

00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:16,039
and the thing that constrains actually

00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:20,090
our communication there is a satellite

00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:23,179
connectivity much like the tender boats

00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:26,210
and the dock there on the being able to

00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:27,950
dock onto the ship is a limiting factor

00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:30,169
on how many people you can get on and

00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,330
off the ship at once the satellite is

00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:34,730
really a limiting factor and how much

00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,679
data we can send back and forth and it's

00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:39,679
also not something we can always count

00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:41,690
on being there so if we start a

00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,539
deployment the satellite goes down we

00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:47,419
have to have contingency plans to handle

00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:49,610
that automatically for us especially if

00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:51,950
the code got out there fine Jenkins

00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:54,409
starts this process the satellite goes

00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:59,120
down it's got to be able to not kill the

00:21:54,409 --> 00:22:00,860
entire system if something goes awry so

00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:03,169
this photo here this is what they call

00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,690
the bulbous on top of the ship it's what

00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:07,610
covers all the radio the satellite

00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:08,450
equipment the radio equipment all that

00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:11,950
stuff there's actually multiple

00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:14,179
abilities they have different purposes

00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:17,230
for different they carry different kinds

00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:17,230
of equipment packages

00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,889
but that's where we got had to kind of

00:22:18,909 --> 00:22:22,870
go to is what is the content lifecycle

00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:26,200
look like when we have a short sight

00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:30,610
master kind of controlling the majority

00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:33,340
of the content we have these individual

00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:35,380
ship based sites out there that are

00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:37,630
handling their own publishing but have

00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:38,769
to rely on this one and changes that

00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:44,519
happen on there that we want to bring

00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:50,259
back and then reincorporate into the the

00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:52,059
master shoreside system it's it's a

00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:53,830
really tricky thing it's kind of

00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:57,250
something that's probably way too big to

00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:58,990
go into in this presentation but come by

00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,279
we have a booth so swing by we'd love to

00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:04,509
talk about if you have any questions

00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:07,679
about that because it is pretty cool I

00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:07,679
think what we've been able to do there

00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:14,350
and this is kind of where that Karen

00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:16,269
McGrane key not really hit us in and the

00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:18,490
way the content is really structured is

00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:22,480
that we are actively supporting multiple

00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:24,429
different endpoints with this system so

00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,399
it has to be reusable content as

00:23:24,429 --> 00:23:28,990
reusable everywhere the ship actually

00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:31,299
has really embraced the ships of really

00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:34,210
embrace this because when you talk about

00:23:31,299 --> 00:23:36,429
what events titles descriptions images

00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:39,340
all look like so tremendous amount of

00:23:36,429 --> 00:23:41,580
work for a ship to manage this library

00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:44,740
of potentially thousands of unique

00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:47,889
titles descriptions all that stuff for

00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:49,840
the event listing and we've been able to

00:23:47,889 --> 00:23:54,159
now leverage all the ships together to

00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:56,860
create this like community maintained

00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,110
and curated library of events so they

00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:02,139
all can add once to it it may not make

00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:04,690
its way back into the master one but it

00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:06,399
has a workflow where it comes back

00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,870
shoreside they can review it edit it

00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:11,100
update the one on the ship and then

00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:14,409
redeploy it out all the other ships so

00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:16,570
ultimately reusable and that content

00:24:14,409 --> 00:24:20,379
type I mean that taxonomy type actually

00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:24,519
has multiple other use of cases for two

00:24:20,379 --> 00:24:26,019
so there's a field for the newsletter

00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:29,840
version of that event description

00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:34,520
there's image upload areas for

00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:38,210
signage and for use on princessy so we

00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:41,179
can reuse that one image earth at one

00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:46,640
scheduled events to publish out to all

00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:48,950
of these different endpoints and this is

00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:52,210
like I said a key one will show some

00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:54,679
examples of this in a moment but

00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:58,490
multilanguage is a is one thing we

00:24:54,679 --> 00:25:01,940
always have to keep in mind it's if you

00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:04,130
haven't done multiple languages yet be

00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:07,570
prepared to underestimate the amount of

00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:11,299
effort that it's going to take to to do

00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:12,919
it's a very challenging topic very

00:25:11,299 --> 00:25:16,130
challenging subject very challenging

00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:17,330
weight thing to do right I don't think

00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:21,370
we've done a totally right but I think

00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:21,370
we've done it ninety-five percent right

00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:29,419
it is key for us we were you know we're

00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:31,940
a international brand we're in China now

00:25:29,419 --> 00:25:34,070
we sail through Europe throughout the

00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:37,190
summer so there's which used to be a

00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:39,110
heavily heavily booked by North

00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:40,940
Americans now it's getting more heavily

00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:44,320
skewed towards Europeans actually

00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:48,230
booking so we have to be able to support

00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:50,240
and through our system all these

00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:51,890
different languages and this is a key

00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:55,399
thing to we'll talk about in a second

00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:56,870
when I show it that that has made a big

00:25:55,399 --> 00:26:02,299
difference that we couldn't have done

00:25:56,870 --> 00:26:05,529
without a digital platform like this so

00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:08,299
a couple of key things we use here

00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:09,919
lingotek like I said I can't talk enough

00:26:08,299 --> 00:26:11,230
about how you know awesome of the

00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,659
relationship has been with lingotek

00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:17,029
there a key partner for us we're looking

00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:19,309
at further bulletproofing our content

00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:22,880
life cycle with message queues like

00:26:19,309 --> 00:26:25,270
RabbitMQ or something along that way and

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:28,100
we heavily use heavily heavily use

00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:31,789
Drupal de Drupal kind of migration using

00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:35,539
migrate and services that's something we

00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:37,720
couldn't do this project without so we

00:26:35,539 --> 00:26:40,159
spent kind of a long time talking about

00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,630
you know digital transformation from

00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,740
operational and

00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:47,800
this side so now let's talk about the

00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:51,020
actual fun stuff to look at which is

00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:52,280
transforming the customer experience so

00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:54,380
this was kind of the first version of

00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:59,980
presidency that deployed on royal

00:26:54,380 --> 00:27:04,910
princess what Princeton see really does

00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:07,940
overall is transform the way passengers

00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:09,890
interacts with the ship you know

00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:12,890
experience their vacation and

00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:14,720
communicate with each other I'll show

00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:18,980
kind of some little bits and pieces of

00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:22,490
that right now so this year is actually

00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:24,380
regal princess i think the front desk

00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:26,480
area was as it was finalizing

00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:28,970
construction now before Prince let's see

00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,270
the passenger wanted to view their bill

00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:35,600
they'd have to go to the front desk wait

00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:37,760
in the line get a paper printout or they

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:41,600
could go to a kiosk maybe wait in the

00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:44,000
line and get a paper printout or wait

00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:46,700
till the end of the voyage get a paper

00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:52,310
printout of their bill and those are

00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:54,200
kind of the three ways now they can

00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:59,990
pretty much view this at any time on

00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:02,780
their own device it's on demand they can

00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:05,600
go and look at it at any point it's up

00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:07,010
to date it basically i always go and buy

00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,870
a martini when we actually get it up and

00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:11,650
running so i can test to see if that the

00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:14,540
you know is actually billing any right

00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:19,550
that's just what I say to hide the fact

00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:21,290
that I like martinis this is where it

00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:24,080
gets kind of cool though likewise we've

00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:26,300
rolled this out like the staff on board

00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,730
we hear this from them anecdotally we've

00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:30,410
seen it a little bit but it's definitely

00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:34,070
decreased the lines of people waiting

00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:36,070
for this bill at the front desk it's a

00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:39,050
they actually have come up to us on

00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:43,400
asked and said you know this is great

00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:44,810
this lets us focus on really helping

00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,620
passengers who may be having a real

00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:51,630
problem not just wanting a print

00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:53,700
their bill and from an budget standpoint

00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:57,270
it's great too because now we have to

00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,770
print less junk out and don't have to

00:28:57,270 --> 00:29:00,480
spend as much money on paper and don't

00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:05,820
have to throw a whole bunch of paper

00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:07,470
away or incinerate it or whatever and

00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:10,230
one thing that this is also done is

00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:13,680
allow us to do kind of uniquely digital

00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:15,090
things like adding filter a filter on

00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:17,190
the top so they can actually look at the

00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:19,380
different kinds of things they're

00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:21,780
spending on so they can kind of manage

00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,980
how much they want to spend and we're at

00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:27,000
which different areas a little bit

00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:29,400
better and it's really designed to be no

00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,170
simpler to understand and look at and

00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,760
all that stuff even though it does have

00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:37,050
a dollar dollar sign tours and stuff

00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:39,090
like that on there that's the system

00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:44,760
that feeds us that's the problem we're

00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:46,830
working on right now actually okay so

00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,210
there's a few of the modules we used to

00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:51,830
make this happen at the bottom will have

00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:55,679
those on a few of these different slides

00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:57,240
so this photo here is from during royal

00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,070
princess inaugural it's actually the

00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,140
upper deck on board the ship we have

00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:03,150
kind of a I think they call it

00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:06,360
watercolor fantasy or something like

00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:08,910
that a one-note all these photos Cebu

00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,130
and I took dear so if you think they're

00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:17,370
cool let us know will feel good about

00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:18,990
ourselves so you know this is kind of

00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:21,420
some of the kinds of events that we have

00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:24,330
we have you know it's the ship is you

00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:27,360
know hotel it's a dining place it's a

00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:29,070
mall it's a bunch of entertainment so

00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,470
it's all self-contained so there's a ton

00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:34,140
of stuff to be doing on board all at all

00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:36,360
times you know before princessy really

00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:38,790
like the passenger had to look at a

00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:40,770
printed newsletter every day which is

00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:46,020
actually pretty dense with a lot of

00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:47,850
competing things ads venue hours the

00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:51,570
note from the captain and all this kind

00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:53,880
of stuff but after princessy they're

00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:55,740
actually able to do quite a few cool

00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:57,600
things beyond just looking at the events

00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,220
even though that's a key you know a key

00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,950
part of this is being will see

00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:04,289
these up-to-the-minute events sometimes

00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:05,610
event venues change like what happened

00:31:04,289 --> 00:31:07,860
actually this morning when they had to

00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:11,100
announce a whole bunch of time changes

00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:14,370
for different events that were happening

00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:16,590
here we can just go in and change the

00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:20,700
time and so on out here and it's updated

00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:22,470
immediately occasionally weather might

00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:25,200
be too bad we can't go into port so that

00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:28,350
means the entire day's events change

00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:31,830
like that before they would have to

00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:33,890
actually go print a whole new run of the

00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:38,309
princess patter which is our newsletter

00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:40,049
to let people know what the new events

00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:41,970
are going to be on board that day now

00:31:40,049 --> 00:31:48,000
they can just go and then do it

00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:50,070
immediately so we're able to show more

00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,960
detail than we could in the appended

00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:54,630
version of the newsletter we're able to

00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:56,460
show deck plans where the thing is let

00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:58,799
them slide around look get more detail

00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:00,270
about this stuff some of the other cool

00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,090
things we can do now that we have this

00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:06,360
kind of a form out there is we're able

00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:08,970
to now extend this concept of an event

00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:11,220
to passengers themselves so they're able

00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:14,010
to actually go in create events that

00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:17,130
only they or the people they invite can

00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:19,380
see so that also implies they can event

00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:20,970
shear these events more than implies

00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:23,520
that it actually allows them to do that

00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:26,010
they're able to create an event saying

00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:30,510
let's go meet for dinner at Sabatini's

00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:32,789
at 8pm share it to the people in their

00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:39,960
group and now they all have it in their

00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:43,380
personalized scheduled to go see and for

00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,179
us one of the things that is a benefit

00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:47,309
both to the passenger and princess is

00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:50,130
that the passenger can flag events that

00:32:47,309 --> 00:32:52,380
they intend to go see create their kind

00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:54,360
of own personalized schedule and then

00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:58,110
what we get as a company which is

00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:00,299
awesome is now we can see how what is

00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:03,720
what are the events passengers are

00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:07,020
planning to attend and do we need to

00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:08,669
change maybe the amount of crew members

00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,110
that had employed at this event if it's

00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:11,110
much more popular than we think it's

00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:14,810
going to be

00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:19,580
so we can have more bar stewards out

00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:23,360
there making sure the passenger gets the

00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:25,000
kind of service they want and here's

00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,040
kind of like the what it looks like when

00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,750
you know they they cracked their own

00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:35,630
schedule the home page totally changes

00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:37,040
into their personalized schedule so this

00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,600
is a key one for events what I'm going

00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,970
to show is not actually screenshots of

00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:44,800
events but just general stuff but this

00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:47,240
has been a huge one for us being able to

00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:49,730
display these events in multiple

00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:52,370
languages on demand by the passenger

00:33:49,730 --> 00:33:57,680
powered by drupal and the lingotek

00:33:52,370 --> 00:34:00,730
connection that we have but previously

00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:04,970
we really could only print multilingual

00:34:00,730 --> 00:34:07,460
events listings on demand if we knew

00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:11,150
they were guests there and if we had the

00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:12,440
proper people on board to be able to to

00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:14,840
make sure that the language who is

00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,730
correct all that kind of stuff now we

00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:19,130
can do this whenever we're using the

00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:21,770
standardized library of titles and

00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:23,690
descriptions that are pre translated the

00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:26,540
ship just has to select one of these

00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:29,030
priests translated items and then now

00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:31,040
magically we have the entire event

00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:33,860
listing and whatever languages we

00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,140
support currently it is limited the

00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:38,300
Chinese and Japanese we're launching

00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:40,990
Spanish later this month and then will

00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:45,169
ultimately have nine languages available

00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:46,910
French German Portuguese Russian and I

00:34:45,169 --> 00:34:49,760
can't remember all of them Italian

00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:52,460
that's right the ships also have the

00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:54,890
freedom to create new events which may

00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:56,450
not be translated Shelley but we have a

00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:58,310
workflow that's been created to that

00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:00,110
events are getting migrated back to the

00:34:58,310 --> 00:35:02,150
show set instance gets translated

00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:03,920
through lingotek and comes back to the

00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:06,800
ship when it's ready for showing to the

00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,840
passengers so this is kind of what

00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,310
sapphire princess look like over the

00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:14,450
summer last year you know we were able

00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:17,030
to leverage drupal's you know language

00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:18,170
detection on the device so piece of

00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,430
people that were coming to look at it

00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:20,869
and simplified Chinese would

00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:24,960
automatically get

00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:26,910
the version and Chinese I knew we must

00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,190
have done this right when I use these

00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:30,720
slides in presentations with native

00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,250
Chinese speakers and nobody started

00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:36,329
laughing at me for showing something

00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:37,440
crazy they actually I kept asking does

00:35:36,329 --> 00:35:40,380
this really say what I think it means

00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,910
yeah but I think it says and so but this

00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:44,480
was really this is a key feature for us

00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:49,109
this is a huge thing for us to have in

00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:51,180
in China last year and Japan this year

00:35:49,109 --> 00:35:55,470
when we launched about diamond princess

00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:58,230
a month and a half ago and I can't

00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:59,730
really you know I just can't talk enough

00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,109
about how great their working

00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:03,359
relationship with lingotek is and

00:36:01,109 --> 00:36:04,980
there'll be a reason why we can talk

00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:07,940
even further about this at the end and

00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,940
I'll show at the end of the presentation

00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:12,480
here's kind of some of the modules we

00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:17,540
use don't worry about writing all this

00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:19,859
stuff down it'll be up for viewing later

00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:21,720
so one interesting use case that we

00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:25,109
didn't even think about was the

00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:26,940
passengers and crew talk using this for

00:36:25,109 --> 00:36:28,890
communication so it just in case of

00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,750
passengers is a non-native speaker and

00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:33,329
the crew doesn't know how to speak to

00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:35,010
this passenger that language and the

00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:37,230
passengers looking for something they

00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:39,329
actually browse to the location in

00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:41,339
English and then switch the switch the

00:36:39,329 --> 00:36:43,290
language and show the passenger so this

00:36:41,339 --> 00:36:45,119
was used as a means of communication and

00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:47,069
which we never thought that will be used

00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,109
like that yeah that was a cool one we

00:36:47,069 --> 00:36:51,119
heard a nun deployment is actually one

00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:52,650
of those things like you know just

00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:57,420
behaviors that start happening when

00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:58,829
tools like this are out there okay so

00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:00,210
now we're going to talk about one of the

00:36:58,829 --> 00:37:02,309
big challenges on board and one of the

00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:04,710
things that is actually unique to having

00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:07,079
a platform like this out there this is

00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:09,150
kind of a comedy photo we took on Coral

00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:12,000
Princess throwing our deployment we have

00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:13,559
the speaker phones in the room and no we

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,839
could hear everybody else on the speaker

00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:17,490
but nobody could hear us we found the

00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:19,559
way to do it was take the hand set up

00:37:17,490 --> 00:37:25,440
and speak right into the phone like it's

00:37:19,559 --> 00:37:28,440
a microphone so that leads us into kind

00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,000
of the big feature that we launched

00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:33,450
that's rolling out to all the ships

00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,180
right now messaging

00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:37,589
so when you're on a ship it can be kind

00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:40,619
of hard to coordinate with all the other

00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:42,720
people you're traveling with there's not

00:37:40,619 --> 00:37:44,910
really there's you know phone and voice

00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,770
mail and all that stuff that requires

00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:49,349
going to your stateroom you know

00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:51,150
checking your voicemail and who wants

00:37:49,349 --> 00:37:52,380
you're not on the cruise to state in

00:37:51,150 --> 00:37:53,579
your stateroom all the time checking

00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:58,710
your voicemail that's what you do at

00:37:53,579 --> 00:38:01,050
home so to combat this some passengers

00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:02,400
have gotten pretty creative I think we

00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,930
talked with somebody earlier today who

00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,839
is planning or what's planning to get

00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:09,960
walkie-talkies you know to keep in touch

00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:11,460
with each other but what messaging

00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:16,320
really allowed us to do was to provide

00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:18,450
kind of a text messaging platform for

00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,599
the ship it's not really text it's more

00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:24,510
of a chat kind of thing doesn't require

00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:26,940
any charge it's free that was a key

00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:31,230
driver from our present is that it

00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:32,460
should be free and which I love so now

00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:34,140
passengers don't have to bring

00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:36,540
walkie-talkies on board they can just

00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:40,140
connect to this system use it freely

00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:42,240
freely they can use it in a passive

00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:45,150
manner where it's more like leaving a

00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,490
note in a box there's an app they can

00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:50,250
download additionally that will give

00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:53,369
them notifications but this is all

00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:55,849
driven by drupal so you know the app is

00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:59,150
native it's there just to capture that

00:38:55,849 --> 00:39:04,109
device ID and be able to push the

00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:05,369
notifications out but you know it's been

00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:06,869
a kind of a challenge getting this one

00:39:05,369 --> 00:39:09,329
out because there's a lot of things to

00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:12,180
think about when you're activating

00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:16,619
notifications on on a kind of a closed

00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:18,930
Network so it's been tricky but it's

00:39:16,619 --> 00:39:20,609
been apart from the notification part

00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:23,119
the messaging itself has been kind of a

00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:25,800
transformative experience for the guests

00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:28,079
and for princess too because like one of

00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:30,359
the cool things we now have is another

00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,760
channel to send messaging out directly

00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:35,010
to the guests previously we'd have to

00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:38,369
make an announcement over the shifts

00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:41,700
loudspeakers if there was immigration

00:39:38,369 --> 00:39:43,079
coming up or change in venue the cruise

00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,400
director likes to get on there and hear

00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:48,420
his own voice a lot of time

00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,760
you know but we're now able to send

00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:53,279
these kind of things through the system

00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,440
and out directly to the passengers and

00:39:53,279 --> 00:39:57,599
even potentially the future target

00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:02,010
specific passengers themselves a

00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:04,970
specific kind of messaging as well and

00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:07,680
and one of the kind of cool things that

00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:10,109
that allows to is kind of like crawling

00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,270
your group you know the it's not just a

00:40:10,109 --> 00:40:14,880
one-to-one communication it can be a

00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:20,520
one-to-many kind of thing where your

00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:23,400
groups themselves can can chat and want

00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,950
you know the kind of why this even came

00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:27,779
into being is that socializing the ship

00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:29,789
is actually a very important thing on a

00:40:27,779 --> 00:40:32,309
cruise that's why there's traditional

00:40:29,789 --> 00:40:35,220
dining where you have a large table with

00:40:32,309 --> 00:40:36,569
multiple guests who are on different you

00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:38,099
know in different state rooms may not

00:40:36,569 --> 00:40:41,460
know each other the idea is that you

00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:44,160
meet new people and meet new friends so

00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:45,779
we didn't want to have that only tied to

00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:47,579
that one time you have dinner those

00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:50,400
times you have dinner with them so when

00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:52,500
you meet them you can become contacts

00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,660
with them and messaging and then now

00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:56,039
have more people that you can plan

00:40:54,660 --> 00:41:00,119
events for through the rest of the

00:40:56,039 --> 00:41:03,630
cruise and one of the kind of cool

00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:05,339
things about this whole infrastructure

00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:07,170
here is that we've been able to leverage

00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:10,500
it for a lot of other features so we

00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:13,410
have charters and large groups coming on

00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:15,779
board quite a bit and this now gives

00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:17,940
them a way to instead of having they

00:41:15,779 --> 00:41:20,480
actually have like big flip charts like

00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:23,430
the ones you see here in a table set up

00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,980
to coordinate all their people on the

00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:27,690
Charter on the group now they can use a

00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,970
group large group messaging that's

00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:32,490
automatically settled for them they have

00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:38,789
kind of their own space and wall within

00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:40,740
Britain at c2 to manage and provide a

00:41:38,789 --> 00:41:47,220
great experience for their customers who

00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:50,339
are their members of their charter so

00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:55,079
this was taken on sapphire princess last

00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:58,019
year off the coast of Korea

00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:59,640
it was i got up at insanely early hour

00:41:58,019 --> 00:42:02,459
one morning for some reason and took

00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:06,869
this photo but i like it because it

00:42:02,459 --> 00:42:08,459
makes me think about the future so what

00:42:06,869 --> 00:42:10,549
we have now is really just the beginning

00:42:08,459 --> 00:42:12,509
the start of what we're doing it's all

00:42:10,549 --> 00:42:14,009
revolves around what we've been able to

00:42:12,509 --> 00:42:16,170
do with Drupal and the way we've been

00:42:14,009 --> 00:42:18,749
able to use a lot of the contributed

00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:21,390
modules space and a lot of the great

00:42:18,749 --> 00:42:25,009
service providers that have sprung out

00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:27,420
around Drupal so we're planning a lot of

00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:30,059
really kind of cool features we really

00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:33,029
want to extend kind of the sharing

00:42:30,059 --> 00:42:36,630
concept beyond just the ship and out to

00:42:33,029 --> 00:42:39,329
the world itself and your you know your

00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:41,430
real group of friends back home so we're

00:42:39,329 --> 00:42:43,529
looking at ways we can integrate social

00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:45,420
end of this we definitely want to get

00:42:43,529 --> 00:42:48,989
into more transactions stuff that's

00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:50,729
coming very quickly down the pipe we've

00:42:48,989 --> 00:42:52,829
been experimenting a lot with ways we

00:42:50,729 --> 00:42:55,829
can do you know kind of location-aware

00:42:52,829 --> 00:42:58,699
onboard the ship we can't really rely on

00:42:55,829 --> 00:43:00,989
GPS because you're moving constantly so

00:42:58,699 --> 00:43:05,519
we have to look at interesting other

00:43:00,989 --> 00:43:07,589
ways to do that and we like one of the

00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:09,499
key things for us is as we get more and

00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:13,309
more information about the passengers

00:43:09,499 --> 00:43:17,999
we're on a very space-constrained device

00:43:13,309 --> 00:43:20,249
we need to be able to provide more

00:43:17,999 --> 00:43:23,249
relevant information to the passenger in

00:43:20,249 --> 00:43:24,660
a without throwing too many things at

00:43:23,249 --> 00:43:26,969
them at once so we're looking at all

00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:29,190
sorts of ways we can do that of course

00:43:26,969 --> 00:43:32,459
all of these are made only the more fun

00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:33,900
and challenging by being on a ship out

00:43:32,459 --> 00:43:36,209
in the middle of the ocean that can't

00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:38,099
use any cloud service so challenge that

00:43:36,209 --> 00:43:39,809
we have is like drupal itself is

00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:42,119
powering video signage is video on

00:43:39,809 --> 00:43:44,459
demand systems and everything like and

00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:46,949
our primary use case is also the

00:43:44,459 --> 00:43:48,449
passengers number personal devices and

00:43:46,949 --> 00:43:50,880
we have we do too many things like

00:43:48,449 --> 00:43:52,709
e-commerce like we have messaging we

00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,469
have information we have everything into

00:43:52,709 --> 00:43:56,969
one tiny screen so we want to build more

00:43:55,469 --> 00:44:00,229
intelligence towards that so that you

00:43:56,969 --> 00:44:03,209
know when the passenger looks at his

00:44:00,229 --> 00:44:06,180
profile and now he he gets what he needs

00:44:03,209 --> 00:44:07,240
to have but we have real-time ng

00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:09,100
decisions

00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:11,200
running around agree we have here but

00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:14,640
getting to work on both the ship is a

00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:17,800
big challenge you're walking towards it

00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,570
so if there's one thing though that this

00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:23,050
entire project up to this point has

00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:28,210
taught us is that Drupal really is a

00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:31,900
platform for making platforms it's very

00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:34,869
very flexible it's geared towards what

00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:37,080
we want to do which is B digital own

00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:39,880
cause these little transformations and

00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:41,410
therefore Drupal is digital going back

00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,670
to like what drew said at that keynote

00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:47,980
two years ago really resonated with us

00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:50,950
I'm the direction we're heading by the

00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:53,200
way this was taken off of Japan as the

00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:55,420
Sun was setting and I just thought it

00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:58,180
was nice that this is the way the Land

00:44:55,420 --> 00:45:02,550
of the Rising Sun says goodbye to you is

00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:06,400
by the Sun setting on a beautiful ocean

00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:10,960
so thank you very much for listening to

00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:12,369
me a for 45 minutes a couple notes

00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,780
though we do want to do some questions

00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:16,119
and we're gonna bribe you with some

00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:18,460
giveaways so whoever answers ask the

00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:23,470
question will get a umbrella or cookbook

00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:28,300
princess cookbook so it's branded but

00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:31,480
two notes we are hiring so please view

00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:33,580
or anyone you know you know it's

00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:38,470
thinking about working at somewhere kind

00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:41,859
of cool and weird and fun stop by our

00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:44,200
booth I'm there quite often I'm actually

00:45:41,859 --> 00:45:45,490
Cebu will be there quite often a lot of

00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:47,080
people from our team are there so we

00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:49,900
love talking about the project and what

00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:51,609
we're doing and finding people that have

00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:55,020
mesh really well with the team that we

00:45:51,609 --> 00:45:58,240
have one other note and this is

00:45:55,020 --> 00:46:01,720
definitely one that you should plan on

00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:03,369
attending we're doing lingotek is

00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:06,990
graciously invited us to their booth

00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:09,250
tomorrow for a couple hours for a

00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:12,460
session what's not really session it's

00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:15,130
more of a beer-drinking kind of fun Q&A

00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:17,369
kind of thing called beers boats and

00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:19,790
boots it's tomorrow from three to five

00:46:17,369 --> 00:46:23,420
at lingotek booth which is

00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:24,800
booth number 806 so definitely mark that

00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:29,090
on your calendars it's going to be some

00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:31,610
cool swag you can get all that while we

00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:33,830
do questions just one note please leave

00:46:31,610 --> 00:46:35,480
feedback for us on what you think of the

00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:39,020
session what is it helpful was it cool

00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:41,870
was it terrible leave it all so let's

00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:44,240
get started with the questions great

00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:46,700
presentation Thanks what do you guys do

00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:48,740
to disseminate user logins does each fan

00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:50,060
then one login are just each person

00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:53,990
habit how do they get access to the

00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:59,450
bills etc sure so right now the user

00:46:53,990 --> 00:47:01,430
logins are tied with their booking on

00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:04,040
board the ship so it's directly tied

00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:06,040
into their shipboard account we are

00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:08,600
going to be integrating that with our

00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:12,920
princess com login and the near future

00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:15,530
so it'll be a one-time persistent only

00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:18,170
one log in sync log and right now though

00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:20,450
it's it's really just there for use when

00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:23,270
you're on the ship and when you leave it

00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:24,650
you lose everything that you set up on

00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:26,960
the ship that's something we really want

00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:28,700
to change so like contacts you create on

00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:30,920
the ship will follow you around all of

00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:32,870
these things so so if you have a family

00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:35,420
with like four kids for example do they

00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:37,310
all get their own logins yes yeah so it

00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,870
is unique per person and that's mainly

00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:43,670
because of the billing the way the

00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:45,890
billing is done basically everybody in a

00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:48,200
state room can be charging to one card

00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:50,450
or there can be multiple cards so

00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:52,220
there's kind of this layering of who

00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:53,540
gets to see what parts of the bill and

00:47:52,220 --> 00:47:55,940
all that stuff the owner of the card

00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:57,260
always gets to see everything the users

00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:00,350
who are underneath it get to see bits

00:47:57,260 --> 00:48:03,230
and pieces so everybody has their own

00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:06,530
specific login tied to their kind of

00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:08,060
loyalty number that everyone gets when

00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:10,790
they when they take a cruise with us

00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:12,770
thank you cool we come in and get a book

00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:15,860
or umbrella we only have two umbrellas

00:48:12,770 --> 00:48:20,840
so you know if you want an umbrella run

00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:23,090
up and ask a question okay yeah now

00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:26,450
you're set for the five times it rains

00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:30,329
in LA hopefully you're from a rainy area

00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:32,849
cool all right a couple questions first

00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:35,309
so if a cruise director or the powers

00:48:32,849 --> 00:48:37,559
that we need to add an event change an

00:48:35,309 --> 00:48:39,690
event whatever there's our date of

00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:42,210
logging into a local instance of Drupal

00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:44,190
and as soon as they add that event it

00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:46,170
gets published or is it a thing of you

00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:48,660
were saying it goes back to stateside

00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:49,980
and and there's some kind of approval

00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:51,960
system or something then comes back to

00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:53,849
the ship I had what's that process so

00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,770
there's kind of two things that there's

00:48:53,849 --> 00:48:58,490
two systems in play and kind of two

00:48:55,770 --> 00:49:00,630
parts to it there is a separate

00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:02,369
scheduling system that they use that

00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:06,510
does directly tie to us for all the

00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:08,539
titles and descriptions of events that

00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:11,369
populates us and then we have the

00:49:08,539 --> 00:49:14,910
ability to override or create additional

00:49:11,369 --> 00:49:17,250
ones in Princeton see in Drupal those

00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:20,010
are all content types it's a note that's

00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:22,020
being created at that point the actual

00:49:20,010 --> 00:49:24,839
title description images all that stuff

00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:27,869
those are all taxonomy terms so they

00:49:24,839 --> 00:49:29,309
while they create their own events and

00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:31,289
they can do that on demand publish

00:49:29,309 --> 00:49:34,980
immediately they have a limited subset

00:49:31,289 --> 00:49:37,920
of functionality they can do on the

00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:39,510
terms themselves so this you know the

00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:41,369
shoreside approved terms you're locked

00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:43,410
down they can't even touch they can look

00:49:41,369 --> 00:49:45,059
at them and browse them they can create

00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:47,430
new terms which they can publish

00:49:45,059 --> 00:49:49,710
immediately because the nature of the

00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:51,210
ship they may have guessed entertainers

00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:53,609
change all that stuff so we have to give

00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:56,039
them some flexibility there but those

00:49:53,609 --> 00:49:58,410
will once they created in the background

00:49:56,039 --> 00:50:00,839
it does come back shoreside we can do

00:49:58,410 --> 00:50:02,789
our own editing workflow republish it

00:50:00,839 --> 00:50:06,089
back out and override whatever they have

00:50:02,789 --> 00:50:08,549
with the corporate approved branding so

00:50:06,089 --> 00:50:10,770
it's kind of a mix of both okay once it

00:50:08,549 --> 00:50:13,500
comes back it also goes to linger again

00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:16,170
gets translated so if the event is good

00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:17,910
for one should creates an event and the

00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:20,700
copper things that it's good for every

00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:22,410
ship will go for translation and then

00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,640
get streamed out to all the other ships

00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:26,800
for the

00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:29,230
borchers ok and then the other question

00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:32,020
is so you have the the billing system

00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:34,000
I'm assuming is not in Drupal right so

00:50:32,020 --> 00:50:35,830
what how did the two systems talk to

00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,650
each other you're using services yeah

00:50:35,830 --> 00:50:40,060
and we we are the rule we made early on

00:50:38,650 --> 00:50:41,470
for every system that was either going

00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:43,300
to look at us or that we were going to

00:50:41,470 --> 00:50:46,630
look at was everything had to be restful

00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:50,350
Jason there was we believe me we've had

00:50:46,630 --> 00:50:53,560
many other systems asked to have direct

00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:55,450
access to the database which we've

00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:57,910
denied every time I always use the

00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:59,950
excuse you don't want to figure out how

00:50:57,910 --> 00:51:01,660
Drupal is storing all this stuff in the

00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:03,940
database and I don't really want to

00:51:01,660 --> 00:51:05,530
explain it to you either so just you

00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,880
know we'll create a service it'll give

00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:09,490
you what you need you create a service

00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:12,100
to us and we can all agree that you know

00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:14,380
then if say god forbid one day we do

00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:17,920
switch to something else we can have the

00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:19,420
service look identical and not break any

00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:21,790
of the functionality and you're

00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:24,430
literally using the services module or

00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:27,250
using something homegrown or so for us

00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:31,840
we do use services model so everything

00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:34,150
we do we built custom services for the

00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:37,060
other systems are using their own

00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:40,690
stuffing its a mix of yeah what's the

00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:41,980
Botes Lotus Notes stuff if you believe

00:51:40,690 --> 00:51:46,780
it that's worth laughs and scheduling

00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:49,080
system is there's java stuff out there

00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:52,240
there's some dotnet sprinkled in their

00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:56,080
mainframe cobol yeah we don't talk to

00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:57,330
them very very often yeah we sit right

00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:01,180
next to him but they're quite a bunch

00:51:57,330 --> 00:52:05,820
yeah cool yeah that's all I had cool if

00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:05,820
you wanna book / an umbrella please come

00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:12,370
yeah the cookbooks by the way are all

00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:14,200
stuff that they serve on board the ships

00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:18,790
so you know give you a taste of princess

00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:21,310
at home yes i'm new to drupal I just

00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:23,560
know I've been IT for a while but new to

00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:26,380
Drupal I noticed you have 15 20 25

00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:28,330
different modules that are not renewable

00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:32,370
plugged in what process did you go

00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:32,370
through to decide which ones to use

00:52:32,510 --> 00:52:37,250
that's a good question there's ones that

00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:39,050
we always use some core ones that we

00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:41,030
always no matter what project we're

00:52:39,050 --> 00:52:43,640
doing in Drupal we use theirs you know

00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:48,080
activating multilingual and languages

00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:50,060
adds quite a few we tend to look at

00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:53,150
quite a few things one we do review the

00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:55,160
code of the module that we're looking at

00:52:53,150 --> 00:52:56,690
adding just to make sure that fits the

00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,160
kind of stuff we're not uncomfortable

00:52:56,690 --> 00:53:00,950
with anything we always look at how many

00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,960
sites have installed that module when

00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:05,300
the last commit date was how many issues

00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:08,000
it hasn't its issue queue all this stuff

00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:09,440
is it's great on drupal.org because you

00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,320
can see all this stuff very easy it's

00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:14,270
very transparent so we we look at all of

00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,880
those things mainly to determine is this

00:53:14,270 --> 00:53:19,340
actively supported and is it actively

00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:20,960
being developed and you know there is a

00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:22,880
line in there that says whether it's

00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,430
actively being developed or maintained

00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:28,910
or it's abandoned or you know looking

00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:35,840
for a new maintainer etc so drupal.org

00:53:28,910 --> 00:53:38,300
that's the big thank you hi hello I'd be

00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:40,790
interested to know if you did any sort

00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:43,730
of user tests to do first of all or if

00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:45,530
the first ship it went live on were they

00:53:43,730 --> 00:53:48,350
the first people using it or how much

00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:53,930
did you test it out before um the answer

00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:55,970
is none hit the timeline was really

00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:58,570
tight for royal princess it was a very

00:53:55,970 --> 00:54:00,740
very basic site at that time it was

00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:04,280
pattern why as we weren't doing anything

00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:06,260
to dock fell too crazy we also didn't

00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:08,270
really have it had to roll out when the

00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:10,700
new ship rolled out and no other ships

00:54:08,270 --> 00:54:13,400
really at that time had the Wi-Fi

00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:15,560
coverage that we really needed so we

00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:16,850
really was kind of rolling the dice you

00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,290
know I mean we knew that it was going to

00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:19,910
work we knew passengers because we're

00:54:18,290 --> 00:54:23,650
gonna like it but we didn't really know

00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:26,780
we've done more we do look at feedback

00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:28,850
there's a very very active cruise

00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:31,580
community out there called cruise critic

00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:34,150
if you do something wrong you're going

00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:37,250
to see it on there in about five seconds

00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:40,250
so we look at that we we've started

00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:42,590
doing informal passenger focus group so

00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:44,130
as we do deployments but it's something

00:54:42,590 --> 00:54:46,350
we lack right now that we

00:54:44,130 --> 00:54:48,180
they want to make it a more formalized

00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:50,010
part of our process would that be

00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:52,170
something that you would expect them

00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:54,660
like if they give passengers give

00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:56,400
feedback on the ship or do you like send

00:54:54,660 --> 00:55:00,330
them a survey and hope they get back to

00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:01,740
you um so we do it we'd like to do it

00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:04,170
directly on the ship because it's in the

00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:06,210
environment it's I think you'd look at

00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:09,420
the thing differently when you're in the

00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:11,910
moment versus not but when you know if

00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:14,970
it's usable or not can be done at any

00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:16,650
point you know and you that's one of the

00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:18,420
things we're convincing everyone right

00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:22,980
now is you don't need a large group to

00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:24,450
get good results we haven't really

00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:27,450
determined how we're going to you know

00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:28,710
our methodology for that yet there we're

00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:30,420
going to try and leverage some of the

00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:33,750
stuff that our princess calm team is

00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:36,750
using and see how we can extend it even

00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:40,890
further and go from there so it's still

00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:45,540
evolving you know kind of a not totally

00:55:40,890 --> 00:55:49,800
the succinct answer but oh cool thank

00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:53,070
you okay we're we've got three things

00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:55,530
left so the three people in the line so

00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:58,710
you're all good thanks again for the

00:55:55,530 --> 00:56:00,510
presentation I apologize if I missed the

00:55:58,710 --> 00:56:02,430
first couple of minutes but some of the

00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:04,860
screen shots were confusing the

00:56:02,430 --> 00:56:08,310
passengers do they access this through

00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:11,040
web browser or app yeah so it is all

00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:12,540
browser-based we made that decision very

00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:14,460
early on because we didn't you know

00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:17,610
costs money to connect to the app stores

00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:18,810
and download it for the internet really

00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:20,370
more than anything so we didn't want

00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:21,780
somebody to have to remember to do

00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:23,550
something before they got exactly

00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:25,560
perfect okay and then also it's just

00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:28,230
it's just hosted locally on the ship

00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:30,060
right yeah yeah yeah so it doesn't it's

00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:31,650
not affected by internet asset outages

00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:33,060
any of that stuff that's that kind of

00:56:31,650 --> 00:56:37,980
leads into my next question which is

00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:40,200
about the future I mean is the globe

00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:41,280
gonna get more coverage is that

00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:43,350
something you guys are thinking about as

00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,370
far as like is the internet going to be

00:56:43,350 --> 00:56:47,370
available in the middle of the ocean

00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:49,080
someday yeah yeah so we are looking at

00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:51,870
ways we can do it the luckily the

00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:54,600
majority of our cruises don't go more

00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:55,500
than like 50 miles off the coast so

00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,820
there's I know

00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:59,460
is some stuff that they're actively

00:56:56,820 --> 00:57:01,950
being deployed right now to you know

00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:03,690
we're not rock ribbing who can do you

00:57:01,950 --> 00:57:07,320
know spend billions of dollars on on

00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:09,330
their internet infrastructure so we're

00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:12,090
looking at smarter ways we can spend a

00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:13,320
smaller amount of money to to do that so

00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:15,840
we're looking at stuff that's more land

00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:19,890
based is one that's rolled out in Alaska

00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:22,080
already and working with our satellite

00:57:19,890 --> 00:57:23,970
providers to you know to optimize the

00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:25,890
band we have right now because I mean it

00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:27,930
seems that make sense to you know host

00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:29,970
it on the ship you know just always

00:57:27,930 --> 00:57:31,770
reliable but I'm just wondering about

00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:33,300
you know you've had to overcome so many

00:57:31,770 --> 00:57:35,550
challenges with the fact that their

00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:38,310
internet isn't available and on a cruise

00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:40,380
yeah I'm wondering if they'll improve

00:57:38,310 --> 00:57:42,720
your processes you know Internet becomes

00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:44,520
available yeah yeah and really then

00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:46,140
that's the thing look we do have not you

00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:48,030
know is available the majority of the

00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:52,020
time so it's not it just may not be

00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:54,180
great exact you know so luckily Drupal

00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:56,100
zips up pretty small you know so we need

00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:59,760
to deploy the code it's it's not you

00:57:56,100 --> 00:58:01,020
know gigantic so we're not faced with

00:57:59,760 --> 00:58:03,900
some of the same challenges that other

00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:05,340
other teams are it's still you know it's

00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:07,710
one of those things we don't have a good

00:58:05,340 --> 00:58:11,910
solution for yet though you know real

00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:13,440
high speed kind of internet access and I

00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:15,480
might've missed this too i'm sorry but

00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,920
like how do they access do they just

00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,090
open their browser and it's like when

00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:20,670
you're at a hotel it just kind of takes

00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:22,650
over yes yeah it's so it's just like I

00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:25,050
hotel we have a captive portal on board

00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:27,690
you connect to the the passenger Wi-Fi

00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:32,100
yeah any requests you make is going to

00:58:27,690 --> 00:58:33,600
redirect you to us awesome cool we also

00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:36,150
made the domain really easy by the way

00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:38,730
so we have princess calm so every site

00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:42,390
that runs on the ship is the ship name

00:58:38,730 --> 00:58:45,240
so royal princess calm or sapphire now

00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:50,550
princess calm so on so

00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:53,910
hi so it was implied I just wanted to

00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:57,450
clarify you have no technical staff on

00:58:53,910 --> 00:59:00,630
board to maintain these systems right so

00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:03,720
we do have a IT officer there is but

00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:06,900
they are more of a support person for

00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:09,119
computer stuff more than a server

00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:10,950
somebody might understand the server or

00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:13,530
understand Drupal or any of that stuff

00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:15,960
we do have a Content Manager on board or

00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:19,230
you do so they manage content purely but

00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:21,140
they're not really a developer so

00:59:19,230 --> 00:59:23,910
everything we do we have to be able to

00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:27,270
remotely support so do you have a remote

00:59:23,910 --> 00:59:29,640
data center and a sense of what kind of

00:59:27,270 --> 00:59:32,550
tools you use out of that data center

00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:34,710
yeah yeah so I mean we do have there is

00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:37,260
it's a I wouldn't say it's beefy but

00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:41,460
there is a nice size data center on

00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:44,580
board and limit remotely hmm where's

00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:46,710
your you have a central yes yeah so we

00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:49,590
and we have our own data center it here

00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:51,930
in los angeles i think is replicated

00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:53,220
somewhere else too but but yeah so we

00:59:51,930 --> 00:59:55,470
have we have one here we have a

00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:57,960
simulation of the ship data center here

00:59:55,470 --> 01:00:00,359
too doesn't unfortunately cover the full

00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:02,820
in the end we don't have the full

01:00:00,359 --> 01:00:05,670
passenger Wi-Fi kind of simulation in

01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:12,200
our office which has led to some you

01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:15,240
know snafu is here and there but cool i

01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:18,690
was wondering about specifically

01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:21,240
performance testing and what you do for

01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:25,170
purple you know for performance testing

01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:27,090
so we have a automated pipeline that so

01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:30,180
every commit goes automatically to dev

01:00:27,090 --> 01:00:32,369
it also now it didn't do this in the

01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:35,490
past but is now triggering our test runs

01:00:32,369 --> 01:00:38,690
as well on every commit basically we use

01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:46,380
jmeter in there we use what else we got

01:00:38,690 --> 01:00:47,940
hp8 or something like speed yeah is

01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:51,180
there anything specifically in your code

01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:55,260
that you focus on to you know make your

01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:56,580
make the site more efficient I'm not

01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:57,870
sure what sort of constraints you have

01:00:56,580 --> 01:00:59,790
based on like the

01:00:57,870 --> 01:01:01,800
server architecture if there's

01:00:59,790 --> 01:01:03,090
differences there yeah we actually we

01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,620
actually don't have to worry about it

01:01:03,090 --> 01:01:06,090
too much we have a you know where the

01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:10,170
max we're going to have us four thousand

01:01:06,090 --> 01:01:11,850
people on yeah you know on there and we

01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:13,740
haven't had to really optimize it too

01:01:11,850 --> 01:01:16,080
much to make it run well I mean we don't

01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:17,580
we barely use caching whatsoever on

01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:20,120
board because it's not an issue for

01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:22,320
right you know we have a fairly

01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:24,960
decent-sized vm so we don't have to

01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:26,610
worry too much about it more than

01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:29,460
anything it's a memory problem or that

01:01:26,610 --> 01:01:32,850
we run into more than anything yeah cool

01:01:29,460 --> 01:01:34,260
thanks recovering from any failure and

01:01:32,850 --> 01:01:36,180
that's what we have to look at more than

01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:39,380
performance right it's more

01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:39,380
