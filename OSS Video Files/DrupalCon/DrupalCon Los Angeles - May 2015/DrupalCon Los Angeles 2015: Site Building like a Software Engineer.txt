Description: 
	Despite the many attempts to move all of Drupal's configuration into code, the most important steps needed to build a quality Drupal site are still made by clicking a checkbox or submitting a form.

It is time to stop treating site building like the unfortunate step between writing a custom module or making the theme beautiful.

The majority of the important long term architectural decisions for your site are made during module selection and site building.

In this session I will identify common patterns and helpful tips that will help you build a quality site.

I will also share some common anti-patterns that will send your site into an unmaintainable black hole where unsuspecting content editors get crushed into oblivion.

Lets start taking site building more seriously and help keep the sites we develop maintainable, understandable, modifiable and robust for far longer than the first 30 days after launch.
