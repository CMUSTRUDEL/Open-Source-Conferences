Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Site Building like a Software Engineer
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	Despite the many attempts to move all of Drupal's configuration into code, the most important steps needed to build a quality Drupal site are still made by clicking a checkbox or submitting a form.

It is time to stop treating site building like the unfortunate step between writing a custom module or making the theme beautiful.

The majority of the important long term architectural decisions for your site are made during module selection and site building.

In this session I will identify common patterns and helpful tips that will help you build a quality site.

I will also share some common anti-patterns that will send your site into an unmaintainable black hole where unsuspecting content editors get crushed into oblivion.

Lets start taking site building more seriously and help keep the sites we develop maintainable, understandable, modifiable and robust for far longer than the first 30 days after launch.

go ahead and get started and let few of

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:16,049
the stragglers from lunch come in as as

00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:17,279
we get going so if you're in the back of

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,560
the room and having trouble seeing the

00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,619
slides or you just want to jot this down

00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,930
for later to refer back to slides are

00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,869
available on github and if you hit that

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,279
URL you'll be able to see the same first

00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,380
hopefully the same version of the slides

00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:37,170
I've got here unless I forgot to push my

00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:40,350
last changes up so about me I've been

00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:43,379
building Drupal sites for see just about

00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:46,289
eight years I actually have an

00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,910
interesting story and that I didn't do

00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,680
it as a hobby beforehand I actually

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,390
showed up for the first day of the job

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,789
and they said we just standardize on

00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:55,559
drupal and your first task is to learn

00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,530
drupal so eight years ago I started

00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,699
building professional websites on Drupal

00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,100
and I've been doing it pretty much ever

00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,350
since right now I'm the director of

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,810
engineering to chapter 3 so we've got a

00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,400
big team of developers and I managed

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,740
those guys talked a lot about Drupal

00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,250
sites spend less time writing code these

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,710
days but try to do some patches when I

00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:20,369
can and if you want to get in touch with

00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:23,250
me market chapter 3 and I'm mrf on both

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:24,750
Twitter and driba org and probably

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,369
message me on Twitter you'll get a

00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:32,670
quicker response than if you emailed me

00:01:26,369 --> 00:01:34,770
so to start out with a little bit of a

00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,590
controversial statement everything you

00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:39,210
do about Drupal is wrong and Drupal is

00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:40,710
not the content management system

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,240
despite everything you've heard

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,070
everything you've read everything you've

00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,829
seen Drupal is not a content management

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,530
system so the Drupal is a piece of

00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,720
software like that's pretty fundamental

00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,250
I think we can agree on that but what it

00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,939
is is a piece of software for building

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,619
contract management systems so you know

00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:00,630
that first time you go to juvie lot org

00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:02,430
you click this link you think you're

00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,630
getting a fully functional content

00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,460
management system that's going to solve

00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,829
all your needs and what you're actually

00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:09,030
getting as a starting point like you've

00:02:07,829 --> 00:02:09,890
got to start building your own content

00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,350
management

00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:17,200
it does probably very little of what you

00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:21,110
need from from that download and install

00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,970
step so congratulations you just became

00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:31,430
a software developer whether you really

00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:35,180
wanted to or not a question close ok

00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:36,170
that's loud will do they offer will do

00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:42,560
the opposite I'll move the microphone

00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:47,350
away because that is that better better

00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,350
before okay look we'll go fifty-fifty

00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:56,480
okay thank you alright so we've got a

00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:57,590
room full of software developers and you

00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,720
can become a software developer now

00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,220
without writing a line of code so so

00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,050
with that kind of under our belts you

00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,920
know that that's sort of the philosophy

00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:08,750
of the rest of this talk so software

00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:13,180
developers think a lot about complexity

00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:16,060
so what do we mean by complexity so as

00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,380
all IT professionals you know loved

00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:20,090
Dilbert we're going to find out about

00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,680
complexity from Dilbert so he came up

00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:24,260
with a really complicated project plan

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,940
and you know he knows when he's talking

00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:28,190
to management that you know they're not

00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,950
going to be able to take his project

00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:32,390
plan in stride and you know of course

00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,070
they're going to just move up the

00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:36,110
deadline when they see how complex the

00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:37,519
working needs to complete is so we all

00:03:36,110 --> 00:03:38,660
have to deal with complexity it doesn't

00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,209
matter whether or not we write software

00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:44,720
or were just drew polettis traitors

00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:46,070
complexities part of our lives and so

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,890
when it comes to the world of site

00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:52,549
building complexity comes from a lot of

00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:54,709
different places and it's not always

00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:59,120
clear where that complexity is going to

00:03:54,709 --> 00:04:01,910
be coming from so what I did to try to

00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,670
get just just wrap my head around what

00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:06,200
makes a drupal site complex but didn't

00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:08,030
really want to go into any you know

00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,440
customers projects you know and throw

00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,930
those up on a slide they may not be too

00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:13,790
happy about that so I went to three of

00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,760
the more popular Drupal distributions

00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:18,440
and try to do some comparisons you know

00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,170
from the command line to see what makes

00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,870
these complex or

00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:25,420
more complex or less complex and so open

00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,850
atrium seemed to top the chart and all

00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:30,190
measures so I'm file count is where I

00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,530
started now whether or not file can't

00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:34,090
make something more or less complex it

00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:35,320
really depends on how much code you put

00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,890
in each one of those files and what each

00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:40,570
one of those files is doing but you know

00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:42,520
setting all that aside eight thousand

00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:44,320
files is a lot more than one thousand

00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,910
files if I wanted to step through

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,710
everything open atrium was doing it

00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,030
would take me eight times longer than it

00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:50,680
would take for me to step through

00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,380
everything that Drupal by itself is

00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,330
doing and so kenapa leaf falls somewhere

00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:58,750
in the middle there in terms of the file

00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:00,460
count measure this is probably a little

00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:03,100
bit more accurate for the site builders

00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,090
in terms of how complex the site you're

00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:06,250
going to be getting when you install

00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:09,550
this distro is going to be so with open

00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:12,820
atrium just run the install and you have

00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:14,620
210 modules enabled as compared with

00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,240
Drupal 7 if you run the basic install

00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,330
and Drupal 7 you have thirty three

00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,190
modules enabled and once again panoply

00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,410
falls right in the middle with 117

00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:27,460
modules enabled so I don't know about

00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,810
the rest of you but I might know what a

00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,460
good majority those two hundred ten

00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:32,170
modules do but there's a good chance

00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,270
that each one of those modules does

00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:36,550
something I'm not expecting and in a way

00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:38,050
that I'm not expecting it so when you

00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:41,710
start with an open atrium site you have

00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:44,260
a lot more complexity there and so in

00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,980
this another way you can measure

00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:49,870
complexity is this is from open atriums

00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:52,780
install page and so in the install

00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:54,490
requirements it's saying your PHP memory

00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,030
limit you should probably double that

00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,200
before you even install open atrium and

00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:01,060
maximum allowed packet size for my

00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:03,550
sequel will probably double that as well

00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:05,320
and you know if your max execution time

00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,910
I don't know what the default is but I

00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,920
don't think it's 60 seconds so we're

00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:11,110
going to bump that as well and so what

00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,570
this is telling you is like we actually

00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:15,160
got some weight with those modules and

00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:17,290
with that file account like all the

00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,930
sudden our CMS is doing a whole lot more

00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:21,040
and a whole whole lot is happening in

00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,960
every request that wasn't happening

00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:26,890
before because Drupal is based install

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:30,430
requirements are I think you can do 128

00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:31,840
megabytes of PHP the packet size I've

00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:33,580
never had to increase that for a Drupal

00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,560
that of a plane Drupal 7 site

00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:38,680
and the max execution time could be much

00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,240
lower so we already know are a lot more

00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,099
magic is happening we're not sure what

00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,860
that magic is until we start clicking

00:06:42,099 --> 00:06:47,139
around open atrium but that site is in

00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:51,370
arguably more complex than a plane and

00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:53,020
solid Drupal 7 so how do we get there

00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:55,569
when we're building our own sites like

00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,789
how do we avoid creating our own copy of

00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:59,229
open atrium you know there's years of

00:06:57,789 --> 00:07:01,120
time invested in making sure all that

00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:03,699
stuff works together so when we're

00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,860
building our own custom Drupal site like

00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:09,310
how do we avoid creating that kind of

00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:11,349
complexity and so the architecture of

00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:14,289
the site is where we avoid this so

00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:16,900
everybody goes into every project with

00:07:14,289 --> 00:07:18,849
good intentions this comic illustrates

00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,440
it really well you know the best of

00:07:18,849 --> 00:07:22,810
intentions this time is going to be

00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:25,259
perfect I'm not going to make the same

00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:28,389
bad decisions I said last time but

00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:31,210
requirements come in deadlines creep up

00:07:28,389 --> 00:07:32,680
and all the sudden you end up with you

00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,810
know something that's it's a usable

00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,490
house like you can do lots of things in

00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:39,610
it but it's probably not what you had in

00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:42,250
mind when you started working and so so

00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:44,289
in the world of site building this

00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:46,870
happens when you're picking modules so

00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:48,759
this is when you start to build that

00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,710
ladder you know build that next section

00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,930
of that house like every time you

00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:54,490
download a module you're bolting on

00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:58,750
another feature to your site whether

00:07:54,490 --> 00:08:00,909
whether you needed it or not so how do

00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:02,409
you go about picking good modules and

00:08:00,909 --> 00:08:05,080
how do you go about picking as few

00:08:02,409 --> 00:08:06,819
modules as unique so I'm actually

00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,860
borrowed this from a presentation I did

00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:12,460
the number of years back to saying howdy

00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:14,830
how do you interact in Drupal contribs

00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:18,039
face and so there's a lot of information

00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,599
on that project module page that you can

00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,000
decipher to kind of make your module

00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,409
decision so this is from views and we

00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,050
all know views is an extremely healthy

00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:28,960
project and the way we can tell if the

00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:31,870
healthy project is three hours ago to

00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:34,839
vaynor was making commits and he's made

00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:36,820
to 2,000 over two thousand ten minutes

00:08:34,839 --> 00:08:39,219
in the five years he's been working on

00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,440
it and not only is he been working on it

00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:43,029
but we also have hundreds of commits

00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,579
thousands of commits from other other

00:08:43,029 --> 00:08:47,110
maintained errs so this to me says this

00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:51,160
is a very healthy project the

00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:54,040
is bug free or very bug you know very

00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,630
few bugs in this code and I can probably

00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,310
guarantee that if they find something

00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,870
critical it's going to be fixed soon

00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:02,230
because people are actively working on

00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:05,140
it another way to find out information

00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:07,209
on the Drupal project page is look at

00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:10,029
the number of installs and then the

00:09:07,209 --> 00:09:12,430
maintenance status so they want more

00:09:10,029 --> 00:09:13,870
help it's obvious from this page that

00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:15,040
there's a whole lot of work going on so

00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,839
there's probably an infinite number of

00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,829
help the amount of help they could get

00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:22,450
and still need more help but the

00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:24,700
development status is under active

00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,839
development which means like they're not

00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:27,339
they're still adding new features

00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,279
they're still fixing things they're

00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:31,420
still working on this project and we can

00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:34,209
tell it's been installed a whole lot of

00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:37,000
times and that number would not have

00:09:34,209 --> 00:09:38,470
grown as large as it did if it wasn't

00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,760
working well for a lot of people so

00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:41,890
that's a pretty healthy module that we

00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,519
can add to our stack and the complexity

00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:47,500
is probably worth bringing along another

00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,930
thing to look at is how often a release

00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,769
is coming out how many releases like

00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,480
have they been working on this thing

00:09:50,769 --> 00:09:54,370
since Drupal 6 or do they just start

00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,570
working on it for Drupal 8 like there's

00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:57,399
a lot of good information on this page

00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:00,940
as well in terms of the health of the

00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:03,120
module you're adding to your stack so

00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:05,790
this is where we come to special cases

00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:08,170
just showing the information for views

00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,970
there's a lot of modules that the second

00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,279
you download and install them your site

00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:14,949
like it just it just folded on a whole

00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:16,930
new section the minute you turn that

00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:19,810
module on so we're going to go through

00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:22,360
some of those special cases right now so

00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:26,529
my favorite favorite from this list is

00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:28,420
panels so I so I've started spreading

00:10:26,529 --> 00:10:30,010
this rumor and i don't i don't know if

00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:32,620
it's made its way around the Drupal

00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:34,390
community but panels was actually a fork

00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:36,480
of Drupal we just never called her to

00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:39,190
fork a Drupal because it was done as the

00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:41,829
contributing to the difference but it

00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:44,440
has its own display layer it has a new

00:10:41,829 --> 00:10:46,630
structure that replaces blocks it has

00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,890
visibility rules that don't have Billy

00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:49,810
anything to do with the rest of Drupal

00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:53,050
core and if you look at all those things

00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:56,410
together it's like well we replaced huge

00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:58,149
chunks of Drupal with panels and we do

00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:59,960
it in an entirely different way so you

00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:01,880
add panels to your site

00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,010
sudden you have this forking complexity

00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,900
is it done with Drupal core is it done

00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,700
the panel's way is it done on these

00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,590
three pages the panel's way and is it

00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,900
done with Drupal core on these three

00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,340
pages and all of a sudden that has to be

00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:16,250
picked apart by the next person working

00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:18,620
on the site so i would say of any module

00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:21,350
you guide your site panels can probably

00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:23,180
it can add a lot of complexity but if

00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:25,280
you use it carefully you can manage that

00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:27,740
really well it's an extremely powerful

00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:31,490
tool for the exact same reasons why it

00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:34,130
adds a ton of complexity so display

00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:37,130
sweet it's guilty of the same thing as

00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:40,490
paneled and a slightly less lesser

00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:41,990
manner which is that it takes over what

00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:44,960
usually happens in the theme layer what

00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:48,500
usually happens in a module file or you

00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:50,660
know in an HTML of a chunk of HTML in

00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,550
your template and what display she does

00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:55,130
it says that probably wants to get

00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:56,900
managed in the CMS itself so then all of

00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:59,240
a sudden you have two places to check is

00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:01,220
this happening display sweet is this

00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,840
happening in my theme layer is this

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,120
happening in my display sweet theme

00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,400
lawyer and panels if we decided to go

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,430
with a display sweet panels combination

00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,990
and so every time we add a layer where

00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,790
you know we're adding a new section to

00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:16,700
that that house that we had in that

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:18,260
first picture so what you want to do is

00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,150
be really careful about every layer that

00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:22,250
you add it's displaced we offering

00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:24,230
something valuable to the people working

00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,540
on this site do they not know how to

00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:27,950
code and having a UI is that extremely

00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,960
valuable to the people I'm delivering

00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:31,520
the site to so you need to start

00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,680
thinking of each feature in terms of

00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,930
does this bring value butter or does it

00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,710
only add complexity like you know what

00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:42,230
what is this feature bringing to me so

00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:43,610
views you know I just showed you is a

00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:47,060
really well maintained module it's a

00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:50,480
really stable module but it also has its

00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:53,210
own rules for what gets displayed and

00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,340
how it gets displayed so it suffers from

00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:57,920
the same issues that display sweet does

00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,990
whereas am I within the views you I

00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,970
changing the output of a field instead

00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:03,650
of using a template to change the output

00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:05,240
of a field you can do that with views

00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:07,280
and a lot of people do do that with

00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,680
views am i doing it consistently in

00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,300
views or only sometimes and beers like

00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,520
so you need to think in terms of that is

00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:16,310
I have this layer of complexity do I

00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,750
want to use it a lot of modules bring

00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,790
layers of complexity but you don't have

00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:22,820
to use you can just use it for what it

00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:27,590
does best and not focus on the

00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:29,030
complexity domain access probably

00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:31,070
actually escalates us to a whole

00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:34,490
different level how many people here

00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:36,290
have used this module so what this

00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:38,240
allows you to do is build a Drupal site

00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:41,120
within your Drupal cited so all of a

00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,090
sudden you have have another another

00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,820
potential from complete complexity which

00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:48,830
is which site does this feature apply to

00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:51,350
and how does this feature apply on this

00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:53,270
individual site so it is this content

00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:54,860
type available on this site as well as

00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,960
this site when I change the feel on that

00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,760
content type does it change the field on

00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:00,920
both those sites on all eight of those

00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:03,620
sites on all 16 of those sites domain

00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:06,410
access opens up huge possibilities for

00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:08,630
setting up a really complex fragile

00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:10,520
system so when you add that to the stack

00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:12,380
you need to be really careful and

00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,840
deliberate about why did you add this

00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:16,040
why did you architect it this way like

00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:19,700
all those decisions need to be made

00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:22,580
really deliberately organic groups

00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:25,730
except as similar to the ones we just

00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:29,150
discussed it creates a bunch of access

00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:32,330
rules it does it in a really clean core

00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:34,490
compliant API compliant way but all of a

00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:36,320
sudden a piece of contents not showing

00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:37,850
to a particular user and you have a

00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,410
whole chain of things to check before

00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:40,850
you can figure out why that piece of

00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:44,720
content is not showing to that

00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:45,830
particular user so the question is you

00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,600
know this is something I could have done

00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,550
with published and unpublished and i

00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,320
added organic groups you know to try to

00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:53,210
solve the problem or did the previous

00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,640
developer who is building this site at

00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:57,440
it to try to solve it salt you know is

00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,000
they using this module for the wrong use

00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,730
case you know organic groups is really

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,990
powerful if you have a social site where

00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,400
there's a lot of different users and

00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:06,590
they do have access to different levels

00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,970
of content but you know you can use it

00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:10,280
on a site that doesn't have that

00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:15,800
requirement and add complexity without

00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:18,770
you know without a lot of benefit so

00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:22,160
rules I think rules is probably the most

00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:24,070
interesting case so does anybody know

00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:26,410
what turing-complete means

00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:28,570
so so turn complete means you know

00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:31,630
basically any programming language

00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:34,060
that's Torian complete it's capable of

00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:36,280
solving any software problem so the

00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,980
rules is within Drupal and it's

00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,380
turing-complete so I can build any piece

00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:45,400
of software possible with the rules

00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:48,820
module because it allows me to do false

00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:50,770
and true values so what that means is I

00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,420
have an infinite ability to add

00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:54,790
complexity my site with the rules module

00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:57,130
and you can do all the same things you

00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:01,450
do in PHP code with the rules module and

00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:03,670
it's even without turning on the custom

00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:06,040
PHP filter within the rules module you

00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:07,960
can still do a whole lot of unexpected

00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,330
things with the rules modules so I press

00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:13,720
the submit on my content type I expected

00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:15,760
to save the content edit I just made but

00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,040
the rules module can intercept right

00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,730
there and do a dozen other things a

00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,540
dozen other other unexpected things so

00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,670
introducing the rules module to your

00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:28,090
site should be done deliberately it

00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:30,400
should be I have a requirement that my

00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:31,810
client needs to go into the UI and be

00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:33,730
able to change the behavior of things

00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:35,650
like content submissions well rules

00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:38,500
modules perfect for that it shouldn't be

00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:41,440
used as an excuse to avoid writing some

00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:45,010
clean custom PHP code that does that one

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,360
condition like it shouldn't be used as a

00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:49,270
fallback were doing things in a much

00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:51,610
more clean way so only add it if you

00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:55,690
need it and your requirements are

00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:58,510
driving it so this is what we're trying

00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:00,340
to avoid as well as another image of

00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:04,300
what we might create if we're not

00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:06,120
careful so this is somebody to the scale

00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:08,920
model of the Homer car from The Simpsons

00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:11,410
so I know if anyone seems everyone seen

00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,150
this episode but Homer finds his brother

00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,500
who happens to own a car company he lets

00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,640
him design a car and doesn't check in

00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,670
with them about what he's actually

00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,780
adding to the car and the car is so

00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:22,870
expensive to build it ends up

00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,730
bankrupting his company so it's got a

00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:26,380
lot of cool features I would I would

00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:28,449
love a bubble to sit in on the back of

00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:31,120
my car and a giant horn and you know

00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:33,250
giant spoiler but those aren't all

00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,230
necessary you know a much plainer car

00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,910
can get you from point A to point B and

00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,560
if that's all we really need to do

00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,910
was get from point A to point B we don't

00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:45,430
we don't need everything that saying

00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:48,490
brings with us so next step is data

00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:51,250
structures so you know our architecture

00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:52,780
data structures complexity that's

00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:55,270
something that software engineers think

00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,740
about all the time so they spend a lot

00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:58,660
of time planning before they start

00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,880
writing code and I feel like with site

00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,970
building we've suffered that dress BL

00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,710
and listing out a half dozen modules

00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:07,510
it's really quick and easy to just start

00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:10,600
adding complexity really really quickly

00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:13,360
so is there's no measure twice cut once

00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,070
there's a lot of just cut cut cut cut

00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,670
cut cut cut until you have a slice it

00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:21,400
works and so thinking about data

00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:23,260
structures is is another spot where I

00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,660
feel like here is we're planning serves

00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:30,490
you the best so what do we mean by data

00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:32,530
structures in Drupal so first of all we

00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:34,180
have a problem here and it's apparently

00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,950
the hardest problem in computer science

00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,900
so we're not alone in trying to solve

00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:40,540
this problem is we need to figure out a

00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:42,010
naming system luckily with Drupal and

00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,440
especially Drupal 8 we don't need to

00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:47,710
worry too much about cache invalidation

00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,600
but naming things still is you know is

00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:51,820
the cross to bear for the site builders

00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:54,280
in the room and actually more so than

00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,540
the module builders because we're naming

00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,470
a whole lot of things when we're site

00:18:55,540 --> 00:19:01,510
building so this is how a site builder

00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:03,490
thinks about data they think about

00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:06,010
adding fields they think about content

00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:09,280
types they're adding a lot of data

00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:10,930
structures this you know normally and

00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,270
historically no software development

00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:15,190
used to be the developer the developer

00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:17,500
was sitting here writing my sequel

00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:20,470
tables they were looking at it from from

00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:22,750
this angle which is you know it is it an

00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:24,190
it is you know is it long text like

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:26,710
they're really thinking about this at a

00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:28,630
fundamental deep way and we've got

00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:30,460
checkboxes we've got autocomplete fields

00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:32,890
we can add these like we can add ten of

00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,870
them in five minutes so we're plowing

00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:37,330
forward at 100 miles an hour and we're

00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:39,250
not sitting here I mean this is slow to

00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:40,510
create this so you have to be more

00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,060
deliberate about it just because the

00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:45,960
process is slow but you know not so with

00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:49,270
adding fields and adding content types

00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:50,110
so there's a lot of data structures in

00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:54,160
Drupal

00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:56,410
and content types is the most important

00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,200
one so content types has been with us

00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:00,580
for I don't know it was there and Drupal

00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,549
for that was the first version of Drupal

00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:06,040
i worked with i'm guessing content types

00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:08,470
preceded preceded drupal for by a number

00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,120
of versions as well and so content types

00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:12,549
what we need to think of as we're

00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:15,160
stacking them up is do they have a good

00:20:12,549 --> 00:20:17,350
name does that name makes sense for now

00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,940
does that name continue to make sense in

00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,650
the way that content type gets used over

00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:24,790
time or should we rename it to make it

00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:26,290
more clear field same rule applies here

00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,330
do we want to share fields across

00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:29,740
content types do we want them to have

00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:31,720
the same name or do we want to create

00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:34,480
new unique fields for the content types

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,309
do one of prefix our field names with

00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,950
that content type name so it's obvious

00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:41,799
both in the database and in the end the

00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:43,809
content type that that field you know

00:20:41,799 --> 00:20:46,299
when we're adding it from a view we know

00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:47,590
which content type it belongs to so as

00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:49,150
you're adding these things you really

00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:51,640
need to think deliberately about how the

00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:53,290
whole system works a lot of times we

00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,549
fall into that same trap we're bolting

00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,900
something on here we're bolting

00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:58,000
something on here we're both teams at

00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,490
something on down here and there's no

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,570
sort of overall like consistency in

00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:07,720
terms of what's getting filled taxonomy

00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:11,470
as well it can be really complicated or

00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,150
really simple and it helps a lot to have

00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,770
this all figured out before you start

00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:16,720
building it out you know you can fall

00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:18,370
into the trap where you have to taxonomy

00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,530
zon your site have really similar

00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:22,630
content but they differ by like two or

00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:24,460
three terms so you really need to think

00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:26,320
about this upfront you need to name it

00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:28,690
in a way that makes sense to both the

00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,100
backend content administrator as well as

00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:32,940
a future site builder that's going to

00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:36,460
come into the site and try to fix things

00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:40,360
menus as well this is we're storing data

00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:41,950
and we're we need to think about is each

00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,929
submenu going to be breaking off and

00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:46,059
just broken off into its own menu to

00:21:43,929 --> 00:21:47,500
support our theme does that make the

00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:50,380
most sense when you're administering

00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,250
that site later on as a site builder so

00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,380
you really need to think about

00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:55,929
deliberately about when you're adding a

00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:59,620
menu how you're adding a menu how how

00:21:55,929 --> 00:22:02,260
the menu is named and how it's stored in

00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:03,700
the in the database so because we have

00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,679
the ability to create these things so

00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,480
quickly sometimes we don't do it as in

00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:13,779
as a deliberate fashion as we could be

00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:15,039
doing it so upstarts I first did the

00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:17,320
talk similar to this a couple of years

00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,330
ago and I thought it was funny then to

00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:22,179
call these modules upstarts but you'll

00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:24,190
understand why in a minute so so flag

00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:28,000
and flag like modules have probably been

00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:30,639
around for five or six years but they

00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,350
kind of changed the way you were able to

00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:35,580
build Drupal sites so in older versions

00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:39,190
of Drupal like drupal five and before

00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:41,470
content types were really it in terms of

00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:44,289
places to store things so people would

00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:47,980
rely on content types for everything and

00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:49,570
all of a sudden in Drupal 7 especially

00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,730
we started to get a lot of other places

00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,830
to store things and modules that could

00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:55,779
could change our storage module so

00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:59,049
flagons like like modules what does lie

00:22:55,779 --> 00:23:00,610
to do is just take an on-off checkbox on

00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:02,950
that content type you can do the same

00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:04,570
thing in a field but what you want to

00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:06,940
think about is do I need to add another

00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:09,760
module to do what I can do in a boolean

00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:11,139
field like maybe not and you need to

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,620
think about your own site in terms of

00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:16,950
whether or not that makes sense

00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:19,779
reference fields we just got a whole

00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:22,510
whole other way to knit complexity into

00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:25,029
our site so we all this isn't me to

00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:26,950
start thinking about it's this content

00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:28,840
type just a pseudo content type and does

00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:32,080
it store data that's only linked to from

00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:35,260
other content types and you can go down

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,059
a huge chain of references that require

00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:39,519
references that require references and

00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:41,679
it might take somebody like a couple of

00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:44,649
hours to unpick all those deep deep

00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:45,940
references within your site so you know

00:23:44,649 --> 00:23:48,100
it's another thing you need to go into

00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,899
really deliberately and think about the

00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,389
storage and is there a better way to

00:23:49,899 --> 00:23:54,250
store this do I even need to reference

00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:58,240
this content here and I just have views

00:23:54,250 --> 00:24:00,940
do the reference work for me feel the

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,100
field groups are is another way to

00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,019
organize content so it's kind of an

00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,519
alternative to references like maybe

00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:07,659
these fields can be available on this

00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:09,519
content type and I don't need to

00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:11,380
reference them elsewhere so you should

00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,600
be thinking deliberately about how my

00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:16,600
contents getting stored how my content

00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,049
is getting used and what's that going to

00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,019
mean long

00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:22,960
term for my sight so I'm just a sort of

00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:24,669
side track for a minute here a lot of

00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,799
the meat of this presentation came from

00:24:24,669 --> 00:24:28,149
inheriting a lot of sites and just

00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,519
building a whole lot of sites at chapter

00:24:28,149 --> 00:24:33,249
3 we sometimes launch two or three sites

00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:35,259
a month and so you know there's there's

00:24:33,249 --> 00:24:37,179
a lot of a lot ability to experiment and

00:24:35,259 --> 00:24:39,190
see what works long-term what doesn't

00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:42,220
work long-term and what we've noticed is

00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:44,769
is every time somebody tries to save a

00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:46,840
day's worth of work on the site building

00:24:44,769 --> 00:24:49,299
phase they created two weeks worth of

00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,889
work in the maintenance side and I did I

00:24:49,299 --> 00:24:52,539
didn't always like early in my drupal

00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:54,220
career get exposed to that because a lot

00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:56,499
of times I built a site for a client I

00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:58,330
said here you go here's your site and

00:24:56,499 --> 00:25:00,730
then that was it I didn't really know

00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:02,590
long-term how easy that site was to

00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:04,470
maintain or not and you know we're

00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:06,879
working with distributions working with

00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:08,379
moderate modules like panels a lot of

00:25:06,879 --> 00:25:10,539
times you can work really quickly in the

00:25:08,379 --> 00:25:12,129
site building phase and that's good to a

00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:14,679
certain extent but you need to think in

00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:18,399
terms of long-term how easy is this site

00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:21,840
going to be to maintain so filled

00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:25,330
collections is another one that just

00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:28,570
spidering complexity once again build

00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:30,609
collections allow you to have an entity

00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:32,350
that's referenced from your content type

00:25:30,609 --> 00:25:33,970
so we don't need to store a separate

00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,859
content type we're going to just have

00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:38,499
entities attached to our content types

00:25:35,859 --> 00:25:39,669
and this all sounds well and good when

00:25:38,499 --> 00:25:41,590
you're building the site when you're

00:25:39,669 --> 00:25:43,659
clicking checkboxes when you're working

00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:46,450
really quickly and everything seems to

00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:48,309
be going smoothly and then three months

00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:50,409
down the road somebody says you know

00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:52,899
what we want to translate that site and

00:25:50,409 --> 00:25:55,119
you start to realize that the

00:25:52,899 --> 00:25:57,039
translation interface it doesn't really

00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:58,929
take field collections into account you

00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,809
know field collections are a new edge

00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:04,149
case it's not part of Drupal core and so

00:26:01,809 --> 00:26:05,739
all of a sudden we have one system that

00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:07,690
doesn't know about another system and

00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:11,169
we're doing a lot of work to make the to

00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:14,109
talk to each other so we say half an

00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:15,580
hour in the site building phase and we

00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:18,700
ended up adding three weeks where the

00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,929
work in the bug fixing phase so you've

00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,210
got to you've got to think in terms of

00:26:19,929 --> 00:26:24,340
that you know do I really need this

00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:26,950
module just because it exists just

00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:28,830
because drush dl module name takes me 30

00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:35,159
seconds is it really worth adding it to

00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:36,360
site so in another data structure you

00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:38,279
know when you're talking about

00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:41,850
programming they're always talking about

00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:43,830
this so in Drupal we've got our own way

00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:46,169
to store let's you know like i said

00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:47,820
drupal purely on the site building side

00:26:46,169 --> 00:26:49,380
we could build almost any piece of

00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,720
software if we had enough time and

00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:54,299
enough people with high enough pain

00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:56,940
threshold for clicking checkboxes but

00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:59,010
with no queues and draggable views we

00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,269
can order the content on our site we can

00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:02,010
store that order and then we can use

00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:05,549
that store to order wherever else we

00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:07,679
want to on the site and so once again we

00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:09,480
have information that's crucial to the

00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:12,000
display of our site that's stored and is

00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,950
separate data structure so how we use

00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,919
that data how it's stored that's all

00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:18,330
important and we want to make sure that

00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,440
picking between these two options that

00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,899
were comfortable with how it's being

00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,029
stored and second of all that is it

00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:26,639
really crucially important or with a

00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:28,980
simple um you know that promoted field

00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:30,690
is feeling lonely it's been there and

00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,730
Drupal forever and people don't always

00:27:30,690 --> 00:27:34,289
use it when that maybe that's all they

00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:35,610
needed was to promote the one item to

00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:37,590
the top of the list we didn't have to

00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:44,909
add a whole module to add that one

00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:46,260
feature so I had a co-worker who did a

00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:48,090
whole presentation about the bike

00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:51,570
building smells so I wanted to give a

00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:54,600
shout out to did this as a way to when

00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:56,399
you're inheriting a site begin to tell

00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,590
you know what kind of site is it and

00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,649
what kind of shape is it in this comes

00:27:58,590 --> 00:28:03,450
from code smells when people do code

00:28:01,649 --> 00:28:05,429
reviews they talk about code smells so

00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,080
it's like it's just like tinkle you get

00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:08,669
on the back of your neck when you're

00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,860
reading through the code and you're like

00:28:08,669 --> 00:28:12,480
something's wrong here you know that

00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:14,580
there's there's something wrong in the

00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,639
universe and you start to get this sense

00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:19,110
of like it's not quite right and so this

00:28:17,639 --> 00:28:20,549
is people trying to put their thumb on

00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:22,230
it like this is what made me

00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:23,970
uncomfortable this is what maybe start

00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:26,190
to start to question the quality of this

00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:27,750
code and so I've got some things that

00:28:26,190 --> 00:28:30,539
allow you to do that when you're

00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:33,269
inheriting a site as well so these come

00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:34,980
straight from our site audit we do a lot

00:28:33,269 --> 00:28:37,830
of site audits on new customers we're

00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:39,210
bringing on at chapter three and so

00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:41,370
these questions come straight from our

00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,269
site audit and we try to use these to

00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:44,700
get like a

00:28:42,269 --> 00:28:46,349
a flag of this needs more attention we

00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:48,330
need to dig in more here and figure out

00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:51,239
what's going on so the number of

00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:53,249
vocabularies like if I see a site with

00:28:51,239 --> 00:28:55,169
50 vocabulary I'm going to start asking

00:28:53,249 --> 00:28:58,080
a lot of questions really quickly like

00:28:55,169 --> 00:29:00,209
what what is so crucial that it needs to

00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,799
be powered by taxonomy in here or did

00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:03,479
this person not even know that content

00:29:01,799 --> 00:29:05,879
types existed and they use taxonomy for

00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:07,409
everything so you got to start asking a

00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:09,659
lot of questions if there's a huge

00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:11,389
number of vocabularies and then you

00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:13,919
start looking into them and you realize

00:29:11,389 --> 00:29:15,479
you know this has the same content as

00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,309
this other one did they just recreate

00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:18,599
this one because they didn't get and

00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:21,119
didn't know how to reference the other

00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:23,700
one like if you start seeing a big

00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:27,239
complexity and a big number it's like

00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,769
you've gotta start asking questions with

00:29:27,239 --> 00:29:32,099
content types it's the same kind of

00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:33,899
questions apply so how many individual

00:29:32,099 --> 00:29:36,359
content types are there if I see a list

00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:38,099
of 50 or 60 content types you know

00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:39,989
that's that's usually a big head

00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:42,869
scratcher like most Drupal sites I've

00:29:39,989 --> 00:29:44,669
seen can get by with like 10 to 20 and

00:29:42,869 --> 00:29:47,789
you know sometimes you can get by with a

00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:49,379
lot less than that and then when you go

00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:51,479
into the content type you know does it

00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:53,399
have 50 fields on a single content type

00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:55,229
you know are they using a module that

00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:57,690
you know to control the access to those

00:29:55,229 --> 00:30:00,929
fields instead of just separating those

00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:02,519
objects to separate content types did

00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:04,769
the lines between the content types make

00:30:02,519 --> 00:30:06,749
sense like a lot of times when you go in

00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:08,639
you're auditing the site you go into the

00:30:06,749 --> 00:30:11,070
database you realize that only two

00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:13,229
copies of a lot of content types like

00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:15,119
only two nodes were ever created for

00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:17,309
that content type so it's like was did

00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,869
that content type just was it a relic of

00:30:17,309 --> 00:30:20,099
when somebody was doing some tests

00:30:18,869 --> 00:30:23,249
during the site building phase of the

00:30:20,099 --> 00:30:25,409
project so so I'm always asking these

00:30:23,249 --> 00:30:27,509
questions is like you know why is this

00:30:25,409 --> 00:30:29,099
here what purpose does it serve is it

00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:31,919
even displayed anywhere in the site or

00:30:29,099 --> 00:30:37,259
is it just a relic of developers past

00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:40,079
and then then the last one is a lot

00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:41,669
harder a lot more opinion and that's the

00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:43,289
thing about this whole presentation is

00:30:41,669 --> 00:30:45,749
there's a lot of strong opinion here

00:30:43,289 --> 00:30:48,539
which is that you know what like every

00:30:45,749 --> 00:30:51,599
module I listed in that first special

00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:54,479
cases section serves a valid purpose on

00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:55,740
a production site for someone and serves

00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:57,330
them really well

00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,429
otherwise it wouldn't exist it wouldn't

00:30:57,330 --> 00:31:02,280
be maintained it would have died on the

00:30:59,429 --> 00:31:03,480
vine a long time ago so this is where

00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:05,970
you start to ask these like big

00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,679
questions it's like does it all make

00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:09,540
sense does it seem like it was done

00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,800
deliberately by somebody was really

00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:12,960
thinking about what they were doing or

00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,210
was it done on accident over three years

00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,160
and ten different developers and so you

00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:20,010
when you're looking at a site you need

00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:21,240
to you need to look at whether or not

00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:23,309
you know if I was building this from

00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:26,550
scratch today is always like you know

00:31:23,309 --> 00:31:28,140
hindsight's always 2020 but you know is

00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:29,730
there a way that this could be done

00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:31,320
better is there a way that I can spend

00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:34,429
two days right now and clean this all up

00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:39,570
and make it better for the next person

00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:41,250
so coming up to the next section so you

00:31:39,570 --> 00:31:44,100
know when your software developer

00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:46,110
documentation is not optional you know

00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:48,360
you're gonna you're going to fail your

00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:50,280
first code review if you didn't provide

00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:52,650
any documentation with the code that

00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,179
you're writing and unfortunately for the

00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:56,460
world of site builders it seems like

00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:58,770
documentation kind of is optional you

00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:00,030
know you're not doing standard

00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:01,740
documentation where you like you're

00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:04,200
doing a word doc that you attach to the

00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:06,600
site and there's a lot of opportunities

00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:10,530
for documentation you know within Drupal

00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:12,900
that are also being miss ignored you

00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:17,570
know bypassed so I'm going to step

00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:20,190
through some of those right now so

00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:22,860
everyone here is probably seen this

00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,480
screen it's rare that you build a Drupal

00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:27,420
site and you use the content types that

00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,429
are provided to you so a show of hands

00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:33,540
how many people fill out that second

00:32:29,429 --> 00:32:35,309
massive field on here so we got like

00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,950
half the room and that's probably based

00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:41,340
on what I've seen you know what you

00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:43,260
usually get so you get a nice huge text

00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:45,870
area here where you could write a novel

00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:47,070
about what was in your head the moment

00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:49,140
you click this button and started

00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:51,530
creating this content type and a lot of

00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:55,140
times you're lucky to get one line in

00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:58,050
here and you know the thing is is you're

00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,490
not doing this just for the person

00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,960
coming after you you're not just doing

00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:02,490
this for your boss when he's going

00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,130
through and reviewing your work you're

00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,809
doing this for you two days later when

00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,810
you can't even remember which section of

00:33:06,809 --> 00:33:09,700
the site you are working

00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:12,070
on and you know where you left it

00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:14,680
because all of a sudden you know you're

00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:16,540
tapping into your own own brain from the

00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:18,820
past and you know the same rules that

00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:20,890
apply to software development apply here

00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:22,270
whereas great documentation is going to

00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:24,490
make it a lot clearer when you need to

00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:25,930
work on it again and you know every

00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:28,030
developer that inherits the site after

00:33:25,930 --> 00:33:30,520
you is going to thank you for taking the

00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:33,520
30 seconds to type out you know a little

00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:36,490
line of text here so that's the content

00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:39,430
type screen so unfortunately taxonomy

00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:41,410
gets a little bit of shorter description

00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:43,300
you're going to have to wordsmith it a

00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:47,440
little bit but you can you can still

00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:48,970
have a non-optional field I you know

00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,790
this makes me think I should just write

00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:55,630
a contributor of these description

00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:57,670
fields required but you know so it says

00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:59,080
an optional field i could probably get

00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:01,000
turned this into a text area as well

00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,150
that sounds like a good project for the

00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,560
rest of the week but we can still give a

00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:07,390
little bit of information here and we

00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:09,340
should any time we have the option to

00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:13,090
give a little bit of information we

00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:14,680
should provide that information so menus

00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:17,350
we get a nice big description field

00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,640
again but once again it's optional so we

00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:21,550
can leave it blank and we can still

00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:22,600
press submit and never know what was in

00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:26,920
the person's head when they were

00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:28,540
creating that mindia block we get a tiny

00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:31,150
description you know but this one

00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:33,070
actually shows up a lot so you know on

00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:35,740
that block listing page this information

00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:38,680
is hugely important and if you weren't

00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:40,420
really careful about your title which

00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:42,010
you know a lot of times on the title is

00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,020
being shown to the user so you don't

00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:46,270
have a lot of room for you know

00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,950
exposition there so that description it

00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:50,080
might be the only way you can actually

00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:52,120
explain to the person using the site

00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:54,450
what this block about so use it

00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:58,420
carefully make sure it's filled out and

00:34:54,450 --> 00:35:00,460
you know think about yourself when

00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:02,350
you're going back to the site and you're

00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,520
being asked to disable the block and you

00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,050
have to click through the configure

00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:08,950
settings for ten different blocks to

00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:11,050
figure out which one to disable and so

00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:12,820
this is one I was joking with a

00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:14,770
co-worker I didn't actually know this

00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:18,040
existed so I'm just as guilty of this as

00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:20,230
anybody in this room so in views buried

00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:21,250
you know a level deep on that right-hand

00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:23,290
column

00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:24,970
is we have a nice big comment section

00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:27,490
for a view and we can fill that out and

00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:30,550
I feel like more than the content types

00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:32,320
more than anything else views a lot of

00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:34,150
times or real head-scratchers in terms

00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,920
of why was this creative what does this

00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:38,350
do which section of the cyclist is

00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,750
applied to how come this view has

00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:42,310
multiple displays how comes there's this

00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:45,220
other view that seems to do the same

00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:46,930
thing but it's not used as a display so

00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:49,510
views there's a lot of things you can

00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:52,510
write about and a lot of information you

00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:54,310
can provide here but it's definitely not

00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:56,770
front and center and super easy to

00:35:54,310 --> 00:36:03,490
forget and accept when you're initially

00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:04,960
creating the view with the Builder so to

00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:09,340
wrap things up on some time for

00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:11,530
questions conclusion is we want to add

00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:14,170
complexity deliberately so every time

00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:16,210
we're going we're clicking we're finding

00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:18,280
a new module we need to do that for a

00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:21,190
reason so we're not adding a module

00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:24,310
we're not using a distro blindly we're

00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:25,540
using it because we want everything that

00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:29,620
it offers and we're going to use

00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:31,390
everything that it offers and we want to

00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,810
name things carefully and this is

00:36:31,390 --> 00:36:37,000
probably the most important which is

00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:40,300
those concept content type names those

00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,380
block names those field names those if

00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,180
you're going to not fill out that

00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:45,880
description that's the only way point

00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,920
the next person has like this was

00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:50,380
prefixed with that name so it obviously

00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,270
refers to that section of the site so

00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:54,220
think about how you're naming things

00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:55,780
have a plan before you start creating

00:36:54,220 --> 00:37:00,160
things for how you're going to name them

00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:03,010
and comment liberally so every time you

00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,150
see a text area to start typing in it

00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,710
you know when you're in the back of the

00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:07,600
Drupal it's just getting shared it's not

00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:09,190
getting shown to the users but you're

00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,780
just leaving notes for yourself you're

00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:13,540
leaving notes for the next developer on

00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:16,780
how the site was built why the site was

00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:18,460
built the way it was and you know what

00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,840
you were thinking you know what what was

00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:26,640
going on in your head while all that was

00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:26,640
happening so that's it any questions

00:37:30,309 --> 00:37:36,479
nope alright thank you for coming out

00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:36,479
