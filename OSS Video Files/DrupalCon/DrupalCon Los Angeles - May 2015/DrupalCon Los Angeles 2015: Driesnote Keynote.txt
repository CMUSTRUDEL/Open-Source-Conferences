00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:40,110
community that builds and promotes

00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,970
Drupal that's our job and really what

00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,909
that means is that we recognize that you

00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:47,579
power Drupal so it's our job to empower

00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:50,460

00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:23,110
to miss it also coffee apparently you

00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,750
like it I want to let you know that

00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,669
there is paid coffee all day in the 300

00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,680
aisle of the exhibit hall and there is a

00:06:27,669 --> 00:06:31,630
free sponsored coffee break at

00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,280
ten-fifteen this morning so thanks to

00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,440
iso vera and siteground for making that

00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,450
happen they are sponsoring those coffee

00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:42,720
breaks today tomorrow and thursday at

00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:42,720
ten-fifteen yes applause for coffee

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:49,450
Wi-Fi here is the access and if you see

00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,070
any drupal association staff around

00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:54,190
today they also have it printed across

00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:56,740
their backs so just be like hey nice to

00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,930
meet you could you turn around you'll

00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,370
get the password also if you are in this

00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,840
room right now one of the things that we

00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:03,610
do that's amazing about drupalcon is

00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,340
that we record every session and make it

00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:09,040
available practically immediately online

00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:11,290
it will be much more difficult for us to

00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,550
do that we have to live stream the

00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:14,080
keynote but it'll be much more difficult

00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:16,600
for us to do that if you are currently

00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:19,120
sucking the Wi-Fi dead with your mifi

00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:22,890
devices so if you could turn those off

00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:28,180
that would be amazing thank you so much

00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:30,729
ok and food lunch options if you are a

00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:32,590
vegetarian you can pick up your food at

00:07:30,729 --> 00:07:34,870
lunch in the main buffet lines in the

00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,460
exhibit hall if you're vegan or you have

00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,860
another special meal you have your own

00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:41,080
buffet station and if you just decide

00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,790

00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:48,910
vegans food don't make them starve ok so

00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:50,410
if you're not vegan halal or have other

00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:53,500

please alright couple of schedule

00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:56,480
changes that I think we need to get

00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:59,360
through today from five to

00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,430
6pm room 518 the core conversation is

00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,010
now going to be constructive conflict

00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:07,610
resolution with Donna Benjamin I'll see

00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:10,280
you there it's on my schedule and in the

00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:12,830

00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,620
drupal org will be at 122 p.m. today now

00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:19,570
instead of 2 15 to 3 15 so if you've got

00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,570
your schedules out jot those notes down

00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:24,890
code of conduct this is probably my the

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,490
reason that i love the triple community

00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:30,170
so much is that we value we value our

00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:33,919
commitment to each other we value

00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:36,530
inclusivity we value transparency we

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:39,530
just really respect one another and our

00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:41,180
code of conduct is part of that so let's

00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:44,480

00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:09,390
speaker the reason why we're all here

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:13,050
today the founder of Drupal and project

00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:28,380
lead co-founder and CTO of aquia trees

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:30,660
by tart whoo good morning everybody um

00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:32,340
was actually just like as I was

00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:34,050
listening was trying to figure out how

00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:37,260
many of these Drupal cons have been too

00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:40,470
and I think it's number 23 and so this

00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:43,320
is my 23rd keynotes you know which i

00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:47,930
think is pretty exciting so i'll be

00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,930
talking about um let's see if it works

00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,990
not sure if it work it there we go sorry

00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:57,089
about that i'll be giving another state

00:15:54,990 --> 00:16:00,540
of drupal but before I do I wanted to

00:15:57,089 --> 00:16:04,890
take a minute and you know think about

00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:07,630
Aaron wind-borne work oops yeah okay

00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:11,230
Aaron wind-borne who unfortunately

00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:14,950
lost his battle with ALS for those that

00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:17,080
don't you know no Aaron he was a very

00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:20,650
well respected contributor it was a

00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:23,070
friend of many of us and really a role

00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:25,450
model for many of us in the community

00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:28,720
and so one of the things that we've

00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:31,600
decided to do is that the community

00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,730
working group created a new program in a

00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,400
wart which we will call the Aaron

00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:38,020
wind-borne Awards which we every year we

00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,900
will give to somebody in the Drupal

00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:45,880
community that we believe represents our

00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:49,650
values and basically you know is a great

00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:53,260
asset to us and so we'll do that in

00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:55,900
respect of Aaron and if you want you can

00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:58,240
start nominating people there's a little

00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:00,190
bit more information on drupal.org so

00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:06,660
please check it out and nominate other

00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:09,400
people for these awards alright so today

00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:12,100
I'll be talking about a number of

00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,380
different things really one of the

00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:16,150
things that I realized is as well as

00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,459
traveling run into world and I was

00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:20,560
telling some of the stories about the

00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:22,329
history of Drupal I kind of noticed that

00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:24,939
many people didn't know those stories

00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:27,160
and so what I want to do today we spent

00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:30,100
some time retelling some of these

00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:32,230
stories and I think it's important to

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,670
help us reinforce the culture and and

00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,620
some of the things that we've gone

00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:38,590
through two to help everybody in this

00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:41,080
room understand where we came from in

00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:43,000
addition to that I'll also be talking

00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,280
about the future in Drupal 8 i'll give

00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,920
you an update on where we're at as well

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,270
as some other things and so some of you

00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,540
may have heard me talk about some of

00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:54,160
these things but i'm going to try to new

00:17:52,540 --> 00:18:00,990
elements to it and going to make it

00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:04,060
interesting for everybody all right so i

00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:05,800
think it was about nine months ago and i

00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:09,100
was in brussels and i went to this hotel

00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,690
if you have a meeting you know with a

00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,850
potential drupal user and so it's a

00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,710
little early to this meeting and so i

00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:16,360
decided to walk around a little bit in

00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,580
this amazing lobby actually and what I

00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,720
saw was quite interesting on the wall

00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:23,340
there was this little photo

00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,950
and it turns out that many many years

00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:28,080
ago it would organize conferences at

00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:29,670
this hotel in Brussels I said they took

00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,680
they put up a photo of the people that

00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:33,750
attended a conference and so as i was

00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:35,520
looking at this photograph and some of

00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:38,630
the names of the people at this

00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:41,820
conference i was actually quite amazed

00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:45,420
it was amazed by the fact that all these

00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:47,610
people kind of lift in the same a little

00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:50,910
time frame like in my mind that was

00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:52,320
maybe more spread out i was also amazed

00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:55,620
by the fact that they would all come

00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,990
together instead of maybe going off on

00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,480
their own or inventing some of these

00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:01,740
things on their own and then if you

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,770
think about it these people came

00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:06,960
together in Brussels they each invented

00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:08,910
some really truly amazing things things

00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:11,220
that save the lives of millions of

00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:14,310
people you know things that evolved into

00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:16,230
multi-billion dollar businesses on you

00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:18,450
know y'all came together and so I no

00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:22,290
means i no means I'm trying to compare

00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:24,900
ourselves to these people by no means

00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:26,580
but as i was looking at this photo it

00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:28,170
kind of struck me like the way we come

00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,360
together and the way we make connections

00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:32,490
between people as definitely cause some

00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,980
really cool things to happen and so I'd

00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:39,600
like to talk a little bit about that

00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:41,700
today as many of you know I started the

00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,790
Drupal project in my dorm room in

00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:47,790
Antwerp in 2000's and I wouldn't have

00:19:44,790 --> 00:19:50,610
been able to do so it wasn't for the

00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:52,260
work of some other great people like the

00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:54,420
ones that you can see here that you know

00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:57,260
eventually ended up creating a lamp

00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:00,510
stack and so the lamp stack was born and

00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:02,520
really allowed me to get started with

00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:04,980
Drupal and so my initial plan was to

00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,410
create a quick message board so me my

00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,930
friends could share messages but very

00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:12,660
quickly this message board evolved into

00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:15,480
an experimental platform like I was

00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:17,700
interested in the weapon I would you

00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,730
know look at emerging trends and or

00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:22,110
incorporate these in Drupal and so

00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:29,070
within a year actually we did three

00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:32,070
major versions of Drupal very mellow

00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:34,370
behind the three major versions of

00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:38,100
Drupal in one year

00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:39,929
and as you can see from the slides there

00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,210
is some really fundamental things that

00:20:39,929 --> 00:20:44,610
we added early early on in the lifetime

00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:46,679
of Drupal and some of these things like

00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:48,539
blogs weren't called blogs at the time

00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:50,250
we would call them public Diaries and

00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:52,470
people started to use the internet to

00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:55,049
share you know diaries of mine and later

00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:57,720
he became blogging or RSS feeds I was on

00:20:55,049 --> 00:21:00,330
the mailing list where RSS feeds were

00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,130
invented and I you know I don't take any

00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:04,950
credit for that but I was there lurking

00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:10,230
and it would implement RSS feeds in

00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:12,419
Drupal and so one of the things that I

00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:14,159
started to do is I really want to have

00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:17,159
people use Drupal and so it would

00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:20,279
effectively reach out to people and

00:21:17,159 --> 00:21:23,009
before i started with drupal i was into

00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,809
the linux kernel I considered

00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:26,490
contributed a little bit to the Linux

00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:30,330
kernel and so I would follow a website

00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:33,240
which was called a kernel trap and a

00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:37,139
girl trap was managed by you know Jeremy

00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:39,299
Andrews and at the time linux and the

00:21:37,139 --> 00:21:42,179
linux kernel was a very hot topic when

00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:44,580
everybody wanted to read about it and so

00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:46,409
what Jeremy would do is he would

00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,389
basically you know listen in on the

00:21:46,409 --> 00:21:50,039
colonel mailing list and it would take

00:21:48,389 --> 00:21:53,370
interesting conversation and woodblock

00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:55,230
about it and so / dots I don't know how

00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:59,519
many people know / do you know sliced up

00:21:55,230 --> 00:22:00,870
a lot of people do but you know back in

00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,840
the day there was something called the

00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:07,080
slashdot effect so this was in a time

00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,019
where you know dealing with unexpected

00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:12,299
traffic spikes or hosting it wasn't what

00:22:10,019 --> 00:22:15,120
it is today and so every time somebody

00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:17,519
got on slashdot you know the site we

00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:20,639
typically go down and so they call this

00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:22,200
the / la effect or if you say it didn't

00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:24,350
go down and people usually ended up with

00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,299
a hosting bill of thousands of dollars

00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:30,029
so this big thing at the time and so

00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:32,759
every time Jeremy got on slashdot he

00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:36,269
site went down and so he was using

00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:38,700
something called php-nuke or PHP post

00:22:36,269 --> 00:22:42,090
nuke i believe and so I emailed Jeremy

00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:44,870
and I said you know you should really

00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:47,820
convert your website through Drupal and

00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:50,130
here's a screenshot of that email

00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:53,280
actually this is the original email and

00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:58,710
I used pine back in the day or does that

00:22:53,280 --> 00:23:01,470
remember pine and I basically said if

00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:07,080
you convert your website to Drupal it

00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:09,150
will never crash again and and to close

00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,670
the deal I offered you concede here are

00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:14,340
offered to give him access admin access

00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:16,500
to my own website you know which was

00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:19,260
based on Drupal and so I offer that up

00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:25,470
to him and I did and this is this is

00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:30,990
what it looked like at the time so this

00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:35,340
was Drupal around 2002 I think of course

00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:36,900
that sealed the deal was very pretty for

00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,030
those that were around you may remember

00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:41,880
like all these admin links what we did

00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:45,570
is we sorted the admin links by module

00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:47,520
name and so things like information

00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:49,740
architecture usability was it was

00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,780
basically non existing and so you know

00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,570
Jeremy did convert his website to Drupal

00:23:51,780 --> 00:24:02,100
and of course the first time he ends up

00:23:54,570 --> 00:24:05,610
on slashdot the site crashed and so

00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:07,290
you're like oh but we used it as a

00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:10,290
learning point and we made some changes

00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:13,050
through Drupal I remember I improved the

00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:14,700
caching of Drupal and Jeremy took the

00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:17,010
lead in creating a module call to

00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,750
throttle module and the trottle module

00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:21,510
was cool because what he would do is it

00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:23,850
would look for spikes in traffic and

00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:26,670
then automatically disable features

00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:29,160
based on the load and so for example if

00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:31,140
the load reached level 5 we would say

00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,720
let's disable the for a module block

00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:36,420
when there and the load would reach

00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,940
level 6 we would disabled commenting all

00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:42,270
together and so you can configure all of

00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:45,120
these things and so you know next time

00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:47,040
you got on slashdot it worked and so you

00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,800
know everybody was very happy and so a

00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,980
lot of that work basically translated in

00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:55,890
you know early 2002 which became drupal

00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:59,400
4.0 and so we added a note system right

00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:01,500
away in 2002 we had a caching layer and

00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,210
then we added the trottle module

00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,480
and also he started getting all of these

00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:08,370
patches to make drupal faster including

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,070
a new taxonomy module that was more

00:25:08,370 --> 00:25:12,960
scalable turns out later that a lot of

00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:14,670
these patches came from you know

00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,520
somebody that was running an adult

00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:20,640
entertainment websites and so he had a

00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:24,870
need to take Drupal to sort of the next

00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,160
level in terms of scaling and so you

00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:29,390
know Drupal for is a lot about

00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:38,580
scalability and making it work better

00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:40,560
all right and so right and so that's

00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:43,220
pretty cool because what happened next

00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:45,360
is that Jeremy was really hooked on

00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:47,610
Drupal and ended up starting a company

00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,820
called tie guan which ended up employing

00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:52,560
a lot of our key contributors that ended

00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:54,540
up you know doing a lot of great things

00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,700
for drupal he also started drupal

00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:59,340
watchdog and all of these things so this

00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:01,200
little email that i sent and you know

00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:04,380
basically stretching the truth maybe a

00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,210
little bit has actually been a good

00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:09,150
thing because Jeremy join our community

00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:12,720
and has given back you know hundred

00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:15,030
times more and a few years ago actually

00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,880
Jeremy emailed me back that email that

00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:20,670
that's why I still have it and he said

00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:23,730
this email changed my life which is a

00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:27,210
which is kinda nice of him to do and so

00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:29,130
there's still quick lessons um the first

00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:31,290
lesson you may not like because

00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:34,110
sometimes they give presentations at

00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:35,730
other conferences about startups and how

00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:37,880
did you grow things whether it's a

00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:40,950
company or an open source project and

00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:43,980
one of the things that's key is that you

00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:46,260
have to sell and when I say sell I mean

00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,870
that in the broad sense like you have to

00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:50,520
evangelize your vision even if you're

00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:52,680
working on a patch you need to sell your

00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,470
vision for us for attached if you're

00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:57,690
working on an initiative you have to

00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:00,030
sell your vision for that initiative or

00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:02,550
even for those of us that run companies

00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:04,860
if you're recruiting you know getting

00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:07,230
people to join your company to is a form

00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:09,870
of selling as well and then once they

00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:11,429
join your company you don't need to sell

00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:14,690
them on you know where you want to go

00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:14,690
with your company so

00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:20,049
you know when I do these presentations

00:27:17,429 --> 00:27:22,870
from time to time and in I'm in a room

00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:24,970
full of engineers not unlike this and I

00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:27,880
tell them the one thing you have to

00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:30,820
learn is to sell usually like the room

00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:33,880
gets a little quiet but I do believe

00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:36,450
it's true and I also do believe it's not

00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:39,610
like pure selling it's like selling as a

00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:42,669
you know in the brats and so to speak

00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:45,340
and thence once you sold somebody the

00:27:42,669 --> 00:27:46,809
keys to make them successful like it's

00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:49,690
actually very simple growing your

00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:52,929
community is bringing people on board

00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:55,090
and then making them successful and if

00:27:52,929 --> 00:27:57,640
you do so amazing things will happen and

00:27:55,090 --> 00:28:00,399
jeremy i think is a great example and i

00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:03,490
can at least name 12 other examples of

00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:07,690
people that join our community and you

00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:09,220
know ended up doing amazing things all

00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:16,750
right so these are my first two lessons

00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:19,600
for you so by 2000 we had Drupal for and

00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:22,390
with all of these features and in many

00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:24,100
ways we were ahead of the curve like

00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:26,649
this was before you know web two point

00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:28,720
oh I think it only came in 2005 three

00:28:26,649 --> 00:28:31,419
years later and so we had a lot of these

00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,950
building blocks at the time to build

00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:34,929
dynamic websites and to build

00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:39,250
interactive websites which would later

00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:42,399
become web two point oh and so the fact

00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:45,130
that we have these features you know

00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:48,460
cause something really cool to happen so

00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:50,049
basically in 2004 Howard Dean was a

00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:53,080
presidential candidate here in the

00:28:50,049 --> 00:28:55,360
United States decided to do something

00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:58,600
very innovative and it was a first

00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:01,480
presidential candidate to use or

00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,610
leverage the internet to campaign and he

00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,679
would raise millions of dollars and it

00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:08,799
did that with something called Dean

00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:12,010
space and Dean space effectively was a

00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:14,380
Drupal distribution right and so while

00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:16,510
he was the underdog and it obviously

00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:18,820
didn't win the elections they actually

00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:22,600
got very far to the point that people

00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:24,640
said wow business game-changing this is

00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,380
game-changing to the point by the next

00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,490
presidential elections every

00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:31,720
presidential k

00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:34,030
we'll use the internet to do this and so

00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,429
Dean space was actually a very big

00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:38,470
turning point for us and we got mentions

00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:40,720
in all sorts of media like time and the

00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:44,770
Wall Street Journal and all these kinds

00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:47,350
of things also a lot of great people

00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:49,720
joined the Drupal project through Dean

00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:52,929
space and you can see some of the names

00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:54,970
here and the Rappaport's actually ended

00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:57,150
up on the board of the huffington post

00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:59,800
Thursday vid Strauss and Zach Rossum

00:29:57,150 --> 00:30:02,770
hearin was an amazing connector still

00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:05,500
today and sort of brought a lot of these

00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:08,530
people together and so even though Dean

00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:11,050
space or Harvard theme didn't win it was

00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:15,059
a great win for Drupal i beez people

00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:19,270
joint and now some great things happened

00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:22,030
alright so then and the Rapoport who is

00:30:19,270 --> 00:30:25,570
also an investor he said you know I like

00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:29,050
this idea and I think we need to invest

00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:31,510
in this Dean space idea and we decided

00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:33,610
to start a company or fund the team

00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:36,070
behind the in space or part of that team

00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:39,070
to create a company called civic space

00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:41,500
and the idea behind civic space was to

00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:43,150
take the Dean you know Dean space

00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:46,050
platform if you will and get it ready

00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:49,330
for the next presidential elections

00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:51,570
problem there was the next presidential

00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:53,500
elections wasn't for another four years

00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:55,620
and said it could build all of this

00:30:53,500 --> 00:31:00,520
technology but they couldn't test it and

00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:03,360
so they built this company some other

00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:07,690
great people join actually Chris Messina

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:10,150
was very active in Drupal ended up being

00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:13,690
instrumental in open ID and oh and also

00:31:10,150 --> 00:31:16,750
ended up inventing the hashtag he joined

00:31:13,690 --> 00:31:17,890
the Drupal community and basically what

00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:20,080
they said is you know it because there

00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:22,660
is no presidential election we're going

00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:27,490
to campaign for something else and so

00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:30,370
they said and at a time Mozilla which we

00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:33,190
all know basically had created Firefox

00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:35,200
and they said we're going to campaign

00:31:33,190 --> 00:31:39,820
for Firefox and they built these

00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:41,260
websites called spread Firefox they got

00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:45,220
some other people on board

00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:48,370
and they started to use Drupal and make

00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:51,940
Drupal better to promote Firefox I said

00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:53,890
it all sorts of cool things like one of

00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:55,270
the things that I that I remember is at

00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:58,240
some point is that we're going to raise

00:31:55,270 --> 00:32:00,790
fifty thousand dollars and we're going

00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,970
to use that money to buy a two page ad

00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:07,750
in The New York Times you kind of make

00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:10,450
fun at the time of you know Microsoft

00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:12,730
Internet Explorer to tell the world is a

00:32:10,450 --> 00:32:14,590
great alternative and so they did they

00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:17,410
raise fifty thousand dollars and they

00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:19,630
ended up you know promoting Firefox in

00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:22,710
the New York Times as well as in many

00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:26,590
other locations and so in many ways

00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:29,470
drupal helped you know spread Firefox

00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:36,030
and firefox become a thing like we were

00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:36,030
instrumental in getting them adoption

00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:45,400
all right and so you know here we are in

00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:48,100
space had just used rupal spread Firefox

00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:50,740
was a great success and it really kind

00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:53,860
of helped us grow as a community gave us

00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:55,570
credibility and then just like in that

00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:58,720
photo that I showed you a lot of these

00:32:55,570 --> 00:33:00,850
early adopters you are not to do many

00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:05,020
great things it's kind of amazing

00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:06,940
actually one of them ended up starting a

00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:10,120
company blue state digital and when

00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:12,340
President Obama decided to run they said

00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:14,740
I want to work with that agency because

00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:17,680
they were involved with in space and so

00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:21,190
blue state digital helped President

00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:23,380
Obama you know in the election from a

00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:24,970
you know digital point of view so all of

00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:29,260
these people are involved with Drupal

00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:30,970
which is kind of amazing and to me that

00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:33,910
is less than number three it's all about

00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:42,030
the people like attract great people and

00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:42,030
amazing things will happen all right

00:33:43,379 --> 00:33:48,629
less than four please to go back to what

00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,519
I showed you earlier it's like you know

00:33:48,629 --> 00:33:53,019
you want to recognize trends early and

00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,489
you want you know how do you attract

00:33:53,019 --> 00:33:55,929
these great people also have a great

00:33:54,489 --> 00:33:58,960
platform you know with things that

00:33:55,929 --> 00:34:00,519
people really love and so I think

00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:03,789
there's also a very important lesson

00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:06,399
there recognize trends early and embrace

00:34:03,789 --> 00:34:08,529
them and so by this time in the history

00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,960
of Drupal we really felt like we were on

00:34:08,529 --> 00:34:14,079
to something like it was kind of hard to

00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,849
believe that all of these things that

00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,460
happened and now we get some press and

00:34:15,849 --> 00:34:21,309
so we decided to organize the very first

00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:24,279
drupalcon we organized it in Antwerp

00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:26,919
where I was living at the time and we

00:34:24,279 --> 00:34:29,559
had 27 people in attendance and I

00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:32,770
remember I couldn't believe that 27

00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:35,349
people wanted to travel to enter to talk

00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:37,089
about Drupal for three days I thought it

00:34:35,349 --> 00:34:40,329
was like unheard of i thought it was

00:34:37,089 --> 00:34:42,579
crazy because for the most part that

00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:44,230
would work on it you know from home and

00:34:42,579 --> 00:34:45,730
I wouldn't really talk to my friends

00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:49,270
about it or like it was kind of like

00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:51,579
what I did and so we organized the very

00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:54,700
first drupalcon in an syrup and these

00:34:51,579 --> 00:34:57,010
people I'll travel to Antwerp to talk

00:34:54,700 --> 00:35:00,400
about Drupal at a time right away we had

00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:02,910
the node system I think it was the bet

00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:07,480
Kessel's he had created flex amount

00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:10,329
which was kind of like cck before cck an

00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:12,520
a Drupal con Antwerp we spent at least a

00:35:10,329 --> 00:35:16,150
day of the three days sort of

00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:18,160
architecting cck and so now c ck is the

00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:20,289
entity api and all of these things off

00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:24,460
if you think about it took 10 years for

00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:28,079
us to go from you know flexi no to c ck

00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:31,180
to the entity api that we know today um

00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:33,430
kind of interesting all right and so as

00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:35,859
we grew and as you know more people

00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:39,760
joined the project something else

00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:42,220
happened around in 2005 there was a big

00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,440
server meltdown and I've told this this

00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:46,690
story before as well but at the time i

00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:49,240
was running drupal adoro con a shared

00:35:46,690 --> 00:35:52,359
hosting account so one of the drupal

00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:54,250
people yet the Menace he had like a

00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:56,110
little server somewhere which on

00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:57,310
she hosted firing projects and he said

00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:59,740
yeah sure you can have a shell account

00:35:57,310 --> 00:36:03,310
you can run the drupal doric website

00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:04,870
from my shell account and so by 2005 you

00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:06,850
had so many people coming to the Drupal

00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:09,250
the doric website 2d tatto that

00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:11,650
basically the server crashed like I

00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,960
shifted a lot of my focus and Karen did

00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:18,580
the same from actually working on Drupal

00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:22,330
to you know tuning the machine but as I

00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:24,180
said at some point it just it crashed so

00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:28,180
the only thing that I could think of is

00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:33,370
to replace all of the pages on the on d

00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:35,950
dodo with like a white page and there

00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:37,960
was a donate button a paypal donate

00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:40,270
donate button and read a little bit of

00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:43,240
text like please donate some money so we

00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:45,520
can buy a bigger server because I was a

00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:46,710
student I didn't have any money and we

00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,880
did some quick back of the envelope

00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:50,920
calculations and we said it with three

00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,900
thousand dollars we can buy this huge

00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:59,200
server like you won't have to buy a

00:36:52,900 --> 00:37:01,360
server for like five years and and so if

00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,190
we replace every single page on the data

00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,920
with a blank page a donate button and

00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:10,630
something amazing happens like within 24

00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:12,190
hours people had contributed $10,000 and

00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:15,780
so I never had two thousand dollars in

00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:18,520
my life and so completely freaked out I

00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:23,590
remember changing my paypal password to

00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:27,070
be like this long paypal immediately

00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:29,530
blocked my account because for the five

00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:31,930
of you know the first five years of

00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:34,660
Drupal I got like fifty dollars over

00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:36,100
enough over five years so that and all

00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:38,950
of a sudden we get like ten thousand

00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:41,860
dollars in in two days and so we have to

00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:44,890
deal with unblocking that then something

00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:47,640
else happens Tim brave it was a CTO at

00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:50,560
Sun Microsystems systems but also

00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,730
co-invented xml by the way he emailed

00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,530
and said you know what I've been

00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:56,680
tracking Drupal it's going to cool we

00:37:53,530 --> 00:38:00,160
use it within son I just shipped you a

00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:03,460
seven thousand dollar son machine and I

00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:06,220
was like wow here we are ten thousand

00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:07,820
dollars and basically the next day a

00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:13,370
seven thousand dollar

00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:14,630
son server arrived on the curb and so we

00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:16,900
you know we ended up using this machine

00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:20,000
and you know we called it son price

00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:22,970
because it was a surprise from son it

00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:29,180
may still be used I don't know no longer

00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:32,390
use and then something else happens the

00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:34,550
OSL the open-source laps in in Portland

00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:37,040
they said you know what we can host a

00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:39,110
server for you like will give you

00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:41,480
bandwidth electricity and oh by the way

00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:44,870
we have some students they can help run

00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:47,930
it for you just ship as a server oh my

00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:49,670
growl within two days all of these

00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:51,920
things came together and so we shipped

00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:53,330
the Sun machine to Portland's and we

00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:55,190
ended up buying I think three more

00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:57,500
servers with the ten thousand dollars

00:38:55,190 --> 00:39:00,050
because we felt like it raised the money

00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,790
for server so we should use it for

00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:03,740
servers and so all of a sudden and from

00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:07,040
a little shared hosting again to dislike

00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:15,920
what looked like you know capacity for

00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:17,930
the next you know 20 years but in many

00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,610
ways this was like an amazing you know

00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:22,700
point in the history of Drupal because

00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:25,010
for the first time you could see sort of

00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:28,760
the magic of the Drupal community like

00:39:25,010 --> 00:39:31,430
how people would come together you know

00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:33,830
and chip in and really sort of do

00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:35,780
something great here and so what we did

00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:38,750
is we made this Drupal poster inspired

00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:40,340
by the spread Firefox new york times app

00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,840
which basically would list all of the

00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,940
names of the people that chipped in

00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,130
money and we would take it around the

00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:50,480
world or events and put it up as a thank

00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:54,230
you and so it's really nice and so I

00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,550
think the lesson there is you know it's

00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:58,940
all about the community if you want to

00:39:55,550 --> 00:40:02,660
go far you want to go together all right

00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:05,510
later in 2005 we all got together at OS

00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:07,310
CMS so this was kind of like a drupal

00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:10,070
kong really but we decided to invite

00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:11,750
other projects and I was like ninety

00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:14,630
percent rupal people and ten percent

00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:16,370
other people but we try to embrace them

00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:20,060
and welcome them by changing the name of

00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:21,680
our conference for one time and so Boris

00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:24,050
man and Kieran and myself

00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:26,090
we sat down on this couch in Portland

00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:28,640
and we said we need to start the drupal

00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:31,100
association we need to start the drip

00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,080
Association because I just accepted ten

00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:36,290
thousand dollars in my personal checking

00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:40,910
account and technically I have to pay

00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:43,610
income tax on that that's not cool ice

00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:47,120
in are still to date I think I voted the

00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:48,770
tax authorities income tax on that ten

00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:50,930
thousand dollars but we said really we

00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:52,790
need to organize ourselves a little bit

00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:55,220
better start an association so at least

00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:56,960
we have a checking account so we get you

00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:59,990
know taking money and use it to help

00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,330
grow Drupal and also because we didn't

00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:05,720
have any money and so this was at the

00:41:02,330 --> 00:41:07,600
Oscar orale conference o'reilly was nice

00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:09,860
enough to give us a little booth area

00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:12,290
without having to pay and they gave us

00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:15,200
literally like the boot area all the way

00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:17,540
in the corner the first away from the

00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:20,090
entrance and we didn't have any money so

00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:21,800
we couldn't afford to buy a table like

00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:23,630
you had to buy these you can boot you

00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:26,810
could buy a table you could buy carpet

00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:29,210
and so we have none of this but what's

00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:31,130
really cool is all the other booths that

00:41:29,210 --> 00:41:33,560
are really nice tables and you know

00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:35,600
whatever all these things that no people

00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:37,400
there but we had so many people in our

00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:39,440
booth and people would sit on the floors

00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:43,100
and hack and coat and you can see some

00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:45,830
of it in the photo that it really felt

00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:47,660
like all right this is this is kind of

00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:52,100
the beginning if you go of something

00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:54,260
great and so what happened next really

00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:56,720
the next few years I mean there's a lot

00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:59,840
of stories there as well but I would

00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:02,600
describe it as the era of lots of people

00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:04,850
joining you know companies being started

00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:10,460
the commercial ecosystem around Drupal

00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:13,280
was created and so you know drupalcon

00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:15,080
kept on growing and growing lots of

00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,710
great things more and more bigger users

00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:23,420
came along it's a lot of sort of

00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:26,800
expansion but at some point i think it

00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:30,380
was around Rubicon Paris we started

00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:34,499
because we had grown so much

00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:36,299
like we started like what are we we

00:42:34,499 --> 00:42:40,529
started having sort of existential

00:42:36,299 --> 00:42:43,920
questions and like are we a product are

00:42:40,529 --> 00:42:46,499
we a framework and we were kind of

00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,089
confused about that and I think that's

00:42:46,499 --> 00:42:50,700
when we started talking my things like

00:42:48,089 --> 00:42:52,710
small core and what's nice about the

00:42:50,700 --> 00:43:05,039
eiffel tower by the way that it's boda

00:42:52,710 --> 00:43:06,539
product and a framework we get it and so

00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:09,059
we started talking about this in the way

00:43:06,539 --> 00:43:11,640
that happens in my opinion from where I

00:43:09,059 --> 00:43:14,009
was sitting is when I started Drupal it

00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:15,900
was really for be by me like I was

00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:18,210
building it for myself nobody else is

00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:20,789
using it nobody else was contributing to

00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:22,739
it an animator open source and really

00:43:20,789 --> 00:43:24,989
what happened this was now by developers

00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:26,430
for developers like other people that

00:43:24,989 --> 00:43:28,829
wanted to use Drupal as their

00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:31,349
experimental platform and all of a

00:43:28,829 --> 00:43:33,630
sudden by this time there was his idea

00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:37,170
of theirs users of Drupal to like

00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:39,029
non-technical users and so they came in

00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:41,819
they started you know asking for things

00:43:39,029 --> 00:43:44,579
and a lot of us wanted to cater to them

00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:46,650
and so there's a lot of tension I would

00:43:44,579 --> 00:43:48,599
say around do we just care about

00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:52,739
ourselves as developers or do we also

00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:55,890
want to care more about you know

00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:58,019
end-users and so one of the things that

00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:00,180
came out of that I think is we decided

00:43:58,019 --> 00:44:02,309
to focus on providing better usability

00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:04,289
and we made actually some very bold

00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:07,529
moves which created all sorts of shock

00:44:04,289 --> 00:44:08,880
waves in the community you know aquia

00:44:07,529 --> 00:44:11,489
was founded and we said we're going to

00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:15,450
hire mark bolton and we're going to hire

00:44:11,489 --> 00:44:18,390
him to redesign the Drupal 7 admin UI

00:44:15,450 --> 00:44:20,130
and so he did like you looked at our

00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:23,009
information architecture he created the

00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:24,869
seven theme in all sorts of things came

00:44:23,009 --> 00:44:27,299
out of that we also started doing

00:44:24,869 --> 00:44:29,730
usability testing in Minnesota where we

00:44:27,299 --> 00:44:32,730
would observe people using Drupal and it

00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:36,690
was shocking it was shocking to see how

00:44:32,730 --> 00:44:38,759
hard it was to use Drupal we also ended

00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:41,069
up doing things like spark and so in

00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:42,840
many ways these things weren't natural

00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:45,120
for us to embrace them to start

00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:47,790
doing but we you know we decided to do

00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:49,320
them anyway and I think it helped like I

00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:51,480
think we have a long way to go but I do

00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,760
believe that we've got much better at

00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:56,370
talking to end users and embracing it

00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,550
users and I think as we grow we'll see

00:44:56,370 --> 00:45:06,000
more and more needs to you know cater to

00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:09,270
them all right so and I think it took us

00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,830
a little while at least for me maybe but

00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:13,260
we started to get this ID like you know

00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:14,970
drew please boda framework and it's an

00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:17,460
application it's a framework it's for

00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:20,130
developers by developers but you have a

00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:21,690
great framework people can build great

00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:23,070
applications on top of that and what

00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:27,450
happens is there is like this flywheel

00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:30,000
almost as the framework gets better the

00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:32,400
applications can become better and as

00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,710
the applications get better they start

00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,050
to be more demanding of the framework

00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:38,700
and so it's like this vicious circle

00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:42,210
almost that makes it better and better

00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:45,090
better anyway so if we did a lot of work

00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:48,390
around UX and it was a difficult time in

00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:51,150
many ways from a from a community point

00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:53,100
of view at the same time we also decided

00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:54,810
for the reasons that I just explained

00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:59,010
that we needed to be a better framework

00:45:54,810 --> 00:46:00,630
to it wasn't one or the other and so you

00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:03,900
know a lot of this is reflected in in

00:46:00,630 --> 00:46:08,270
Drupal 8 but we ended up spending a lot

00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:11,130
of time making Drupal a better framework

00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:13,670
and you know things like Symphony and

00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:17,070
embracing object-oriented programming

00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:18,960
the entity API in the fields API and

00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:21,240
plugins and cmi I mean there's a long

00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,100
list of things that we did to make

00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:25,740
Drupal a better framework and so you

00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:27,750
really chose to be both and I still

00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:32,090
today believe that is the right thing to

00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:35,880
do I think the fact that we can do both

00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:37,470
makes his boats a great framework and a

00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:39,720
great product and its really but the

00:46:37,470 --> 00:46:42,090
combined thing is called a platform and

00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:45,450
I think it's really what's unique about

00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:47,340
Drupal that we're probably the only you

00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:51,720
know maybe not the only but one of very

00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:53,580
few real platforms out there and so the

00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,260
lesson though here is that sometimes we

00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:56,700
don't always agree on things and it

00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:58,829
takes is a while too

00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:00,390
Gus but discussion is a good thing it's

00:46:58,829 --> 00:47:03,060
not a bad thing we don't always have to

00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:07,079
agree just have to work through these

00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:12,089
disagreements all right because we

00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:15,380
started you know making these frameworks

00:47:12,089 --> 00:47:17,400
better and products better you know

00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:21,869
Drupal became bigger and bigger and

00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:23,300
bigger in a way and so the last few

00:47:21,869 --> 00:47:26,579
years there's been a lot of talk about

00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:29,400
how do we sustain Drupal if it becomes a

00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:31,410
bigger like now too complex maybe for

00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:34,829
volunteers to dive in and take on big

00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:36,960
projects or a lot of burden on

00:47:34,829 --> 00:47:39,420
relatively few people and their risk

00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,220
burning out or how do we keep innovating

00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:44,970
fast there's all of these questions

00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:47,940
because we grow in size over the years

00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:50,790
and so I spoke a lot about is actually

00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:53,010
in Amsterdam at drupalcon Amsterdam and

00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:56,760
prior to that kino to spend a lot of

00:47:53,010 --> 00:47:59,369
time reading about you know academic

00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:01,020
research in books about these kinds of

00:47:59,369 --> 00:48:03,750
problems because we're not the only one

00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:07,020
that we're not the only organization

00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:09,810
that has this problem like every public

00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:11,550
good actually has this problem and so

00:48:09,810 --> 00:48:13,500
one of the books I read is the logic of

00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:15,890
collective action I current you

00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:18,960
encourage you to read it as well but

00:48:15,890 --> 00:48:22,530
basically what this book says it's based

00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:25,470
on research is as you grow as an

00:48:22,530 --> 00:48:28,349
organization as a public good you know

00:48:25,470 --> 00:48:31,260
and as an open source community the cost

00:48:28,349 --> 00:48:33,329
of contributing increases I think we can

00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:35,220
all relate to that if the codebase gets

00:48:33,329 --> 00:48:38,609
more complex it's harder and harder to

00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:41,540
not get in and make changes or to do you

00:48:38,609 --> 00:48:46,650
know really fundamental work but also

00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:49,250
the second thing is as you grow the

00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:51,900
benefits of contributing decrease

00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:53,280
because think about it like in the early

00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:55,800
days of Drupal i could put every

00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:57,540
contributor on a slide and you could

00:48:55,800 --> 00:49:00,420
clearly see here's the you know five

00:48:57,540 --> 00:49:02,250
contributors to Drupal today it's

00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:04,589
actually hard to put them in a tag cloud

00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:06,540
let alone in a slide with images on all

00:49:04,589 --> 00:49:09,359
of these things and so the individual

00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:10,410
reward from contributing and the eyes of

00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:13,319
many people

00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:15,510
maybe not everyone decrease see if these

00:49:13,319 --> 00:49:19,069
two trends which actually make it more

00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:21,240
and more difficult to contribute and so

00:49:19,069 --> 00:49:23,039
you know there's a lot of material

00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:26,069
around is but there's basically this

00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:27,990
notion of you have freeloaders people

00:49:26,069 --> 00:49:29,339
that use the software without giving

00:49:27,990 --> 00:49:31,230
back to the software and that's not

00:49:29,339 --> 00:49:32,970
necessarily a bad term it has a negative

00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:36,720
connotation but it's perfectly fine for

00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:38,970
people to just use the software we need

00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,619
those people actually but then on the

00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:42,990
other hand there is what they call

00:49:40,619 --> 00:49:45,630
caretakers these are the people that

00:49:42,990 --> 00:49:47,730
help us maintain and build the software

00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:49,289
and so basically if you put this theory

00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:51,569
in practice what you have is something

00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:53,220
like this when the project is small and

00:49:51,569 --> 00:49:55,829
everything is by developers for

00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:58,460
developers you have a very healthy ratio

00:49:55,829 --> 00:50:01,440
probably between free loaders and

00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:02,970
caretakers but as you grow that rate

00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:06,539
should start to change you have

00:50:02,970 --> 00:50:09,960
relatively few caretakers compared to

00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:12,809
the number of you know users but really

00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:15,119
what you want is probably something that

00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:17,910
has a bit of a healthier Rach or maybe

00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:20,010
something like this right this is also

00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:22,470
commonly referred to as a tragedy of the

00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:27,329
Commons and so this is the stuff that I

00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:29,400
talked about in my keynote and encourage

00:50:27,329 --> 00:50:32,869
you to go watch like you know it's if

00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:32,869
you want to know more about the details

00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:40,770
all right all right and so we decided

00:50:37,279 --> 00:50:42,119
leaving Amsterdam to you know to start

00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:43,260
experimenting more and more with these

00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:45,539
things and so I wanted to give you a

00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:47,970
quick update so one thing you can do

00:50:45,539 --> 00:50:51,510
with the scale is reducing costs right

00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:53,279
the scales if you reduce the cost you

00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:54,660
lower the barriers to contribution and

00:50:53,279 --> 00:50:58,140
in fact we've kind of done a lot of

00:50:54,660 --> 00:51:00,599
things here I think like for example the

00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:03,690
fact that we embraced symphony it's a

00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:06,809
way of outsourcing a lot of the code if

00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:09,869
you will and so that reduces the cost of

00:51:06,809 --> 00:51:11,279
the codebase we also empower to drupal

00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:14,640
association to do more of the

00:51:11,279 --> 00:51:16,589
maintenance of drupal.org right and so

00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:19,289
it used to be that the core developers

00:51:16,589 --> 00:51:21,390
very few people may notice but used to

00:51:19,289 --> 00:51:24,390
be the case that the core developers

00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:27,369
also maintain Jupiter dork

00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:29,260
and that's also an artifact I guess of

00:51:27,369 --> 00:51:31,839
you know when I was starting with you

00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:35,650
apply which basically developed life on

00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:38,710
drupal.org and so obviously they had to

00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:40,420
change but you know things like better

00:51:38,710 --> 00:51:42,430
governance you know work on the test

00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:44,799
pots all of these things help to reduce

00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:46,270
the cost and we should also keep doing

00:51:44,799 --> 00:51:47,829
more and more of these things we should

00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:50,319
all be thinking like how can we reduce

00:51:47,829 --> 00:51:51,490
the cost of contributing to Drupal

00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:54,430
because at the same time we're also

00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:56,710
increasing the cost I mean let's be

00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:59,170
honest like drupal 8 is maybe a little

00:51:56,710 --> 00:52:03,490
bit more complex too right and so it's

00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:06,760
it's a balancing act there as well all

00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:08,530
right the other thing I talked about is

00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,780
this idea of selective benefits and this

00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:13,000
is like the academic terms you can go

00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:16,089
read about it but the way they solve

00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,980
this problem with other public goods is

00:52:16,089 --> 00:52:19,660
they give the people that contribute

00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:22,089
that help maintain the public good

00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:24,640
whether it's Drupal or if it's a park or

00:52:22,089 --> 00:52:27,640
you know anything and give them you know

00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:30,760
benefits and so that increases the

00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:33,309
benefits and so out of that idea we

00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:35,849
launched I think I started talking about

00:52:33,309 --> 00:52:39,190
this over a year ago but this idea of

00:52:35,849 --> 00:52:40,359
organizational commit credits you know

00:52:39,190 --> 00:52:44,289
and you can see here it's a little

00:52:40,359 --> 00:52:45,819
animated gifts it loops around but

00:52:44,289 --> 00:52:50,680
that's actually deployed since Amsterdam

00:52:45,819 --> 00:52:54,930
and so as you contribute to Drupal in on

00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:57,190
drupal.org you can now attribute your

00:52:54,930 --> 00:52:59,020
contribution maybe not every

00:52:57,190 --> 00:53:01,539
contribution today but you know we may

00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:04,779
expand this but you can attribute your

00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:07,000
contribution to the organization that's

00:53:04,779 --> 00:53:09,279
paying you to do this work and even the

00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:12,430
customer that's paying your organization

00:53:09,279 --> 00:53:15,010
to do so what's nice about that is that

00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:17,799
we can start to see how our community

00:53:15,010 --> 00:53:19,599
actually works like you know we can see

00:53:17,799 --> 00:53:22,839
how much is volunteer-driven damages

00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:25,089
driven by the commercial ecosystem but

00:53:22,839 --> 00:53:28,390
we can also reward the organizations

00:53:25,089 --> 00:53:32,319
that letter developers contribute right

00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:34,690
and so we don't have that data on on the

00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:37,240
website yet but and we run some quick

00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:39,070
numbers and you can see

00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,720
now there's actually this is just the

00:53:39,070 --> 00:53:43,630
top 10 there is actually a good list of

00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:47,230
companies that allow their employees to

00:53:43,630 --> 00:53:48,970
contribute to Drupal and this is not

00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:52,180
just for Drupal core this is also for

00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:53,710
contribute modules and so the way we

00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:55,300
could use this information and this is

00:53:53,710 --> 00:53:57,610
these are the things that we're going to

00:53:55,300 --> 00:54:00,160
work on next it's the way we can use

00:53:57,610 --> 00:54:03,310
that information is by providing some

00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:07,530
benefits to these organizations and so

00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:11,050
here's an example of you know capgemini

00:54:07,530 --> 00:54:12,700
so we have organizational profiles on de

00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:16,600
todo and we could do these little badges

00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:18,130
or some statistics and the organizations

00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:20,890
that I talked to their very excited

00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:23,830
about this because for them what they

00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:26,410
want is they want to be able to attract

00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:28,210
great developers and so the fact that

00:54:26,410 --> 00:54:30,940
that organization is contributing to a

00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:32,320
Drupal is something that a lot of us

00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:36,190
like we want to go work for companies

00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:38,290
that give back right but also they like

00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:40,180
to use it when they need to convince

00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:42,700
customers like you know we know Drupal

00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:45,070
because we contribute to Drupal all

00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:47,320
right so these are mock-ups it may not

00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:49,119
look exactly like this but that's the

00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:52,720
kind of thinking and it doesn't have to

00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:54,730
be limited to profile pages we can you

00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:59,920
know trickle these things in across the

00:54:54,730 --> 00:55:02,590
website for example job boards like you

00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,720
know if you're looking for jobs you know

00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:07,270
companies that allow their employees to

00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:09,790
contribute and we can highlight them in

00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:11,770
the job boards and makes it easier for

00:55:09,790 --> 00:55:14,470
organism you know individuals to find

00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:16,060
great companies to work so the idea is

00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:19,830
that that hopefully will allow

00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:22,210
organizations to justify contributing

00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:25,869
letting their employees contribute to

00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:28,630
Drupal all right so the other thing that

00:55:25,869 --> 00:55:30,520
we decided to try is fundraising and

00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:32,650
Holly talked a little bit about it is

00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,780
already but we said we're going to raise

00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:37,930
some money from everybody in the

00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:42,790
community to try and accelerate the

00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:45,550
release of Drupal 8 right and so we set

00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:49,030
a goal if we want to raise $250,000 and

00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:51,079
we will use that money to fund Sprint's

00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:52,759
where core contributors

00:55:51,079 --> 00:55:55,880
or developers get together in the work

00:55:52,759 --> 00:55:58,369
and release blocking issues in addition

00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:02,630
to organizing Sprint's we also decided

00:55:58,369 --> 00:56:04,910
to pay you know developers for fixing

00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:07,099
release blocking bugs so you know fixing

00:56:04,910 --> 00:56:09,440
this bug we're going to give you a

00:56:07,099 --> 00:56:12,920
thousand dollars or you know whatever to

00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:18,019
help fix that and so we raised a good

00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:20,209
amount of money you know again a lot of

00:56:18,019 --> 00:56:22,519
that money comes from either users of

00:56:20,209 --> 00:56:25,099
Drupal or you know the Drupal shops and

00:56:22,519 --> 00:56:28,489
I'm proud to announce that timing just

00:56:25,099 --> 00:56:32,349
as just committed to donate another 25

00:56:28,489 --> 00:56:32,349
thousand dollars to Drupal accelerates

00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:46,390
very generous and so the slider will

00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:47,290
move up a little bit all right so these

00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:49,450
are some of the things we're

00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:52,180
experimenting with it's not too late to

00:56:49,450 --> 00:57:01,090
contribute the Drupal 8 accelerate we're

00:56:52,180 --> 00:57:05,050
still raising money all right and so the

00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:06,700
history of Drupal you know obviously

00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:09,040
it's been years in the working it's been

00:57:06,700 --> 00:57:10,690
15 years almost of you know working on

00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,280
Drupal and so a lot of people that I

00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:14,520
talk to they don't realize is that it's

00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:17,320
been 15 years or like the example of

00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:19,480
flexi node becoming cck becoming the

00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:26,950
entity API and these things don't evolve

00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:30,040
super fast so to speak but definitely

00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:31,720
the history of droop has been one of you

00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,790
know overcoming a lot of milestones

00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:36,730
whether it's you know fixing the

00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:40,390
performance issues you know for Jeremy

00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:42,220
on Colonel trap or whether it's having

00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:43,660
to start the drupal association so we

00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:46,510
can actually take in money to buy

00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:49,330
hardware or organize conferences or

00:57:46,510 --> 00:57:53,560
whether it's working through things like

00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:55,600
small core or how do we get more end

00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:58,000
users engaged and designers into the

00:57:55,600 --> 00:58:00,640
project to how do we sustain the

00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,640
development of core you know over the

00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:06,520
next five to ten years if not longer and

00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:09,790
so the history of Drupal is this chain

00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:12,130
if you will of different you know

00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:15,540
milestones and I'm sure there will be

00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:18,370
many more milestones ahead of us and

00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:21,070
this is not a bad thing right like I

00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:23,500
think overcoming these milestones is

00:58:21,070 --> 00:58:25,990
actually what makes us strong it's a

00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:28,510
fact that we didn't have three thousand

00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:30,010
dollars to buy a new server the fact

00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:32,560
that we had to come together as a

00:58:30,010 --> 00:58:35,710
community and chip in money is really

00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:38,140
what created you know camaraderie what

00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:41,560
created the sense of community and so

00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:43,690
learning to overcome these obstacles is

00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:47,070
actually what is what makes is better so

00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:48,640
you know it's not a it's not a bad thing

00:58:47,070 --> 00:58:51,549
all right

00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:52,809
if you look at all these lessons and

00:58:51,549 --> 00:58:55,420
there is many more and i'm sure i'm

00:58:52,809 --> 00:58:57,579
forgetting a lot of important stories

00:58:55,420 --> 00:59:00,730
and i forgot a lot of other key people

00:58:57,579 --> 00:59:02,349
in the history of drupal but if you

00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:05,079
apply these lessons when you look

00:59:02,349 --> 00:59:06,880
forward i mean i think we need to

00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:11,289
continue to do the same things we need

00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:13,059
to recognize the next strengths early we

00:59:11,289 --> 00:59:15,190
need to implement those mean because we

00:59:13,059 --> 00:59:17,380
want to attract more amazing people to

00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:19,930
our project they can go on and do great

00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:22,240
things with Drupal we need to stick

00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:24,549
together as a community like you need to

00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:26,740
build this together we shouldn't be

00:59:24,549 --> 00:59:29,589
afraid to have disagreements in to have

00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:32,769
discussions because overcoming these

00:59:29,589 --> 00:59:36,190
disagreement is is a key part of what

00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:39,279
makes us successful and we shouldn't be

00:59:36,190 --> 00:59:43,569
afraid to evangelize or sell or vision

00:59:39,279 --> 00:59:45,160
or the things that we want to achieve we

00:59:43,569 --> 00:59:47,920
should definitely stay committed to

00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:51,970
making our user successful just like we

00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:54,130
may Jeremy successful and so if you do

00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:55,869
all of these things and we have done a

00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:58,420
lot of these things and I feel we've

00:59:55,869 --> 00:59:59,769
made a real difference and this is when

00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:02,230
I wake up in the morning this is what

00:59:59,769 --> 01:00:05,339
I'm proud about the fact that we've made

01:00:02,230 --> 01:00:08,619
a difference we've made a difference to

01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:10,329
the lives of you know individuals like

01:00:08,619 --> 01:00:12,579
you know I mentioned that Jeremy emailed

01:00:10,329 --> 01:00:16,059
me like this this one email that I sent

01:00:12,579 --> 01:00:18,130
you know maybe a couple emails you know

01:00:16,059 --> 01:00:20,259
I said it changed my life and I'm sure

01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:24,039
it changed the lives of many people in

01:00:20,259 --> 01:00:25,869
this room so not only did we directly

01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:28,539
change the life of individuals i think

01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:30,970
we're also making a difference in the

01:00:28,539 --> 01:00:32,910
world indirectly by enabling a lot of

01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:36,039
great organizations to do great things

01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:40,059
you know like hundreds of thousands of

01:00:36,039 --> 01:00:42,970
nonprofits using Drupal they use Drupal

01:00:40,059 --> 01:00:44,980
to better fulfill their mission to raise

01:00:42,970 --> 01:00:47,950
money for their cause to activate their

01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:50,430
members and so if we can make duple a

01:00:47,950 --> 01:00:52,779
little bit better you know we basically

01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:55,029
enabled them to be more efficient at

01:00:52,779 --> 01:00:57,880
changing the world right we're enablers

01:00:55,029 --> 01:00:59,890
indirect enablers to obviously

01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:01,420
government related things like the ones

01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:02,230
I talked about that even commercial

01:01:01,420 --> 01:01:07,290
organization for

01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:09,430
Tesla Tesla Motors runs on Drupal and

01:01:07,290 --> 01:01:11,410
they're doing some great cool things for

01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:13,660
the world to electric cars are not a bad

01:01:11,410 --> 01:01:15,910
thing you know batteries are not a bad

01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:18,609
thing and so Tesla is somewhere in the

01:01:15,910 --> 01:01:21,160
room here as well definitely encourage

01:01:18,609 --> 01:01:23,650
you to talk to them to that stuff we've

01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:25,510
done for me the people like we took a

01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:27,580
basic fundamental right of every

01:01:25,510 --> 01:01:30,280
American citizen to petition their

01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:31,660
government something I didn't I don't

01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:33,850
even know how people used to do these

01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:36,880
things like probably writing a letter or

01:01:33,850 --> 01:01:39,220
on the scorner streets and we move that

01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:41,590
online so not everybody can petition the

01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:43,630
government right these are all things

01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:45,910
small little bits that help make things

01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:49,420
better and so that got me thinking like

01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:52,540
what can we do you know that's what kind

01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:56,619
of fires me up what can we do to make an

01:01:52,540 --> 01:02:00,250
even bigger difference and so what if i

01:01:56,619 --> 01:02:03,340
gave you a thousand dollars what would

01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:06,280
you use a thousand dollars for to make

01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:10,330
an even bigger difference right

01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:11,859
something to think about and so I

01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:13,119
started thinking about that I didn't

01:02:11,859 --> 01:02:15,040
know what I want to do with my thousand

01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:18,220
dollars but I do have an idea of how we

01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:21,130
can make a bigger difference and so a

01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:23,590
lot of things right now are a little bit

01:02:21,130 --> 01:02:26,680
broken or could be improved upon and I

01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:28,210
think one example is education it's

01:02:26,680 --> 01:02:30,520
nothing wrong with education as it is

01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:33,369
today but it's an example of where the

01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:36,550
web and digital is kind of transforming

01:02:33,369 --> 01:02:39,490
things for better so if you think about

01:02:36,550 --> 01:02:41,109
education the way it works today's like

01:02:39,490 --> 01:02:42,340
usually it's in a classroom style

01:02:41,109 --> 01:02:45,910
environment you have to go there

01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:49,359
physically then there's a teacher that

01:02:45,910 --> 01:02:51,400
tells you all sorts of things you know

01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:52,750
first of all if you want to have the

01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:55,690
best teachers you need to have a lot of

01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:57,640
money right if you want to be you want

01:02:55,690 --> 01:03:00,720
to study computer science and you want

01:02:57,640 --> 01:03:04,240
to go to MIT it's kind of expensive

01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:06,730
secondly is often these teachers are in

01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:08,619
front of like hundreds or dozens of

01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:10,960
students at the same time they can

01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:13,300
actually control which students are

01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:15,910
falling behind they don't necessarily

01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:17,710
know which are the weaker students

01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:21,099
which students may need extra attention

01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:23,260
or extra lessons or exercises so I think

01:03:21,099 --> 01:03:26,230
there is a huge opportunity for the web

01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:30,069
and Drupal to change that what if we

01:03:26,230 --> 01:03:32,609
could provide the best feature to

01:03:30,069 --> 01:03:34,990
everybody in the world right and I think

01:03:32,609 --> 01:03:36,970
that's where the web is really

01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:38,980
disrupting education like you know Tim

01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:41,230
berners-lee if you want to learn about

01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:43,630
the web could teach you know kids

01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:45,130
everywhere in the world thanks to some

01:03:43,630 --> 01:03:47,049
of the technology that's coming along

01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:49,720
some of these technologies are also

01:03:47,049 --> 01:03:53,650
smart I cannot know if you have used

01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:55,030
duolingo you know to learn languages but

01:03:53,650 --> 01:03:58,240
what they'll do is like if you're behind

01:03:55,030 --> 01:04:00,460
on a certain aspect of the language say

01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:03,490
Spanish it will automatically start

01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:06,130
giving you more you know exercises on

01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:07,660
the areas that you're weak at and so

01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:09,910
some of these things I feel like have

01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:15,160
the opportunity to benefit billions of

01:04:09,910 --> 01:04:18,280
people I really do believe it I'm quick

01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:19,660
other examples like disaster relief and

01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:22,990
we're actually have some examples of

01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:24,460
this but um you know if things go bad in

01:04:22,990 --> 01:04:25,660
the world like you know getting the

01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:30,940
right information to the right people

01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:33,369
very fast and I think you ski right what

01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:34,960
should you do if this happens and so I

01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:39,069
really believe like information can

01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:42,010
actually help save lives doesn't have to

01:04:39,069 --> 01:04:43,420
be for the greater good or a kind of

01:04:42,010 --> 01:04:46,569
stuff even in business I think there's a

01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:49,859
lot of great examples travel for example

01:04:46,569 --> 01:04:53,170
right now if you open a travel website

01:04:49,859 --> 01:04:55,089
say you flew from A to B you arrived in

01:04:53,170 --> 01:04:57,789
B you open the website it will ask you

01:04:55,089 --> 01:05:00,520
to book another flight but really what

01:04:57,789 --> 01:05:03,069
you probably want is if you lost your

01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:06,970
luggage you want the website or the app

01:05:03,069 --> 01:05:08,770
to say hey your luggage is lost here's

01:05:06,970 --> 01:05:10,630
what you should do next or if you lost

01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:13,270
our connecting flight it should be smart

01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:15,250
enough to say do you want to book this

01:05:13,270 --> 01:05:16,720
new flight or if you lost your

01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:19,420
connecting flight and there is no more

01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:21,130
flights it should say there's no more

01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:23,859
flights I can book your room in this

01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:25,990
hotel right like there's so many things

01:05:23,859 --> 01:05:28,930
that we can do to build better

01:05:25,990 --> 01:05:30,930
experiences for you know for people to

01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:34,720
make their lives a little bit

01:05:30,930 --> 01:05:39,099
and so I think the opportunity that we

01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:41,680
have here is pretty much limitless and

01:05:39,099 --> 01:05:43,480
so I think all of these examples and i

01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:45,640
can give you many more examples but i

01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:48,010
think what it all comes down to is

01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:52,150
providing the right information to the

01:05:48,010 --> 01:05:54,490
right person at the right time and i

01:05:52,150 --> 01:05:58,030
really believe that that would make the

01:05:54,490 --> 01:06:00,310
world a better place so to speak and so

01:05:58,030 --> 01:06:02,410
the question is you know how would you

01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:05,740
do these things and that kind of stuff

01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:08,050
and so I've written about this you know

01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:10,030
recently which is his idea of the big

01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:12,130
reverse of the web and I think if we

01:06:10,030 --> 01:06:13,630
want to see that vision the right

01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:15,869
information at the right time to the

01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:18,160
right user in the right format even

01:06:15,869 --> 01:06:20,349
become a reality we need to make some

01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:23,140
very big changes to the web and

01:06:20,349 --> 01:06:25,150
specifically I believe that we have to

01:06:23,140 --> 01:06:27,790
transform from what I call the pool

01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:30,250
based web to a push based web today too

01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:32,680
often if to go to somewhere to find the

01:06:30,250 --> 01:06:34,780
information multiple websites to to get

01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:36,640
the information you want or if an

01:06:34,780 --> 01:06:38,920
emergency happens you have to go and

01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:41,800
find out what you should do like it's

01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:44,250
very cool based the opportunity is to

01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:48,720
become push-based where information

01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:52,750
where content starts to find you right I

01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:54,849
think I think this will be a very big

01:06:52,750 --> 01:07:01,869
transformation that will happen in the

01:06:54,849 --> 01:07:04,839
next ten years where I'm ahead of my

01:07:01,869 --> 01:07:07,060
slides content will find you and in fact

01:07:04,839 --> 01:07:08,859
it's already happening and very few

01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:10,420
people realize this that if you think

01:07:08,859 --> 01:07:13,020
about some of the big industries or the

01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:15,790
big platforms out there in media

01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:17,680
typically people consume media by going

01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:19,960
to multiple websites go to the New York

01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:22,150
Times go through the another website and

01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:23,980
read the things you like but then flip

01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:26,920
words came along how many of you use

01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:29,230
flipboard's many people quite a few

01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:30,430
people so Flipboard is interesting

01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:33,190
because you tell it what you're

01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:35,680
interested in you know cars for example

01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:38,200
and it will look across hundreds of

01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:40,930
thousands of websites and find you all

01:07:38,200 --> 01:07:42,760
the car related articles that may be of

01:07:40,930 --> 01:07:44,890
interest and it will push it to you

01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:50,020
it's very disruptive it's a very

01:07:44,890 --> 01:07:52,000
successful company and it doesn't mean

01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:53,380
like there's no room for serendipity I

01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:55,180
mean there's a lot of content that it

01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:57,670
pushes to you and you can explore within

01:07:55,180 --> 01:08:00,280
that stream of content it's happening

01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:03,100
for products as well not just for news

01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:05,080
think about Pinterest where you like

01:08:03,100 --> 01:08:06,850
things or you organize things and boards

01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:08,620
and automatically pinterest will start

01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:12,520
to push it other things you might be

01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:14,110
interested in in fact my favorite

01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:16,660
example is staying in touch with your

01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:18,850
friends and family like the way that

01:08:16,660 --> 01:08:21,430
used to work and still does today so you

01:08:18,850 --> 01:08:24,310
would call your mom or your dad and say

01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:27,130
hey how are things going and call your

01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:29,470
friends and very cool based like you

01:08:27,130 --> 01:08:33,100
have to like you know reach out to them

01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:35,020
and really Facebook change that like you

01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:38,400
can using facebook you can stay in touch

01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:43,150
with many more friends and family and

01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:45,540
that information is push push to you you

01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:48,100
know same thing is happening with media

01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:50,319
or you used to dial in into different

01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:52,720
radio stations things like Spotify and

01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:56,259
Pandora are really examples of going

01:08:52,720 --> 01:09:00,130
from pool to push so I think it's a very

01:08:56,259 --> 01:09:02,680
powerful trend that I think you'll see

01:09:00,130 --> 01:09:04,569
more and more of but all of these things

01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:06,339
have in common is that they establish

01:09:04,569 --> 01:09:08,589
one-on-one relationships I think this is

01:09:06,339 --> 01:09:10,660
actually very big deal like they know

01:09:08,589 --> 01:09:12,700
the user they know the visitor they know

01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:15,009
their interests they're very content

01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:18,040
rich too they actually often use more

01:09:15,009 --> 01:09:19,750
content you know because a lot of these

01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:21,850
examples I gave are actually aggregators

01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:23,589
but they don't have to be there also

01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:25,420
contextual meaning they know your

01:09:23,589 --> 01:09:28,660
interests and their work on different

01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:35,830
channels and so let's go back to the

01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:37,390
example of you know education right and

01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:42,029
so how can we provide the best feature

01:09:37,390 --> 01:09:44,080
to these kids well you know first of all

01:09:42,029 --> 01:09:46,299
you know we need to know a few things

01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:48,759
about these users like where do they

01:09:46,299 --> 01:09:50,529
live you know what do they like or their

01:09:48,759 --> 01:09:52,299
interest and you know maybe we know that

01:09:50,529 --> 01:09:54,700
they're interested in building websites

01:09:52,299 --> 01:09:57,130
and so how can we basically provide them

01:09:54,700 --> 01:10:01,750
the best possible training how can

01:09:57,130 --> 01:10:03,520
mit teachers to on their machines or

01:10:01,750 --> 01:10:05,739
whatever the best teacher is and how can

01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:07,360
we make it so that they can continue to

01:10:05,739 --> 01:10:10,900
learn and if they get behind to get

01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:13,630
extra lessons all of these things right

01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:15,159
so how do we do that so this is a little

01:10:13,630 --> 01:10:18,400
bit more technical but still very high

01:10:15,159 --> 01:10:21,520
level but here's what I think you need

01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:24,219
first of all you need this idea of users

01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:28,420
right and you want to enrich these users

01:10:24,219 --> 01:10:30,610
with metadata if its location maybe it's

01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:33,219
their interest you know whatever it is

01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:36,460
you want to enrich more with your user

01:10:33,219 --> 01:10:38,260
profiles and I think Drupal 8 is

01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:40,510
actually in a great spot to do so like

01:10:38,260 --> 01:10:43,389
you know users are entity there you know

01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:45,489
feel double they can be extended in many

01:10:43,389 --> 01:10:48,639
ways so I think we're in a great

01:10:45,489 --> 01:10:51,010
position there the same time you need

01:10:48,639 --> 01:10:54,190
lots of content like if you're trying to

01:10:51,010 --> 01:10:57,250
match lessons with students you need all

01:10:54,190 --> 01:10:59,199
these lessons and so being able to

01:10:57,250 --> 01:11:01,900
create great content is very important

01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:04,750
and in fact if you play desire in your

01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:07,840
head we may actually need much more

01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:09,370
content than we have today because the

01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:12,219
opportunity here is that we could tail

01:11:09,370 --> 01:11:14,860
or some of these lessons very much more

01:11:12,219 --> 01:11:17,620
closely to the audience for example if

01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:20,650
we know the students are young you know

01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:23,620
we can kind of send a variance of those

01:11:20,650 --> 01:11:25,630
lessons or if we know it's maybe too you

01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:27,370
know young boys or young girls we can

01:11:25,630 --> 01:11:28,630
even tweak the lessons based on these

01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:30,730
kinds of things there's a lot of ways

01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:34,780
why we could actually leverage more

01:11:30,730 --> 01:11:36,370
content to provide better lessons and so

01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:39,159
this idea of being able to create more

01:11:36,370 --> 01:11:41,409
content and then also attach metadata to

01:11:39,159 --> 01:11:44,800
it so we can you know categorize the

01:11:41,409 --> 01:11:46,989
content for adults for young people

01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:50,530
whatever it is and so it turns out

01:11:46,989 --> 01:11:53,469
drupal 8 is really good at this too like

01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:56,230
a lot of the work we've done I write the

01:11:53,469 --> 01:12:02,199
entity API and the taxonomy system

01:11:56,230 --> 01:12:04,030
improvements the fact that our content

01:12:02,199 --> 01:12:05,380
is more structured than more semantic

01:12:04,030 --> 01:12:09,250
and the fact that we can translate

01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:11,170
condoms more easily I think are all key

01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:13,600
things in Drupal 8 that will help

01:12:11,170 --> 01:12:18,070
do that as well and then the trick is

01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:20,380
how do we match the right content to the

01:12:18,070 --> 01:12:24,520
right user right and I think there is

01:12:20,380 --> 01:12:28,150
this magic function if you will which is

01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:31,440
get the best next experience right I

01:12:28,150 --> 01:12:34,449
think this is kind of the holy grail of

01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:37,900
what I think most websites will start to

01:12:34,449 --> 01:12:40,690
figure out how do we implement get best

01:12:37,900 --> 01:12:43,810
next experience if you're a student

01:12:40,690 --> 01:12:45,640
looking for the next lesson you know

01:12:43,810 --> 01:12:48,370
whatever is the next lesson based on how

01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:52,989
you did in the previous lessons based on

01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:55,150
your interest for example these kids in

01:12:52,989 --> 01:12:57,550
Africa maybe it's rain season or

01:12:55,150 --> 01:12:59,800
something like can we find lessons that

01:12:57,550 --> 01:13:01,300
will leverage the context of these

01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:04,360
students to provide a great learning

01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:06,370
experience or you know get best

01:13:04,360 --> 01:13:12,030
experience in the travel example could

01:13:06,370 --> 01:13:15,429
be our if the luggage is lost do this if

01:13:12,030 --> 01:13:17,410
you know missed connecting flights do

01:13:15,429 --> 01:13:21,520
this and so this is the closest I've

01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:25,210
come to coding in a few months but you

01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:27,429
can you know probably imagine some

01:13:25,210 --> 01:13:29,590
pseudocode in your head of how we could

01:13:27,429 --> 01:13:32,770
implement some of these things right so

01:13:29,590 --> 01:13:35,710
you have these enriched user profiles

01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:37,870
and give this enriched content and you

01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:41,290
know this magical function get best next

01:13:37,870 --> 01:13:43,420
experience is what you know will bring

01:13:41,290 --> 01:13:45,880
these things together I think often you

01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:47,739
can implement these things in Drupal but

01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:50,380
I think also very often you want to make

01:13:47,739 --> 01:13:53,830
you know calls to third-party services

01:13:50,380 --> 01:13:56,320
for example I could imagine in the

01:13:53,830 --> 01:14:00,040
example of education but you want to do

01:13:56,320 --> 01:14:01,630
a call to a scoring service maybe

01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:03,550
there's another system that scores

01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:06,070
students but you want to get their score

01:14:03,550 --> 01:14:08,730
to help with the matchmaking I think

01:14:06,070 --> 01:14:12,010
that's a kind of an intuitive example

01:14:08,730 --> 01:14:14,710
and once you find the right content and

01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:16,239
I think you have to output it you know

01:14:14,710 --> 01:14:19,090
you know in the right format so it's

01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:20,739
great that Drupal supports structure

01:14:19,090 --> 01:14:23,560
content and then send it to the right

01:14:20,739 --> 01:14:25,200
endpoint in the case of a smartphone

01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:27,640
with native apps or

01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:30,970
like an Apple watch I think you want to

01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:33,220
use things like JSON and restful web

01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:34,840
services like how many people realize

01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:40,600
that the Apple watch doesn't have a

01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:42,430
browser most people don't but the Apple

01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:43,720
watch doesn't have a doesn't have a

01:14:42,430 --> 01:14:47,110
browser it's something to think about

01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:50,020
and how that changes things if these

01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:53,410
things will actually take off obviously

01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:55,330
we will also i put these things to the

01:14:53,410 --> 01:14:56,950
actual browsers and so we've made a lot

01:14:55,330 --> 01:14:59,920
of great improvements in Drupal 8

01:14:56,950 --> 01:15:02,740
surround you know layouts and you know

01:14:59,920 --> 01:15:05,080
templating with twig and responsive

01:15:02,740 --> 01:15:08,020
design and html5 and all of these things

01:15:05,080 --> 01:15:14,710
so Drupal also for that will do a great

01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:17,740
job and then this like imagine in a

01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:21,340
world where most websites implement this

01:15:17,740 --> 01:15:24,000
function get best next experience no two

01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:26,620
experiences might actually be the same

01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:28,180
like my facebook page looks very

01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:29,740
different than your facebook page and

01:15:28,180 --> 01:15:31,990
looks very different than your facebook

01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:34,810
page and actually not too no two pages

01:15:31,990 --> 01:15:38,470
facebook generates are identical so

01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:40,510
imagine in extremists where drupal now

01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:42,910
has to serve pages where no two pages

01:15:40,510 --> 01:15:45,370
are identical that makes it a lot harder

01:15:42,910 --> 01:15:47,770
to cash right it's a world that is a

01:15:45,370 --> 01:15:49,990
hundred percent dynamic not saying

01:15:47,770 --> 01:15:52,630
that's what it will be like but it could

01:15:49,990 --> 01:15:54,330
be like that for some cases and so

01:15:52,630 --> 01:15:56,560
there's a lot of work that we've done

01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:59,440
all right you know performance and

01:15:56,560 --> 01:16:02,530
scalability where you know we can use

01:15:59,440 --> 01:16:05,350
more precise caching more precise cache

01:16:02,530 --> 01:16:09,190
invalidation we can offload some of the

01:16:05,350 --> 01:16:10,630
work to the client or two different you

01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:14,590
know layers in the stack to the edge

01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:17,830
maybe we're also working towards and

01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:21,310
this is not in core this idea of the

01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:22,930
Facebook big pipe which basically flips

01:16:21,310 --> 01:16:26,530
the entire Drupal rendering pipeline

01:16:22,930 --> 01:16:28,570
kind of upside down but will allow us to

01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:31,930
hopefully build these kinds of

01:16:28,570 --> 01:16:34,150
experiences experiences and to scale

01:16:31,930 --> 01:16:37,600
them effectively again something that we

01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:38,790
aspire to do not yet in core and so all

01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:41,340
these things consider

01:16:38,790 --> 01:16:42,960
so I do really believe that Drupal 8

01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:46,080
will be a game-changer we've worked on

01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:48,120
this for four years with hundreds of new

01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:50,070
features I think a lot of the new

01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:52,380
features are at the right time at the

01:16:50,070 --> 01:16:54,870
right place and hopefully in a way that

01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:56,700
no the Dean space people are attracted

01:16:54,870 --> 01:16:57,990
to Drupal because it had all of these

01:16:56,700 --> 01:17:00,090
great features at the right time

01:16:57,990 --> 01:17:02,550
hopefully people will start doing the

01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:05,130
same thing with Drupal 8 and will be

01:17:02,550 --> 01:17:09,800
inspired by some of the possibilities

01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:16,560
that Drupal aids will enable course a

01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:18,060
big question is when can we use it the

01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:21,990
answer is that it's actually already in

01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:23,130
use today not everybody may might

01:17:21,990 --> 01:17:26,070
realize is that there is you know

01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:28,110
several hundreds of websites that are in

01:17:26,070 --> 01:17:30,570
production in a built in Drupal 8 it's

01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:33,060
not something we recommend but if you

01:17:30,570 --> 01:17:36,360
know what you're doing you can start

01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:38,340
using Drupal 8 today the upgrade path

01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:40,350
isn't fully supported we're trying to

01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:42,630
support it through projects like

01:17:40,350 --> 01:17:46,680
head-to-head upgrade encourage you to

01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:48,510
check that out but the point is it's

01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:50,370
getting better and better and some

01:17:48,510 --> 01:17:53,940
people the early adopters the risk

01:17:50,370 --> 01:17:57,810
takers there are you know willing to do

01:17:53,940 --> 01:18:00,000
start using it the reality is it's done

01:17:57,810 --> 01:18:05,370
when it's done or it's ready when it's

01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:09,510
ready we have a stretch goal is to

01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:11,730
release by drupalcon Barcelona I don't

01:18:09,510 --> 01:18:14,010
know that will be possible as I said

01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:15,900
it's a stretch goal I know it will not

01:18:14,010 --> 01:18:19,710
be possible without the help of more

01:18:15,900 --> 01:18:21,720
people it will not be possible we write

01:18:19,710 --> 01:18:23,220
the help of more people we have an

01:18:21,720 --> 01:18:26,520
amazing team of people that have been

01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:29,730
working on Drupal 8 every every day for

01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:33,030
weeks for months and we cannot ask to do

01:18:29,730 --> 01:18:35,100
we cannot ask them to do more and so

01:18:33,030 --> 01:18:38,040
it's really important that more people

01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:39,780
get involved if we want to make that

01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:41,250
stretch goal and this is just the top 10

01:18:39,780 --> 01:18:42,950
contributor so how can you help all

01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:46,020
there's you know many ways you can help

01:18:42,950 --> 01:18:48,570
you can start porting modules if you're

01:18:46,020 --> 01:18:50,580
an owner of a Drupal company you can let

01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:51,790
your people contribute give them time to

01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:53,980
contribute

01:18:51,790 --> 01:18:55,990
you know attend the sprints we'll have

01:18:53,980 --> 01:18:57,610
sprints here at drupalcon it's a great

01:18:55,990 --> 01:18:59,740
way to get involved and to learn how you

01:18:57,610 --> 01:19:02,620
can make a difference did you plate you

01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:04,240
can donate to Drupal 8 if you don't have

01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:06,430
the expertise if you don't have the time

01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:07,900
but you have the money donate and we'll

01:19:06,430 --> 01:19:10,480
make sure we spend the money to

01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:12,640
accelerate Drupal 8 and to pay the

01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:15,040
people that can and obviously you can

01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:20,650
try Drupal and you know test it and

01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:22,570
report bugs where exactly are we well

01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:26,830
there's 28 critical bugs left today

01:19:22,570 --> 01:19:30,220
maybe it's this i created the slide two

01:19:26,830 --> 01:19:33,700
days ago so it may be inaccurate at this

01:19:30,220 --> 01:19:35,110
point that it's around 28 if not 28 and

01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:38,350
so you can see we've made some good

01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:42,640
progress but we still have 28 bucks left

01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:44,910
once we get 20 you know we'll start

01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:47,970
doing release candidates and hopefully

01:19:44,910 --> 01:19:53,170
you know there will be a big party

01:19:47,970 --> 01:19:55,600
though rupal 8 we've had a lot of people

01:19:53,170 --> 01:19:57,460
contribute more than 2,800 people

01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:59,710
contributed which is about three times

01:19:57,460 --> 01:20:03,490
the number of people that contributed to

01:19:59,710 --> 01:20:05,230
Drupal 7 core and you know like to thank

01:20:03,490 --> 01:20:07,540
all of these people that contributed to

01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:09,910
a Drupal not just the Drupal 8 people

01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:13,390
that contributed in the past some of

01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:17,290
which have left us and the ones that are

01:20:13,390 --> 01:20:19,470
here today now working on Drupal 8 thank
