Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Making the Leap from a Drupal Shop to a Product Company
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	There are natural limits on how your business scales as a consultant selling your time by the hour. Whether you want recurring revenue from a support service, to launch a SaaS product, or sell physical goods, there are many compelling reasons to build a business outside of the professional services model.

But other business models come with their own unique set of challenges. Managing product development costs, marketing, or inventory is complex. During this session Zack will present on lessons learned making the leap from professional services at Chapter Three to retail Drupal Commerce at Mission Bicycle and SaaS recurring revenue at Pantheon. Ryan will present on his experience in ecommerce, Commerce Guys, Platform.sh, and Bellweather.

We will cover these topics at a strategic level, and dive into the nuts and bolts as they apply to your day-to-day business:

Product, marketing, positioning, and sales

Managing co-founder relationships

Managing towards cashflow and profitability

Spinning out companies from corporate parents

Balancing time across multiple simultaneous ventures

Raising  financing -- from friends and family and professional VCs

Building and scaling teams

business thanks Zach i'm ryan drama from

00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:17,130
commerce guys I sort of started working

00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,159
in Drupal with ubercart background like

00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:22,080
the Drupal 5 beta days it was neither a

00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,310
product company or services company

00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,350
despite the fact that everybody thought

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,150
we were a company it was a project that

00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:32,700
then turned into commerce guys in 2009

00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,930
and we've grown in various ways since

00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,479
then that will be discussing in this

00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,360
session we're now sort of creating a

00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,150
product internally that that can find a

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,920
life of its own called platform not SH

00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:46,079
and then because I don't have enough to

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,570
do in my life with businesses and three

00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,399
triple at third child on the way I'm

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,380
also building a product company called

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,570
bellwether that's using Drupal as an

00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,369
application framework to sell things

00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,520
that we'll talk about I don't spill all

00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:00,930
the beans now keep you in suspense but

00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,009
just as a high-level overview for what

00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,869
we'll be talking about we're going to

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:09,420
begin with the next slide let's figure

00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,099
this out yeah we're going to begin with

00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,520
just a description of the business

00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:14,590
models

00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,270
our histories represents so between us

00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,720
we have I think six or seven different

00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:22,660
companies or products that we've

00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,390
contributed to or grown so we'll discuss

00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:27,280
the business models involved in those we

00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:29,140
will discuss venture capital at a very

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,420
high level you know what is that all

00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:34,180
about what kind of a company could

00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,980
receive funding and if you're not going

00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:38,530
to go the route of capital how would you

00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,950
bootstrap a SAS business either on the

00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:44,500
side or as part of a services company

00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:46,270
that you then spin out will briefly

00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:49,180
cover what product development at a

00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:51,340
start-up looks like and then close with

00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:54,550
just a few words on kind of management

00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:56,280
101 and a lot of this format here is

00:02:54,550 --> 00:03:01,750
lessons that we've learned along the way

00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:03,430
it's less how to go and do you know this

00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,800
thing that we all want to do which is

00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:07,060
make money while you're sleeping and and

00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,680
more about you know what are the hard

00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,510
knocks that we've taken in lessons that

00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,240
we've learned and how can we inspire you

00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:16,150
to go out and build something yourself

00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:21,310
so with that I will pass the mic back to

00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:22,630
Zach to thanks for so here we go so

00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,900
here's a founding story you might sound

00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:27,760
a little familiar it was 2006 and I was

00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,610
hanging out with Josh and Matt and we

00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,250
were 20-somethings who were confused

00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:35,740
about her life and we were getting asked

00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:38,260
repeatedly as independent consultants to

00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,280
work on Drupal projects and at some

00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,900
point we kind of looked at each other

00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,350
and said hey do you want to start a

00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,870
company so that is the grand strategy of

00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:49,240
founding chapter three wasn't much to it

00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,890
and that's how we are going so the

00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,260
company has been built kind of brick by

00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,870
brick ever since it's evolved a lot over

00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:57,880
the years at the moment it's and as of

00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,140
the last two years actually Josh Matt

00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,459
myself a very little to do with the

00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,010
day-to-day operations of the company was

00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:04,510
nothing there's a team there Jon and

00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:07,660
Steph and the management team that runs

00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:10,270
it that's about 35 come please is based

00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:12,310
in San Francisco it's 100 we didn't

00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:15,640
never raised any outside capital it's

00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:18,700
all been built off of profits and has a

00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:20,940
great life of its own so here's another

00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:26,290
founding quick story so it was maybe

00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:29,050
2008 and I got around San Francisco

00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,640
bicycle which was a lot of fun because

00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:33,250
the buses are not we're not very good

00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,290
and cars are crazy and my friends got

00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:37,150
around the bicycles and none of us liked

00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,860
our bicycles because they were kind of

00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:41,080
not very well designed for City rotting

00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,060
and then then we all went through this

00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,010
process of building our own bicycle

00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,780
which was really fun and took about 30

00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,570
hours in a ton of research it was a pain

00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,250
in the butt and at that point we started

00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:53,380
saying why doesn't why isn't there a

00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,320
decent City bicycle why isn't there an

00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,730
awesome City bicycle company and then we

00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,020
started talking about well maybe we

00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,020
could start an awesome City bicycle

00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,730
company and then it was oh my god we

00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:06,010
started a bicycle company and it's been

00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,320
kind of like that ever since so mission

00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:10,750
bicycle has been a bootstrapped venture

00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,890
since then we've I'll talk about it more

00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,600
in depth but we have a little shop and

00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:17,200
valencia street and it's on a very

00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,970
different path from chapter three other

00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:21,360
companies our long-term ambition mission

00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,830
bicycle is to build the world's best

00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,570
commuter bicycle for american cities the

00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,690
most personal reliable and remarkable

00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,340
city bicycles available and our vision

00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,710
for the company looks a lot more like

00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,870
does anyone know heath ceramics in san

00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:37,480
francisco anyone never heard of them

00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:40,060
okay it's my favorite businesses dirt

00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,770
comes in one end and people buy really

00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,360
great ceramics out the other it's a

00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,880
local manufacturer in San Francisco it's

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,870
been around since nineteen forty eight

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,090
we would love permission of bicycle to

00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:51,760
be around in 50 plus years that's a and

00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:54,520
and it's not at all events your business

00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,920
it's a kind of a passion manufacturing

00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,930
business so yeah we have a little shop

00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,630
we build bicycles so I'll built to order

00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,720
it's really fun it's totally different

00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:06,940
in many ways from software companies or

00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,710
consulting but also many ways it's just

00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:11,890
the same stuff in terms of building

00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:13,630
companies and maybe it goes without

00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,940
saying that they're able to use Drupal

00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,830
to okay yeah to drive a lot of the

00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:22,000
construction in fact beautiful uh

00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:24,750
commerce in fact but that wasn't my

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,400
project you guys didn't fantastic job

00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,840
but no it's it's the idea is that you

00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,760
know Drupal is enabling people to build

00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:33,190
businesses that kind of transcend just

00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,200
thinking about software mission bicycle

00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,340
in the way that it you know exists today

00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,340
I think I guess previously would have

00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,669
been a mail-order cattle

00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,290
yeah blame it I called her by numbers

00:06:40,669 --> 00:06:44,470
where you kind of yeah piece it together

00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:47,630
and mail it in and get a bike hopefully

00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:49,120
so the Commerce guys story almost

00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:51,470
similar to the story of chapter three

00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,850
which was I was working on new Burkhardt

00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:55,130
selling restaurant equipment at the same

00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:57,470
time because we built it for a company

00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:59,960
called prima supply that sold vitae prep

00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:03,350
lenders and true refrigeration and all

00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:05,479
that stuff on the internet and I just

00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,979
started to meet people in the Drupal

00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:10,340
community around drupalcon Barcelona

00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:11,450
ultimately met two guys Mike and Tim who

00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:14,200
decided they were just going to

00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:16,400
specialize in doing ubercart consulting

00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:17,690
and around the time that I decided to go

00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,340
Drupal full time they said well hey why

00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:21,050
don't you join us instead of you know

00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,100
just working for any old Drupal shop

00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:25,610
let's try to build a business around

00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:28,729
Burkhardt and so we got together in 2009

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,410
at drupalcon DC and you know sign the

00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:34,220
whole articles of incorporation and

00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:38,479
kicked off this grand adventure and it

00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:39,979
was really stressful and and yet it

00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,630
wasn't necessarily stressful because

00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:43,010
like starting a business is stressful we

00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:45,770
actually like made plenty of money that

00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:47,900
year paid ourselves fine but there was

00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,160
this whole like shift with ubercart

00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,750
turning in the Drupal commerce that

00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,820
happened around the same time that took

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:56,360
a personal toll but we stuck it out and

00:07:52,820 --> 00:08:00,260
ended up merging with the French team of

00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,940
AF 8300 con Paris and kind of brought

00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,800
their Drupal team to commerce guys and

00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,389
created a new commerce guys wear the

00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,789
same brand but headquartered in Paris

00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:10,160
that then raised venture capital to both

00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:12,500
scale the services team and pursue a

00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,810
product roadmap that we would deliver

00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,580
services around so we could have

00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:19,010
continued kicking it with rubric art and

00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:21,770
just kind of managing that conflict and

00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:25,520
building sites and whatnot as a small

00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:27,830
commerce guys but but making this jump

00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,180
enable us to put me full-time just on

00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,740
building Drupal commerce and then other

00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,750
people dedicated full time to creating

00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:36,440
kickstart and so on it was just a very

00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:38,539
different path and we were discussing

00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,279
this earlier that one of one of the

00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:42,440
challenges and raising money to like

00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:44,120
scale a services team is that was

00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,610
chapter three you could kind of grow the

00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,800
team organically so that as you had need

00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:50,260
to add developer

00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,089
hire more developers where is it

00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,149
commerce guys it was almost like we had

00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:56,230
money in a budget that we had to in a

00:08:54,149 --> 00:08:57,940
forecast for revenue that we had to hit

00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,100
and so we're having to actually like

00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,839
scale to fit something that we we said

00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,110
we could do you know a year and a half

00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,920
before it's really really challenging

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,660
and then you know we didn't have a

00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,519
product roadmap to start it wasn't until

00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,779
our second round of funding really that

00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,029
we we knew we were going to build

00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:14,470
kickstart and platform I think I might

00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:16,510
be the next side you know platform was

00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,760
the the product that we actually sort of

00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,290
put venture capital behind and it wasn't

00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:23,079
until we raised a series be that we even

00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:25,630
were able to launch platform and so it's

00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:27,490
a kind of a kind of a roundabout path to

00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:29,529
going from being a Drupal services shop

00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,660
that started on New burkhard turn into

00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:33,250
Drupal commerce consulting decided then

00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:35,680
to build a couple of products one that

00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,089
is actually so that people don't know

00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,070
this but commerce kickstart itself is

00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:40,660
kind of revenue neutral it wasn't a loss

00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:42,550
despite the fact that we spent a lot of

00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:44,110
money to built it it also generated

00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:47,980
revenue in its own right and continues

00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:49,990
to not just thanks to Pantheon affiliate

00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,550
fees but also thanks to things like

00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,709
payment gateway integrations that

00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,600
continue to pay you know a feeling

00:09:53,709 --> 00:09:58,750
referral fees and things that kickstart

00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,130
enable so that all happened and then of

00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,810
course platform happened and now that's

00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,310
kind of trying to find a life of its own

00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,079
in the enterprise hosting space so

00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,820
that's that's kind of a commerce guys

00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:08,829
platform story I have one more but first

00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:11,709
I'll pass the mic back to Zach because

00:10:08,829 --> 00:10:13,980
the Pantheon story is kind of like an in

00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:18,130
hindsight maybe what we should have done

00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:20,589
so so if you haven't noticed this is

00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:22,810
appeared apparently in random order it's

00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:27,520
actually in chronological order which is

00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:29,110
random so so Pantheon is on a very

00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,060
different path than Machine bicycle in

00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:33,130
Chapter three so one way is just

00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,630
different is we we have raised quite a

00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,490
lot of venture capital we've raised 28

00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:39,699
million dollars to date and that's for a

00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:42,990
very specific reason it's it's because

00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:46,500
the the goal the mission of Pantheon is

00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:49,029
it's kind of you know stupidly ambitious

00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,519
our long-term goal is to run thirty

00:10:49,029 --> 00:10:54,339
percent of the web we currently run Oh

00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:57,190
point one percent so we have twenty nine

00:10:54,339 --> 00:11:00,520
point nine percent to go we're going for

00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:02,380
one percent in a few years and you know

00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,610
the founding story of Pantheon was it

00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:05,620
came out of the consulting work we were

00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:09,220
doing at chapter 3 at the time it was

00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:11,950
really Josh Matt David and myself you

00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:16,060
know kind of idly talking about you know

00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:18,400
is really a realization that we had that

00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,110
we thought that the demands for website

00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,110
customers so marketers and business

00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:24,400
owners what they demand of Drupal or the

00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:28,510
demand of their website when they buy a

00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:30,340
Drupal website was increasingly going to

00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,990
look like what they get from software as

00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:34,990
a service companies so Twitter

00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:38,620
Salesforce google apps where there's no

00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:40,450
servers there's no kind of a citation

00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,160
and fix things thing like the website

00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,870
really should just work is the

00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,420
expectation we think marketers are going

00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,730
to increasingly expect as they get kind

00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:50,610
of used to softwares or service tools in

00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:54,190
the rest of their portfolio of tool sets

00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:57,490
and we basically at that point when we

00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:59,140
had that realization we looked to where

00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,990
the state of the art for the industry

00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,520
was for infrastructure for Drupal and we

00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:05,680
became pretty convinced that hosting

00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,810
companies and hosting architecture

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,210
wasn't going to get Drupal there quick

00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:12,700
enough it just we didn't you know what

00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:14,170
we saw was a need for for example we

00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,490
thought running Drupal site should look

00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:18,040
much more like Heroku or Google App

00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:20,830
Engine and not like GoDaddy sorry

00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,030
GoDaddy or and and we thought of every

00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,710
developer needs like really good

00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,630
developer tools of version control and

00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,740
deb test live environments and all this

00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,690
stuff that you kind of need for every

00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,430
site and hosting companies really

00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:32,440
weren't getting getting it done so that

00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:34,540
that was the beginning of Pantheon and

00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,640
to try to achieve something on that

00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,260
scale we there was no choice for us we

00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,760
needed venture capital you know we

00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,920
bootstrapped the company as far as we

00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,350
could out of chapter three it got us

00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,060
decently far but at some point mean

00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:48,790
we've invested over ten million dollars

00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,230
just in the technology alone and that's

00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:52,870
something we literally could not do as a

00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,580
bootstrap company and we be in it and it

00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,840
also works out that the kind of things

00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,750
we're trying to do with Pantheon which

00:12:55,840 --> 00:13:00,640
is a big long-term technology bet is

00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,470
exactly the kind of thing that venture

00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,240
capital tech venture capital is built to

00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:07,690
do so there's a really good alignment

00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,520
between the expectations and the kind of

00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:10,570
framework of venture tech investment and

00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,920
what we're trying to do a Pantheon

00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,769
that's why we're on the path but it's a

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,869
completely different path than

00:13:13,769 --> 00:13:17,160
bicycle or chapter 3 where it's it's all

00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:18,689
bootstrapped her friends and family and

00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,879
is there was like a point when she made

00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:23,309
like a clean break yes actually to be

00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:25,649
full time focused on this one thing and

00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:27,269
yeah so we spun I'll talk about this a

00:13:25,649 --> 00:13:28,679
bit more we spun Pantheon out of chapter

00:13:27,269 --> 00:13:30,839
three is a completely different company

00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:32,369
with different ownership and investors

00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:36,660
is basically insisted that we would do

00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:38,910
that yeah otherwise your your valuation

00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:41,009
is tied negatively to this like services

00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:43,709
revenue that's so clouding the picture

00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:45,629
and yeah so so one quick story and it's

00:13:43,709 --> 00:13:48,239
not my story it's true Gordon's story

00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:50,009
and Ronan's story it's the back of they

00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:51,629
migrated no scroll story so I just want

00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:54,869
to call this out because it's a actually

00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:56,069
I love this story so so you know Ronan

00:13:54,869 --> 00:13:58,199
has been working on back with my great

00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:59,399
for eight years back and my grits used

00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:01,199
by three hundred thousand Drupal sites

00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:03,720
it's kind of the de facto way you create

00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,239
backups and migrate your backup of your

00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,129
Drupal site somewhere else and then drew

00:14:06,239 --> 00:14:09,779
and ronan without any outside investment

00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:13,649
bootstrap that's node school business

00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:15,540
into a very successful and you know very

00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:19,949
nicely operating business on their own

00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:21,990
with no outside investment and you know

00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:25,769
did this out of the Drupal ecosystem and

00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:27,029
we he is really it's a really cute

00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:29,220
squirrel he's wearing a really cool

00:14:27,029 --> 00:14:30,990
t-shirt and we just so Pantheon recently

00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,850
acquired note squirrel so drew and

00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,259
running or joining the team but I

00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:36,779
thought their story was worth telling

00:14:34,259 --> 00:14:38,339
because I think it's very applicable to

00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:39,839
a lot of folks here in the room yeah and

00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:41,759
it kind of demonstrates that it is

00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,369
possible to take a drupal module and

00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:47,189
provide a value-added service on top sex

00:14:44,369 --> 00:14:49,589
is this open source code then not only

00:14:47,189 --> 00:14:50,970
becomes like a stand like a good

00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:52,829
business in its own right but something

00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,670
that there is an exit for there are

00:14:52,829 --> 00:14:56,459
companies that are interested in

00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:59,040
acquiring things that do that for

00:14:56,459 --> 00:15:00,209
various reasons I'm sure you know it

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,540
made good sense for a number of reasons

00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:05,459
for Pantheon to to move this direction

00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,439
it's a quick quick plug so the reason we

00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:10,829
did this we're excited about is this

00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:12,600
guy's now free so in note scrolls now

00:15:10,829 --> 00:15:14,160
free service anyone can use it and it

00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,480
was a thing that we wanted to do and

00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,679
Drew and Ronan wanted to do but we could

00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,110
only do it together and that's why we

00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:20,100
ended up merging and and so I i I'm

00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:22,169
pretty convinced there are other

00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,879
opportunities like this out there right

00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:26,129
its backup and migrate isn't the only

00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:26,590
thing that could have a value-added

00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:28,210
server

00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:30,190
it's built on top of open source code

00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:32,050
whether it's we've added around ideas

00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:33,910
around the administration and analytics

00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:35,110
other things in the Commerce space but

00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,150
I'm sure there are there are other

00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:41,920
opportunities like that and another

00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:43,930
another model that uses drupal and like

00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,640
drupal itself as the heart of a product

00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,140
is is this model that i first learned

00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,300
about through company called bio raft

00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,880
anybody heard of that company they're up

00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:54,790
in New England has anybody here from bio

00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:58,600
raft okay that'll be would have been

00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:00,160
cool I guess but I first heard about

00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,120
them i think it was in barcelona they

00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,080
were there because they were using

00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,580
drupal as like the the framework for

00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,910
their software as a service product

00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:12,580
which sells tools essentially SAS tools

00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:14,590
to research laboratories so that anytime

00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:15,820
somebody has a need for some different

00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:17,980
type of research they could create a

00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:20,500
module you know to track all of your

00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:22,000
mice in your lab and then they would

00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:23,350
roll that you know module out to all

00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,180
other other customers for free so you're

00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,740
paying a subscription fee and then sort

00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,010
of using this inherent like modular

00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:31,540
nature of Drupal to roll out continuous

00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:33,790
improvements in your service to all of

00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:36,640
your customers pretty cool and it also

00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:39,160
kind of sounds a bit like where drupal

00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,810
distributions come into play where you

00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,940
know typically the distribution i think

00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:44,620
is built as a project on drupal.org to

00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,880
help other people build websites but it

00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:48,400
could just as easily be managed

00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,200
internally as like the the framework

00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,700
around which you build a SAS company and

00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,130
so that's what I'm doing now with

00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:55,750
bellwether I'm actually had a friend who

00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,060
developed and this is kind of out in the

00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,620
weeds so I'll be really fast with it but

00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,870
he developed a new model for what's

00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:03,880
called weather normalization it's part

00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,830
of the energy forecasting process that

00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,500
every power company in the world has to

00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:11,770
do on an annual and at a micro level on

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:13,360
a daily basis and he had this model and

00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:15,730
it was basically like in his head and in

00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,560
an Excel spreadsheet and so I said well

00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,260
I know how to help you productize this

00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:22,330
you know let's let's create a Drupal

00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,220
distribution that can serve as a front

00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:25,600
end for a better statistical computing

00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,180
environment than Excel which is called

00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,100
our another open source tool and then we

00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:32,050
can provide utilities access to this

00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,430
portal and then as utilities have

00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:34,930
different needs we can build new

00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,850
products for them and release them to

00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:38,230
all of the other customers that they can

00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,270
quickly turn on and start to make use of

00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:42,130
all these tools so in a sense weird

00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:44,470
the bio raft thing but for the energy

00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,880
industry to start to build this sort of

00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:48,550
cloud of machine learning tools that

00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,460
help them better understand weather's

00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:53,500
impact on energy demand and various

00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,050
other things that they're doing and so

00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:58,600
this is pretty exciting that the model

00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:01,150
thus far has been when you call customer

00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:02,980
funded development so the idea being you

00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:05,200
know that there are people who wanted

00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:08,170
this to happen and we're willing to pay

00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,970
money for it sight unseen the Minimum

00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:12,070
Viable Product was literally just a PDF

00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:13,240
that we emailed and now we're finally

00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,100
getting the web portal up for them to

00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:17,530
make use of that and then we've

00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:18,910
discovered new tools along the way to

00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:21,150
them get you know thousands of dollars

00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:23,620
in annual revenue before ever really

00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:25,570
having something that looks good okay

00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,890
and so I'll talk a bit more about like

00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,780
what that bootstrap process has been

00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:30,970
like but it's it's a model of customer

00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:32,710
fund development that now is kind of at

00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,810
a place where it could reasonably raise

00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:37,960
I mean at least a nice seed round of

00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:39,040
venture capital yeah so let's want to

00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,900
wrap up this section really quick

00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,670
because this was a random walk of

00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:45,040
chronological history so just to wrap it

00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:47,410
up a little bit so I guess the the

00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:50,350
message here is there is no one right

00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:53,860
way right there are tool kits and

00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:55,600
strategies and practices you can take

00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:57,910
from one business to the other but

00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,800
there's no one right way of financing or

00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:02,020
building a company strategy or building

00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,850
company at all and all these companies

00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,890
we kind of found our own way that was

00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:07,840
right for that company and made many

00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:10,330
mistakes along the way that we were yeah

00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:15,010
work from yeah and we will continue to

00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:17,320
make those mistakes exactly okay so

00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:19,420
venture capital what's that all about

00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:23,860
this is a three-minute talkin venture

00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:26,590
capital so a couple messages here so one

00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:29,140
of them is and this is a very hard point

00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,790
for me at first and I think for many

00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:34,180
people to kind of get their head around

00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:35,920
in terms of venture capital so rational

00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,810
people would think if you went to a

00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,820
venture investor and said you know hey

00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:42,460
venture investor I have this foolproof

00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:44,380
plan to take twenty dollars and reliably

00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,120
turn it into it sorry ten dollars and

00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,770
reliably turn it into twenty dollars and

00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,480
it's never it's not going to fail and I

00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:51,760
proven that it works and it's a just

00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,890
like money growing machine will you

00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,710
finance me that they would say

00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:58,660
that sounds interesting actually turns

00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:00,280
out not to be the case those kind of

00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,780
businesses are not the kind of

00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,940
businesses venture investors look for

00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,830
because it turns out venture investment

00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:09,730
is what what they call a hits business

00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:12,820
actually has a lot in common with movies

00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:14,170
or entertainment where you have as a

00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,750
venture investor the way this really

00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:18,430
works is you have a portfolio of many

00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,290
investments sometimes it's dozen

00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:22,720
sometimes it's hundreds and you're

00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:25,420
looking for the outliers that really

00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,760
blow up so like the googles or the ubers

00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:30,220
or the Twitter's the Facebook's where

00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,720
they have humongous outside returns

00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,760
where they can turn ten dollars into

00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:36,580
potentially a thousand or ten thousand

00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,470
dollars but what that means is most

00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,750
companies actually don't make it most

00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:42,040
companies are not the outlier and so

00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:44,260
what they're looking for is these big

00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,300
outlier companies that make so much

00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:47,920
money that they'll pay for all of the

00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:50,500
risk that it took on everyone else that

00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:53,470
didn't make it very hard to get your

00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:54,850
head around this and so what it actually

00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:57,490
means we'll talk about this a bit more

00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:59,320
is most businesses actually are not

00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:01,930
really a fit for venture capital because

00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,490
the kind of risk they as a venture

00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:06,100
investor they want you to take you

00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:07,420
probably are not doesn't aggression all

00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,580
sense for you to take for your business

00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,280
or your business is really not set up to

00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:14,800
try to be a moonshot so you know all the

00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,120
companies we ran through I think three

00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:20,050
of them or venture investment and the

00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:21,490
other four aren't so and ninety-nine

00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:23,320
percent of businesses are not venture

00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:26,740
investment for venture investment

00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,940
companies for this reason so how do

00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,610
people build businesses with a not

00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,660
raising venture investment well again

00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:34,120
99% of business as many these businesses

00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:35,980
are fortune 500s or huge companies went

00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,840
and built and built huge companies

00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:40,930
without any venture investment how they

00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,030
do it well how about building and

00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:45,640
growing your company on profit getting

00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:46,990
bank loans some sometimes people raise

00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,220
you know friends and family investment

00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:51,220
not from a professional investors but

00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,690
from you know their own networks this is

00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,880
the way most business actually are

00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,080
scaled and it's appropriate actually

00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:01,510
think for most businesses and business

00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:04,210
models to deleverage these tools okay

00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:07,030
but if you do think you have a venture

00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:09,580
capital kind of business there's an

00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:13,480
and and you don't want to do this the

00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:16,360
normal way you want to do this the go

00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,410
for broke venture capital way the good

00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:19,750
news is it that there are ton of

00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:21,670
resources so there is this great blog

00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,770
that i love called venture hacks that

00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:25,060
has 20 or 30 posts which will run you

00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:26,530
through everything you probably need to

00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:28,270
think about what before you to start

00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:31,120
down this road there's this really great

00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:33,280
book venture deals that is everything

00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,860
you need to know about actually signing

00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:38,020
up for venture capital and negotiating a

00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,550
term sheet with a venture investor and

00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,780
there are really great incubators like

00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:43,150
TechStars and y combinator they're

00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,890
literally like boot boot camps for how

00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:47,200
to start a venture-backed companies or

00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,580
many more resources also in addition to

00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,900
this it's a lot of stuff on the internet

00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:55,330
and and you know for me with like my

00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:57,570
development i guess from commerce guys

00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:59,800
until now is it all been about like

00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:01,690
running well more like trying to start

00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,730
running while moving i guess how does it

00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,980
whether there's a there's an idiom there

00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:09,310
that i'm missing anyways trying to find

00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:10,900
my feet whatever and so all along the

00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:12,460
way even just doing goober card and in

00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,990
drupal commerce consulting like reading

00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:15,610
these blogs and reading these books is

00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:17,590
just for like preparation putting my

00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:19,120
head in the right like the right space

00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:21,550
so that when an opportunity like a

00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,560
bellwether came along like it didn't

00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:24,640
take me much effort to tell my friend

00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,820
well here's how you need to grow this

00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,680
business so it's kind of like if you

00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:31,750
have an idea that you want to do this

00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:34,360
someday like reading now is certainly

00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:36,100
not going to hurt you and these are

00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,990
these are the resources that have really

00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,360
helped me as well as s Zack and I

00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:42,340
through my link there to Paul grams blog

00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:44,800
as well and you can just kind of like go

00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:48,100
read everything he's ever written and be

00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:50,560
in a really good spot to avoid some

00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,650
pretty common mistakes whenever you

00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:58,000
start to build your product business

00:23:52,650 --> 00:24:00,190
yeah alright so but we're all we're also

00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,900
here to talk about making the leap from

00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:07,480
an existing consulting company to a

00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:09,790
product company which is the approach

00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,620
that we took to start mission bicycle

00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:12,760
and Pantheon actually and its approach

00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:14,530
this actually not available to many

00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,630
people so for many folks out there who

00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:18,460
want to start a product company or want

00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:20,200
to start a venture back up lata company

00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,970
they have to look at a life decision

00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,360
like

00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:26,280
their job going on zero income having no

00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,320
resources to start with and literally

00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,340
building everything from scratch but if

00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,570
you're in this room and you're looking

00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:33,210
to start a product company you already

00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:35,490
have a consulting company that actually

00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:37,380
can be used as a vehicle as kind of a

00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:39,900
cheat or an accelerator to start to

00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:41,610
build your company your product company

00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:44,610
and that is the path that we took with

00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:47,250
both mission bicycle and pantheon so a

00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:50,039
funny story this is actually the chapter

00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,630
3 office in San Francisco the first ten

00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:54,900
mission bicycles were built in the

00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:56,880
conference room of chapter three which

00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:59,010
was a great way to save money and made

00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,799
no sense to her clients so we found

00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:03,690
crated ways to explain that and in fact

00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:05,850
the first year mission bicycle actually

00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:07,890
got started as a web ecommerce business

00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:09,870
with no storefront so we literally

00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:11,880
incubated it inside the office of

00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:12,900
chapter 3 we built the website with the

00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,380
chapter three weapons website

00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:17,909
development team we put the first couple

00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,590
hundred thousand dollars of investment

00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:21,510
to get the business going it directly

00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:23,820
came out of profits from Chapter three

00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:26,460
so we actually were you know chapter 3

00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:28,260
was the incubator for the mission

00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:31,530
bicycle company and really got it off

00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,940
the ground and if we were to go back in

00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,320
time and think about starting mission

00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,690
bicycle without chapter 3 I don't think

00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,740
we could have done it or if we were to

00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:40,169
try to do it would have been a lot

00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:42,720
harder so we actually that worked really

00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:45,390
well in most respects and so we actually

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:49,460
did that model again for pantheon so the

00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:51,870
first nine months of Pantheon were

00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,640
Pantheon was incubated inside chapter

00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:55,679
three so this is before we raise venture

00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,179
investment you know David Strauss ended

00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,100
up moving out to San Francisco he worked

00:25:57,179 --> 00:26:01,980
with us in this chapter three office we

00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,780
put the Pantheon team behind closed

00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,030
doors there glass doors you can see

00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:08,309
through them it was very ineffective we

00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:10,230
tried our best funny story the first two

00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:11,730
employees a Pantheon were not the

00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:14,220
founders they were actually chapter

00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:16,409
three employees who we put on developing

00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,700
pampy on while we kind of extricated

00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:19,530
ourselves from operating the chapter

00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,909
three business again the first couple of

00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:23,309
thousand dollars of investment in the

00:26:20,909 --> 00:26:24,780
pantheon came from chapter 3 profits and

00:26:23,309 --> 00:26:26,130
we were able to get the Pantheon

00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,809
business really going with first

00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:30,330
customers an early prototype of a

00:26:27,809 --> 00:26:32,130
product without any outside investment

00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,400
and when we raised outside investment we

00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:37,240
were pretty far down the path

00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:38,680
and we had in a run way to really know

00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:40,840
exactly what we wanted to do as a

00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,640
business which really helped us when it

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,870
came time to raise money and you've said

00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,760
it a couple of times now that it you

00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:46,990
know you invested hundreds of thousands

00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,970
of dollars in these two separate

00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:50,980
businesses and I think you know one of

00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:52,210
the takeaways from that is that we

00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:53,590
probably have to like up our game a

00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:56,350
little bit and how we're running aren't

00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:57,550
rupal shops it seems counterintuitive if

00:26:56,350 --> 00:26:59,200
you want to build a product business you

00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:02,050
want to bootstrap it and spin it out of

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:04,630
your drupal shop then you may need to

00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:06,070
learn how to grow a business first that

00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:08,620
can have hundreds of thousands of

00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:10,750
dollars of profits to then incubate and

00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:12,910
spin out a side project yeah I think

00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,530
it's a really good point and I think if

00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:16,900
you if you're in this mid transition

00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:19,090
actually if she's really hard it's very

00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:21,550
tricky place to be because you're always

00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:23,830
rationalizing your time and so for

00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:25,510
example a pantheon it was more made more

00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:27,580
sense for Josh Matt and myself actually

00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:29,620
to work on chapter three and have

00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,930
employees work on Pantheon to make

00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:34,960
chapter three profitable enough to build

00:27:31,930 --> 00:27:37,450
the business and over time figure out

00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,370
how to build it you know we had a team

00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:41,230
that from the bottoms up can't kind of

00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:43,120
took over the responsibilities that the

00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:44,980
founders and partners had within the

00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,840
next year or two but yeah just in

00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:49,690
general so if you were to go down this

00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:53,020
path it it can work really well it's

00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:57,220
certainly not easy but you know to just

00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:58,630
you know be pretty blunt what I consider

00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:00,430
kind of a healthy growing consulting

00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:02,410
company should be able to run at about

00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:04,960
twenty percent gross margins that's

00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:08,230
generally the target that's very hard to

00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,780
do and if you're doing that like wow

00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:12,730
that's really impressive but if you can

00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:15,460
do that yeah it's very real money you

00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:17,290
can put into building a business and it

00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,570
can be part of the exercise on our

00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:21,700
budgeting process was figuring out

00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:23,590
exactly how much of our gross margin we

00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:25,660
could allocate toward platform not SH

00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:27,280
development and then basically managing

00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:30,520
to that number obviously will be great

00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:32,260
to exceed it oh yeah that was that was

00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:33,940
what we had to show the investors to

00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,590
bring them to the table you know to

00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:40,060
invest in the sort of combined commerce

00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:41,380
guys yeah oh yeah keep the slide so then

00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:42,280
we end up spinning out mission bicycles

00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,320
official bodies over here its own

00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:46,060
company we raised it basically the

00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,320
equipment like a restaurant kind of

00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,960
friend

00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,250
and family investment not a huge amount

00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,350
of money not from any professional

00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:53,669
investors and then Pam can we ended up

00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:55,980
raising money from that your Venture

00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:59,130
Capital groups and spinning out his own

00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:03,120
office okay somebody headed back to Ryan

00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:06,360
all right so another way to bootstrap it

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:08,309
is just to not sleep to work to work a

00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,230
full-time job and then assist your

00:29:08,309 --> 00:29:14,090
friend on your vacation days and nights

00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:16,110
and weekends with a very forgiving wife

00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:17,519
but with Belle whether it's it's

00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:21,029
literally bootstrapped on Twitter

00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:23,460
bootstrap and again was born out of an

00:29:21,029 --> 00:29:25,320
existing need that my friend had

00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:27,269
discovered in the company he worked at

00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:29,850
so he was from a power company

00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:32,370
developing this model that that sort of

00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:34,490
far exceeded the precision of the

00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:37,049
existing like industry standard model

00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:38,399
because I guess he discovered that the

00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:40,019
industry sort of just thrown up their

00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,259
hands and good enough with respect to

00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:44,429
understanding weather's impact on load

00:29:42,259 --> 00:29:45,929
but it's coming back around again of

00:29:44,429 --> 00:29:48,210
course because of alternative energy and

00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:51,059
so on and so forth and so he discovered

00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:53,009
this new created a solution sold it to a

00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:55,080
CFO all the way down so they

00:29:53,009 --> 00:29:57,059
standardized on his model and then you

00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,740
know whenever like they started to talk

00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:02,340
about what may be other companies might

00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:04,230
be interested in this you know that sort

00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:06,899
of you know he knew he had something

00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:09,629
special that was worthwhile to take and

00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:12,149
build I mean so so bootstrapping mint he

00:30:09,629 --> 00:30:14,700
quit his job and lived on just his

00:30:12,149 --> 00:30:19,710
wife's income which I think runs out

00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:21,960
soon and I assisted and then we just

00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:23,460
started to try to find sales with a

00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:25,169
third friend who just started cold

00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:27,990
calling every utility company what you

00:30:25,169 --> 00:30:29,519
think of and and ultimately like there

00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,539
was there was like this problem that we

00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:31,679
knew we wanted to solve we had a

00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:33,299
solution that was good for it it just

00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,889
looked like our scripts and command line

00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:37,230
output that we formatted in the reports

00:30:34,889 --> 00:30:40,440
for companies but we never actually we

00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:42,029
haven't actually yet sold that thing so

00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,830
instead there were these these other

00:30:42,029 --> 00:30:46,190
conversations with customers where they

00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:49,019
said well we we don't really need to

00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:50,190
apply your model to sales forecasting

00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:51,899
right now but I do have this like

00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:53,730
maintenance issue where I need to

00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:55,200
understand weather's impact on

00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:58,110
number of customers without power per

00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,280
hour ok so the same model can help them

00:30:58,110 --> 00:31:00,270
understand that and produce them a

00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,310
pretty report that they're willing to

00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:04,140
pay thousands of dollars for and then

00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:07,050
there's just the tool that's even

00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:08,760
simpler you know it was a better weather

00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:10,110
forecast because the you know the

00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,010
company with eighty percent market share

00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:15,030
in the forecast data supply space

00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:16,770
literally gives you access to an ftp

00:31:15,030 --> 00:31:18,990
server to download your file and you're

00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:20,160
forced to then customize that reformat

00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:22,410
it and distribute it amongst your team

00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,970
and of course with Drupal we can quickly

00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:26,130
create a user interface that somebody

00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:28,110
can log in tune download reports and so

00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:31,260
it's a really scrappy story right where

00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:32,580
we renew a market and we knew people had

00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,230
problems that weren't being addressed

00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,790
and so then it was okay how we use the

00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:38,130
tools that we have in the very limited

00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:40,710
time that we have to begin to address

00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:42,510
their needs and get money like coming

00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:45,000
through the door and so like this was a

00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:46,560
weekend project literally to create the

00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,030
prototype for them to get there by the

00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:49,290
reports but they're happy to pay six

00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:51,930
thousand dollars a year to have access

00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:53,850
to this site and you know who knows what

00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:56,670
other opportunities there are and so the

00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:58,320
basic framework here for creating a

00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:00,720
product and bootstrapping this business

00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,730
is that you have to have a problem worth

00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,650
solving that you've identified in a

00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:05,880
market that hopefully you know well so

00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:08,010
whether that's everybody should have

00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:11,070
automated backups of their Drupal sites

00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:13,530
or power companies shouldn't have to ftp

00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:14,910
CSVs off of servers and reformat the

00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:17,130
ministry with them there there are

00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:19,140
problems out there that you can find and

00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:20,640
solve so then you have to iterate your

00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:24,090
way toward a solution that actually

00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:25,410
addresses real customers needs so that's

00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:27,810
what's that's what's called finding your

00:32:25,410 --> 00:32:29,640
problem solution fit it's the idea that

00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:31,950
the solution you think is going to solve

00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,350
somebody's problem a pantheon agency

00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,970
dashboard or you know a command-line

00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:38,250
interface for platform whatever it is

00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:40,710
actually does solve people's problems

00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:42,390
and is usable then once you have this

00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:43,530
thing and people are paying you forward

00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:45,690
you now have a product that you're

00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:47,310
testing in the market pricing you know

00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:48,720
determining how to support it etc etc

00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:50,520
that's called finding your product

00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,650
market fit then once you've done that

00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,120
well you can scale it be happy day it's

00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:56,790
it's it's now a matter of creating this

00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:58,650
this sales and marketing engine that can

00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:01,290
that can take this idea and scale it and

00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:04,050
so the idea behind bootstrapping is like

00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:06,660
that you're not necessarily saying no to

00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:07,530
money but you're saying when you're

00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:10,590
saying that it that it's

00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:12,510
better to find some outside investor

00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:14,580
who's interested in multiplying their

00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:17,220
money at a time when you have a model

00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:18,330
that's ready to be multiplied so for all

00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,380
of the businesses that we've been

00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,360
involved with whether it's building

00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,590
bicycles and knowing that this is

00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,740
something that people are going to pay

00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:28,200
money for and and then it can scale or

00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:31,050
building website platforms or e-commerce

00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,840
frameworks or you know tools for power

00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:36,000
companies you find where it can scale

00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:38,130
and then that's a great time then to

00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,870
raise that friends and family round if

00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:41,910
you want to take to the next level or in

00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:44,310
the case of bellwether begin to talk

00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:46,050
with you know early stage investors to

00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:47,880
put together around that can help you

00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:50,010
accelerate specifically that sales and

00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:52,260
marketing and not you know see you

00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:54,570
continue to pour money into building the

00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,700
product that you haven't tested yet and

00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:58,050
so I like everybody's story is different

00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,580
and unique and you learn lessons every

00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:01,050
time you do it but with with Commerce

00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:03,300
guys we sort of lived at this point of

00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:05,250
tension for a long time where you had

00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:07,920
two businesses that we raised money to

00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:09,780
build in one which meant that the

00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,880
services company needed to grow in scale

00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,669
but it also needed to supply money to

00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:16,230
the platform that Sh team and company

00:34:14,669 --> 00:34:19,320
and say there's this this is real

00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:22,470
tension that that kind of came maybe

00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:25,200
from from a bit of premature premature

00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:27,540
like scaling like there was no real

00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,040
product yet at the time so I'm sure we

00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:31,919
could analyze it but but the big idea is

00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,750
that you know it was a longer path

00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:35,820
toward finding that product market fit

00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:37,890
and now we're going to have to separate

00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,210
on the tail end the two businesses and

00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:40,860
distinguish them so that we can scale

00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:44,220
them both on their own terms that so

00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:45,480
it's just you can either go I guess one

00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,490
way or the other or one of a hundred

00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,320
different ways but at the end of the day

00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:51,659
you're still having to follow the same

00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,970
basic pattern to grow and scale a

00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:55,649
product company and there are tools that

00:34:53,970 --> 00:34:58,710
help you do this I'm probably the best

00:34:55,649 --> 00:35:00,150
tool that we used just to help my

00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,430
friends sort of think about how to

00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:04,800
productize a data model or an algorithm

00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:06,450
was what's called a lean canvas and it

00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,070
just forces you to put down on one sheet

00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:09,750
of paper you know what is the problem

00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:12,000
that you're trying to solve what is your

00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,380
solution how do you evaluate your

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,780
solutions effectiveness what's your

00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,830
unfair advantage who your customers how

00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,810
you're going to reach them what's your

00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:20,490
revenue model etc etc and it's all in

00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:22,770
one piece of paper

00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:24,240
you can really quickly you know one like

00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:25,410
like just make sure you understand what

00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,360
you're trying to do together as a

00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:29,369
business but also use that didn't to

00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,200
speak to potential investors if that's

00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:33,000
the route you're going I mean I think

00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,460
that you know Zach you thrown some books

00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,050
on there that would be also helpful yes

00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,210
so I just want to reiterate that so

00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:40,830
right when we were starting Pantheon we

00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:43,700
were both three of us for very good

00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:45,990
engineers one of us was a faker me and

00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:48,090
you know that the impulse was let's

00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:49,740
start coding we know what to build let's

00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:52,200
start building it oh I love building

00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:54,180
things but instead we force ourselves to

00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,280
go through this lean startup process we

00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:58,110
literally bought this workbook which is

00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:01,920
not a very well produced workbook which

00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:03,750
was really like do the lean a custom

00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,580
development process step by step by step

00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:07,080
like paint by numbers and we did that

00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,000
and it was one of the best things we

00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,610
ever did because it saved us literally

00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,900
thousands of hours of lost effort

00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:15,450
building product that no one would have

00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:18,660
wanted it's it's just all about I mean

00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:22,020
you should never write code it before

00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:23,340
you do this process I'm such a believer

00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,780
in this at this point because the

00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,980
biggest mistakes you will make is just

00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:29,070
building stuff that people won't buy

00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:30,330
valuable I think one of the things that

00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:31,740
really blew my mind about the lean

00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:34,770
startup and running lean and other books

00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:37,680
like that is that the MVP is like a

00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:39,119
wireframe you know it's not I've now

00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,410
built my drupal distribution and i can

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:42,480
go and install and demo it to somebody

00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:43,890
it's it's literally just well what if we

00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,600
did like something like this would that

00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:47,220
be interesting to you and it's just

00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,080
enough to get you to the next iteration

00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:51,290
of testing your hypothesis until you

00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:54,540
finally know what you're going to build

00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:58,430
yep alright so we're continuing our tour

00:36:54,540 --> 00:37:03,780
of business lectures were an hour 29

00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:05,220
okay management 101 so this is a my

00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,840
little spiel and co-founder

00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,580
relationships and building co-founding

00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,260
teams but I really think applies to just

00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:13,140
building teams in general and

00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:14,970
specifically early teams so and I'm

00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,770
totally stealing this this isn't gives

00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:19,200
an old Steve Jobs quote where he you

00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:22,950
know it's it's the best model of

00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,810
building teams is the Beatles so here's

00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:27,270
why this example of this example so the

00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:29,220
Beatles were you know the best band

00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:31,230
arguably the last whatever a hundred

00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:34,050
years you can argue the point but

00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:35,730
phenomenal band but as individual

00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:38,010
solo acts not that fun I mean pretty

00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:40,290
good but not like you know earth-shaking

00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:42,900
and it just turns out that you know

00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:45,300
these four gentlemen as individuals were

00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:48,150
you know okay musicians like pretty good

00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:50,250
musicians but the things that they were

00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:52,080
individually really good at they were

00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:53,550
really good at and the things that they

00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:55,800
were not good at someone else in the

00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,870
band covered up and as a group they were

00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:00,840
able is really an example of four

00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:04,320
individuals performing much better than

00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:08,940
one plus one plus one plus one they as a

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:10,710
group where we r you know a phenomenal

00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:11,790
act and I think the apply the same thing

00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,990
with co-founders like the best kind of

00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:15,450
co-founder relationships you would think

00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:16,770
would be like oh I like you you like me

00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:20,400
we're really good friends or both

00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:23,040
awesome at the same thing what's the

00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,320
problem with that is the jobs you need

00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:28,440
to do at a startup cover so many degrees

00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,240
of operation that what usually leads to

00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,920
is you know the things that you're best

00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,660
at you're both trying to do the same

00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:36,270
thing and then all those other stuff

00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,470
just gets kind of ignored I think the

00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,520
best kind of co find relationships are

00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:40,050
the ones where you're just totally

00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,250
different mean you like each other you

00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:43,080
work really well but you're just really

00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:45,600
good at different stuff so the things

00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:47,250
that you love to dude you can love to do

00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:49,770
the things that you hate to do your

00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:51,420
co-founder is amazing at that's a great

00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:52,890
co-founder relationship and where the

00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:55,500
things that you're really are just kind

00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:57,990
of not good at someone else is covering

00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,850
your weakness and I think that's you

00:38:57,990 --> 00:39:01,560
know that that is my kind of mantra for

00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:05,670
for team building and certainly applies

00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:09,900
in coke on relationships thanks and then

00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:11,730
you know before I for speak to this side

00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:15,180
of mine I actually add to the the team

00:39:11,730 --> 00:39:17,310
the team slide is it there's something

00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:19,980
to be said for like equal levels of

00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:22,200
motivation and like interest in the

00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:23,910
thing you're building and like if one

00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,050
person's interest really Wayne's I could

00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:27,270
say it's really time to kick him out of

00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:29,130
the band and replace them with some of

00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:31,110
that is interested in megan's because we

00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:33,570
we just experienced this at Commerce

00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:35,010
guys were my two original founders you

00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:37,140
know my contentment no longer at the

00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:39,840
business and and it was really a case of

00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:41,220
you know one person's interest just

00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:42,420
wasn't his heart wasn't in the business

00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,520
because he didn't know what to do or how

00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:46,230
to contribute and ultimately just need

00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,869
to needed to move on

00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:51,210
and then you know the other partner like

00:39:48,869 --> 00:39:52,410
the this may be had as much to do with

00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,880
the distributed nature of our business

00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:55,140
as anything else but like just the

00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,730
relationship wasn't working in his

00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:58,710
interest again like wow you know I'm

00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:00,510
having to do sales I'm not really

00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:02,070
interested in just like doing sales so

00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:04,590
maybe I'll just go and build a product

00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:05,820
somewhere else you know like not knowing

00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:08,190
ahead of time what your levels of

00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:09,840
interests are and keeping like keeping

00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:11,850
really close tabs on that and being able

00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,740
to like ask that like as your head still

00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:15,510
in the game and if not like it's cool

00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:17,520
like we just need to plan for the health

00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:18,960
of the business not for you know

00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,420
dragging you along some or you don't

00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,770
want to be and I guess maybe part of the

00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:25,500
way to make sure that you all stay in

00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:27,600
line is to have that like shared vision

00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,609
for what you're doing together and then

00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:32,100
also to approach it from like a shared

00:40:29,609 --> 00:40:33,859
set of values and I'm one of the things

00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,910
that strikes me about Zach and his

00:40:33,859 --> 00:40:37,650
presentation of his businesses is that

00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:39,810
you know first with pantheon you know

00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:41,369
you know the mission of Pantheon this to

00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:43,440
power the vision is to power thirty

00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:45,090
percent of the web and that's that's um

00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,430
that can really drive their business

00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:48,570
decisions now they can acquire a node

00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,950
squirrel because they know that that's

00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:51,750
going to get them further toward

00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:53,910
powering thirty percent of the web they

00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:55,530
can expand into WordPress because that's

00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:57,990
going to get them closer to powering

00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:59,940
thirty percent of the web and I really

00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:02,040
think you were the first Drupal like you

00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,770
know company like platform hosting

00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:06,480
company whatever to go that direction

00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:07,980
and it's because it does align perfectly

00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,180
with their vision and if there was

00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,560
something that wouldn't get them toward

00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:12,390
that vision I think they would say no to

00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,040
it because they have well you know this

00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:16,260
North Star that's that calls it guiding

00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:18,840
them toward a specific point together

00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:20,970
the other thing was you know values are

00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,770
really important and so with with

00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:25,590
mission bicycle the values that you guys

00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:27,570
shared were to have personal remarkable

00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:30,180
reliable city bikes you know the best

00:41:27,570 --> 00:41:32,070
ones in the world and you know that

00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:33,690
turned into what seems to be a really

00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:36,180
great business and fantastic looking

00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:38,700
bicycles that I assume are also personal

00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:40,230
and remarkable and reliable and so

00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,220
there's there's this real neat if you're

00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:42,780
trying to set out to do something

00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:44,160
different and something new and

00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:46,770
something together with other people

00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:49,950
which I also recommend it's it's

00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:51,630
difficult so doing it with a team it's

00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:54,960
kind of statistically proven to be more

00:41:51,630 --> 00:41:57,570
successful than doing it on your own but

00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:59,820
to talk up front about this this vision

00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:01,860
and values is really really critical

00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:03,090
to the long term health and success of

00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,650
the business and you're not going to

00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,880
have to try to figure that out retro

00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:08,370
actively as you're already moving

00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,420
somewhere especially if you're doing it

00:42:08,370 --> 00:42:11,850
from within the context of like a

00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:13,890
services company and trying to bootstrap

00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:16,020
something and spin it out like literally

00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:18,480
the only way to change the culture of a

00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:21,000
services company is to like change all

00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:22,320
the people in it and even then you're

00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,190
still the same person and so you're

00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,530
probably going to end up with the same

00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:27,540
culture similar to what you would create

00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:30,240
it before so having the set in advance

00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:32,070
is is really key to any kind of company

00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,600
but certainly to you know a product

00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:35,550
business that has a very long game in

00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:37,920
mind and can be very stressful and

00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:39,390
involve fundraising and really weird

00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,820
incentives and perverse incentives

00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:43,230
anyways so that's that's my my

00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:45,360
management going to pick is is really

00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:46,910
leading from values is the only way

00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:49,380
you're going to make it happen

00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:51,180
especially because there are so many

00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:53,310
distractions there's so many things that

00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:55,890
we could do with this whole bellwether

00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:57,210
idea needs that we could meet that would

00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:59,220
just be a distraction of people we could

00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:01,080
partner with I think we were discussing

00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,790
this earlier there was a business that

00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:05,520
wanted to partner with bellwether to go

00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:07,920
and sell in like into power companies

00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:11,130
through maintenance departments and that

00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,440
that wasn't really like the strength of

00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:15,570
the model and so if there was no like

00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,950
really really strong vision directing it

00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:19,560
towards now we're really more about this

00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:20,580
sales forecasting and analysis like that

00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:21,360
would have been all well here's

00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:22,860
something that wants to do something

00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,180
with us and help us make money sure you

00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,950
know he might be able to help this

00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:27,120
product really take off but it would

00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:29,310
have been the wrong decision for the

00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:30,990
business even if it did result in like

00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:32,250
some short-term revenue because it just

00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:35,370
was the wrong revenue it wasn't

00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:36,990
strategic and I think you know maybe one

00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:39,120
final example from commerce guys then on

00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:41,220
we can wrap it up and take questions and

00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:44,430
we have is this whole commerce kickstart

00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:47,400
and marketplace idea where we do have

00:43:44,430 --> 00:43:49,470
strategic marketplace partners that we

00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,210
integrate into Drupal commerce for the

00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:52,710
sake of growing their business and then

00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:56,370
you know repeating these reaping these

00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:58,860
sort of affiliate bonuses as a result

00:43:56,370 --> 00:44:00,510
and you know whenever you look at all of

00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:02,010
the people out there providing services

00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:04,950
to e-commerce companies there's there's

00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:06,660
hundreds of them and so that the the

00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:08,460
real temptation is to say well let's

00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,750
just integrate them all and chase them

00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,890
all down and get them all to the table

00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,539
and then put them all into commerce

00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:14,160
kickstart which then creates a

00:44:12,539 --> 00:44:15,299
you know makes for a bloated commerce

00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,039
kickstart that's more difficult to

00:44:15,299 --> 00:44:18,869
maintain and doesn't actually have any

00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:22,199
long-term impact on your profitability

00:44:18,869 --> 00:44:23,729
you have to have some some vision and in

00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:26,400
some rubric that that allows you to say

00:44:23,729 --> 00:44:28,319
no to these 200 companies yes to these

00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,819
three and then you know actually find

00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:32,699
the relationships and then the path

00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:34,799
forward that works so vision values

00:44:32,699 --> 00:44:37,439
there's books about that as well okay

00:44:34,799 --> 00:44:42,630
but it's a very healthy and necessary

00:44:37,439 --> 00:44:44,249
exercise excellent Thank You Ryan I'm

00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:45,269
gonna yeah I'm going to keep this slide

00:44:44,249 --> 00:44:51,269
up and then we're going to take

00:44:45,269 --> 00:44:54,449
questions we have ten minutes left yeah

00:44:51,269 --> 00:44:57,269
hi um I did this presentation last heat

00:44:54,449 --> 00:44:59,249
well something similar last year about

00:44:57,269 --> 00:45:00,900
Drupal and startups and one of the key

00:44:59,249 --> 00:45:04,529
questions that people ask me was like so

00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:07,319
but what modules should i use and and i

00:45:04,529 --> 00:45:09,839
thought a lot about that and i've

00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:12,959
actually i've started putting together a

00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:14,969
udemy course that's going to answer that

00:45:12,959 --> 00:45:18,209
and a few of other things just like

00:45:14,969 --> 00:45:20,099
drupal for start-up so like prototyping

00:45:18,209 --> 00:45:21,449
with drupal and i'm going to be handing

00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:24,119
out flyers for that so if you want

00:45:21,449 --> 00:45:30,719
something about that just think I info

00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:32,699
thanks Krista yeah in once on my mind I

00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:34,229
didn't mention earlier but if you don't

00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:36,439
have the kind of services company that

00:45:34,229 --> 00:45:38,429
can incubate and spin out a product

00:45:36,439 --> 00:45:39,809
there may actually be companies

00:45:38,429 --> 00:45:42,059
exhibiting in the hall that have

00:45:39,809 --> 00:45:43,469
programs to do that sort of thing so I

00:45:42,059 --> 00:45:44,789
know that aqueon now starting to see

00:45:43,469 --> 00:45:47,609
that they're doing that that's sort of a

00:45:44,789 --> 00:45:50,699
program within you know kind of juices

00:45:47,609 --> 00:45:51,809
octo sort of Beast and then I then you

00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:53,849
can also look at the example of like a

00:45:51,809 --> 00:45:56,069
web form com which was essentially spun

00:45:53,849 --> 00:45:59,219
out of Lola bought through Nate hug so

00:45:56,069 --> 00:46:00,929
that you know you know becoming a profit

00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:03,569
machine in your own strength is not the

00:46:00,929 --> 00:46:06,150
only path toward doing that what would

00:46:03,569 --> 00:46:08,009
you say about building a business for

00:46:06,150 --> 00:46:10,439
the sake of getting acquired like

00:46:08,009 --> 00:46:12,869
getting acquired by Pantheon or Acquia

00:46:10,439 --> 00:46:15,599
Drupal commerce are the commerce guys

00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:17,939
like would you say like should you first

00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,559
start producing value or should you talk

00:46:17,939 --> 00:46:21,989
with those people that you might want to

00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:25,530
get acquired by to see what you actually

00:46:21,989 --> 00:46:28,290
should build AI think that

00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:29,640
and this is so when people ask me

00:46:28,290 --> 00:46:31,560
questions like that I usually answer

00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:33,450
with actually the only way to answer

00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:36,030
that question is to answer what do you

00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:37,800
want to do with your life which we do

00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:39,450
not have time for but I think that's

00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,420
really what it comes down to it comes

00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:44,820
down to your back to this slide what is

00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:46,950
your vision for the company what is the

00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:49,740
what is the goal you have personally for

00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:51,030
the business and then and then when you

00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,900
can answer that you can work backwards

00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:57,360
from there in terms of the right path to

00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:58,800
build your business whether it's joining

00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:00,030
forces and being acquired eventually

00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,430
whether it's going public whether it's

00:47:00,030 --> 00:47:04,260
being independent forever as a as a kind

00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:05,730
of i don't mean it's interrogatory way

00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,990
but a lifestyle business lifestyle

00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:09,180
businesses are great mission bicycle is

00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:10,530
a lifestyle business I think when you

00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:12,690
know you have to start there to really

00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:14,850
answer that question but I don't think

00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:17,490
it's bad to have that goal in mind like

00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:19,230
yeah building a business to have an exit

00:47:17,490 --> 00:47:21,780
is actually like a pretty legitimate

00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:24,360
strategy after absolutely thank you I

00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:28,230
didn't I didn't see AOL going to verizon

00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:30,330
coming but so so building a product on

00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:33,030
an open source framework like drupal how

00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:35,850
do you think that changes the evaluation

00:47:33,030 --> 00:47:38,760
when you're talking to VCS and then does

00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:40,230
that have an effect on exit so when

00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:42,840
you're trying to sell it because it does

00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:46,950
have sort of a open source framework as

00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:49,500
a kernel of the product yeah so yeah

00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:51,690
there is a slight challenge in the sense

00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:55,530
that the software you're building

00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:57,180
everything on it's not like privately

00:47:55,530 --> 00:47:59,580
owned you know intellectual property i

00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:04,260
guess i mean it's kind of public domain

00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:08,370
in a sense but at the end of the day you

00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:10,770
know like a business like ours it's not

00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:13,860
usually valued i don't think you know

00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:16,830
for its you know for the license of its

00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:18,330
code you know if you can you can build a

00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:20,610
great business on open source software

00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:21,960
that has fantastic revenue and that's

00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:26,070
what what really matters in long-term

00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:27,840
client relationships and so on you know

00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:30,480
with with commerce guy specifically

00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:31,800
we've never really had an issue you know

00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,150
of course our business was built around

00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,130
drupal commerce and commerce kickstart

00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:37,410
but then you come into like a platform

00:48:35,130 --> 00:48:38,850
sh and that's not open source the code

00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:40,740
behind that is proprietary

00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:42,780
and that intellectual property is

00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:44,580
valuable in its own but even so like

00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:46,200
just because that is like privately

00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:47,880
owned intellectual property like we

00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,830
couldn't necessarily just go sell it

00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:52,020
because it is something that we can sell

00:48:49,830 --> 00:48:53,820
it still has to be a business that makes

00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:55,560
sense for somebody to get and that's

00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:56,700
going to come back to well how many

00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,860
customers do you have what's the

00:48:56,700 --> 00:49:02,670
lifetime value what's the acquisition

00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:05,730
costs and so on so I haven't seen it to

00:49:02,670 --> 00:49:06,870
be a problem but but it will change the

00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:10,650
kind of business that you build a

00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:12,750
building and notes grows a great example

00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:15,660
I mean it was just a GPL module that

00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:18,650
added value and then what was sold was

00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:22,110
that that value in and that experience

00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:24,600
so the automaker John DeLorean wrote

00:49:22,110 --> 00:49:27,660
about setting goals and he envisioned a

00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:29,340
high jumper who claimed he would train

00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:32,820
to the point where he could jump 30 feet

00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:34,770
in the air and he works works and works

00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:37,320
and works and he ends up jumping 20 feet

00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:40,080
and obtaining the world record but

00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:42,150
coming you know far short of his goal so

00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:44,100
you know was he a success or a failure

00:49:42,150 --> 00:49:45,630
you know and it's like when you talk

00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:47,100
about you know pantheon and Pantheon

00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:49,260
said you know we want to host one

00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:51,450
percent of the world's websites that

00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:53,340
would sound like a very ambitious goal

00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:55,830
to me but obviously it's much smaller

00:49:53,340 --> 00:49:57,420
than your goal so how do you know how

00:49:55,830 --> 00:50:00,110
far to shoot when you're shooting for

00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:02,940
the moon so it's a very good question

00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:04,200
well so and I think this the same

00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:06,150
question applies to anyone doing a

00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:08,970
venture tech sorry venture-backed

00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:11,460
startup because again it's back to like

00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:12,840
if you're going to really do this you're

00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:14,550
really are we going to have to shoot for

00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:18,060
the moon that's the reason to raise

00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:20,280
venture capital and there's this kind of

00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:23,190
duality we're on one side of your your

00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:26,190
brain it be incredibly rational in not

00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:27,840
deluded and tactical and strategic and

00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,250
on the other side of your brain you have

00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,230
to you have to shoot for the moon and be

00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:35,400
crazy and how do you deal with that

00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:37,320
duality and I don't I don't have an

00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:39,750
answer other than you have to do it like

00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:41,790
you have to be able to flip between both

00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:44,280
sides your brain which is what is most

00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:46,800
important to do now what is going to

00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:49,890
work now what is the strategy now what

00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,930
isn't working and and then you know back

00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:52,500
to well if we were to do this and this

00:50:51,930 --> 00:50:54,810
and this

00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:56,460
within three years five years ten years

00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:58,710
how are we going to position ourselves

00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:01,260
in this company to hit the 30-foot high

00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:03,840
jump and I think you need a you know you

00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:06,390
have to you can't lie to yourself right

00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:08,970
you have to actually believe that it's

00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:10,590
possible to go down a path where you

00:51:08,970 --> 00:51:12,600
could run third percent the web or hit a

00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:14,640
30-foot high jump or whatever this goal

00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:16,860
is even if that the chances of achieving

00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,330
and are very small if it's rap if it's

00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:23,610
believable and you believe it's possible

00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:27,210
then you know it's a viable goal hey I

00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:30,960
love the I love the example of of the

00:51:27,210 --> 00:51:33,270
bellwether and I and and boots tramping

00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,920
a start-up from from from nowhere you

00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:37,650
know art from you know out of an

00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:40,890
existing you know an existing services

00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:43,050
company and I like the experience canvas

00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:45,060
and I've used that myself but i think

00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:46,950
you know i'm always curious when I hear

00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:49,170
people talk about this you know about

00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:51,330
the experience canvas and you know

00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:55,140
because I feel that there's a gap in it

00:51:51,330 --> 00:51:57,240
you know and I'm curious you know you

00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:59,340
you had an epiphany moment right with

00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:02,160
bellwether what were your in the middle

00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:03,690
of a services kind of or you're

00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,970
connected with somebody who's performing

00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:07,620
services for a type of a customer and

00:52:05,970 --> 00:52:08,460
you know that there's a need there you

00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:11,880
know that somebody's doing something

00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:13,200
wrong right but a lot of the great ideas

00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,960
and the great companies come out of an

00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,490
idea that just didn't exist before at

00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,560
all and there's nothing in lean that

00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:21,120
really covers that you know lean doesn't

00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:24,800
let you make Twitter because nobody

00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:27,000
needed tweets you know before Twitter so

00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,500
how do you you know when you're when

00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:31,620
you're trying to think of like ideas in

00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:33,030
that vein what do you see it is there

00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:35,100
something that fills that gap for you

00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:38,040
for like you know wait ideation I'm

00:52:35,100 --> 00:52:39,360
presently maybe a bit boring in that

00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,830
like I kind of feel like I need to make

00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:43,500
some money first before I can afford

00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:46,680
myself the luxury to create something

00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:49,140
new in it but it's really just a

00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:50,880
personal decision I can speak to that

00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:53,010
directly but there's a book called zero

00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,050
to one have you heard of it no I have

00:52:53,010 --> 00:52:57,780
not ok so zero to one is specifically

00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:59,490
about that question how do you like like

00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:01,500
yeah like there are already a hundred

00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:03,450
companies delivering analytics services

00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:05,280
to power companies and bellwether is

00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:05,880
just like another one that does it a

00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:08,130
little bit better

00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:10,110
but 0 to 1 is about going from there

00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:11,490
being no facebook to there being a

00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:13,980
facebook or there being no twitter to

00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:16,800
there being a Twitter and my I can't

00:53:13,980 --> 00:53:19,650
resent horowitz that wrote that to Peter

00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,360
Thiel Peter Thiel my bed yeah so that's

00:53:19,650 --> 00:53:23,220
a good check that I'm being that and

00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:25,710
thank you in a few of it I one more note

00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:27,480
I definitely think the lean customer

00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:28,860
development approach sorry the customer

00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,770
development proach is really about

00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:33,360
enterprise startups I don't know or I've

00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:35,790
never tried to apply it to a consumer

00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:37,410
startup for exactly that reason I think

00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:38,850
you could in parts but I think there's a

00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:45,000
lot more applicability a tener by

00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:46,590
startup cool thank you my question is

00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,790
around something I think you addressed a

00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:49,320
little bit already and talking about

00:53:47,790 --> 00:53:51,570
sort of like building an agency and

00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:53,580
working into the budget that new startup

00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:55,800
and like what your profit margins have

00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:57,000
to be just to start that do you have any

00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,640
additional comments and sort of the

00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,890
wisdom or the folly of like trying to do

00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:03,990
both of these simultaneously launching a

00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:06,450
agency and at the same time trying to

00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:10,770
have a sort of sight business so for you

00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:13,020
I have a special slide so this is his

00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:14,640
fellows James Lindenbaum he's very near

00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:16,920
and dear to my heart he was our first

00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:18,390
adviser and investor at Pantheon first

00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,400
one really outside of the company really

00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:23,880
believed in us so he's also the founder

00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:28,140
co-founder of Heroku and chief great

00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:30,300
like real success there and you know he

00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:32,760
was a very early advisor so I like sent

00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:35,340
him out cold email and got in touch with

00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:37,890
him and you know convince him to go out

00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:39,330
to coffee with me we got coffee and it

00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:41,610
gave me a really good advice and then I

00:54:39,330 --> 00:54:42,780
got Josh and Matt and David together we

00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:44,730
talked about a really nice restaurant

00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:46,260
delfina in San Francisco we got really

00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:48,540
great advice from James it was amazing

00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:49,860
and Heroku at the time was a pre

00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:52,500
acquisition was doing really really well

00:54:49,860 --> 00:54:54,900
and we leave the restaurant and he turns

00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:56,520
to all of us and says and into the

00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:58,110
backstory for him is he actually say

00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:02,220
they spun Heroku out of consulting

00:54:58,110 --> 00:55:04,320
company called bit scribe and had a very

00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:06,150
similar path so he turns to us and says

00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:08,160
are you guys going to start this

00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:09,540
pantheon company or what because you're

00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,130
going to start this pantheon company you

00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:13,710
would fire yourselves from chapter 3 and

00:55:11,130 --> 00:55:14,850
really do it and we were like like our

00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:17,850
kind of stunned and look each others

00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:19,110
like he is totally right and so that's

00:55:17,850 --> 00:55:19,770
we ended up doing we actually decided

00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:21,030
we're really

00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:23,190
do this we're really going to do it we

00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:24,810
didn't fire ourselves overnight but we

00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:26,130
set a plan in place where we would

00:55:24,810 --> 00:55:28,170
extricate ourselves from

00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:30,000
responsibilities at chapter 3 and

00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:31,650
commensurately a management team in

00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:34,100
chapter 3 took over the business and so

00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:37,580
they'd run it today it's very hard it's

00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:37,580
