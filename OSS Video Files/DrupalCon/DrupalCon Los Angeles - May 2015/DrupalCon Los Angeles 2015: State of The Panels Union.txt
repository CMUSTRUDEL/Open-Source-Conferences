talk or cover the state of the union for

00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:22,080
the panel's ecosystem and a lot of

00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:26,160
things it encompasses and we are your

00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,760
panelists for the day and there may be

00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,870

00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,789
Atlanta we build some pretty cool things

00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,699
and for the last several years we've

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:57,930
been heavily involved involved in the

00:00:53,699 --> 00:01:02,430
panel's system and contributing and

00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:05,250
improving it I'm also honored to

00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:08,670
introduce our other panels today we have

00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:12,500
Caroline Boyden a web developer from UC

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:15,840
Berkeley we have David's no pec a

00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:19,890

00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:23,040
calm and Jacob Perry dripless with the

00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:26,310
drupal association and Tim Plunkett a

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,259
senior engineer with aquia and we're

00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:30,990
going to present different pieces today

00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:34,200
and at the end you'll get to answer or

00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:36,930
ask questions we ask you to please all

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:42,840
the questions to the end and so we can

00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:44,820
get through our notes first so our

00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,780
agenda today is fairly simple we're

00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:51,240
going to cover the past of the panel's

00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,970
ecosystem the present and where we're

00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,560
looking to take it in the future so

00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,409
before we get into that I just want to

00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,780
give a brief explanation as to what

00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:06,590
panels is and

00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:10,979
so panels is power its editorial

00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:14,310
flexibility for a site it provides a lot

00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,830
of flexibility and functionality most

00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:20,510
witches through a fairly straightforward

00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:23,010
drag-and-drop interface it's also a

00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:26,069
flexibility there is tremendous amount

00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:28,550
of flexibility provided by it through

00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:31,700
standalone pages entity integration

00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:34,410
custom layouts revisions

00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:38,220
internationalization inline editing on

00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:40,200
and on and on it's also a system called

00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,320
context not to be confused with the

00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,840
contacts module but it's an ability for

00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:51,120
a piece on a page to have some

00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:56,400
consideration for where it is it's also

00:02:51,120 --> 00:03:01,440
extensibility it has a fairly solid API

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:05,579
and with both normal hooks but it's all

00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:10,709
its own plug-in system and it's also

00:03:05,579 --> 00:03:13,769
speed along with its plug-in system that

00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:15,390
only loads things when it's needed it

00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:17,670
has a huge amount of flexibility for

00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:21,720
controlling the caching of pages and

00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:24,060
have they work and it's also site

00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:27,150
control pretty much everything is

00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,730
exportable using a standard CTools

00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:32,790
exportable system but also with features

00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:37,650
that is obviously haven't have used on

00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:42,019
Drupal 7 and it's safe there is a

00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:44,519
tremendous amount of permissions

00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:48,420
available for different things that you

00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:51,810
can do with panels and that allows you

00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:54,180
to narrowly control what different

00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:58,769
people within an organization and

00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:01,109
manager site can do so you can remove

00:03:58,769 --> 00:04:03,810
things that somebody hasn't had training

00:04:01,109 --> 00:04:05,970
to use yet and as they gain more

00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,590
experience and get more training you can

00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,959
give them more and more control over the

00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:13,050
system and it's also at this point

00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:16,560
relatively we feel very stable

00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:20,030
for use on a site and we think it's kind

00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,370
of awesome so in summary its power

00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:29,070
flexibility context extensibility speed

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:33,020
psych control and safe so awesome so at

00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:37,440
that note let me pass it over to Jacob

00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:40,650
hello so I'm Jacob I'm one of the

00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,720
containers for panels NC tools and so a

00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,760
little brief history because people ask

00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,580
oh this panels do this panels do that

00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:50,310
and I hear a lot about pass so how many

00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:55,350
people here were drupal 4.7 anyone use

00:04:50,310 --> 00:05:00,510
panels for points wow panels in 4.7 what

00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:04,230
I know you yeah 47 let's do block

00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:07,470
layouts 2006 I was just a little paddle

00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:10,800
on and yeah it was awesome pretty simple

00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:13,590
good little MVP didn't do a whole lot

00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,980
yet but it was neat so panels to then

00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,660
came out Sam Boyer joined so you know

00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,910
that's a whole bunch of coolness how

00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:25,620
many people used panels to in Drupal

00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:29,220
five no good good good yeah a little

00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:30,870
more flexibility needed views you know

00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,990
that's sort of what started the whole

00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:38,130
caching and context debate do i use

00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:40,530
context i use panels and and you know it

00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:45,270
was still in its infancy how many people

00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:47,700
use panels to in Drupal 6 I even more

00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,930
even more cool cool cool okay so so

00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:53,490
we're getting there we're getting there

00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:55,320
so Drupal 6 had panels three and i

00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:58,260
presume almost everyone here is using

00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:01,380
panels three right how many people got

00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:05,040
pals three okay let me reverse that how

00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:08,160
many people aren't using panels okay ree

00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:09,930
nice nice okay so yeah now we're using c

00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:15,030
tools which is a collection of AP is

00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:17,669
that i would i call core plus it has a

00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:19,950
whole bunch of awesome new features in

00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:21,990
Drupal 6 it was a little bit slow but

00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:23,370
cash was starting to get there a lot of

00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,670
the things that we hadn't done yet in

00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,650
Drupal 7 we

00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:29,200
getting started we had the ipe editor

00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:32,650
and that context versus panels thing

00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:35,770
kept you know persevering but we had

00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:37,570
more flexibility and we even had you

00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:39,040
know we have quite a few people using it

00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:41,380
we still have a lot of people using it

00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:45,610
to this day those bumps you can ignore

00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:47,740
those yeah so so Drupal 6 panels was

00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:50,170
awesome and that sort of led us to

00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,450
Drupal 7 which we will talk about here

00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:56,250
in a moment but I wanted to really quick

00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:56,250
how many people are using Drupal 6 still

00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:08,020
okay so this next slide is fun for you

00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:11,860
so its status is frozen let it go so

00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:14,740
there will be one final release after

00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:16,300
that final release their security fixes

00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:18,760
only and we're going to follow the

00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:20,710
Drupal 6 core support window so when

00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,440
Drupal 8 comes out we have three months

00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:26,710
after that and then when core security

00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:29,170
releases stop so will the panels and see

00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:31,780
tools releases so that's that's where

00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:34,150
we're going there with that and other

00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,460
wise no further development in Drupal 6

00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:38,620
all the stuff will be in Drupal 7 you'll

00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:40,690
see there's an asterisk I'll keep the

00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,240
dream alive if you want to become a d6

00:07:40,690 --> 00:07:46,060
branch maintainer low commitment because

00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,840
this time next year you'll be out of a

00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:52,120
job as the branch maintainer so yes

00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,550
these are actually the remaining issues

00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,710
for Drupal 6 there's what one two three

00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:59,620
four five six seven eight my hope is

00:07:56,710 --> 00:08:02,110
that possibly for those Drupal 6 people

00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:03,640
come to the Sprint's on Friday that sort

00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:07,390
of recurring theme that I'll start right

00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:10,090
now let's get those are TBC issues and

00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:11,710
roll the Drupal 6 version and I really

00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:13,270
really love a Drupal 6 person to come

00:08:11,710 --> 00:08:17,290
because I totally forgot what ripple sex

00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:19,470
was about that said let's go to the

00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,470
present

00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,230
hi everyone if you don't remember from

00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:28,870
the introductions the beginning I'm

00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:31,510
David snowpack decent OPEC on drupal.org

00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:34,030
I'm one of the co maintained errs of

00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:36,160
panoply the other two containers are

00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:38,080
Matt Cheney at Pantheon and Tom

00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:40,750
Kirkpatrick at system seed just want to

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,000
give a quick shout out to Pantheon back

00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:45,130
in December my first child was born and

00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,170
I was talking to Matt Cheney and told

00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:49,210
him hey man I'm not going to be able to

00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:51,940
contribute to monopoly like I did in the

00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:53,530
past and he was able to get Pantheon to

00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,480
step up and start sponsoring my work

00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:59,050
company so I can continue contributing

00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:01,060
to its I'm very grateful to them so

00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:03,040
earlier Damien was talking about all the

00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,990
power and flexibility that comes with

00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:07,210
panels but this is actually kind of one

00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:09,700
of panels weaknesses right it can almost

00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:11,140
do too many awesome things when you

00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,630
install panels and open up the page

00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:16,450
manager you're essentially facing a

00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:18,490
blank canvas with infinite options a new

00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:20,350
user might ask what are some things that

00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:22,870
I can do with panels you know what can't

00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:24,490
you do with panels right even an

00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:25,900
advanced user has been using panels for

00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:27,280
many years might not know the full

00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,790
breadth of things that you can do with

00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:34,120
it personally I kind of hated panels

00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:37,480
until I found monopoly you know there's

00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,010
all these new concepts new terms new

00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:40,990
tools there's kind of a steep learning

00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,400
curve and all I wanted to do was put a

00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:44,550
block and a layout and I thought you

00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:47,680
know what do I need all this stuff for

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:49,630
but it was actually a panoply that led

00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,310
me to fall in love with panels and start

00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,350
digging into you know how is it doing

00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:55,030
that how can i change it how can i

00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:57,310
extend it how can i take that and use it

00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:59,050
somewhere else and you know eventually

00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:01,510
led me to become as involved in the

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,560
panel's ecosystem as i am now so i'm

00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:04,870
really excited that there were a couple

00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,460
people here who said that they don't use

00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:10,420
panels so when we're looking at

00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:11,770
panopticon you know help encourage you

00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:15,610
to see you know some of the things that

00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:18,250
panels can do so yeah by looking at

00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:19,990
panopticon find some inspiration for

00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:21,760
some things that panels can do that

00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:24,850
maybe you didn't know about next time

00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:28,000
you're in front of that blank canvas so

00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:30,160
panoply is many things but one thing it

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,290
absolutely is not it is not a module

00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,310
it's not something that you put in your

00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:35,770
sights all modules

00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:38,830
folder and enable but you can do is

00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:40,090
install it as a distribution who here is

00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:42,610
familiar with the idea of a Drupal

00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:45,070
distribution awesome quite a few people

00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:48,070
so a drupal distribution is Drupal core

00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:50,170
plus some controls themes some default

00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:52,900
configuration that you install just like

00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:55,210
Drupal core I accept out of the box it

00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,470
has some additional functionality so for

00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:58,060
example there's the restaurant

00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,250
distribution for creating restaurant

00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:02,440
websites you install it just like Drupal

00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:05,050
core but out of the box it has an online

00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:07,150
menu in online reservation system map

00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:11,470
all the stuff that you expect in a

00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:13,450
restaurant website or you can install

00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:16,000
panop alize individual feature modules

00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:17,800
on a vanilla Drupal site so panoply is

00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,779
made up of a dozen or so features

00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:22,150
modules for each of the components of

00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:24,100
panoply so we have a monopoly admin

00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:25,630
module which has the admin improvements

00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,640
we've a panoply WYSIWYG module it has

00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:29,920
the WYSIWYG configuration so you can

00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:31,450
take just panoply WYSIWYG and installed

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,350
on your vanilla Drupal site if you want

00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:37,450
to steal our WYSIWYG configuration or

00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:38,740
you can use it as a base distribution

00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,690
for creating your own custom

00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:42,580
distributions so similar to how you have

00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:43,839
base themes that you can use to create

00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:46,300
your own custom theme you can use

00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:49,000
panoply as a base distribution to create

00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:51,550
your own distribution and some examples

00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:56,040
are open atrium open academy and many

00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:58,030
others so what does panoply do beyond

00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,640
vanilla Drupal core well it tries to

00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:02,650
improve the user experience of Drupal

00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,680
and one of the ways it does that is by

00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:08,140
including WYSIWYG previews live previews

00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,730
in as many places as possible so seeing

00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:13,060
the thing you are editing as you're

00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:15,430
editing it allowing you to edit content

00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:17,020
in place so editing content on the page

00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:19,870
that you're viewing it rather than going

00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,459
to some separate edit form and various

00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:25,390
improvements to the Drupal admin

00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:27,190
interface so a walkthrough panoply is a

00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:29,500
walk through the panel's ecosystem

00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:31,810
there's definitely a lot more to panoply

00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:34,300
than just panels but all the really

00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:39,670
coolest of the cool stuff is from panels

00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:43,120
and ponopolis the panel's ecosystem

00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:45,339
together in a cohesive way you know on

00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,670
any given project you might not use all

00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:47,930
of the modules and the panels

00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:50,090
system because you only use what you

00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:53,360
need right but seeing all of them

00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:57,140
together configured in a coherent way

00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:01,550
allows you to see sort of the intended

00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:04,430
vision of Drupal through panels so let's

00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:05,990
take a look at some stuff the first

00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:08,420
thing we're gonna look at is changing

00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:09,920
the layout of a page in place and this

00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,380
is using the panels module and the

00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:17,270
panels ipe module that is part of the

00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:20,150
panels module it's included so this is

00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:22,820
the default panoply homepage down at the

00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:34,600
bottom that even visible here let me see

00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:39,460
if I can up the quality come on YouTube

00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,460
hmm let's try doing the non YouTube

00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:45,770
that's a bit better all right so this is

00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:47,090
the default properly homepage down at

00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:50,000
the bottom you'll see these two buttons

00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:52,400
one is change layout click that button

00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,170
you get a menu of possible layouts to

00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,970
choose from currently selected is this

00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:58,280
sidebar on the right we're going to

00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,810
switch to a sidebar on the left the

00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,460
screens just about sort of mapping the

00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:06,200
regions from one layout to the next here

00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:09,500
we don't have to do anything click Save

00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:11,870
and this page now has a sidebar on the

00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:15,580
left it's already live so we've changed

00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,580
layout of the page on the page itself

00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:25,040
next we are going to place new content

00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:29,870
in a region on a page in place again

00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:32,240
using panels in the panel's ipe so again

00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,680
here's the default panoply front page

00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,900
this time we're going to click this

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,290
customize this page button down at the

00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:40,790
bottom and you'll see the different

00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,880
regions on the page will click this plus

00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:45,890
button in the sidebar region it shows us

00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:49,300
a menu of possible things we can add if

00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:49,300
we're going to click add video

00:14:52,010 --> 00:15:00,630
and here we can just paste a youtube

00:14:56,250 --> 00:15:02,450
link it's using the media module you'll

00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:04,920
see that a preview appears on the right

00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:07,350
as soon as we're filling in the values

00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:10,380
on the left click Save and then click

00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:12,450
Save down at the bottom and this page is

00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:15,810
already live with our awesome kitten

00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:17,550
video on the right sidebar oh and we can

00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:20,010
also i think i may be accidentally

00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:22,560
skipped part of the video if we click

00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:24,450
customize this page again we can also

00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,070
drag and drop the different pieces of

00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:28,020
content around on the page so we're

00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:30,290
going to take our kitten video put it in

00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:40,350
the main content region and click Save

00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:43,380
and now we have bigger kittens this is

00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:45,330
much more existed advanced example we're

00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:47,970
going to use the page manager to lay out

00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:50,730
the content add edit form so in vanilla

00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:53,760
Drupal the content creation or edit form

00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:56,640
is just one big long column with each of

00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:58,800
the fields to edit in it using page

00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,300
manager you can apply a layout to that

00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,400
forum you know to column 3 column

00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,590
whatever you want and rearrange the

00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:11,610
different fields so that is what we're

00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:13,920
going to do first we're just going to go

00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:16,080
look at the add content form for this

00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:19,520
testing content type that I created for

00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:23,160
this demo you'll see that the default

00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:24,870
panoply content add edit page puts it

00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,820
into a two column layout similar to

00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:29,190
Drupal 8 and it puts these submit

00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,270
buttons in the right sidebar we are

00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:35,700
going to move those from the right

00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:40,650
sidebar to the main content area so we

00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:46,920
can go to structure pages we're going to

00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:48,960
find the node edit page here you can see

00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,820
some variants these are provided by

00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,520
panoply this bottom one is kind of like

00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:55,970
the default fall back we're going to

00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,970
clone it

00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:05,230
going to add a selection rule that says

00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:08,170
we're only going to load this new

00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:12,430
variant when editing our testing content

00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:13,300
type and we have to rearrange the

00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:16,120
variance because we need to have more

00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:21,520
specific ones come above the general

00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:24,160
fall back then we're going to the

00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,020
content tab and we're going to click and

00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,540
drag this pain that represents the

00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:33,820
submit buttons from the right sidebar to

00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:36,700
the main content area on the left click

00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:40,180
save and update or obtain save then we

00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:43,530
go back to our content add page for our

00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:46,120
testing content type and you can see the

00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:49,020
submit buttons are now on the left so

00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:52,660
this is a simple example of a very

00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:55,720
advanced concept right because you can

00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:57,670
rearrange this form using anything that

00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:01,980
page manager allows you to do you could

00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:04,690
have a different layout of a particular

00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,300
content types add edit page depending on

00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:08,140
your role you could have a different

00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,150
structure for it depending on a

00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:18,100
particular value on the node that you're

00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:19,600
editing so it's super powerful next

00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,760
we're going to look at creating new

00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,280
widgets using the feel double panel

00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:28,690
pains module I think this is the video

00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:30,840
would have been on the fourth video this

00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,840
video

00:18:34,059 --> 00:18:42,590
this is not it all right so when you

00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:44,210
click this customize this page button

00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:47,899
and click one of these + buttons you get

00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:50,090
this menu of possible options I'm

00:18:47,899 --> 00:18:51,740
panoply we call these widgets some of

00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:53,090
these comes from custom code some of

00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,440
them come from views some of them come

00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,960
from few double panel pains which is

00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:59,000
what we're going to show here so you can

00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,159
create new widgets similar to that add

00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,049
video widget we saw earlier for the

00:19:01,159 --> 00:19:06,200
users of your site using feel double

00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:08,000
panel pains and creating a new feel

00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,610
double panel pain is super similar to

00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,889
creating a new content type I in Drupal

00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:15,200
which you're probably familiar with you

00:19:12,889 --> 00:19:19,700
go to structure feel double panel pains

00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:25,820
click Add we'll give it a name my

00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:28,429
special widget and then now you'll see

00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:29,840
the manage fields tab that you're

00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:31,100
probably familiar with creating content

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:37,879
types and adding fields we're going to

00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:39,500
add an image field and this is the

00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:43,820
normal field settings form we'll just

00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:46,690
save the defaults and if we go back to

00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:48,950
the homepage click customize this page

00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:52,279
click the plus button one the regions

00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:54,889
you'll see there is now this extra

00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:58,580
category and our my special widget is an

00:19:54,889 --> 00:20:02,500
option and we can create one you'll see

00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:02,500
our image field that we added earlier

00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:12,240
so this is a super powerful tool because

00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,980
it allows you to extend this menu of

00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:18,090
options that your users have to create

00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:19,530
using only the add venue eyes just by

00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:25,080
pointing and clicking and configuring

00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:27,179
things in Drupal next we're going to

00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,700
look at the panel Iser module one of the

00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:32,309
things that allows you to do is add

00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:34,590
extra ad hoc content to a node so if you

00:20:32,309 --> 00:20:36,450
want just one node on your entire site

00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:38,250
to have a different layout and some

00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:40,110
different piece of content on it you can

00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:50,970
do that with the panel Iser module oops

00:20:40,110 --> 00:21:01,440
we're not using YouTube so first we'll

00:20:50,970 --> 00:21:07,830
create a new node give it a name or a

00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:10,380
title put some text in the body click

00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:12,179
publish and then we'll use the change

00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:13,710
layout button on the bottom to switch

00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:16,169
the layout from Simon on the left to

00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:18,480
sidebar on the right click save now only

00:21:16,169 --> 00:21:22,200
this node on the site has this layout

00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:25,790
will click customize this page and add a

00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,790
new image to the sidebar

00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:36,480
so in general Drupal is really great at

00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,220
letting you create new content types and

00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,529
decide like this content type should

00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:43,020
look like this but Drupal is our Drupal

00:21:40,529 --> 00:21:45,390
core at least is less good at making

00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,890
like one-off nodes that look unique but

00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:54,929
the penalized module can allow you to do

00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:57,120
that the penalized module can also let

00:21:54,929 --> 00:21:58,830
you change the display of a content

00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,500
types of view mode so if you wanted to

00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:03,929
apply a layout and rearrange the content

00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:10,980
on a content types teaser you can do

00:22:03,929 --> 00:22:14,059
that so this is a view that shows the

00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:16,770
teasers of our testing content type and

00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:18,779
currently it's pretty boring just you

00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:22,890
know the title the image the body the

00:22:18,779 --> 00:22:24,210
links all just in one column and we're

00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:30,720
going to switch that to appear in two

00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:35,279
columns so to do that we go to structure

00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:36,630
content types there's our testing

00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:38,630
content type on the bottom will click

00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:43,710
this panel Iser link over on the right

00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:46,080
will select the teaser go to the Layout

00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:47,399
tab will switch from this one column

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:57,360
layout to this sidebar on the right

00:22:47,399 --> 00:23:00,059
layout and then here we're clicking and

00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,830
dragging the field that or the pain that

00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:03,750
represents the image field from the main

00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,909
content area to the sidebar so we go

00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:08,100
back to our view you can see that now

00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:10,380
the image field is over on the right so

00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:12,179
anytime a teaser is used on your site

00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:14,419
for this content type it will have this

00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:14,419
layout

00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:24,930
so far we've been looking at just

00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:26,910
rearranging the fields from a node on

00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:29,160
the page but you can actually edit the

00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:31,800
content of a field while using the

00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:39,690
panels in place editor using the Fate

00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:41,130
module so this is just a normal piece of

00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:43,050
content we're going to click customize

00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:45,060
this page and we click the Settings

00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:46,980
button on this image field we can

00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:50,070
actually change the content of the image

00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:58,050
field from this vegetables image to our

00:23:50,070 --> 00:24:00,360
kitten image will click Save will scroll

00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:02,130
down to the body field will click the

00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,530
little Settings icon there and we can

00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:06,870
change the text content of the bounty

00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:11,420
field right here in the in-place editor

00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:14,430
without having to go to the edit form

00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:17,640
click Save and there we go now the piece

00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:24,870
of content has different values for the

00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:27,090
image field in the body field the Fate

00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:29,010
module isn't technically a part of the

00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:31,170
panel's ecosystem it doesn't use panels

00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:33,180
but sort of an honorary member of the

00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:34,650
panel's ecosystem it's very similar to

00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:37,080
the fate module we just looked at before

00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:39,990
but allows you to edit the content of

00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:42,600
individual fields on tabs so you can

00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:44,100
create a edit body tab for your content

00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,230
type and then users can edit the value

00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,760
of the field that way but because it is

00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:50,460
not directly panels related we're going

00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,840
to skip this video I'll the last one

00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,840
we're going to talk about is the panels

00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,430
everywhere module so far we've just been

00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:00,090
using panels to take control of the

00:24:56,430 --> 00:25:01,650
content area on the page so your theme

00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:03,900
is still responsible for rendering the

00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:05,340
header the breadcrumbs the footer all

00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,530
that stuff and panels has just been

00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,120
messing with that content area but using

00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:11,070
panels everywhere you can actually have

00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,110
panels take over the entire page and

00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:16,700
render things like your site header your

00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:16,700
breadcrumbs your footer and all of that

00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:24,450
so first of all I'd like to apologize

00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:26,850
for how ugly the site and this demo

00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:29,340
looks on a real site you need to create

00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:31,590
a child theme and theme it so that

00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:36,059
actually looks nice but just bear with

00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:39,179
me for the purpose of this demo so up

00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:40,710
here this is the site header and what

00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:42,540
we're going to do is we're going to use

00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:46,320
panels everywhere and the page manager

00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:49,260
to move the site header from the top of

00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,420
the page over into the right sidebar

00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,830
this is something you would never do on

00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:54,660
a real site right like why would you

00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:59,100
want the site header in the sidebar but

00:25:54,660 --> 00:26:01,230
it demonstrates the power that panels

00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:05,460
everywhere gives you you can drastically

00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:07,260
change the way your site looks using any

00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,299
of the selection rules that you normally

00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:12,179
have in page manager so you could say

00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:13,890
you know users of this role we're going

00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:16,799
to completely change the layout to look

00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:18,419
like this or anything that you can do in

00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:21,240
page manager you can use to affect the

00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:23,730
layout of your site and since this is

00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,110
such an advanced demo I didn't feel the

00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:27,419
need to talk to you to the pieces but

00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:35,309
we're able to make these types of

00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:37,950
drastic changes so that was our

00:26:35,309 --> 00:26:39,299
walkthrough um you know those were the

00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:40,320
modules that we're talking about when

00:26:39,299 --> 00:26:41,700
we're talking about the panel's

00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:47,220
ecosystem so I hope that gives you a

00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:49,490
little bit of context um I hope full

00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:49,490
screen

00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:58,140
alright so I hope you were able to see a

00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,380
couple of things that you didn't

00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:02,610
previously know panels could do and

00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:05,450
we're able to get more of an idea of

00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:09,179
what a panels taking over everything

00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:10,770
universe looks like so we were looking

00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:12,360
at ponopolis it's not the only

00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:14,610
distribution that does awesome things

00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:16,440
with panels here's a couple of other

00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:19,890
examples if you'd like to check those

00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:29,730
out as well next caroline is going to

00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:31,799
talk about accessibility so hey everyone

00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:34,559
I'm Caroline Boyden and I work for UC

00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:37,410
Berkeley the University of California

00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:40,530
has a policy and the policy states that

00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:41,940
all websites and web applications have

00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:44,790
to be accessible to people with

00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:47,429
disabilities including people who use

00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:50,400
assistive technology so when we decided

00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:52,679
to build our distribution on top of

00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,010
panoply we basically committed ourselves

00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:58,919
to the project of continually improving

00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:00,780
ponopolis accessibility and we're also

00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:03,059
taking the improvements we're making and

00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:06,150
contributing them back into see tools

00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:08,309
and into panels and any module we

00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:12,750
encounter along the way to make things

00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:14,160
more accessible so law and policy aren't

00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:16,980
the only reason we're doing this we've

00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,919
also found that making things more

00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:22,169
accessible adds value in some unexpected

00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:26,280
ways and one of them is it's improving

00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:28,350
our automated testing because if you

00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:30,630
have a widget that you can't operate

00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:33,299
with the keyboard only for example you

00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:35,669
might find that whatever tool you're

00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:39,450
using forefront and automated testing

00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:41,220
can't operate that that widget either so

00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:42,870
it's really is really improved things

00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:46,290
for us in that regard which was sort of

00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:48,000
unexpected so I want to show you some

00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:51,540
stuff we have in progress we're looking

00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:53,160
at the sea tools modal plus the panels

00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:55,950
ipe which is a lot of the stuff that

00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:58,200
David just showed you on Drupal 7 and

00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:01,740
there are some keyboard accessibility

00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:04,860
issues with this now we like to start

00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,680
with keyboard accessibility because once

00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,720
you fix that

00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:09,940
you have a pretty good foundation a

00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,190
baseline on which you can build in

00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:14,350
better accessibility for assist other

00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:18,070
assistive technology or other situations

00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:20,320
and also we found that at Berkeley five

00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:22,870
out of six students who come into the

00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,480
assistive technology lab for help have a

00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:27,790
repetitive stress injury or some other

00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,010
mobility condition that means they

00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:32,620
really shouldn't be using a mouse they

00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:36,250
should be using the keyboard or an

00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:38,770
alternative input device so I'm going to

00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:42,330
show you a little before video that I

00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:49,110
will demonstrate some of these problems

00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:49,110
let me see if you can see this here so

00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:01,930
okay so I activating the add content

00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,600
button with the keyboard you can

00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:06,850
definitely do but now I want to get into

00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,220
that list of category so I'm tabbing

00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:11,350
forward forward forward but nothing's

00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:14,350
happening my keyboard focus is

00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:17,980
completely lost and no amount of tabbing

00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:20,620
is getting me anywhere so luckily I can

00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:23,110
hit the Escape key to dismiss the dialog

00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:25,780
but I'm unable to add any content to

00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:28,060
this page with the keyboard now that's

00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:30,910
firefox chrome is a little bit better so

00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:34,270
switching to chrome and activating the

00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:36,160
add content button you probably can't

00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:37,750
see it because the resolution but what's

00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:40,480
happening is my focus highlight is

00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:43,240
moving through the admin menu at the top

00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,520
of the page so I'm tabbing through the

00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:47,740
page that's behind the dialogue now

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,800
eventually if I keep tabbing forward I

00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:52,900
eventually I make it into the dialogue

00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:55,170
but when i hit enter to activate a link

00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:58,330
that changes the content of the dialogue

00:30:55,170 --> 00:31:00,460
then my focus is bumped back into the

00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:02,860
page behind the dialogue again and i

00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:05,620
have to tab tab tab tab tab to get back

00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:07,660
to where i was so that's kind of a pain

00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:10,990
and we don't really want to put our

00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:13,960
users through that so we do have a

00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:15,730
solution for this after a whole lot of

00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,320
coding and testing and really frankly

00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:19,510
just breaking things and then fixing

00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,580
them again a lot of work from four

00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:28,180
david and from myself we've basically

00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:29,890
fixed keyboard accessibility so this

00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,930
slide is just for reference these are

00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:34,660
some patches we've contributed two

00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:36,340
panels and see tools this is the issues

00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:39,460
in the queue you can check them out and

00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:42,160
my next video is the after video it's

00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:53,170
the exact same site and all I've done to

00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:55,660
it is apply these two patches so now

00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:58,540
when you hit enter to activate the add

00:31:55,660 --> 00:32:00,910
content button your focus immediately

00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:02,980
starts on the first item in the dialog

00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:05,170
which happens to be the close link you

00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:07,630
can tab forward and backward through the

00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:10,300
list of categories and tabbing to the

00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:12,100
activity category and hitting Enter your

00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:15,340
focus immediately starts on the first

00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:17,530
available option then you can tab to the

00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:20,080
one you want which in this case is who's

00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:21,880
online that brings up the configuration

00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:25,540
forum which you can operate with the

00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:28,450
keyboard hit enter a sorry spacebar to

00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:30,550
check that box override the title then

00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:34,110
tab to the finish button it hit enter

00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:37,300
tab to the Save button and hit enter and

00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:39,340
that's it we've successfully added

00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:45,910
content to this page using the keyboard

00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:48,880
only no mouse required ha ok thank

00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:51,520
thanks so obviously I like that right

00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,800
it's pretty cool but there's a lot more

00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,940
work to be done and there's some stuff

00:32:53,800 --> 00:33:00,910
we're going to be looking at in the near

00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:02,970
future so for future accessibility

00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:05,680
improvements we're going to look at

00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:08,560
media browser which is included in

00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:10,510
panoply right now media browser is not

00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:13,000
operable with a keyboard in order to

00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:15,400
select one of those images you have to

00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:17,260
click it with the mouse and also once

00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:19,570
you've selected it it's hard to tell

00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:21,610
which one you've selected in this

00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:23,290
screenshot one of the items is selected

00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:25,000
but it's kind of hard to distinguish

00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:27,010
from the others even you know looking at

00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,370
it down here on this screen it's hard to

00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:33,159
distinguish we're also going to look at

00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:34,509
module filter which is unfortunately no

00:33:33,159 --> 00:33:36,099
longer accessible with the keyboard

00:33:34,509 --> 00:33:39,039
because those button thingies they

00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:41,590
aren't actually real buttons there divs

00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:45,099
with behavior attached not focusable not

00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:46,570
operable with the keyboard and finally

00:33:45,099 --> 00:33:49,119
we're going to look at drag and drop you

00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:52,299
saw a lot of drag and drop in David's

00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:55,450
demos and right now you can't do that

00:33:52,299 --> 00:33:56,830
with the keyboard so this is going to be

00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:59,950
a big challenge it's probably going to

00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:02,679
take a lot of work but we're really

00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:05,080
committed to this work and we're pretty

00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:08,559
confident that we can get some real big

00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:11,740
wins for accessibility into panels and

00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:15,190
see tools and Drupal so that they really

00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:18,730
benefit everybody and how many of you

00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:22,210
out there write code okay and how many

00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:24,609
of you build sites okay so a lot of you

00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:26,889
are involved in building things and I

00:34:24,609 --> 00:34:28,329
just want to ask you all to think about

00:34:26,889 --> 00:34:30,129
accessibility when you're writing code

00:34:28,329 --> 00:34:32,169
or when you're building sites or

00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:34,839
whatever it is that you do with Drupal

00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:36,789
so if everyone kind of puts just a

00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:38,619
little bit of effort into making things

00:34:36,789 --> 00:34:45,730
more accessible we can really make

00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:47,440
things better for everybody so thanks

00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:51,899
and I'm going to hand it over to Jacob

00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,899
now for some updates on Drupal 7 status

00:34:52,169 --> 00:34:57,460
all right so that's a little bit about

00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:00,609
Drupal 7 let's talk a little bit about

00:34:57,460 --> 00:35:02,319
where panoply is so most of the big

00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:05,079
features phone opoly that you've seen

00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:06,940
have been done so they've already been

00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:10,569
planned and they're in progress right

00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:12,010
now and really try and get the stability

00:35:10,569 --> 00:35:15,339
part done and getting into maintenance

00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:17,950
mode the biggest and most exciting parts

00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:20,740
you've seen here is really improving the

00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:24,670
accessibility and gain that part really

00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:26,529
into into panels and in up to see tools

00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:30,640
because of all of that sort of related

00:35:26,529 --> 00:35:33,339
together the next part is panels and see

00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,160
tools so as many people have seen we do

00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:40,089
about one release a year it's pretty

00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:43,490
stable until we do a release

00:35:40,089 --> 00:35:46,609
and then we do another one there is bug

00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:48,079
fixes and security it's mainly in

00:35:46,609 --> 00:35:51,020
maintenance mode but we're accepting

00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:56,150
patches that are reviewed our TBC by the

00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:59,210
community and similar to Drupal 8 when

00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:01,640
Drupal 8 comes out all of the features

00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:04,339
that we're doing in Drupal 7 3 months

00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:08,060
after will go into security release only

00:36:04,339 --> 00:36:11,630
mode similar to Drupal 6 so we're also

00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:13,849
planning to do a 3.6 and a 1.8 release

00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:17,240
maybe this weekend did I say something

00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:19,550
about friday friday saturday and sunday

00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:23,150
anyone here for saturday sunday sprints

00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:26,210
okay good nice come to the extended

00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:30,200
sprints so we have 26 are TBC issues for

00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:35,000
ctools and 20 are TVC issues for panels

00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:36,500
so that's really awesome we might be

00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,570
able to even get that through so we can

00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:43,670
get all of we can get another release

00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:45,380
out for those so yes oh and our TBC for

00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:48,680
accessibility those two patches you saw

00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,790
so a few more tests on it and we should

00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:53,150
be able to roll those into the next

00:36:49,790 --> 00:37:01,190
version cool and now Damien will talk

00:36:53,150 --> 00:37:04,040
about paralyzer okay so I have to fix

00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:10,369
that so a panel Iser at this point is

00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:13,099
what i consider mostly stable so there

00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:14,990
are a number of things left but i feel

00:37:13,099 --> 00:37:18,140
it's getting close to a 3.2 release

00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:22,339
finally after two years and more there

00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:24,109
are several new features in 3.2 that are

00:37:22,339 --> 00:37:27,500
really beneficial to building

00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:30,980
distributions but some other user

00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:34,940
interface improvements a big block right

00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:36,829
now is revision support both working

00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:38,750
with core revisions but also when you

00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:40,970
get into using something like workbench

00:37:38,750 --> 00:37:45,530
moderation or the revisional and

00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:48,170
building workflows with content and

00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:50,090
revisions there and then especially when

00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:54,920
you throw IP into the mix

00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:57,680
it gets rather complicated but hoping to

00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:59,840
get that spend a lot of time on that

00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:02,630
soon at the next one is panels

00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:05,270
everywhere at this point it is mostly

00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:08,090
stable it's very close to a 1 point 0

00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:10,580
release finally the key blocker on that

00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:13,730
is there are some form errors need to

00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:17,060
solve that we're basically the form

00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:20,030
error area Justin show up which is kind

00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:22,460
of bad and it doesn't highlight the form

00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:26,410
fields that have the errors which again

00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:30,050
is bad but structurally besides that

00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:34,610
it's working pretty well and field will

00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:37,010
panels pains is a block alternative

00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:39,100
entity system that works particularly

00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:41,930
well with panels at this point it's

00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:43,550
again mostly stable the 1.5 release

00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:47,120
works pretty well but there are a few

00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:49,400
issues with it it's very close to 1.6

00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:51,230
there are just a couple of blockers to

00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:53,270
work through to make sure that it works

00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:54,920
correctly with like the entity API and

00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:59,030
you can do queries properly with and

00:38:54,920 --> 00:39:01,640
whatnot feel double field API pain

00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:03,980
editor and field API tab editor I just

00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:06,980
wanted considering those stable they

00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:09,020
don't do very much and at this point

00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:13,340
it's pretty much down to bug fixes and

00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:16,220
security updates as needed and again we

00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:18,320
have a code sprint specifically focused

00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:22,220
on panoply in the panel's ecosystem on

00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,990
Friday so hope to see you there so we're

00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:28,370
going to be focusing on stability

00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:33,350
improvements again on Friday find Jacob

00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:35,990
in the coder lounge on the day as we

00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:37,640
work through these stability problems so

00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:42,790
at this point I'm going to hand you back

00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:42,790
to David to take us into the future

00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:55,940
so the short version is that there will

00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:59,420
be panels in Drupal 8 now the slightly

00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:03,320
longer version so in Drupal 7 we rolled

00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:05,960
our own everything the core API is we're

00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:09,710
not powerful enough for panels so see

00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:12,620
tools filled the gap one example of this

00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:16,040
is core blocks versus CTools content

00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:19,550
types blocks are pretty weak in Drupal 7

00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:21,560
they can only be placed one time they

00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:23,480
have over simplistic visibility rules I

00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:25,340
think you can control like it appears or

00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,780
doesn't appear on this list of paths and

00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,660
it appears or doesn't appear on these

00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:32,300
content types right and that's it they

00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:35,120
have no sense of context like how do you

00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:37,130
make a block that pulls data from the

00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:41,570
node you're currently looking at the

00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:43,910
answer is very happily right so they're

00:40:41,570 --> 00:40:47,390
not powerful enough for panels in d

00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:50,750
eight panels will use blocks d eight

00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:53,000
blocks can be placed multiple times we

00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:55,240
have condition plugins in core for doing

00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,210
really complex visibility rules and

00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:04,580
there's context in core so finally

00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:06,890
blocks are powerful enough for panels in

00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:09,530
d eight panels can use the core API is

00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:11,330
because now they're awesome instead of C

00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:14,150
tools plugins we have the Drupal 8

00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:16,520
plugin system instead of content types

00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:19,130
will have d 8 blocks instead of access

00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:21,260
plugins will have da conditions instead

00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:27,050
of task handlers will have d 8 display

00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:29,240
variants and there's the context api so

00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:31,430
panels is finally coming out of its silo

00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,870
it's no longer you know its own weird

00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:35,480
little land over here it's going to be

00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:37,700
able to participate more in Drupal core

00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:41,030
and all the rest of contribs that works

00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:42,800
with Drupal core and this is possible

00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:44,780
because many of the ideas that were

00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,300
pioneered in C tools are now part of

00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:49,460
Drupal core this was done mainly by the

00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:51,410
views in core initiative in order to

00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:52,820
bring views into core all of these

00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:55,670
concepts from see tools need to be

00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:57,560
brought in as well but not everything

00:41:55,670 --> 00:42:00,010
that we need ended up in court

00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:02,810
so there will still be a few contribs

00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:04,580
for example the page manager module that

00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:07,580
Tim Plunkett maintains has been doing a

00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:08,930
ton of awesome work on and Chris Vander

00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:11,450
waters just start doing some cool work

00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:14,900
there too this is really I think where

00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:18,020
most of the work on bringing panels to

00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:19,610
Drupal 8 has been done so far layout

00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:22,250
plugins we have this cool little module

00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:25,040
called layout plugin that allows you to

00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:27,560
register layouts and provide a twig

00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:30,530
template it's going to be not only used

00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:32,270
by panels but also display sweet so both

00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:38,360
panels and display c will be using the

00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:40,550
same layouts and all the rest of the

00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:44,060
stuff will end up in the Drupal 8

00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:45,590
version of C tools so style plugins the

00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:48,440
wizard API Chris Vander water has been

00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:51,530
doing some awesome work on that and very

00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:53,180
a specific plugins so a Drupal core now

00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:55,490
has the plug-in manager and the plug-in

00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:57,440
types for all of these things that used

00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:59,330
to be in C tools like blocks and

00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:01,940
condition plugins but it doesn't have

00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:06,050
the specific plugins that C tools used

00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:07,250
to have in Drupal 7 so C tools are going

00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:09,920
to need to include a whole bunch of

00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:11,870
condition plugins blocks and stuff in

00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:17,540
order to parity with what we had in

00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:20,050
Drupal 7 with the new release cycle will

00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:24,080
be able to add new features at Drupal

00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:26,390
8.1 8.2 so it's possible even you know

00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:28,040
we won't have it in in Drupal 8 point

00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:30,560
zero point zero but it's still possible

00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,450
that one day we could get panels merged

00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,400
into Drupal core I will probably be

00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:35,960
doing it progressively you know each

00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,790
time there's an opportunity to add new

00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,740
features will start trying to get some

00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:42,260
of the lower level stuff merged in I

00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:44,450
think layout plugin is a strong

00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:47,030
candidate for getting merged relatively

00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:48,440
early it's super simple some of the

00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:51,710
stuff we're putting in C tools I could

00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:53,450
see going into Drupal 8 in point

00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:55,580
releases and if we get enough of that

00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:58,550
stuff in there maybe one day we'll have

00:43:55,580 --> 00:44:01,310
all of panels but first we've got to

00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:05,090
prove it out trib so here's a quick demo

00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:06,860
of panels in Drupal 8 it's a super

00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:08,510
simplistic demo it really doesn't show

00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:09,990
all of the stuff that's even possible

00:44:08,510 --> 00:44:14,050
now

00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:17,940
yeah you go to structure pages just like

00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:17,940
going to the page management Drupal 7

00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:29,320
i'm going to click the add page button

00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:30,790
give our page label and a path now we're

00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:36,280
going to add a display variant and

00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:38,350
choose the panels variant will give our

00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:40,030
display very into label there's a title

00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:42,280
we're not going to change that and

00:44:40,030 --> 00:44:44,500
select one of the layouts you can't

00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,700
really see it but it's the single column

00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:47,890
and two column layout that you might

00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:49,750
know from the Drupal 7 version of panels

00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:52,330
then we'll click this add new block

00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:54,610
we're going to choose the powered by

00:44:52,330 --> 00:44:56,050
drupal block and select which region

00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:59,260
should go into we're going to put it in

00:44:56,050 --> 00:45:01,360
the left side and then we'll click Add

00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:03,550
block again again select the power by

00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:05,680
drupal block has been played blocks

00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:08,980
multiple times and put another one in

00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:10,480
the right side region click update

00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:14,710
display variant then we'll go visit the

00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:24,330
URL and there you have a layout with

00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:28,390
some blocks in it so this demo used

00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:30,550
Drupal 8 beta 10 page manager one point

00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:32,590
0 alpha 10 layout plug in 1 point 0

00:45:30,550 --> 00:45:34,570
alpha 10 and panels three point 0 alpha

00:45:32,590 --> 00:45:36,670
10 so you see that we're sinking the

00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:38,680
Alpha releases with the Drupal 8 beta

00:45:36,670 --> 00:45:40,960
releases to try and make it easier to

00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:43,330
know what is compatible with what and

00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:49,180
make it easier for you guys to help

00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:51,970
contribute and help us get it done so

00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:54,670
that was sort of the core of panels

00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:56,380
nexus talk about the status of some of

00:45:54,670 --> 00:46:00,250
the rest of the panel's ecosystem

00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:01,690
modules for Drupal 8 so panoply you know

00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:04,150
first we're just focused on getting

00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:07,150
panels and Drupal 8 done but we are

00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:10,000
committed to try and have at least in 2

00:46:07,150 --> 00:46:13,230
point 0 alpha 1 on the day that Drupal 8

00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,230
point zero point zero is released

00:46:17,530 --> 00:46:23,360
so for CTools panels page managers you

00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:26,360
saw their work in progress they exist

00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:28,070
and kind of do something right there's

00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,900
still a lot of work going on Chris

00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:31,580
Vander waters working on some patches

00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:34,010
for page manager that make it look a

00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:36,500
whole lot more like page manager in

00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:38,000
Drupal 7 and those will be getting

00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:41,420
finished in the next couple of weeks so

00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,600
indefinitely stay tuned and the goals do

00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:46,970
have a beta by a Drupal 8 point zero

00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:51,800
point zero hopefully with an upgrade

00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:55,580
path from Drupal 7 the rest of the

00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:57,440
modules fate you know to be determined I

00:46:55,580 --> 00:47:01,160
could see that being merged into CTools

00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:04,010
since it's kind of a basic module feel

00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:06,920
double panel pains you know since we're

00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:09,350
using blocks in panels now and blocks

00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:11,510
custom blocks in Drupal 8 are entities

00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:13,970
they can have types and fields like

00:47:11,510 --> 00:47:16,220
maybe we'll just use custom blocks maybe

00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:18,650
it won't be necessary on panels

00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:21,200
everywhere analyzer to be determined you

00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:22,760
know we're waiting to see this is

00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:28,040
another one of Damien's fun puns until

00:47:22,760 --> 00:47:30,020
the panel pain dreese yeah so we're

00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:32,150
waiting to see how panels comes together

00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:36,740
and then we'll decide what to do with

00:47:32,150 --> 00:47:41,600
those modules and fate will be ported

00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:46,070
very definitive Damien said since it's

00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:49,000
such a tiny module it's no problem I'll

00:47:46,070 --> 00:47:49,000
pass it back to Damien

00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:01,570
so because this is an open source

00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:04,390
project and everything we would

00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:07,750
appreciate some help obviously so if

00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:11,290
you're able to please contribute we are

00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:12,910
very very eager to have people just help

00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:14,500
out and do a little bit of issue queue

00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:17,230
triage if you've ever looked at the

00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:19,360
issue cues for panels and see jewels and

00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:21,190
everything there are lots of simple

00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:25,540
things for people asking how do I do

00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:28,210
this or lots of simple things where

00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:30,250
somebody needs some a common one is

00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:32,880
somebody uploads a patch but doesn't

00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:35,770
change the status to say needs review

00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:38,440
lots of very simple things and for that

00:48:35,770 --> 00:48:42,460
you don't need any experience developing

00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:46,240
or whatnot just looking around you can

00:48:42,460 --> 00:48:48,250
pick up a lot then obviously reviewing

00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:51,550
some of the many many patches people

00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:54,370
have uploaded and you don't need a lot

00:48:51,550 --> 00:48:59,440
of experience but just being able to

00:48:54,370 --> 00:49:01,510
download a patch and apply it and then

00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,930
obviously if you're into it and have the

00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:06,610
skills or even just want to try and we

00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:11,370
would be delighted to have people help

00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:14,650
work out fixes for bugs or even and I

00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:18,070
times steps to reproduce it bug so we

00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:19,570
can so somebody else can fix it some

00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:22,090
experience is obviously a little more

00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:25,090
necessary for this but you don't have to

00:49:22,090 --> 00:49:28,780
be an absolute expert so how'd it get

00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:32,260
started we have a weekly meeting on IRC

00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:37,060
on the free node network in the Drupal

00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:41,740
Scotch chat room and it's on Tuesday at

00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:44,620
noon central standard time which is 1

00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:50,650
p.m. eastern and 10 a.m. pacific time

00:49:44,620 --> 00:49:52,690
and there's also a d8 major issue which

00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:54,900
is a good starting point if you want to

00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:58,270
get it if you really want to get into

00:49:54,900 --> 00:50:01,670
helping with the d8 the panel is the m

00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:04,760
d8 that explains a lot of the plans and

00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:08,020
architecture and stuff so again code

00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:12,079
sprint on Friday and so in summary then

00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:13,940
the status update of the union is that

00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:16,940
for drupal 7 we're considering

00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:18,859
everything to be fairly stable there are

00:50:16,940 --> 00:50:21,470
still a number of bugs we're trying to

00:50:18,859 --> 00:50:23,420
work through and fix and we're focused

00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:25,099
on improving accessibility then

00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:28,030
obviously undie ate everything is still

00:50:25,099 --> 00:50:32,210
in a work in progress state with some

00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:36,109
hopeful goals and again codes for and

00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:37,940
friday so just before we finish up would

00:50:36,109 --> 00:50:42,140
like to offer thanks to Earl miles

00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:49,099
Merlin and chaos who wrote panels back

00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:53,359
in the day and and then also Sam Boyer

00:50:49,099 --> 00:50:56,420
who helped steer panels 3 and C tools

00:50:53,359 --> 00:51:02,180
architecture back for Drupal 6 in it 27

00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:04,520
and Daniel Wayner who also helped with C

00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:06,049
tools and panels Chris Vander water who

00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:09,230
has been doing a tremendous amount of

00:51:06,049 --> 00:51:11,980
work on panels for Drupal 8 and the

00:51:09,230 --> 00:51:14,390
whole ecosystem there along with Tim and

00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:16,670
all of the contributors over the years

00:51:14,390 --> 00:51:19,180
who have helped out so huge round of

00:51:16,670 --> 00:51:19,180
applause for everybody

00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:28,100
and also thanks to the many companies

00:51:24,590 --> 00:51:30,320
that have paid for us to work on the

00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:32,510
clock either for the companies or for

00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:35,450
clients to work on all of these issues

00:51:32,510 --> 00:51:39,620
and to work on further improvements over

00:51:35,450 --> 00:51:44,090
the years so thank you and any questions

00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:46,040
I know we're a little over but we do

00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:47,750
have some time especially given we're

00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:55,880
going into the lint or an evening break

00:51:47,750 --> 00:52:09,830
any questions for Sookie drew is

00:51:55,880 --> 00:52:16,510
microphone on field of retiring feel

00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:21,530
double panel pains oh that's kind of a

00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:23,660
lofty goal that in Drupal 7 many people

00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:25,280
came up with the idea of you know we

00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:27,580
need something like blocks only that's

00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:30,650
entity base we can add fields to it

00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:33,410
fillable panel pains was one of the beam

00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:36,770
was another and ec k kind of reared his

00:52:33,410 --> 00:52:38,930
head and at this point has a fairly

00:52:36,770 --> 00:52:40,790
stable version too but there's a lot of

00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:44,570
architecture that they want to go into

00:52:40,790 --> 00:52:48,080
version 3 to have translations and

00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:50,330
revisions and stuff so it's kind of a

00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:52,370
lofty goal I don't know if we'll

00:52:50,330 --> 00:52:54,320
specifically get there but there's just

00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:57,380
so much repetition between them all it

00:52:54,320 --> 00:53:00,410
would be nice to do I am they're all

00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:03,290
kind of redundant in Drupal 8 so the

00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:07,070
Drupal 8 version will probably be just a

00:53:03,290 --> 00:53:12,290
GUI around what's already in core thank

00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:13,880
you hey guys we barely just scratched

00:53:12,290 --> 00:53:16,340
the surface of

00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:19,460
fish off on that I've got two questions

00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:21,680
if you don't mind so I didn't really

00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:24,230
know that Napoli did all this is panels

00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:26,960
of Monopoly an alternative to paragraphs

00:53:24,230 --> 00:53:31,630
if you're familiar with that or can they

00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:34,430
work give it a more powerful Harding

00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:37,130
sorry about that so paragraphs can

00:53:34,430 --> 00:53:40,640
definitely work along with panels and

00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:43,220
panoply open atrium uses paragraphs and

00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:45,140
it's based on monopoly so they really um

00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:47,510
there's no conflict they can be

00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:50,590
complimentary for sure so paragraph is

00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:53,660
another one of those things like field

00:53:50,590 --> 00:53:57,320
collection or you can group multiple

00:53:53,660 --> 00:54:03,860
things into say and note form and have

00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:06,290
repeating feels and stuff and then can

00:54:03,860 --> 00:54:08,930
you apply panels layouts to a specific

00:54:06,290 --> 00:54:10,940
note i'm outside the note of default

00:54:08,930 --> 00:54:12,020
well i know that i don't think i'm

00:54:10,940 --> 00:54:13,970
saying the name of that right sugar

00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:18,050
cookie fault lay on that you can in fact

00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:22,010
through panels and then use a very to

00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:23,780
specify what content types are going to

00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:27,890
be affected is there a way to do that

00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:38,060
outside of that so you don't have one

00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:40,220
favorite or actually specifically right

00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:41,750
cuz that's perfect for penalize ER that

00:54:40,220 --> 00:54:44,660
that is penalized or what you just

00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:47,270
described yeah I don't know if you want

00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:51,860
to say sure one of the things in panel

00:54:47,270 --> 00:54:53,780
Iser penalize there was a replacement

00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:56,510
for panel nodes that originally came in

00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:59,150
Drupal or if four panels one for triple

00:54:56,510 --> 00:55:02,000
five and didn't really change much I

00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:03,320
guess maybe an example as we're going

00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,360
through content strategy for drupal org

00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:07,400
we're looking at changing like the

00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:09,920
project pages into groups and using

00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:12,500
potentially not not totally sure yet but

00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:14,560
probably using panel Iser so like every

00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:21,220
project page can do their own layouts

00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:21,220
because using that potential pastors

00:55:22,339 --> 00:55:31,010
yeah so what feel double panel pains is

00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:34,230
retired there'll be transition time

00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:41,849
campaigns to these new custom blocks we

00:55:34,230 --> 00:55:44,760
have penalties so if it's retired there

00:55:41,849 --> 00:55:46,349
will be a crossover period perhaps you

00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:50,910
mean like will there be an upgrade path

00:55:46,349 --> 00:55:53,460
yeah it is possible to build one for

00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:54,900
panoply we will have to build one so I

00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:59,059
will say yes there will be an upgrade

00:55:54,900 --> 00:56:02,549
path my other question was about cameras

00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:04,440
that was a big jump up for us we love

00:56:02,549 --> 00:56:06,390
that over the top of countless age

00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:08,520
manager a lot easier to use multiple

00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:10,650
content types I don't know if this more

00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:13,140
of a question and more than pleased you

00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:15,059
know if you're still determining whether

00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:17,250
to do that if you could do that or we

00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:20,460
can help or something and you mean in

00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:22,349
Drupal 8 yes oh yeah it'll happen okay

00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:25,069
analyzer is gonna get into jubilation

00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:31,109
well not in court but ill bill how about

00:56:25,069 --> 00:56:32,940
oh yeah yeah absolutely no yeah it's

00:56:31,109 --> 00:56:35,339
more a case of needing to make sure the

00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:38,099
foundation is there that panel Iser will

00:56:35,339 --> 00:56:40,140
use that's basically we just haven't

00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:41,400
started yet so when we were earlier

00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,779
there was that list of modules and I

00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:44,940
said to be determined it basically

00:56:42,779 --> 00:56:45,900
saying we haven't sat down and evaluated

00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:48,500
how we're going to do it and start

00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,500
writing code yet

00:56:52,750 --> 00:56:59,180
to change the header based on the rest

00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:01,430
of the page of the content type and

00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:04,760
various other things so I'd like to put

00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:09,800
in a strong hug for that seems like the

00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:12,320
more robust version of blocks with

00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:15,710
lemons I was thinking that handles

00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:19,040
everywhere would almost become trivial

00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:21,500
if the blocks are more robust the way

00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:25,610
they sound like it would be yeah i mean

00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:27,710
the abuse counselor before as well

00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:29,360
there's also the block of fire module

00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:31,640
which basically takes like most of the

00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:34,160
site elements and makes them into blocks

00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:36,020
for you so you can kind of do half tell

00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,510
us everywhere and that's basically done

00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:40,310
in court like all the site logo you know

00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:42,080
site name all that the search bar

00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:43,700
everything is a block now anyway and

00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:45,740
because you can place it in many

00:57:43,700 --> 00:58:01,400
different ways and text to decide when

00:57:45,740 --> 00:58:03,410
it shows up that's almost done for you I

00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:05,660
think it's mostly just taking time to

00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:07,250
sit down really evaluate exactly what

00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:09,950
people use panels everywhere for and

00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:11,480
make sure everything is covered we could

00:58:09,950 --> 00:58:12,950
just decide we're done and everything's

00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:15,340
great there might be a couple of things

00:58:12,950 --> 00:58:15,340
to clean up

00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:27,220
so I filled all nice licensing paddles

00:58:22,570 --> 00:58:30,520
and mostly use vuze content pains for

00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:32,350
just about everything with everything we

00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:34,180
need to da with the new robustness of

00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:43,450
the block system how is that going to

00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:48,010
affect content they don't exist yet but

00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:50,830
they will they don't exist yet so we

00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:52,540
just haven't written them I mean there's

00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:54,580
already these blocks and there's a

00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:56,380
couple of them that can I mean you know

00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:58,780
infuse content pains you can choose

00:58:56,380 --> 00:59:00,400
extra helps the views you I you know how

00:58:58,780 --> 00:59:02,590
many items there are what fields show up

00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,750
and stuff we kind of put like views

00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:07,840
continent pains light into the views

00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:11,320
block system it can be expanded both in

00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:14,230
court and trib it's really easy to write

00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:15,790
the code it just needs to be done yeah

00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:20,320
I'd say out of the gate will probably

00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:23,740
have a equivalent of content pains in C

00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:25,330
tools to start with but because all of

00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:27,370
the things necessary to build them are

00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:29,800
in Drupal core maybe we could get it

00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:32,260
into core for like 8.1 8.2 something

00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:37,770
like that talk to me on Friday that'd be

00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:37,770
really fun to work on again goat sprint

00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:59,380
look for that that's a great support

00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,210
request to actually put in the issue

00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:02,980
queue I'm not sure if you're getting a

01:00:01,210 --> 01:00:20,920
white screen of death and is it just

01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:23,680
like a regular install of panels that'll

01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:26,710
that'll break everything okay so what's

01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:31,720
the right way I open a support request

01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:32,950
today yeah add screenshots and steps

01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:36,010
treat for you since I'm going to help

01:00:32,950 --> 01:00:37,810
you yeah yeah I think that sounds like a

01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:40,890
bug that could potentially be fixed to

01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:40,890
