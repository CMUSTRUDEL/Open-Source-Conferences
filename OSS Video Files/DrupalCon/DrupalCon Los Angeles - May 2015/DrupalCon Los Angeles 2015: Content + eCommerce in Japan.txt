Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Content + eCommerce in Japan
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	In 2014, UK-based handmade cosmetics company, Lush, anticipated a busy holiday season for its eCommerce business in Japan. There was also a trend indicating that  the market share for  mobile transactions in Japan was increasing as well.  Lush Japan knew it’s existing web content management system wasn’t equipped to meet these needs, so the company sought a new platform, ultimately adding  Drupal Commerce to its solution portfolio.

Join CI&T team at this session as share how Drupal helped bring Lush's eCommerce+Content strategy to lushjapan.com, while still maintaining a consistent global brand look & feel and user experience.  

The challenges involved:

Deliver in less than 4 months;
Leverage an existing distribution (build for Lush UK) and customize it
Integrate with an existing Japanese OMS
Localize the solution to Japan specific needs in Japan
Migrate content/product information from the existing platform
Support specific operation management workflows
We will also share a bit of the "under the hood" insights, including the modules used, challenges for localization, integration, and migration, plus the overall architecture.

At the end, we'll also have covered:

The business outputs for Lush Japan
Lessons learned when bringing a "western" distribution to "the east"
The state of Drupal in Japan/Asia and how you can (and should!) get involved

okay all right everyone just let's get

00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:10,860
started first of all thank you very much

for coming and welcome to the first

00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:18,630
session of the drupal showcase track

00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:21,660
what we what we wanted to do today is to

00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:25,230
present about this case that would be

00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,910
last year for Less Japan and we're very

00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:29,250
excited i was just telling greg did

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,449
attract chair we got very excited when

00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,920
we got to prove to talk about the

00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:33,960
session i hope you guys are very excited

00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,329
to to be here today think the drupal day

00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,940
the keynote was awesome and I really

00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:41,700
just a quick question or just quick Bo

00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:45,870
who is the first time drupalcon or all

00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:48,870
right cool and who is evaluating droop

00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:53,699
or trying to start starting droop one

00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:56,070
hour okay good alright guys so we're

00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,789
going to do a little bit of a both of us

00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:05,100
talking here so I'm going to mix a bit

00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:06,810
and we probably will finish not like

00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,010
it's going to be quite fascinating so

00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,659
we're going to have a left lots of time

00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:14,060
for a first to discuss and have to have

00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:17,250
some questions about the this case so

00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:19,799
today the story it's more like a Segway

00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,900
story so if you just use microphone is

00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,490
good but if you just go around you're

00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:26,250
going to see that there's a lush story

00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:28,020
less UK story about using Drupal ready

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,460
so we're not going to talk too much

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:32,159
about that because it was the first

00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,590
story but the focus i can set is talking

00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,900
about the less japan adoption of drupal

00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:43,920
on their commerce platform excuse me and

00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:46,619
i think this story is really how for

00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,570
interesting elements got together how we

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,579
mix them together and make it work not

00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:52,530
not only as here whether all the

00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:54,420
agencies involved in lurch itself and

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,710
the first one is a global retail

00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,360
organization election let me do this

00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,610
second one is a putting an e-commerce

00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,210
digital strategy so that's another

00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:09,539
challenge here drupal using drupal for

00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:12,819
that and the less challenge is japan is

00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:16,719
there in one from japan here how

00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:18,400
good so I'm going to talk a little about

00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:23,590
that and you guys can help me out of the

00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:27,280
gate or confirm what I'm going to say so

00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:29,650
before we continue a little bit of an

00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,989
introduction about myself Phillip Ruby

00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,450
I'm head of operations for CIT in

00:02:31,989 --> 00:02:36,730
asia-pacific I've been working with

Drupal for the past six almost seven

00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:43,749

00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:45,669

00:07:36,669 --> 00:07:41,870
thanks every right um guys we're going

00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:43,729
to go ahead with the introductions here

00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:46,460
CIT the company that we work force or

00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:49,219
both of us work together so ever write a

00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:52,339
drupal developer my head operations and

00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:54,800
work together at CIT it's a global

00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:58,129
company focused on only enterprise so we

00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,469
do most deployments of Drupal looking

00:07:58,129 --> 00:08:03,680
large-scale and to end so start with the

00:08:00,469 --> 00:08:06,169
agency strategy all the way to all the

00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,050
services involved in Drupal we are

00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:12,490
relatively big I think so two thousand

00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:15,110
employees now most of them in Brazil so

00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:18,889
that's that that map is important not

00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:20,839
only to advertise int but to tell you

00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:22,279
guys how we did for this project how we

00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:24,409
worked for this particular / so the

00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:27,139
company's brazilian started 20 years ago

00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:28,569
most of people are there about 1800 we

00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:31,219
have plaintiff offices here in US

00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:34,459
including here in los angeles area i

00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:36,560
live in sydney the ever-rising china

00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:38,269
shanghai and we have our folks in japan

00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,479
unfortunate going to bring my Japanese

00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:43,669
colleagues to to speak today but but

00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,980
that's how we are distributed across the

00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:46,820
globe in terms of Drupal we have about

00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:48,590
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,260
boo talents so that's how we managed to

00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:57,200
to deploy and develop all those our

00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:58,790
focus on the large enterprise all right

00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,990
enough about us let's talk about leash

00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:04,640
um so lush it's a UK head quartered

00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:06,620
company i'm just going to briefly well

00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:10,730
maybe it's better if i ask who doesn't

00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:13,870
know leash okay so good i brought this

00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:17,600
so it's a UK had acquired company it's a

00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:20,600
basic produce fresh handmade cosmetics

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:24,380
so look at soaps or different type of oz

00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:26,270
for cosmetics and in their busy okay but

00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:30,230
they are global now they are in about 80

00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:32,750
countries 50 countries 800 stores you

00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:36,490
know those cars including us here it's

00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:39,230
it's awesome i'll just talking to reishi

00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:41,540
how I found out about lush either your

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,520
girlfriend or or yourself if you like

00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,260
and then you're just passed by the store

00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,790
and that's how what happened to me like

00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,440
it smelled really good let me find out

00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:51,170
and then you remember lish and then you

00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:57,380
buy something to to your to your person

00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:59,330
and then and then I think it what is

00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,920
interesting about lush compared to other

00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,500
cosmetic companies not only fresh

00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,900
handmade but it's also their philosophy

00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:07,550
or in their values so basically the

00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,400
first thing they don't do animal testing

00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:13,610
so they basically count on people to

00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,630
volunteer for that they try to work as

00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:16,550
much as they can in terms of

00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:19,310
sustainability for the packaging so for

00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,230
example by go by and soap is not going

00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:22,790
to have any wrapping or any package just

00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,860
grab that soap and that's going to take

00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,060
it and all the other type of packaging

00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:30,440
is trying to be a lot more like

00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:32,210
recyclable or post recycle material so

00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,160
when we started working for them it's

00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:35,840
kind of a another motivation to work for

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,500
company with search values with with

00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:41,270
that mission and also on the other hand

00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:43,310
if we're like if you're a drupal

00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,050
developer or Drupal agency and you don't

00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,910
have many many work you can also get

00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:53,000
someone in volunteering to do the

00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:55,340
testing as well so that's lush of course

00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:59,120
they have a branch in UK in Japan sorry

00:10:55,340 --> 00:11:00,160
and like i said this story is a segue to

00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,620
the UK

00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,720
one but the vision is starting the

00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,019
headquarters in UK and they put together

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,870
this strategy as most of the companies

00:11:07,019 --> 00:11:12,940
the global companies right so very

00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:18,610
shortly or very quickly story about loss

00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:20,410
UK about me 2013 they started so that

00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:22,000
the CEO everyone the company to market

00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:24,360
the part they decided that they needed

00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,860
to bring the store experience online

00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,839
what does that mean like I said if you

00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:30,790
haven't gone to a large store try to

00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:33,579
find out later try to go to one of these

00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:35,410
stores around here and you understand

00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:37,449
better what I'm talking about but the

00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:39,519
experience of what you see the caller is

00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:42,250
everything of course they smell so it

00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:44,529
hard to bring it online but but the

00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:46,149
whole colorful experience and knowing

00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:47,350
about ingredients everything the whole

00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:48,730
interaction that you have with the

00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,050
product when you go to the store so they

00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:53,350
had this vision that they want to bring

00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:56,259
that wine because the wine selling was

00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:58,689
not even closer to the brick-and-mortar

00:11:56,259 --> 00:12:00,430
cell numbers as well so they wanted to

00:11:58,689 --> 00:12:04,630
bring the experience online but not only

00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:06,699
UK globally so they brought they

00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:10,509
involved a few agencies in Europe I

00:12:06,699 --> 00:12:11,920
think Commerce guys are clear I cause

00:12:10,509 --> 00:12:14,199
those are the companies that i that i

00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,699
worked from for this so they were

00:12:14,199 --> 00:12:17,860
engaged probably there there are other

00:12:15,699 --> 00:12:19,480
companies i'm forgetting here you're

00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,180
engaged they will help them to choose

00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,519
drupal at the time and they help them

00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,920
build this what i'm calling a platform

00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:28,509
but basically is the code base where the

00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,779
envision that will be the most features

00:12:28,509 --> 00:12:33,670
that all the countries will need plus

00:12:31,779 --> 00:12:36,250
the most important part is the look and

00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,779
feel the design how this user experience

00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,699
is going to be this global experience

00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:44,500
that we want so they put that together

00:12:39,699 --> 00:12:50,589
and in q1 may 2013 yeah about a year ago

00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:53,199
they launched the new less UK and you

00:12:50,589 --> 00:12:55,480
guys go online later but that's what I'm

00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:56,769
talking about when I when we talk when

00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,259
we talk bringing the experience online

00:12:56,769 --> 00:13:02,259
so if you go to a store that's what you

00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:05,290
see and you see nice pictures online

00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:07,149
right and back to the title of the

00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:08,800
session and it keep seeing that more and

00:13:07,149 --> 00:13:11,420
more on the marketing trends this whole

00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,160
ecommerce and content getting together

00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,920
right so those that's one of the things

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,300
we're going to be discussing here today

00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:20,690
but that's that's how I video bringing

00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:25,720
bringing more or bigger imagery better

00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:27,500
imagery to your website videos blog

00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,270
specifically for illusion of the

00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:31,640
ingredients information building greets

00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:34,370
very important on their business to talk

00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:36,860
about what is that soap made of so they

00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:38,600
don't use palm or for example right so

00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:40,580
they use more that I think all the

00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:44,830
Broads 100% vegetarian so there's no

00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:48,260
animal at all animal by-product involved

00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:49,910
so having that information connected to

00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,190
the Commerce so that's the content and

00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:53,630
commerce getting together so if you

00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:55,970
search around the product when I know

00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:57,410
more about it eventually you buy as you

00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,360
have more information about ever so

00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:05,300
that's the whole experience that they

00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:08,330
brought together interesting enough

00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:11,060
there was a another great idea I I think

00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:13,550
that they brought into this new version

00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:16,940
or this new experience which is what

00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:19,970
they called luscious kitchen basically

00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:22,010
they produce daily different products

00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:25,270
and they put a different menu every day

00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:27,770
almost like a restaurant with a chef and

00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:30,320
once they sell out they're done that's

00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:32,150
it but a good thing is apart from that

00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,470
having custom experience or personalized

00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:37,550
are going to get one of the soaps that

00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:40,340
maybe nobody else has that serves as a

00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:42,770
lab at some point if somebody order that

00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:45,020
well that was a big success let's put

00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:48,530
that product back into the mainstream

00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:51,940
product right so that's very exciting to

00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:54,190
see that happening also happen in Japan

00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:56,840
and of course if you think about it

00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:59,180
changing content so connecting to Drupal

00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:01,370
right changing content everyday approval

00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:07,190
workflow everything so you need a

00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:09,140
platform to do that as well so after UK

00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:11,720
the decision was okay we're stable

00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:14,270
enough I think we can start we think we

00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,790
can start going global right the first

00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:20,090
two counters were Brazil which were not

00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:22,700
involved although we are Brazil when we

00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:23,899
were first involved in Japan for this

00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:27,959
robot

00:15:23,899 --> 00:15:29,609
I think that's important to say i think

00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,559
i said before but they decided to choose

00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:34,259
this plataform approach so they got the

00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:36,989
code base the butyl s UK they try to

00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:38,850
make it generic as possible every right

00:15:36,989 --> 00:15:41,689
to talk a little bit about the technical

00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:45,569
requirements are technical components

00:15:41,689 --> 00:15:47,730
but then here's the code Japan here's

00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:49,980
the code Brazil here's the code career

00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:52,589
so that's the idea and if you have

00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,989
something that needs to be or can be

00:15:52,589 --> 00:15:56,759
generic once you customize to Japan but

00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:59,100
can be more generic for the plataform

00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:01,230
let's organize the governance and bring

00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,169
you back to the main source code that's

00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:06,809
one approach compared to gradient

00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:08,999
distribution which is similar but that's

00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:10,589
another one or multi site which is

00:16:08,999 --> 00:16:12,509
something that also we built for the

00:16:10,589 --> 00:16:14,689
customers where would basically put

00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:17,519
everyone under the same umbrella

00:16:14,689 --> 00:16:19,889
including the hosting part of it but

00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,449
here there was autonomy and I forgot to

00:16:19,889 --> 00:16:23,309
mention the beginning one of the things

00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:24,899
if there's one word one thing that I

00:16:23,309 --> 00:16:27,179
want you guys especially you guys that

00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:28,559
are evaluating Drupal one of the things

00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:30,239
did the word that I want you guys to

00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,549
leave this session today is flexibility

00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,989
so if we starting with this that's

00:16:32,549 --> 00:16:36,179
that's what we gotta have in mind when

00:16:33,989 --> 00:16:37,499
it comes to Drupal you have different

00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:39,329
approaches you have different options

00:16:37,499 --> 00:16:41,279
and we're going to deep dive a little

00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:43,169
bit about this flexibility capability as

00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,449
well but that was the first so we're

00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:46,919
going to build something we're going to

00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:49,319
improve your time to market by building

00:16:46,919 --> 00:16:51,269
this baseline and then you have some

00:16:49,319 --> 00:16:56,329
freedom to customize to your local needs

00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:59,639
and then from your cable we go to Japan

00:16:56,329 --> 00:17:02,879
getting to in Japan we were involved and

00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:05,189
then we understood their goals first of

00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:07,589
course implement the vision that was

00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:11,880
coming from less UK so leverage the

00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:14,279
Drupal plataform from lush but also as

00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,589
usual with with any project especially

00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:19,649
commerce related lounge with a very

00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:22,559
aggressive timeline by October so we

00:17:19,649 --> 00:17:25,139
were engaged around july by october last

00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,539
year in time for the christmas sales so

00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:30,210
the Christmas a start in October so

00:17:27,539 --> 00:17:32,519
those are the major goals but then let's

00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:34,570
go another level under that but at a

00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:37,179
high level those are the goals

00:17:34,570 --> 00:17:39,970
so we were involved and then we we say

00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:41,350
look okay can do it but let's lay out

00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:46,960
all the challenge and how we're going to

00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:48,789
tackle them first one is to replace the

00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,740
existing platform we'll talk more about

00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:54,519
it but basically that was the previous

00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:56,830
website when it comes to the content and

00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:59,440
commerce was way different from what

00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,120
they have now so that was a main reasons

00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:04,000
that he wanted to do it but more

00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:07,289
importantly was the technical part of

00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,870
the plataform it's it's a it was an ESP

00:18:07,289 --> 00:18:13,269
platform not net asp active server pages

00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:15,700
plataform and it was very limited in

00:18:13,269 --> 00:18:18,279
terms of expanding or customizing any

00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:21,700
change we need to have a lot of custom

00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:24,700
development very difficult or take a lot

00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,190
of time to to bring integration like

00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,450
with the new social media for example so

00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:32,620
that was one of the issues with a

00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:36,029
platform and also the platform was kind

00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:39,009
of one monolithic application meaning

00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:41,230
the front and the OMS order management

00:18:39,009 --> 00:18:43,690
systems all the back office for the

00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:45,549
order management and also feature phone

00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:48,809
we'll talk about that now we're also

00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:51,340
getting the same unique asp application

00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:53,980
so that was the first challenge replace

00:18:51,340 --> 00:19:03,539
that add to some point not replace the

00:18:53,980 --> 00:19:03,539
whole thing second one that's microsoft

00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:09,840
you

00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,340
ok

00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:33,039
alright I'm sorry about that keep

00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:35,230
feature phones working so that's the

00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,600
layout of the feature phone the dumb

00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:40,240
phones right they flip flip out phones I

00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,940
don't know if you guys know my friends

00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:47,200
from Japan they will know but feature

00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:49,330
phone is still huge in Japan I saw a

00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,179
report quite recently two months ago

00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:54,490
that actually last year the feature

00:19:52,179 --> 00:19:56,679
phone cells or shipment was even bigger

00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:58,539
than the smartphones so there's to

00:19:56,679 --> 00:20:02,650
invest in improving the interface for

00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:04,390
those new feature phones so they still

00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:06,880
gotta keep that whoever has a business

00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,980
or a user base with that you still gotta

00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,650
keep that so we got we had to keep that

00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:13,510
for less true what we we've been seeing

00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:16,960
for some customers that is starting and

00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:19,840
you are creating a prices in japan now

00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,610
they might not go but it's really a

00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:25,900
business decision strategy but it still

00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:27,850
huge and in japan there's a lot lots of

00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,740
material bout that it's not only feature

00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,600
phone but there's some characteristics

00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:34,809
about Japan that even there's a

00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:37,299
described as a Galapagos syndrome that

00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:40,240
things have been developed or have were

00:20:37,299 --> 00:20:41,890
developed inside Japan that you can find

00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,730
anywhere else and I think feature phone

00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:47,770
fits into that category too so everyone

00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:50,520
going to Japan market need to be aware

00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:52,870
of the reality there and plan for that

00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,730
so we need to keep that was not just

00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:57,490
coming okay let's forget about this this

00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:59,380
is all know this is important for this

00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,820
market so we got to put this in the plan

00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,380
if we're going to replace something

00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:07,890
we're going to make sure that this to

00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:10,419
work so second challenge third one

00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:12,909
diving a little bit so decoupled that

00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:16,659
ESP application because the idea is to

00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:17,980
keep the OEMs the same again the managed

00:21:16,659 --> 00:21:20,080
with the back office management the

00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,789
macula office operation team they still

00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,650
wanted to do the same way they do all

00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:25,570
the tasks for managing the product

00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:28,299
orders and everything on the users etc

00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:30,730
so we they didn't want to go in the

00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:33,100
first round the first phase and change

00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,730
the whole platform right away that is

00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,160
harder to do

00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:38,770
few steps or phases eventually they're

00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,270
going to replace the whole thing but for

00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:42,700
this phase especially because of the

00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:44,830
time frame they wanted to keep the back

00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:47,530
office the same way so we need to

00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:50,710
decouple that meaning let's ignore the

00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:53,110
desktop front end and bring droop on top

00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:57,790
of it but make sure the Drupal can talk

00:21:53,110 --> 00:22:00,430
to this OMS asp backhand right which is

00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:02,830
the second topic here and again let's

00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:08,430
not touch the feature phone that you

00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:10,750
gotta continue working the next one is a

00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:13,720
imagine that we're bringing drupal with

00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:16,270
own database right and and we already

00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,070
have a live database you have a bunch of

00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:21,400
users which of products and data a

00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:24,070
million registered users so how we make

00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:25,840
sure that most you login into drupal you

00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:28,270
have your experience you're not going to

00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,940
have delays getting data from they are

00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:32,890
the database sequel server so how we can

00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:35,440
synchronize the data how we can migrate

00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:37,750
to start with right and decide still

00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,490
running even during the project we still

00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,740
need to make sure that I we test the

00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:44,020
migration and then we do a freeze in the

00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:45,970
end then we do the final migration right

00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:50,800
so that was another challenge to be

00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:54,520
considering the plan there's also UX

00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:57,250
translation localization the idea is to

00:22:54,520 --> 00:23:00,010
use the whole design coming from UK but

00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,630
I mean you're going to another country

00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:04,210
right so there will be found there will

00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:05,860
be small things that you gotta change we

00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:07,750
we did a bit of again in the count

00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:10,540
existing content product information

00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:13,660
gradients from the existing large site

00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:16,210
in Japan but also getting from UK and

00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,040
it's not just translating as well you've

00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:20,650
gotta go and check ok can we say those

00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:22,150
words in the green it's in Japan this is

00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:24,040
different like so it's almost the same

00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:26,080
thing before bringing it to us so that

00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,640
ingredient is something that is correct

00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:30,040
in Japan so it's not just pure

00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,960
translation so the agency that we

00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,940
involved in Japan also had to consider

00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:37,300
that in disgust with the business in

00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:41,230
Japan and every right to talk a bit

00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:42,910
about about that i think for solar we so

00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:47,900
this platform is deployed on aqua and

00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:51,140
they use much solar diversion still 3.5

00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:53,840
right and the 3.5 doesn't support the

00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:56,810
Japanese characters am I seeing this

00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,090
right yes so so we had to do some

00:23:56,810 --> 00:24:02,120
customization is not perfect to allow

00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:04,340
that 3.6 our exports that so there was

00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:06,440
also this challenge which of course we

00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:07,940
didn't know when we started so those

00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:10,250
things that come up and I think it's

00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:16,460
good you guys to remember once you

00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:19,730
engage on this this journey less not us

00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:22,250
yet communication as you you would

00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:24,140
imagine so we have ever right here from

00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:26,360
China select why we have someone from

00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,830
China or Brazilian butt as if you

00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,540
remember them an opportunity we have the

00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:32,150
local team in japan which I couldn't

00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:33,920
bring you here today but part of part of

00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:36,380
the team that implemented this was in

00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:39,020
China together with ever ride and I was

00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:41,930
supporting traveling all the time and

00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:46,190
helping from Australia but the core team

00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:50,060
we had in Japan lush of course CNT and a

00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:52,340
vendor to work on the SP platform go ms

00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:55,010
and also creative agency to do the whole

00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:56,540
translation everything UK we still gotta

00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:58,850
communicate with the headquarters and

00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:01,520
also the team that created the platform

00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:05,090
for the governance purpose any China's

00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,400
Han T so how we manage that like the

00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:09,110
English the Japanese everything involved

00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,430
in Chinese right so it was under

00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:12,230
challenge something that we do all the

00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:14,450
time so it wasn't not good of a deep

00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:15,890
difficult for us but for the customer is

00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:16,820
these different rights we engage with

00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:20,720
the customer that hasn't done that

00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:23,900
before and the last one timeline I said

00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,820
that before so move quick so because

00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:28,610
they want to leverage the Christmas

00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:30,710
right if we missed then now stop the

00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:34,400
project only next year alright very

00:25:30,710 --> 00:25:39,470
gressive so with that said let's stick

00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:40,859
to have a bit on the architecture thanks

00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:47,399
Phillip

00:25:40,859 --> 00:25:47,399
okay so guys did you remember my name

00:25:53,009 --> 00:26:02,559
this is a simple act of view of this

00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:07,450
project at a high level select a jerk I

00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:10,629
include the following compounds so do

00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:14,940
become Commerce module is already

00:26:10,629 --> 00:26:18,460
existed in the UK platform and the

00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:23,619
vanish and vanish and the memory cache

00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:30,340
is used for improved side performs fuse

00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:33,549
and have to use the fuse with uploading

00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:37,419
manager interface along with the media

00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:41,259
so the operation manager can easily

00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:45,729
manage their products orders in the main

00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:49,179
interface and adjust adjust field is

00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:54,070
used for a user to type their address

00:26:49,179 --> 00:26:58,419
and also we have custom sized a new

00:26:54,070 --> 00:27:08,849
future so user can easily find us there

00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:08,849
just by Japan Japan postcode and salsa

00:27:09,809 --> 00:27:23,019
names Sicily ok in the outer circle we

00:27:20,289 --> 00:27:25,929
have some third-party service here and

00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:29,289
the folder so the part of service the

00:27:25,929 --> 00:27:32,919
first one currently currently is a image

00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:36,669
cloud service and the support image

00:27:32,919 --> 00:27:39,999
change formations like image resizing

00:27:36,669 --> 00:27:47,259
clapping and the face detect service and

00:27:39,999 --> 00:27:52,690
also behind a CDN basic mine and the

00:27:47,259 --> 00:27:57,230
same code guys the noses and cold

00:27:52,690 --> 00:28:02,690
and the same code what comfort the video

00:27:57,230 --> 00:28:05,679
to support Mitt ability files and in our

00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:12,320
case we comfort all the video to support

00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:19,150
iphone and mac or pc iphone and other

00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:22,610
Android device so when comfort we have

00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:26,059
safe back to crown the ink with a loaf

00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:32,840
format file to spur to provide a CDN

00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:36,320
access and apache solr you know episodes

00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:39,460
provided the host site in taxi and the

00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:45,020
whole side searching service with google

00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:48,380
excluded and soap am is used up for

00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:53,059
client communicate and little time at

00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:56,720
read before the kind of service google

00:28:53,059 --> 00:28:59,450
tag management google domain is in Alec

00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:04,100
pleasure is used to manage multiple

00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:07,160
Google and linux I settings in office of

00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:10,400
each pole and a new to beside in one

00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:13,850
place so Google management can manage

00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:17,480
multiple Google site settings in one

00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:19,850
place is fairly easily sorry birth in

00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,890
that particular case we wanted to for

00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:23,890
the feature phone you are our website I

00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:27,590
want to track one ID in Google Analytics

00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:29,419
then for the desktop and a smartphone

00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:31,850
yeah another idea writing they were to

00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:34,040
have the same report all the interface

00:29:31,850 --> 00:29:35,540
so Google a latex bites off the simple

00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:38,000
kinetics wouldn't provide you have to

00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:40,490
have a separate report interface but we

00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:44,090
tag manager you can associate different

00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:46,309
IDs and and see one single report so

00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:48,410
that's I think my at least my was my

00:29:46,309 --> 00:29:50,169
first time using tag manager yes that's

00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:53,789
that what helped them in that case

00:29:50,169 --> 00:29:58,379
manage different IDs in the same report

00:29:53,789 --> 00:30:01,830
you thank you flew okay next here's

00:29:58,379 --> 00:30:06,899
google map is based from UK the screen

00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:12,769
and we just look sighs the map to japan

00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:17,399
and the support large shoppers in japan

00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:20,429
mill charm is used for newsletter also

00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:24,960
yesterday i have got a mail chimp monkey

00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:29,580
head from the deck is here if you

00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:34,999
haven't yet it's a good gift or for us

00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:37,919
and Twitter Facebook will be shows a

00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:42,320
latest illogical such community

00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:46,379
information for the latter shops and

00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:48,749
this is best last is the important this

00:30:46,379 --> 00:30:56,070
is the important part of this act 80

00:30:48,749 --> 00:31:02,629
years interpolation with OMS and OMS is

00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:07,489
the last owed other side a build with

00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:13,830
Microsoft ASP and the circle server so

00:31:07,489 --> 00:31:18,269
for in for this lunch he they just want

00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:22,820
to keep the odd check out and other

00:31:18,269 --> 00:31:27,330
management in there OMS back and obvious

00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:31,379
so so we needed we needed to change

00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:39,330
create a data synchronization plums jubo

00:31:31,379 --> 00:31:40,739
and os OMS database now you can explain

00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:42,359
more in the next slide right we're going

00:31:40,739 --> 00:31:48,919
to deep dive on that one yes next one

00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:48,919
year so just before right sorry okay

00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:56,190
especially look at this and I we came

00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:59,789
with a Drupal code base from UK and we

00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:02,820
still added more components we customize

00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:05,429
the few we created new more just like a

00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:06,380
dress feud in Japan just specific for

00:32:05,429 --> 00:32:08,390
Japan

00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:10,610
whew configurations as well so I think

00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:12,260
that is a when we put this together

00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:13,340
there was like look this is what Drupal

00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,230
is about that's what I said about

00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:17,870
flexibility so it's true crime with

00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:19,580
something that was prepackaged we stir

00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:22,100
it which should read things and let like

00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:23,810
I said in just a few months be able to

00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:25,100
support all the requirements not to

00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,390
mention all the back office where you're

00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,340
going to talk about them again

00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:31,910
flexibility I think that's the thing

00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:36,560
that we can see on this life too thanks

00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:40,760
Phillip sorry for my bad english so as

00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:44,870
we said well of the change challenge and

00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:52,270
the key features of this project is the

00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:57,650
textures existing ashp back front and

00:32:52,270 --> 00:33:00,460
from the OMS backstop so which are we

00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:12,010
needed to replacing the front end with

00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:16,760
Jubal and so also says we have solid

00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:19,820
toad pit phone and the faithful say just

00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:23,030
one we wouldn't have to touch this is a

00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:31,030
faithful say keep and remains of

00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:31,030
features with a fish Pole so the

00:33:31,389 --> 00:33:43,450
solid so the complex involved years said

00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:48,599
data migration of the other side to do

00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:55,209
both such as maculans users products

00:33:48,599 --> 00:34:01,179
others into Jubal the next is data

00:33:55,209 --> 00:34:05,619
signal signals between jubo and the OMS

00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:07,959
rains so use when the manage into ball

00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:12,519
at the main interface say updates their

00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:15,639
product informations our new user

00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:19,169
register and oversight or user updated

00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:27,279
their profile in do beside it will out

00:34:19,169 --> 00:34:32,440
signals tues SP database okay so next is

00:34:27,279 --> 00:34:36,159
so for the the data transmission we just

00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:41,079
need to create a web service to provide

00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:45,940
an API to communicate with du Bois and

00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:48,460
OMS with 4 to both sides we use the

00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:54,569
service module it's very easy to create

00:34:48,460 --> 00:35:00,819
an API so for the OEM side 20 f OS OMS

00:34:54,569 --> 00:35:04,589
spt provides an API but we but we could

00:35:00,819 --> 00:35:08,319
load some coders tells guy how to

00:35:04,589 --> 00:35:12,509
connect to the tube or web service use

00:35:08,319 --> 00:35:12,509
the OS and the rest for

00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:28,930
okay so I and force a section say in the

00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:33,430
om's OMS back and so they just wanted to

00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:36,819
keep that payment and to check out in

00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:42,099
the inside so we needed where is the

00:35:36,819 --> 00:35:45,910
user in juba side blows a product and

00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:51,069
edit card saying they kick check out on

00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:56,730
suicide it will auto post to date to the

00:35:51,069 --> 00:36:01,240
ASG side with the user cookies so the

00:35:56,730 --> 00:36:04,680
OEMs can lose a user's card from Jubal's

00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:08,670
and finishes following check out and

00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:15,539
it's the benefits of the Act eight years

00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:20,349
minimize the operation of the pack of

00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:24,339
uploading user and minimizes the complex

00:36:20,349 --> 00:36:36,190
pci because the pc is also handled by

00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:40,170
oasis om suit side yes and forces data

00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:45,099
migration i had to change our

00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:49,210
information with we just used my soul

00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:52,779
sista load before we have tried to use

00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:58,690
do both mike mccready module to import

00:36:52,779 --> 00:37:01,569
the users and the products but for 47

00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:04,750
million users and to import it's very

00:37:01,569 --> 00:37:09,190
slowly so we have tried to use my

00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:14,680
services with load import from csv file

00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:18,460
is very quickly and finish off this

00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:20,799
import costs 10 but i think for the

00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:27,240
magnetic module may be more than one

00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:31,020
hour or more hours and we just use split

00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:34,560
right assam splitter to transfer the

00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:37,890
data insert with the field through the

00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:42,530
hookers structure to get theaters at

00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:51,060
tables which used force in tightly and

00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:55,010
as tables okay in this side it's just

00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:58,410
leased a major features and modules edit

00:37:55,010 --> 00:38:05,610
into Leicester to pay the difference

00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:11,630
with you UK plan for service we have

00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:11,630
said for into collision with OEMs

00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:23,250
address field Japanese postcode it with

00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:30,200
a custom size with rt to support just

00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:36,780
look up by Japan postcode and also in

00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:40,530
Japan client want to manage to seize

00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:43,380
their products are fleshly after they

00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:47,600
updated their profile in a product

00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:51,690
detail page or homepage so we use the

00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:54,750
apply and a club project module to autox

00:38:51,690 --> 00:39:00,570
price of vanish kg in o'clock round

00:38:54,750 --> 00:39:03,780
when's user update their products but

00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:08,760
and another issue is heaven what

00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:13,109
happened is in some pages so it include

00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:16,800
some block date forms Apache Solr the

00:39:13,109 --> 00:39:20,010
turn so when they use a updated

00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:24,260
productive it will be to the solar to

00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:29,000
index but dueling's is index the date

00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:32,850
Cepeda is auto exploit so we have load

00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:40,070
explore each module extra module based

00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:40,070
on based on explain modo to support when

00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:48,160
Solar index finish weekly clear sound

00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:53,110
petty cash so the user can quickly to

00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:56,800
see all the fresh product pages and Neff

00:39:53,110 --> 00:40:00,400
Class A plus is a product eliminating

00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:03,610
service in Japan so we have custom size

00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:08,710
code to interpolation with two ball and

00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:12,690
the net plus so the last crumbly we have

00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:16,060
total before he is it is a image ground

00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:20,890
service and support image change

00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:27,580
formations behind us CDN service we also

00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:32,290
you can take more about sees okay thank

00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:37,210
you right we started late but I don't

00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:39,370
want impact next session or lunch so I'm

00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:41,170
going to jump a bit ahead guys we did

00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:43,450
prepared I know maybe some of you guys

00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:45,490
will not go to the website and check we

00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:49,300
did prepare the video i'll share later

00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:54,430
with or just quickly how the site look i

00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:56,200
think is just a short video but that's

00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:59,210
that's the experience again because the

00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:01,250
session was about how effective

00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:03,260
this decision from Russia was to bring

00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,240
this experience with commercial yeah we

00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:07,849
thought about the background that's the

00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:09,650
technical platform but with Drupal and

00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:11,950
be able to do all of that and over the

00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:11,950
phone

00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:17,810
advertising lush but

00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:19,830
but also saying we're we're using it one

00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:22,140
of the ones

00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:25,060
in fact actually worth what is happening

00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:27,600
Maddie blows

00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,600
so on

00:41:28,349 --> 00:41:32,299
because wearing red you can see

00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:44,090
go back alright guys so so that was the

00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:46,850
the whole how it happened under the hood

00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:48,350
but in the end of the day how was how

00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:50,690
was the result how was a Christmas sale

00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:52,430
right that's what they want so in the

00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:56,210
end of the day we launched the new loose

00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:59,360
Japan comp experience following the

00:41:56,210 --> 00:42:01,010
global strategy so that was a success we

00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,780
brought the union of Commerce and

00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:05,710
content again coming from this the same

00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:10,190
vision strategy and more importantly if

00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:12,470
if not as important is it was reflected

00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:13,730
in the end of the year so what compared

00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:15,890
to the previous year there was a fifty

00:42:13,730 --> 00:42:18,260
percent increase on sales of wine so

00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:20,660
everything together actually brought

00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:23,690
financial results as well so this is a

00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:25,610
Just Giving step that the work was was

00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:27,500
pretty good and in the plataform and

00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:30,500
everything chosen was it was a success

00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:31,880
and the platforming and there was all

00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,230
the demand coming so the whole

00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:34,640
combination of the whole thing

00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:36,800
everything that was built all the

00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:39,980
decisions made hold the platform as well

00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,420
for all the peak on the sales 25 there's

00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:43,280
the there's the Savior's independent

00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:47,030
there is a couple days after they they

00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,980
can there's a there's a some product

00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:52,180
with a price off so there's kind of two

00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:55,460
rounds of sales near the Christmas time

00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:56,780
so that's just to compare less UK less

00:42:55,460 --> 00:43:01,790
Japan's again keeping the same

00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:04,360
experience that's the ingredients so you

00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:06,800
guys can look have a look in Japan calm

00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:08,360
the back office is very important I mean

00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:10,330
the beginning I myself I was a bit

00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:13,250
worthy especially when comes to Drupal

00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:15,290
is not perfect when when you compared to

00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:17,900
some may be other enterprise platforms

00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:19,550
or especially when customers such as in

00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:21,140
Japan they're used to do their things on

00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:23,810
that way and how we're going to

00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:25,340
customize the back office in the past we

00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:26,870
often would just worry about any user

00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:29,240
experience you wouldn't worry so much

00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:32,180
about the operation management

00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:34,040
experience so we we thanks to views

00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:36,490
thanks to a lot of things that were

00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:40,070
built on the plataform based coding UK

00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:42,140
the last Japan team was very happy with

00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:43,760
the backups interface they thought it

00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:46,299
was even better than of course the OMS

00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,779
platform that they had so it was great

00:43:46,299 --> 00:43:51,910
awesome so the in Japan my friends from

00:43:49,779 --> 00:43:54,759
Japan can help me out here but they

00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:56,650
wanted to have very specific details at

00:43:54,759 --> 00:43:59,380
each custom field I want to search for

00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:01,839
that so from my experience working here

00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:04,959
you ass and end in Brazil there you have

00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:06,519
more more requirements I wanted to have

00:44:04,959 --> 00:44:08,380
more flexibility I wanted to have more

00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:10,630
there were more details than what we

00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:12,519
found in lush so we had to customize

00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:14,380
that and thanks to Drupal wasn't that

00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:16,239
difficult was just playing around with

00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:17,949
videos and then updating one thing or

00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:22,239
the other configuring so there was a

00:44:17,949 --> 00:44:24,249
good thing another like in Japan as well

00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:25,719
they want to even though we were

00:44:24,249 --> 00:44:27,489
supporting the platform for them we

00:44:25,719 --> 00:44:30,039
manage the platform together with

00:44:27,489 --> 00:44:32,739
document but they wanted to have all the

00:44:30,039 --> 00:44:34,239
logs all the details logged and I wanted

00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:36,369
to have this API log when I have

00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:38,799
everything so also we we easily could

00:44:36,369 --> 00:44:40,809
have that available for the team so to

00:44:38,799 --> 00:44:41,949
make sure everyone is engaged with a

00:44:40,809 --> 00:44:43,839
platter formula it's not something

00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:45,400
coming from the global the headquarters

00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:46,689
is something that you will be able to

00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,029
leverage and you thread so it was

00:44:46,689 --> 00:44:50,289
important to get binding from the local

00:44:49,029 --> 00:44:54,819
team right so I have everything that

00:44:50,289 --> 00:44:57,849
they need so the takeaway is just moving

00:44:54,819 --> 00:45:00,189
a bit quick guys so time to market was

00:44:57,849 --> 00:45:02,619
one of the key things so having this

00:45:00,189 --> 00:45:05,199
decision of a platform a code base built

00:45:02,619 --> 00:45:09,189
first was definitely a good start for

00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:13,179
the pan we did we did go through some

00:45:09,189 --> 00:45:16,209
customization level as you guys saw the

00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:18,670
seed for Japan but I reckon if II if we

00:45:16,209 --> 00:45:20,589
get some a different market even even in

00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:21,880
Brazil for my knowledge except for the

00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:25,299
whole tax in Brazil which is very

00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:27,249
complex but everything else probably

00:45:25,299 --> 00:45:29,079
would be faster so for smaller markets

00:45:27,249 --> 00:45:31,299
or four different markets having this

00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:33,009
platform code base decision would

00:45:31,299 --> 00:45:34,959
definitely make things faster to hit the

00:45:33,009 --> 00:45:36,429
ground running for for those countries

00:45:34,959 --> 00:45:38,829
building investing on this platform

00:45:36,429 --> 00:45:40,630
upfront but shipping the code and giving

00:45:38,829 --> 00:45:42,699
the flexibility so that was an important

00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:45,849
decision and Drupal was fundamental for

00:45:42,699 --> 00:45:49,900
that technology I so the flexibility i

00:45:45,849 --> 00:45:52,509
keep saying all the time the teams and

00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:54,489
the language so communication i mean

00:45:52,509 --> 00:45:56,709
that's that's what we do we work the RF

00:45:54,489 --> 00:45:58,680
chinese team japanese team our team in

00:45:56,709 --> 00:46:01,560
brazil so English

00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:04,050
we use tools different set of tools we

00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:05,520
can talk about that offline for four to

00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:07,640
make sure that all communications is

00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:11,420
working the project manager everything

00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:14,730
and local presence I mean in Japan and

00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:16,740
in China as well as we do business just

00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:19,590
without local press without someone that

00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:22,080
knows how to navigate there is just we

00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:23,880
can it wouldn't be able to make it and

00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:25,350
another challenge that we had that I

00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:28,110
think it was important to bring you here

00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:30,150
that we planned but we didn't plan so so

00:46:28,110 --> 00:46:31,980
so good I think could we could have been

00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:34,500
better is for data cleansing so the

00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:36,360
site's live is from an old platform so

00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:38,850
every time we try a new round of

00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:41,250
migraine the data towards the uat phase

00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:43,320
it's just order something missing let's

00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:44,670
go back to the sequel server thing well

00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,500
let's do it again again so let's create

00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:48,840
a script to do data cleansing first

00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:50,250
let's clean up the data then we start

00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:52,260
the whole round of validation of this

00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:54,420
data right so that's something to plan

00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:58,970
ahead look at the plataform investigate

00:46:54,420 --> 00:47:00,870
these scripts first the data first so I

00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:06,060
right full of mine I'm just going to go

00:47:00,870 --> 00:47:08,520
ahead running out of time guys important

00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:10,860
things I think that's something CIT does

00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:15,350
and want to mention here so as a right

00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:17,820
side giving back so part of this project

00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:20,310
we created this view the right created

00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:22,830
this module address viewed specific for

00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:25,920
that just got promoted from sent box so

00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:27,570
everyone can just go start using that we

00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:32,460
also created Claudine Aires already

00:47:27,570 --> 00:47:34,650
there and what good excuse me there's

00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:39,330
awesome code snips is nibud that we put

00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:42,060
it in github okay yeah we put a video

00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:43,710
for that too but running out of time but

00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:45,870
we can also get some code so for example

00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:47,610
asp so if we're going to ever do a

00:47:45,870 --> 00:47:49,770
project we're still going to have to use

00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:52,800
an SP and authenticate against drupal

00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:54,450
you can use that code as well for 40 all

00:47:52,800 --> 00:48:00,420
so that's what they do just send the

00:47:54,450 --> 00:48:01,710
data back to drupal this project another

00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,960
one that i think it's very important

00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:08,040
connects to my next to my next topic

00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:09,210
here lush is not using this but we're

00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:12,420
doing this for another customer just

00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:13,890
right now in japan GMO payment is a

00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:16,800
one of the biggest payment gateways in

00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:20,190
Japan so they work with the other

00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:22,980
platforms that grew in Japan market for

00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:25,650
for CMS and commerce they of course to

00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:28,560
use that and there wasn't there was just

00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:31,020
one module with new Burkhardt version 64

00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:32,600
Drupal and because of this project we're

00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:37,050
building right now for another customer

00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:38,430
we're finalizing this in in Drupal 7 so

00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:42,030
we're going to be putting out there in

00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:44,910
June and an expectation that we help

00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:47,370
evolved ubercart one as well as create

00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:50,250
the one for Drupal 8 and I'll mention

00:48:47,370 --> 00:48:53,010
why this is important in a few second

00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:58,500
under minutes which is connected to this

00:48:53,010 --> 00:49:00,300
so we can finalize I think what I wanted

00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:02,970
to close this session with as a promise

00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:05,100
on the abstract of the of the session is

00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:06,630
to give you guys an overview of what's

00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:08,460
going on with Drupal in that area so

00:49:06,630 --> 00:49:10,620
since we are there we're working there

00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:12,390
in a sense where in LA I think it's good

00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:14,270
to have this overview of what's

00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:17,130
happening on the other side of the world

00:49:14,270 --> 00:49:18,480
in my experience so far so two years

00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:21,060
since i moved to australia working

00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,500
dedicated with China and Japan I think

00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:24,270
there's a lot of potential surgeries

00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,460
went over there to depend in China he

00:49:24,270 --> 00:49:28,560
wrote a couple blog posts he had

00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,240
experience with us there he mentioned

00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,950
what translation with one of the

00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,320
challenge but I think if we think about

00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:36,690
the potential for both markets Japan and

00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:39,330
China and if you see how droop is not

00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:41,670
there at all it's not just small things

00:49:39,330 --> 00:49:42,900
so there's a lot of potential so I

00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:45,210
wanted to leave this message with you

00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:48,060
guys here and we just need to tackle

00:49:45,210 --> 00:49:50,310
those challenge together not only is not

00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:53,460
only CNT but also love to see more

00:49:50,310 --> 00:49:54,480
companies joining Japan in China because

00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:57,420
that's how we're going to do their

00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,980
consistent bring awareness as well but

00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:03,420
again think about the deportation in

00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:05,580
Chinese market all the local CMS or even

00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:07,350
cursed applications legacy see the ASP

00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:11,880
so there's a lot of potential there for

00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:13,080
Drupal I think the first challenge that

00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,030
I wanted to bring here that we're

00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:17,190
working on and I think lush is the first

00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:19,620
English Japan is helping here what we

00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:21,420
wanted to do more is things that happen

00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:22,190
here us with the White House see in

00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,570
Europe the Gulf

00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:25,580
the Australia the Australian Government

00:50:23,570 --> 00:50:28,820
so all those things help bring your

00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:30,320
flagship case something big helps and we

00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:32,150
need to have that in China we don't have

00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:35,150
that yet we need to have that in Japan

00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:36,620
we're building it up but that's that's

00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:38,630
one important is kind of the egg and

00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:42,290
chicken flagship case will bring more

00:50:38,630 --> 00:50:44,950
developers and business will go if there

00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:47,150
are enough developers as well all right

00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:50,450
translation I think that in terms of

00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:52,100
core and add me we are in a good good

00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:54,530
situation there with the translation

00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:57,110
team but again like drees mention i

00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:58,880
personally spoke to him last year we

00:50:57,110 --> 00:51:00,980
could still could do some work on sales

00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,720
and marketing assets so like in Japan

00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:04,220
when we try to pitch Drupal for

00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:05,840
different customers this is like look I

00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:07,400
can't find anything about drooping

00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:09,890
Japanese sorry I don't show this

00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:12,350
platform so then we have to translate

00:51:09,890 --> 00:51:13,580
everything and then gets out of date so

00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:15,290
there's still some work and I have an

00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:16,760
answer but we there will be some

00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:18,710
opportunities here there that would

00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:21,350
definitely make things move faster

00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:26,600
especially again Japan very technical

00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:28,580
very specialized teams GMO payment as I

00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:31,040
said I think as one of the biggest

00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:32,540
payment gateways and we expect that as

00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:34,190
soon as we launch that module that

00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:37,070
should trigger something in the echo

00:51:34,190 --> 00:51:38,990
season look it's a one last barrier for

00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:40,820
you not to use Drupal because yes

00:51:38,990 --> 00:51:44,330
there's a module for that major payment

00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:46,040
gateway or UnionPay so in China if you

00:51:44,330 --> 00:51:48,410
didn't use these are the most of the

00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:50,810
most accepted payment methods Union paid

00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:53,360
right so I was pushing the guys

00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:54,920
contribute to Drupal 8 accelerate but

00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,690
then I say look there's no unionpay on

00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,520
the on the donation website so they

00:51:56,690 --> 00:52:00,350
couldn't say okay I'll do it and then

00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:02,240
you'd pay me back somehow when I go

00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:03,800
there so there are specific things that

00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,450
we could focus on that market that is

00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:07,220
just one less barrier for the business

00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:09,080
to say no I can because you don't

00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:10,730
support this so we can think about other

00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:13,430
things now they'll have to be commerce

00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:15,350
can be post office or post service

00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:18,250
anything that would would be one less

00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:21,020
barrier to just find not going to Drupal

00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:22,940
talent pool we suffer that across the

00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:27,140
world do is make sure that a few times

00:52:22,940 --> 00:52:28,400
in the indirect in his keynote I think

00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:31,070
we're getting better around the world

00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:33,470
but still in China in Japan to look

00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:35,850
around java and.net traditionally and

00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:38,040
then you have a couple guys just in peak

00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:39,660
the HP is not so well seen yet so we're

00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,040
building that we're especially China

00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:43,020
were abusing relationships with

00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,210
universities creating that echo system

00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:46,890
but that's something to keep an eye as

00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:49,560
well all the initiatives we have been

00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:51,510
doing across US Europe and South America

00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:53,790
I think something we can leverage and

00:52:51,510 --> 00:52:57,720
start putting out there in the Asian

00:52:53,790 --> 00:52:59,370
markets in parallel vida and the

00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:00,630
community exists there there's not only

00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:03,120
the right there's a couple more Chinese

00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:04,410
guys here in front of panel definitely

00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:06,840
love to meet you guys and talk about

00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:09,360
that so 3 is went over there last year

00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:11,010
as well as in Japan so Japan is on the

00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:13,710
other side China here so that was

00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:16,160
drupalcamp Shanghai just in February we

00:53:13,710 --> 00:53:20,040
we did that together with the local team

00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:22,140
it's there I think in terms of business

00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:23,820
definitely need more support society is

00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:27,810
supporting both countries now but we eat

00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:29,370
a lot more help but again the potential

00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:30,870
that they have especially China so big

00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:34,500
so there's a communication high in

00:53:30,870 --> 00:53:36,900
Beijing insult China but there's so much

00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:39,180
potential the language has a barrier but

00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:41,100
if companies start looking more into

00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:45,480
that I think we can definitely build a

00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:48,960
better and bigger ecosystem I think we

00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:54,480
can show a demo about contribute more

00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:58,970
Joseph lemon ok so I still have some

00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,970
time maybe yes because that was the

00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:09,900
guys was i showed is i think that's

00:54:07,829 --> 00:54:12,420
pretty much what we had to share today

00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:14,819
the last case talk a little bit about

00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:17,910
the state of the community in japan and

00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:20,309
china if you guys have any questions i

00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:24,359
know we're running a bit late but feel

00:54:20,309 --> 00:54:30,990
free to just go to the mic or yeah or we

00:54:24,359 --> 00:54:33,680
can also talk I think it's good because

00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:37,049
we can record that yeah they'll be great

00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:38,730
hello okay right just before I cause my

00:54:37,049 --> 00:54:40,890
question just want to say that I was a

00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:42,720
developer in my Japan myself and I know

00:54:40,890 --> 00:54:45,630
how difficult it can be to meet the

00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,980
requirements of and their needs and I

00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:49,170
think you guys did an amazing job doing

00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:50,760
that in only like ten months so I was

00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:52,859
great really good person thank you and

00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:55,619
my question was I'm after you handed

00:54:52,859 --> 00:54:57,990
over the project to them and the website

00:54:55,619 --> 00:54:59,730
and did you have to offer some special

00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:01,559
training about how to use Japan

00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:03,359
especially like managing the content in

00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:04,589
the product there was a whole phase in

00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:07,440
the project is for that so the last

00:55:04,589 --> 00:55:10,799
month was uat along with operational

00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:13,140
testing and training yes so wha so we

00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:14,760
had to paralyze that there was testing

00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:16,859
but also training the whole Bridget

00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:20,450
whole month actually did you find it

00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:22,799
difficult to train train them Interpol

00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:25,470
so like I could like I said they did

00:55:22,799 --> 00:55:27,150
like interface but they kept asking new

00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:28,559
things so there was the challenge but

00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:30,450
okay I like that but please can you

00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:32,609
change this to add another field so that

00:55:30,450 --> 00:55:34,680
was a big challenge but as far as drew

00:55:32,609 --> 00:55:36,569
poner was more about I want this field

00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:38,970
now I want this type of search so that

00:55:36,569 --> 00:55:41,819
was the so back and forth then go back

00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:43,740
to the team do this go back yeah that's

00:55:41,819 --> 00:55:48,809
it but I know not so much in the Drupal

00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:51,270
okay thank you the worse thanks hi this

00:55:48,809 --> 00:55:53,089
is probable specific to the lash

00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:56,309
experience but I had a question about

00:55:53,089 --> 00:55:59,059
your integration with the external check

00:55:56,309 --> 00:56:02,750
out or fulfillment system and how are

00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:04,980
how and what challenges you faced

00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:07,319
running campaigns that flow through

00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:10,470
multiple systems so if you're rarely in

00:56:07,319 --> 00:56:12,480
ad campaign on on one website which

00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:14,000
sending traffic to the main launch site

00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,670
and then you also have the

00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:21,260
the external check out in fulfillment

00:56:15,670 --> 00:56:22,970
how you were able to pull analytics so

00:56:21,260 --> 00:56:25,580
they can see that fifty percent sales

00:56:22,970 --> 00:56:28,640
increase or attributed things to what

00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:31,520
ads and all that alright so tag manager

00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,900
was a key part of it but what was

00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:34,940
important in these architectures is

00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:37,670
everything was coming through Drupal for

00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:40,070
desktop is my phone after you create a

00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:42,320
shopping cart then you get redirected to

00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:43,670
the old mass it seems seamless to the

00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:46,340
user because we can't change the

00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:48,890
interface but it's a different system so

00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:51,020
the entry point for most of the usage is

00:56:48,890 --> 00:56:53,780
to Drupal from analytics campaign

00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:55,340
standpoint only the checkout process but

00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,630
you're right at some point if you drop

00:56:55,340 --> 00:56:59,030
out in the check out how you measure

00:56:56,630 --> 00:57:00,800
that so working with them since then to

00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:02,780
improve the analytics and to analyze

00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:05,780
that drop off when you get to the

00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:08,510
checkout but we haven't having many

00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:12,910
channels no not yet but we're working on

00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:12,910
improving that experience yet thanks

00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:17,180
thanks for a great presentation today I

00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,590
think you've been very helpful and I'm

00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:21,650
actually taking on a very similar

00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:23,780
project right now and I've never worked

00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:25,790
on a Japanese translated site before I

00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:28,460
guess my employer thinks I need a new

00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:30,080
challenge and I'm sure they'll be

00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:34,400
watching this video and hearing me say

00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:36,710
that my question is you know for each

00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,120
your internationalized sites of it and

00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:41,000
I'm just guessing here it looks like you

00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:43,940
guys did a separate code base for each

00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:47,330
one is that correct yes and why is that

00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:48,920
why not you know do one massive in a

00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:50,600
Drupal site for those translations are

00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:53,180
you viewing them as distinct audiences

00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:54,560
where they wouldn't be you know English

00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:57,440
customer wouldn't be the same as a

00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:59,390
Japanese customer any you also mean like

00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:00,890
hosting no to get in see me sasur not

00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:02,030
necessarily they're not necessarily I

00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:04,760
mean there's plenty of ways you could

00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:06,710
you know architect that I think there's

00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:09,620
a there was a decision of giving

00:58:06,710 --> 00:58:11,390
flexibility and avoiding back in forth

00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:13,280
in terms of the Gulf Ernest so I think

00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:15,230
the governance piece is bad especially

00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,670
being on the other side of the world was

00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:18,860
a decision that let us take look look

00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:20,330
let's give that freedom but there's do

00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:21,830
some governance around okay if you

00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:24,580
notice something that is more generic we

00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:27,230
can bring it back to the code base but

00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:28,400
but they wanted to keep it because this

00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:31,580
front teams will be building that

00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:34,550
wouldn't be the same I say UK team that

00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:36,170
started this so if was the same thing

00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:37,640
would be like Fosse int doing the whole

00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:39,980
thing for example would be easier to

00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:41,630
manage that I think so you add an extra

00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:44,780
level and you have four months to

00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:47,840
deliver so but you're right i think that

00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:49,460
will be probably 11 good decision if you

00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:52,250
have time and have the teams to do it

00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:54,500
our users on the UK site shared with the

00:58:52,250 --> 00:58:57,290
japanese later there's a protozoan I

00:58:54,500 --> 00:59:01,670
don't notice every okay yeah yeah thank

00:58:57,290 --> 00:59:03,380
you NORs how are you I'm in the middle

00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:06,290
of a big redesign with thousands of

00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:08,000
articles and pieces of content and one

00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:11,300
of the big challenges of a redesign is

00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,040
losing your SEO ranking when you change

00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:14,960
you are l's and aliases and things like

00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:18,080
that what was your approach to make sure

00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:21,500
that you kept you know took the minimal

00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:33,530
amount of hit with a redesign on that do

00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:41,090
you Natalie sure I wasn't for the SEO we

00:59:33,530 --> 00:59:45,910
just import the old lashes side to do

00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:50,960
beside with CSV file they have exporter

00:59:45,910 --> 00:59:54,500
exist euros in the older OEMs and give

00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:57,710
us so we have used looked at important

00:59:54,500 --> 01:00:01,540
module to import other SEO so you kept

00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:07,540
the same perfect billions yes same alias

01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:07,540
okay thank you right

01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:15,450
Thanks exactly that's really what we're

01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:18,529
looking at but I just wanted to make

01:00:15,450 --> 01:00:18,529
sure that there's anything else that

01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:24,210
indeed it because our site is a mess

01:00:21,269 --> 01:00:26,700
it's a legacy site from 2006 and there's

01:00:24,210 --> 01:00:28,950
a lot of you know file directory

01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:34,049
structure we need to clean up and stuff

01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:37,559
like that so thank you you look all

01:00:34,049 --> 01:00:39,749
right guys I guess that's it thank you

01:00:37,559 --> 01:00:42,869
very much for a time we are out there in

01:00:39,749 --> 01:00:44,430
the if you we're all during the booth we

01:00:42,869 --> 01:00:46,559
have a booth that so if you want to stop

01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:50,119
by and have a chat I would love to hear

01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:50,119
more more case anything thank you

01:01:37,809 --> 01:01:39,869
