Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	In 2014, UK-based handmade cosmetics company, Lush, anticipated a busy holiday season for its eCommerce business in Japan. There was also a trend indicating that  the market share for  mobile transactions in Japan was increasing as well.  Lush Japan knew it’s existing web content management system wasn’t equipped to meet these needs, so the company sought a new platform, ultimately adding  Drupal Commerce to its solution portfolio.

Join CI&T team at this session as share how Drupal helped bring Lush's eCommerce+Content strategy to lushjapan.com, while still maintaining a consistent global brand look & feel and user experience.  

The challenges involved:

Deliver in less than 4 months;
Leverage an existing distribution (build for Lush UK) and customize it
Integrate with an existing Japanese OMS
Localize the solution to Japan specific needs in Japan
Migrate content/product information from the existing platform
Support specific operation management workflows
We will also share a bit of the "under the hood" insights, including the modules used, challenges for localization, integration, and migration, plus the overall architecture.

At the end, we'll also have covered:

The business outputs for Lush Japan
Lessons learned when bringing a "western" distribution to "the east"
The state of Drupal in Japan/Asia and how you can (and should!) get involved
