Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Designing End-to-End Experiences: Why we need Service Experience Design
Publication date: 2015-05-13
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	Designing a website is not just about designing good user experience. It’s about designing new processes, new identities, and new partnerships.

When we engage with a client on a web design project, we are engaging with the totality of what they offer their customers. In many cases, the website is just a stop along the journey their customers take. Decisions we facilitate on web content, architecture, and design impact the ways our clients work and the end-to-end experience of their customers.

As true designers of experiences, and not just touchpoints, we have an opportunity to be more intentional in our practice to support the human systems impacted by our designs.

We need to think bigger.
We need to consider the whole journey, end-to-end and top-to-bottom.
We need Service Experience Design (SXD).

In this talk, I’ll share my journey into SXD, and why everything I learn makes me want to learn more.

Who this session is for:

Designers who want to think bigger
Project Managers who want a new perspective
People working in a multi-channel ecosystem
Anyone on a team designing products and customer experiences
Anyone interested in learning about Service Experience
