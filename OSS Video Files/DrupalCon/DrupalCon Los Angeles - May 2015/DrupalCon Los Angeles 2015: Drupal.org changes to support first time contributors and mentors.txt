I'm ESET I work for black mesh black

00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:53,860
mesh is a hosting company and they do

00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:57,130
about sixty-five percent of their

00:04:53,860 --> 00:05:01,120
business is Drupal I am NOT a sysadmin

00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:04,240
for them instead they pay me to mentor

00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,210
other people work on core and travel to

00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:11,530
events and they do this as their way of

00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:18,070
giving back to the Drupal project i'm

00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:20,170
also a CT on twitter hi i'm melina i

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:23,230
work at the university of illinois at

00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:25,090
chicago where i am a developer and a

00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:28,300
system administrator and i'm also a

00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:30,820
contributor to drupal hate my twitter

00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,890
handle is title jacob in kc wants to

00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:36,990
know how to pronounce it I have a

00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,990
helpful pronunciation guide board

00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:47,710
so the people that we wrote the talk for

00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,410
this might match with the people that

00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:52,930
are in the room but we're thinking that

00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:56,740
the target audience here is people who

00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:58,750
can work on drupal.org and maybe you

00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:01,090
want to know like what would be you know

00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,950
like have a big impact if you work on an

00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,690
issue so we're going to suggest some

00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:07,810
issues that we think will have a big

00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:10,300
impact on it the other kind of people

00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,370
that we think might be here is people

00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,290
who are just curious about like what's

00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:18,340
going on with drupal.org on how is it

00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:20,050
getting better so what we're going to do

00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,440
is we're going to run down some of the

00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:27,430
top drupal.org issues that we think will

00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:29,400
remove some barriers to contribution

00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:32,470
especially for people who are new to

00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,270
contributing and we're also going to

00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:37,890
talk about some ways that true provide

00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,890
work has recently gotten better already

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,140
all right so let me give you a little

00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:46,120
content overview we're going to start

00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:48,000
with talking about what already works

00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,920
and what has recently gotten better

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,770
we're going to address a little bit the

00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:58,120
pain points that people have and finally

00:06:53,770 --> 00:07:01,330
we're going to focus on a few important

00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:04,120
issues that we think are important that

00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:08,290
we want people to start working on or

00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:11,140
focus on and pay more attention to so

00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:12,850
why are we here we want to increase

00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:16,570
communication about what is happening

00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:19,000
with org we want to get people involved

00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:21,310
with issues where the community can help

00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,520
and we also want to concentrate efforts

00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:28,870
of of people that work on drupal.org on

00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:32,640
issues that will have big effect on

00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:38,410
improving contributor experience or CX

00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:47,290
so who's behind drupal.org that mess of

00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:49,180
servers and cables we have josh josh

00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:53,020
says they're neater than the cables look

00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:56,139
in the picture great so we have the

00:07:53,020 --> 00:08:04,870
drupal association we have

00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:07,210
TBN drum basic and Opie Davies yay we

00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,949
also have volunteers people from the

00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:12,279
community and we're going to just name a

00:08:08,949 --> 00:08:17,879
few but there's a lot more ml has silly

00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:17,879
effin and Newton Coltrane and Danny girl

00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:23,919
we also have a Drupal software working

00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:27,310
group and also some of you are here TBN

00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:29,439
web chick drum David Hernandez and the

00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:31,719
SCT and if you're wondering what the

00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:34,419
drupal.org software working group does

00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:36,579
it helps define the overall technical

00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:38,500
strategy for drupal.org properties it

00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:42,190
also communicates the community needs to

00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,539
the VA staff so how do you keep up to

00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,570
date with what's happening with

00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:50,050
drupal.org there are two important pages

00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:51,880
that you can visit to find out what has

00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:56,579
changed there basically change records

00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:59,649
for drupal.org and infrastructure and

00:08:56,579 --> 00:09:01,930
there's also of course we all have

00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:04,570
issues so there's also that work issue

00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:09,010
queues if you want during what those are

00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:13,570
well there are 41 projects for drupal

00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:17,350
org which I encourage you to look

00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:21,760
through and find ok so let's talk about

00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:25,660
things that work we have the issue

00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,910
metadata which is on the issue note page

00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,529
with collapsible field set it was broken

00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,410
during the d7 upgrade but its back

00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:35,110
working again really nicely so as you

00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:37,570
can see up there there is our issue

00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:40,510
metadata and also issue summary and

00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:43,959
relationships files and cut it in

00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:45,850
committing we have related and parent

00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:48,880
fields which help us connect issues

00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,670
together to each other and also to meta

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,880
issues so we have a better organization

00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:59,610
so as you can see here in the screenshot

00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:03,070
you can find your issues by title and

00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:05,800
you can also add related issues and what

00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:08,260
happens is that they are shown on the

00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,510
sidebar with the parent issue of child

00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:13,170
issues and

00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:16,530
if you have related issues they will be

00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:22,680
shown as referenced by we have a

00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:26,030
responsive Abu Cheese theme gray so you

00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:30,360
can now view your issues on your phone

00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:34,050
or mobile or another mobile device which

00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:38,220
is great so let's talk about a little

00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:41,100
bit on the recent improvements profiles

00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:43,110
profiles are important because they give

00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:47,430
the kind of a face to all the computer

00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:50,550
contributors and since last drupalcon we

00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:52,590
all got our own custom URLs which is

00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:57,600
great we're no longer just numbers we

00:10:52,590 --> 00:11:01,160
have user names so let me show you what

00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,870
my profile looks like so you can see my

00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:05,760
organization organization's logo you can

00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:10,650
see the Drupal events I've been to there

00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,960
are some fields that i can add for my

00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:15,000
contributions and i can also select how

00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:20,190
i'm contributing how I'm involved in the

00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,920
community a cap creation it has improved

00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:25,230
as well here's a screenshot of the new

00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:27,570
user account creation it has been

00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:34,050
redesigned and the helpdesk the help

00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:35,970
text is more helpful once you create any

00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,730
user accounts you are automatically

00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:42,810
logged in so you can just start browsing

00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:45,780
the site right away the account is going

00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:47,460
to have a little bit of a limited

00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:53,070
functionality until you confirm your

00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:56,520
email address and I'll new users have a

00:11:53,070 --> 00:12:00,690
little blue bar that says new which is

00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:03,360
great because it kind of makes it useful

00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:05,130
for other contributors to note to be

00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:10,470
extra patient with the person or Alex

00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:13,080
extra helpful we also have in addition

00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:17,420
to being a new user we also have a

00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:21,020
community role for our longer time users

00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:23,250
which allows them to automatically to

00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:24,930
confirm new users so

00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,250
if you're working with someone and

00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:28,200
mentoring them and i just created a

00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:31,190
drupal.org account you can right away

00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:34,260
confirm them that they're not a spammer

00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:36,120
previously this was something that very

00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,620
few people could do and now it's

00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,630
something that a lot of people can do

00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:43,160
like thousands of people can do it but

00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:43,160
most of the people in the room can do it

00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:49,350
issue comment attribution something that

00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:52,560
Teresa spoke at about at the keynote

00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:56,150
which is great I tested it out just a

00:12:52,560 --> 00:13:00,120
couple of days ago so I can attribute

00:12:56,150 --> 00:13:02,670
comments to an organization the

00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:07,580
important thing to note the organization

00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:19,200
must have an organization page so um

00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:21,710
yeah i created my IM in addition to

00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,690
attribute in comments you can also

00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:26,520
project maintainer scan also list

00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:29,670
supporting organizations on their

00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,530
projects so you can select an

00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:34,260
organization and i bet they have to have

00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:36,420
an organization page and include how

00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:37,890
they helped and automatically this will

00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:42,230
appear on the product on the

00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:47,220
organization's page in the marketplace

00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:54,180
and next we have tagged autocomplete

00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:58,350
sorting which is a yes CT favorite so in

00:13:54,180 --> 00:14:01,470
this improvement we are tags both in the

00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:05,040
advanced search and in issue metadata

00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:09,210
are now sortable by usage so the high

00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:11,280
usage tags are at the top so this this

00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:18,060
makes it easier to use the right tags

00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:19,620
yeah all the typos float down to the

00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:25,080
bottom you won't pick the wrong ones

00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:27,540
anymore this and again this is both on

00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,120
the issue metadata and also the advanced

00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:32,390
search

00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,130
the issue meta data location so this is

00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:38,080
a pretty important piece of a page

00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:40,790
because it tells you the status the

00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,500
version the component the priority it

00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:45,080
gives you a lot of information about an

00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:49,760
issue now in a wider screen view this

00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:52,580
information is located to the side but

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,080
in the narrow screen view previously it

00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:56,960
was floated all the way down to the

00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,580
bottom well now it's all the way at the

00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:00,740
top which is great makes it easier to

00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:06,260
look up that information and hit that

00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:09,170
update this issue button and finally

00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:11,570
become to project governance so having

00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:15,230
undefined structures and processes can

00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:18,020
be confusing to new contributors and so

00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:21,080
we've made an effort to make explicit

00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:23,540
the things that that happen with the

00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:27,520
drupal.org issues and who to talk to

00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:33,680
about all the things so there's an issue

00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:36,020
number 2 4 5 7 8 75 which is I have a

00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,700
quote from it a document that builds on

00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:39,770
the ideas that have been blogged about

00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:43,820
or presented a Drupal events by many

00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:46,190
people and attempts to clearly document

00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:49,370
how things are done and also proposes

00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:51,500
some incremental improvements so what

00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:54,320
that document has is it answers

00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:56,930
questions such as what is core

00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,760
contributor what is a maintainer what

00:15:56,930 --> 00:16:01,070
are the different types of maintain errs

00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,720
how our decisions made who are the

00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,850
Drupal core maintained errs and what do

00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,560
they do and it also answers a lot of

00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:11,170
questions that were asked on the issue

00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:11,170
in one nice page

00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:18,730
okay so those are some things that

00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,350
worked some recent changes things that

00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:22,900
have gotten better and now we're going

00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,980
to provide a little motivation for the

00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,780
issues that we're going to talk about

00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:31,570
that we're recommending would have a

00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:34,150
fact on improving things so there's

00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:37,750
different types of people that try and

00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:39,250
contribute um one is Drupal users

00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:41,440
they're already using Drupal they're

00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,360
familiar with the site already and

00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,830
they're here about this contribution

00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,680
thing and they finally want to take that

00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:49,980
step they're like I want to do it and

00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:54,600
the sum of the pain for those people is

00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:58,390
if they find the getting involved guide

00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,610
that documentation about how to start

00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:03,850
contributing is confusing and not

00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:06,700
concise the other kind of way that

00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:08,500
people like think to themselves I want

00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,910
to help with something is different they

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:12,850
might be looking at a particular problem

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:17,260
Google to find an issue and on that

00:17:12,850 --> 00:17:18,550
issue there's no help for them they look

00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,970
at the issue and you don't know what to

00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:24,760
do next um and sometimes the issue

00:17:21,970 --> 00:17:29,560
summary is bag there's no background

00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:31,780
information on the issue and there may

00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,820
not be a clear explanation of what like

00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:35,170
the problem is it could just be like one

00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,430
line on the issue and when there's a

00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:37,840
patch elimination you're like okay I

00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,860
have the same problem but I've no idea

00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,450
how to help this issue go forward and

00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,190
these people who are Drupal users they

00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,900
don't know who to ask their questions

00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,390
too so they may have some questions

00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:52,720
about the issue or how to work on it and

00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:57,990
they don't know who they can talk to and

00:17:52,720 --> 00:18:00,400
there's no cross linked to other docking

00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:02,950
documentation maybe about the general

00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,230
problem so maybe this is a usability

00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:06,970
problem there's no leg cross linked to

00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,090
documentation about like hey these are

00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:12,010
the like current thoughts about how we

00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,660
should address these things and here's

00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,610
all the people that are also working on

00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:20,050
usability like it's all isolated and all

00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:22,540
by itself I right now in order to work

00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:26,050
on an issue you need to know the secret

00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:28,169
tags that are involved and you need to

00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:31,390
know how to search for those 10

00:18:28,169 --> 00:18:33,760
you need to know that there is another

00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:35,770
group about that topic so you need to

00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,330
know an Archon groups drupal.org there

00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,559
is a usability group where people talk

00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:41,140
about things you don't know that if

00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,280
you're only looking at the issue you

00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:44,260
need to know that there could be an

00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:46,390
initiative like a group of people

00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:48,460
working together on an issue and how to

00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:55,929
get involved with that but that's not

00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:59,350
obvious um and um yeah so that's some of

00:18:55,929 --> 00:19:00,789
their pain and there are other kinds of

00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:02,190
people though that want to contribute to

00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:04,720
Drupal there are people who are

00:19:02,190 --> 00:19:08,980
contributing already to other open

00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,840
source projects and and they are want to

00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:14,200
get involved with Drupal for whatever

00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:16,840
reasons um they want to see how it works

00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:19,659
and they start a new project with this

00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,730
new technology they want to branch out

00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:23,230
they came to an event with a friend and

00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:28,419
they want to like just see what's going

00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:32,169
on for those people they are their pain

00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:35,860
is that they end up having to learn an

00:19:32,169 --> 00:19:38,980
older technology while they're trying to

00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:40,780
do something new so they end up panic to

00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:43,360
learn how we work in issue queue with

00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:45,429
patches while they're trying to figure

00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,010
out how to contribute to this whole new

00:19:45,429 --> 00:19:50,770
technical thing that they not worked

00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:53,080
with before and that's frustrating they

00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:55,919
would rather use a gift style pull

00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,240
requests or they just rather use github

00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,610
they're also frustrated because they

00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,020
can't just edit in-place to fix like

00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:03,700
really simple things on the issue

00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,260
they're like I want to fix this really

00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:06,700
simple thing as there's a patch already

00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,929
i have a really simple improvement you

00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,460
know you're on your phone you just want

00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:10,659
to like help that you can't you have to

00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:14,169
like wait till you get to your computer

00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:18,010
so you can do it get clone and do the

00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:21,340
whole thing um the way that we work on

00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:25,210
issues in our Drupal issue cues we

00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:27,130
expose all of our faults we upload a lot

00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:30,730
of patches and they stay on the issue

00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:32,950
forever so if you um if you look at an

00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:35,860
issue that's existed a while you might

00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:38,020
see 20 solutions that were not good

00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,880
enough to get in and one solution that

00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:40,440
is good enough to get in and people from

00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,450
other

00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,240
source projects i think particular are

00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:47,180
terrified at this they don't want other

00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,460
people to see their intermediate work

00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:54,420
they're not in there in our Drupal

00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:57,330
community our best people upload broken

00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:59,490
patches all the time and then five

00:20:57,330 --> 00:21:01,020
minutes later they're like but oh man I

00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:02,520
can't believe I you know did that and

00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,140
then they upload a little fix to it and

00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,300
then you know two days later they're

00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,680
like that was a terrible idea i'm taking

00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:09,240
this in a whole new direction and so

00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,760
when we see our best people do that

00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:14,100
we've seen this over and over again we

00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:16,140
start to believe in this culture of

00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,580
bravery and that we learn from each

00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:21,710
other and things but other people from

00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,710
other projects they are scared of that

00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:32,610
okay so are some drupal people and ah so

00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:34,920
the other thing that they want to do is

00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:36,570
if a contributor from another it's

00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,280
already has experience with other open

00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:41,820
source projects comes to our issues and

00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,680
they see a solution where they see that

00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,390
there's a suggested solution like a

00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,150
patch on an issue what they want to do

00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:50,330
is they want to do a nice code review

00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:52,500
they want to help and give feedback on

00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:54,420
but they don't know how to do that

00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:57,060
entrepreneur they don't know about the

00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:59,460
secret redditor and if they do find

00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:02,580
redditor they're like oh I would rather

00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:06,020
have github style code review tools so

00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:08,730
there's a whole bunch of things um

00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:11,640
another group of people that have pain

00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:13,290
are mentors and these mentors are

00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,610
involved with new contributors and

00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,680
that's why they're in our talk is

00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:20,310
because helping them will also help new

00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:23,250
contributors mentors pain revolves a lot

00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:25,410
around keeping a list of issues that

00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:27,210
they want to return to to help people

00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:30,030
they have already started a mentoring

00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:33,000
relationship with typically mentors are

00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:34,890
very experienced contributors and they

00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,480
have long lists of issues that they're

00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:38,640
following they have long list of issues

00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,220
that they are working on they have

00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,110
issues like all kinds of issues but they

00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,330
want to keep us separate listed issues

00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:47,760
that they don't need to work on

00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:49,590
themselves but they want to come back to

00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,840
and that would really help because it

00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:54,210
would strengthen the relationship

00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,650
between people they wouldn't just mentor

00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:59,340
somebody one time that they could return

00:22:55,650 --> 00:23:02,760
and grow and like really expand that

00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:05,060
relationship so instead what mentors do

00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:08,340
right now is they use browser bookmarks

00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:14,760
they subscribe to all issues and use

00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:16,140
tags in gmail to tag things and they

00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,850
would really like to have lists of

00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,010
favorites or just different lists of

00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:25,530
different kinds of issues on drupal.org

00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:29,340
um part of the problem with gmail is the

00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:33,090
issue comments are difficult to read in

00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:36,600
the email format and and if you list all

00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:38,610
your issues with a gmail tag you you're

00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,460
essentially looking at subject lines in

00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:43,080
gmail where what you really want is you

00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,910
really want to see like the results that

00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:47,550
you get on advanced search on drupal.org

00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:52,260
which is fantastic and really super

00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:56,630
useful so they would like that some of

00:23:52,260 --> 00:24:00,240
the same things as new contributors um

00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:02,970
father mentors since they invest a lot

00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:07,410
of time in helping new contributors get

00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:09,600
around these quirks or they invest a lot

00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:12,450
of time explaining some like secret

00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:15,750
information that really bothers mentors

00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:17,580
not because they have like not because

00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:19,020
they are like oh man I really wish I

00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:20,270
knew about redditor but because they

00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:23,160
feel like they're wasting their time

00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:25,140
explaining these things to new

00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,700
contributors when they could be if that

00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:33,540
stuff all just worked they could

00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:35,520
actually be mentoring all right so the

00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:37,050
other group of people that some of these

00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,560
suggestions will help are just all

00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:45,420
contributors they'll all benefit from it

00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:47,580
and and some of these things are that

00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:50,820
everybody kind of experiences the pain

00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:52,830
of no matter what they are is um they

00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:55,350
don't see any recognition of work that

00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:58,620
they do so we had a lot of profile

00:24:55,350 --> 00:25:00,900
improvements but one things that you

00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,940
don't see is when you work on issues you

00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,510
don't see that show up on your profile

00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:09,020
and that makes people send

00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:12,560
and all contributors are affected by the

00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:15,290
fact that reviewers are not always

00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:18,020
credited for their work and reviews take

00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:24,920
a lot of work to do and a good review is

00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:26,480
worth so much and because anybody who

00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,280
wants to work on issues needs to do

00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,230
things like find the issue that they

00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:32,480
once worked on or find the issue that

00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:34,730
they want to work on searching for

00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:38,270
issues is really hard so if we can help

00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:40,130
that that will also help everybody okay

00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:43,390
so some candidate issues to solve some

00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:50,150
of these pain points and one of them is

00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:52,520
issue 233 2789 and it is reduced novice

00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:54,560
contribution differences and consolidate

00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:58,850
novice contribution landing pages

00:25:54,560 --> 00:26:01,220
content and blocks and so this is our

00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:02,600
novice contribution guide so if you come

00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:05,150
to dribble down organ you're like I want

00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:07,010
to contribute and you're like oh look a

00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:10,550
getting involved guide and then you

00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:13,250
start to read the guide it and it has a

00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:14,780
lot of landing pages and the independent

00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,730
to go to a page to a page to page to a

00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:20,090
page before you can find any like any

00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:23,090
action that you can take and there's

00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:24,860
also some sidebar blocks that are like

00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:26,630
getting involved sidebar blocks and

00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:28,010
those show up in multiple places and

00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:30,260
there's like two of them that are

00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:31,580
similar but they're different so like

00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:34,550
you can't find the thing that you're

00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:39,770
looking for and the content there is not

00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:42,350
very well curated some of its old and we

00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:43,970
also have like dashboard information

00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,770
which is like getting involved so we

00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,870
have like all these different ways like

00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:50,000
current content that we have and we just

00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:54,580
need to go through it consolidated make

00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,580
it simple simpler and more actionable

00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:02,570
until eight a second I'm sorry I used to

00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:06,200
work just I didn't mean that what I

00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:08,080
meant was this is a huge job and it's

00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:12,160
going to take a lot of thought to do it

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,160
what we really need to do it

00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:18,080
okay so you want to be you reach that

00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,700
get involved guide and you read it and

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,650
you're like yeah I want to get involved

00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:24,920
so you want to start working on issues

00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:27,350
now before we can work on issues we have

00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:29,060
to find one that is suitable and that

00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:31,970
applies to our interests and our

00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:33,890
expertise and also we want to find an

00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:35,990
issue that other people care about

00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:39,680
because that's the way to move it

00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:45,470
forward so here we have an issue the

00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:48,020
number is 1 290 740 and it is the title

00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:51,380
is how to label aggregates and expose

00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:54,620
issues docks forum posts and groups to

00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:57,500
topic pages this issue is important

00:27:54,620 --> 00:28:01,820
because it helps helps us find issues to

00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:03,800
work on by topic and it might indicate

00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:07,790
what is a priority right now for this

00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:10,070
topic and it could also be a mix of

00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:11,780
curated and automated content you're

00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:15,620
probably wondering what does that look

00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:19,100
like so here is a mock-up that is posted

00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:21,500
on this issue and what it shows is

00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:23,810
there's recent activity from issues and

00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:27,080
from groups on the right hand side and

00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:31,220
the sidebar there's a list of people and

00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:35,090
their expertise so that you know who to

00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:39,530
talk to there is also a curated summary

00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:41,930
field and a list of links we also have

00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:44,140
on the right top hand side topic

00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:47,330
metadata so really when you look at it

00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:51,800
does it remind you of this for me it

00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:54,140
reminds me of meet up but for issues all

00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:58,610
right so let's say we found an issue

00:28:54,140 --> 00:29:01,460
what next what we want to do is for a

00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:03,170
contributor that comes to an issue we

00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:05,990
want to show them all the relevant tasks

00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:08,420
for an issue that could be customizable

00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:11,120
per project we want to indicate what

00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:13,220
tasks still need to be done we want to

00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,530
expose instructions for tasks that need

00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:18,860
to be done well how are we doing this

00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:21,290
right now well you must know about

00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:23,559
dreddit ER you must know about this

00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:25,690
insert tasks template

00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:28,059
and then once you click that button you

00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:32,379
must determine which of this HTML that

00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:34,240
you have to read through is applicable

00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:36,759
to the issues they have to uncomment it

00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:40,120
or comments it now and on you you can

00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:42,940
delete it or comment it back we don't

00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:48,279
know that's not clear so we have an

00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:51,129
issue 2013 22 2 and the title of this

00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:54,269
issue is at issue tasks to project

00:29:51,129 --> 00:29:57,009
issues and correlate tasks with handle

00:29:54,269 --> 00:29:59,139
documentation so instead of a manual

00:29:57,009 --> 00:30:01,869
process it should be easy to expose

00:29:59,139 --> 00:30:04,059
tasks and automatically linked to hand

00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:05,590
web pages and this is something that

00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:07,299
will be helpful both for you

00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:09,610
contributors and also returning

00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:10,899
contributors occasional contributors and

00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:13,600
someone who just needs to have that

00:30:10,899 --> 00:30:16,840
information refreshed as they look on an

00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,999
issue it will also help people who land

00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:23,230
directly on an issue from a google

00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:26,259
search so from this issue we have a mock

00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:34,110
up here in which issue tasks are listed

00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:36,879
as a selectable multi-select heal and

00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:40,450
once you select which tasks are

00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:43,299
applicable it will show up in the issue

00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:46,809
metadata similar to the way that we show

00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:48,369
issue text right now there is another

00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:54,059
issue that has a slightly different

00:30:48,369 --> 00:30:59,679
approach to this to resolving this it is

00:30:54,059 --> 00:31:01,659
219 3871 and the title is create an

00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:05,379
action block for short messages for

00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:08,230
users and visitors this solution or this

00:31:05,379 --> 00:31:09,820
this the work in this issue focuses on

00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:12,669
the net on the next step in the process

00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:14,200
the general direction of how to address

00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:17,309
the pain point of not knowing how to

00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,309
move an issue forward

00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:26,870
finally we have issue 139 3226 which is

00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:31,340
to encourage the use of the issue

00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:33,650
summary template and this issue falls

00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:35,690
under the integrated redditor features

00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:39,470
into the oh so that we wouldn't have to

00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:41,510
go and find out about redditor and stuff

00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:44,690
and install the extension in order to

00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:47,230
use its features the explicit issue

00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:49,970
summary can make it very clear for

00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:52,880
contributors what to do next with what

00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:56,390
steps to take so what are the steps in

00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,580
this issue where it's moving forward the

00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:01,220
last suggestion made was to use vu

00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:04,850
editor for templating so if you're

00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:14,720
interested in this go ahead and follow

00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:18,160
this issue okay so you got involved you

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:21,110
found an issue maybe worked on it um

00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:23,180
reviewing is hugely important we can't

00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:27,080
fix anything without it and we should

00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:29,360
make it easier we can make it easier one

00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,550
of the things that we can do that will

00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,720
improve experience for everybody is we

00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:37,580
can automate our coding style feedback

00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:41,210
this exposes it to people because

00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:44,150
they'll submit a proposed solution to an

00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:46,640
issue that make a patch and then if the

00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:50,290
bots responded back with suggestions

00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:53,630
like coding style things that this patch

00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:56,150
added that we're bad and that comes back

00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:58,370
immediately so you don't have to go like

00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:00,320
oh I wonder if google has coding

00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:01,970
standards and then go try and find them

00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,950
in our Doc's page and then read through

00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:06,230
them all this would give you feedback

00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:08,740
like telling you like oh you violated

00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,740
these ones

00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,310
you

00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:20,180
well that's the ok so the comment was

00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,910
that if we have automated feedback that

00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:25,780
language should not be too harsh and the

00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:28,490
cool thing about making it automated is

00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:30,830
yes we should make sure of that but also

00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:33,110
it won't matter as much because people

00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:36,620
take automated feedback from a machine

00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:40,210
much less personally than they do like

00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:44,930
so some contributor might like post up a

00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:47,680
proposal on a on an issue and then like

00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:50,420
three days later a human looks at it and

00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:52,370
they give them like oh you violated

00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:57,830
these coding standards maybe they do it

00:33:52,370 --> 00:34:00,980
even nicely and they it makes them feel

00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:03,770
bad also they had to wait a long time to

00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:06,170
get that feedback the feedback that the

00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:08,899
reviewer gives them may or may not

00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:11,030
include links to the actual coding

00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:12,950
standards so they can't tell whether or

00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:15,169
not this is this person's opinion about

00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:17,870
how the code should look or whether or

00:34:15,169 --> 00:34:20,570
not it's actual policy and if it comes

00:34:17,870 --> 00:34:22,520
from a machine the machine can be like

00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:25,250
oh you you know this is not the standard

00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:27,110
here's a link to the standard right so

00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:30,379
it solves it can make it just more

00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:33,790
consistent faster and easier to take

00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:33,790
because it's coming from a machine

00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:56,260
Yeah right yeah so we have this um habit

00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:58,270
sometimes um and I think we all do it we

00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:01,870
do these things these drive-by dreaded

00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:04,570
or reviews where we open up the patch we

00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:06,700
look at the code and like we can't help

00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:08,680
but notice these things we're just like

00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,000
spacing is wrong and you're like you

00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,500
want to say something but you don't want

00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,370
to say anything it's like really super

00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:17,260
distracting from actually looking at the

00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:19,360
solution and trying to decide if the

00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:21,010
solution there is good or bad or how to

00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:23,170
improve it or what kind of useful

00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:25,150
questions a reviewer could ask about the

00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:26,560
solution so it's good it's a better

00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,540
experience for the person who's

00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,760
submitting a patch and it's a much

00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:32,680
better experience for a reviewer because

00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:34,570
by the time they actually look at the

00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,400
code the person who submitted the patch

00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:38,350
is probably submitted like six of them

00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,140
already and totally fixed their style

00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:42,400
stuff because they got such quick

00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:45,070
automated feedback with links to

00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,450
actually how to fix it so it'll make

00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:47,890
reviewing a much better experience for

00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:52,570
people who do reviews and they could

00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:55,300
focus on giving better reviews we even

00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:57,250
have a even that have an IRC factoid

00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,620
about like this kind of experience and

00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:03,610
it's called spinach so if you ask that

00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:05,440
IRC bot spinach it'll give you a little

00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:07,000
link about the fact that it's hard when

00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:12,100
you're doing a review to ignore those

00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:17,790
coding standards things um okay so

00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:20,170
another issue 2 480 515 this one is a

00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:22,420
style code blocks so that 80 characters

00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:25,660
did not awkwardly wrap in comments on

00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:28,060
drupal.org issues so on triple dot org

00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:30,640
we do our discussion about the code in

00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:32,650
the same place that we discuss like the

00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:36,490
general problem so they're on comments

00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:39,010
and what we do is we'll take a hunk of

00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:40,930
code from the patch and put it in code

00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:43,480
tags inside our comment and then we'll

00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:46,720
discuss it there and when we do this the

00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:48,940
width of the field that comments hold is

00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,340
not wide enough to hold 80 characters

00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,800
and fixed width font and it makes it

00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:55,750
really super hard to read and I don't

00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,970
think this is a difficult

00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:00,280
is she to solve I don't know so this

00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:01,660
might be like a accessible thing like it

00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:05,440
really if you've never helped which was

00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:07,810
on it before and it doesn't like require

00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:11,440
any like massive I don't think changes

00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:17,440
to things so this this was just it would

00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:19,660
just be nice to piss um okay another

00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:25,860
thing about code reviews is our code

00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:28,900
review tools so there's a very long

00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:32,460
interesting well documented discussion

00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:37,480
this is not an issue so this is node 3

00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:41,530
13 to 18 and its title is implement

00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:43,900
select oh that's a weird title it's

00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:45,580
implement a fabricator components Oh

00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,820
select fabricator components on

00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:53,770
drupal.org so some of it so um we had

00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:57,100
this history a long time ago we wanted

00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:58,930
to migrate juga org from Drupal 6 22 27

00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:01,480
and that took a while and during that

00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:03,280
time we were featured frozen we're like

00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,720
we're not improving people that work we

00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,300
just need to migrate and then once we

00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:10,090
migrate we can add new features and

00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:14,080
approve things and so we did so somebody

00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:15,790
migrated it and we've been improving

00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:18,250
things and the rate of improvement is

00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:20,500
getting faster and faster and so what we

00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:22,420
can do now is go back to our

00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:24,790
three-year-old discussions and ideas

00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:26,410
that we had three years ago we had so

00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:28,060
many really good ideas and now would you

00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:30,370
be like oh we can finally implement and

00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:34,230
there's so this really old conversation

00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:36,310
about should we move to github and and

00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:37,870
there's a lot of different reasons to do

00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:40,180
it but one of them is because people

00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:43,330
want a nice code review tool so an

00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:45,310
option instead of moving to github we

00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:48,430
could actually get a nice code review

00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:50,200
tool and there was some semblance of

00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:52,650
consensus that this might be a good way

00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,650
to go

00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:58,190
okay then we have the general problem of

00:38:55,670 --> 00:39:01,309
not knowing who to talk to who to ask

00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:02,869
questions when you want to figure out

00:39:01,309 --> 00:39:06,890
how to help or how to help on a

00:39:02,869 --> 00:39:12,259
particular issue so we can improve that

00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:14,059
I with issue 1 854 480 which is remove

00:39:12,259 --> 00:39:17,029
inactive maintain errs from meteors that

00:39:14,059 --> 00:39:21,349
text now this is really update maintain

00:39:17,029 --> 00:39:24,259
errs text title is kind of we sometimes

00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:26,150
will keep main people listed in maintain

00:39:24,259 --> 00:39:27,979
errs because we have a long release

00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:29,660
cycle rates in work for years so we

00:39:27,979 --> 00:39:31,640
might keep somebody in there who worked

00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,259
who was active two years ago as kind of

00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,719
like a recognition of all the hard work

00:39:33,259 --> 00:39:37,849
that they did but we also need to

00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:40,579
identify who we can talk to right now

00:39:37,849 --> 00:39:43,400
about this thing and so if we update

00:39:40,579 --> 00:39:45,559
this doc which is in the code base on

00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,900
that will help because you can say like

00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:49,359
oh I wonder who's you know who I can ask

00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:53,329
a question too about the general

00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:55,160
direction that accessibility is going in

00:39:53,329 --> 00:39:56,930
you can be like oh that you look it up

00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,789
in Maine taters text and there's a place

00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:00,440
and those lists of names that are there

00:39:58,789 --> 00:40:05,390
are accurate so this issue is about

00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:10,880
making that list more accurate there's

00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:12,499
also 2458 333 design discuss how to help

00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,289
people understand the formal structure

00:40:12,499 --> 00:40:18,259
of Drupal core so one of the things that

00:40:15,289 --> 00:40:19,759
we mentioned earlier that is an

00:40:18,259 --> 00:40:23,170
improvement that we've already done is

00:40:19,759 --> 00:40:27,049
we have got this handbook page on Drupal

00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:29,449
core maintenance maintain errs

00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:31,160
committers the different roles that we

00:40:29,449 --> 00:40:33,709
have how decisions were made so that

00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:36,559
handbook page is really good but it's

00:40:33,709 --> 00:40:38,479
still on a handbook page so what we can

00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:41,119
do is we can expose that information on

00:40:38,479 --> 00:40:43,940
issues so if you're on an issue that's

00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:46,910
tagged with accessibility maybe we could

00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,719
display there who are the people that

00:40:46,910 --> 00:40:49,249
you might talk to you about

00:40:47,719 --> 00:40:50,989
accessibility then you don't have to

00:40:49,249 --> 00:40:52,160
know about maintainer text and you don't

00:40:50,989 --> 00:40:55,130
have to know about this handbook page

00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:59,930
and we put that information where people

00:40:55,130 --> 00:41:02,059
need to see it um there's yeah so we can

00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:04,459
expose some of that information that we

00:41:02,059 --> 00:41:06,700
put in the handbook page and a more

00:41:04,459 --> 00:41:11,650
actionable place

00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:16,180
alright we also have two to three 2393

00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:19,460
add an option to the issue search form

00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:23,410
to return the list of commenters instead

00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:25,970
of issues so we have an advanced search

00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:29,000
for all of our projects that you can be

00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:35,030
like I want to see a 10-0 x issues in

00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:38,690
core that have the tag usability and you

00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:40,940
get a list of fish table with rose and

00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:44,030
each row is an issue and you can sort by

00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:45,559
like date so you like I want the oldest

00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:47,569
ones are the ones that have recent

00:41:45,559 --> 00:41:49,400
comments would be really great is if we

00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:53,089
can have a similar page where you want

00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,829
to suppress a 80 X issues in core that

00:41:53,089 --> 00:41:56,329
are tagged usability but instead of

00:41:54,829 --> 00:41:58,190
seeing the issues that results what you

00:41:56,329 --> 00:42:01,069
see our list of people who are active on

00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:02,299
those issues and you could sort maybe

00:42:01,069 --> 00:42:04,039
you could restrict your search by date

00:42:02,299 --> 00:42:06,680
so I would like to see people who have

00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:08,990
commented on issues that deal with

00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:11,420
usability in the last six months and

00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:14,390
then you could sort that list by the

00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:16,940
number of comments that they have this

00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:19,430
will expose this organic information um

00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:21,200
not necessarily like who's in maintainer

00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:22,849
is that text because mutator sentence is

00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,770
not always up to date and you don't

00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:26,599
always need to talk to a maintainer to

00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:28,220
know about the current direction of the

00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:30,170
project or to get your question answered

00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:32,150
but what would you would like is to know

00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:34,069
like who the heck is active in usability

00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:38,029
right now and if you don't read all the

00:42:34,069 --> 00:42:40,789
issues in core and you don't know these

00:42:38,029 --> 00:42:42,859
people you know it's really hard and

00:42:40,789 --> 00:42:45,410
that's why sometimes working on an issue

00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:47,180
is easier for the insiders because

00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:49,940
they're like oh you know my issue got

00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:51,470
tagged with needs usability review or

00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:54,589
accessibility review i'm going to go ask

00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:57,020
someone so to do it but if you don't

00:42:54,589 --> 00:42:58,369
already know those people then you're at

00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:00,230
a disadvantage if you're trying to solve

00:42:58,369 --> 00:43:01,970
that and we shouldn't have this like

00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:05,380
secret information we should be exposing

00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:11,180
these things and we can expose them um

00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:14,809
there's also the multilingual initiative

00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:17,690
does this a little bit they use the

00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:19,460
project rocket ship and they do screen

00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:21,680
scraping on

00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:23,510
drupal.org issues and they look for

00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:25,460
issues that are tagged multilingual and

00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:28,010
then they screen scrape to get the

00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:31,520
commenters user names and then they

00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:34,580
display all of the user names as a way

00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:38,630
both to thank all of those people and

00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:42,200
also people who have commented recently

00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:44,630
part of different font and people who

00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:46,010
have commented a lot are bigger font so

00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:47,810
you can look at that you can be like oh

00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:49,880
these people are their recent people who

00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:52,280
are doing a lot of work in this area and

00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:54,470
its really nice post is a thank you and

00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:56,030
a recognition and also as a resource for

00:43:54,470 --> 00:44:04,100
people who are you to know who to talk

00:43:56,030 --> 00:44:06,500
to and that type of information go

00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:09,890
really well on the topic pages that i

00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:12,350
mentioned people are okay so we got

00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:15,370
involved we worked on issues we got them

00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:17,720
reused now it's time to get some credit

00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:19,940
giving credit is crucial in

00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:22,070
collaborative open-source projects we

00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:24,470
give credit for patches and uploaded

00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:27,140
files but those are not the only types

00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:32,830
of contributions that are being made so

00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:35,510
in this issue 2 230 579 this title is

00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:37,730
policy no patch allow crediting

00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:40,880
reviewers and other non coders as

00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:42,980
first-class contributors we want to make

00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,040
it easier to credit reviewers in order

00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:49,370
to encourage more reviews and reviewers

00:44:46,040 --> 00:44:52,340
and to move issues forward so what would

00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:55,190
that look like well here's a mock-up

00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:58,700
from that's posted on the issue and in

00:44:55,190 --> 00:45:01,430
it you see a drop-down that in which you

00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:04,790
can identify the type of contribution

00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:06,830
that is being made so we can there are

00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:09,350
several proposals on what type of

00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:12,890
information should be in the drop-down

00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:16,160
you can identify it by comet type

00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:19,640
whether it's a proposal a patch a review

00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:21,140
or issue management and then there are

00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:23,830
different contribution types or

00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:26,450
different topic

00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:31,250
topic areas such as accessibility

00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:33,680
testing documentation in both cases we

00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:36,200
want to the goal is to highlight the

00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:51,350
variety and importance of contribution

00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:53,720
types on issues on yet oh alright so

00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:55,370
once you work on issues eventually what

00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,930
happens is you collect a bunch of issues

00:45:55,370 --> 00:45:58,550
that you've worked on or that you're in

00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:59,900
the middle of working on or that you

00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:02,690
think you might want to work on when

00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:06,890
they get to a certain state so we need a

00:46:02,690 --> 00:46:09,710
way to track our issues and there are a

00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:11,270
lot of them so I work on core so not

00:46:09,710 --> 00:46:13,580
only do I have a lot of issues that I

00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:20,870
work on but there are just so many that

00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:22,960
I don't and some of the things that that

00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:29,240
would be relevant our personal tags

00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:31,370
improving search adding a way to create

00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:43,070
a follow-up of an issue so that it knows

00:46:31,370 --> 00:46:47,180
that it's a follow up there is there's

00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:48,920
two issues that deal with possibilities

00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:50,690
for making lists of different issues

00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:54,020
right now you just you follow an issue

00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:56,830
or you don't it would be nice if you

00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:59,510
could also favorite certain issues um

00:46:56,830 --> 00:47:00,770
that would create two lists though you'd

00:46:59,510 --> 00:47:03,380
have them which you follow in the month

00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:05,720
of their favorites another option is to

00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:07,490
have a more generic way where you just

00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:10,520
you could just create lists and just

00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:14,690
have multiple of them and you maintain

00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:19,400
your own lists so there's two two seven

00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:21,740
one eight seven seven two two seven one

00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:24,410
eight seven seven which is allow per

00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:27,160
user tagging of issues that one's about

00:47:24,410 --> 00:47:30,260
like making your own list there's also

00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:33,680
one that like has I think a better

00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:37,280
possibility has more consensus and

00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:41,360
simpler this one is 1621

00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:43,370
14 allow bookmark and favoriting of

00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:47,090
issues without abusing the assigned

00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:49,040
field or issue tags and this is just the

00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:51,680
idea that you could have a favorite

00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:55,220
sleep at least you would have two lists

00:47:51,680 --> 00:48:00,340
then oh and the other one that I talked

00:47:55,220 --> 00:48:03,050
about 4227 1877 is more complicated

00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:04,730
would also be pretty cool there's some

00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:07,250
things though to discuss about the

00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:09,350
direction of this like are your lists

00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:11,570
public or not so like if you go to

00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:13,370
somebody's profile page or if you know

00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:17,420
the secret URL for the view that

00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:20,210
generates this thing can you see what

00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:22,880
lists people are keeping and then the

00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:27,830
issues that are on them so right now

00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:30,680
like it's we can see who's following

00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:32,390
which issues so I don't necessarily know

00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,010
that we have a privacy concern with

00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:35,810
releasing this information because we're

00:48:34,010 --> 00:48:38,030
already exposing it in the advanced

00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:39,740
search thing you can put yes et in the

00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:41,720
following field and you can see the

00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:43,490
issues that i'm following this would be

00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,200
elaborating that because you could see

00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:47,690
the issues not just that i'm following

00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:49,070
but how I'm categorizing the issues and

00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:50,750
which issues are in different categories

00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:54,520
so I think there's a lot of advantage

00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:56,690
here and at least not a privacy problem

00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,710
but it's definitely more complicated

00:48:56,690 --> 00:49:00,890
because you don't know how to present

00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:04,180
the information or how to update it this

00:49:00,890 --> 00:49:04,180
is this is complicated

00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:11,500
okay so we talked about all these

00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:14,680
different issues how do we work on

00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:17,350
drupal.org well there's a handbook page

00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:20,170
that explains how to do it basically you

00:49:17,350 --> 00:49:23,650
get a development environment with a

00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:26,410
copy a sanitized copy of drupal org now

00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:30,160
be really great is if the dude I know

00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:32,140
projects issue queues or on issues would

00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:35,020
have a link to that handbook page to

00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:39,960
make it even simpler to find or faster

00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:42,850
to find should also join IRC channels

00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:49,900
Drupal dash infrastructure and Drupal

00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:52,480
dash contribute and finally Google Khan

00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:55,450
has just started so we want to give a

00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:57,280
few session highlights that are coming

00:49:55,450 --> 00:50:00,360
up for sessions that you might be

00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:04,090
interested in related to drupal.org

00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:05,830
tomorrow we have at one o'clock the pain

00:50:04,090 --> 00:50:09,250
points of learning and contributing in

00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:12,520
the triple community with kegel and FGM

00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:16,920
at two-fifteen we actually have two

00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:16,920
sessions that we want you to go to I

00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:22,840
don't know how you're going to do that

00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:25,270
but the first one is issue workspaces a

00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:29,460
better way to collaborate in drupal.org

00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:31,840
issued views with TBN and exalogic and

00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:35,020
the second one is how do we encourage

00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:38,410
repeat contributors contributions to

00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:40,480
Drupal core with Hussain Abbas and David

00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:42,760
Hernandez right so the one about issue

00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:48,850
workspaces that's about making a git

00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:50,770
workflow for drupal.org and on Thursday

00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:54,190
there's the drupal.org infrastructure

00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:57,250
team meeting at 1pm and also there are

00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:59,740
ongoing conversations in the Drupal that

00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:02,040
in the mentoring group on groups that

00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:02,040
drupal.org

00:51:05,550 --> 00:51:11,770
so if you're inspired to work on some of

00:51:10,870 --> 00:51:14,580
these things some of them are

00:51:11,770 --> 00:51:17,470
complicated some of them are more simple

00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:20,140
but you might also want to just try your

00:51:17,470 --> 00:51:23,080
hand at making any change in drupal.org

00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:25,090
but that's kind of scary to do by

00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:27,550
yourself and not always obvious luckily

00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:29,620
we have sprints we and sprints during

00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:31,660
the week and on Friday and also on

00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:34,030
saturday and sunday but if you're new to

00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:37,120
contributing or to contribute to Drupal

00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:39,550
or friday is your day you can get an

00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:41,470
orientation early in the morning with a

00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:45,070
workshop to get you set up with tools

00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:47,010
and explain how is 2 q's work and there

00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:49,180
are mentors there and there will be

00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:51,310
groups printing on many different topics

00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:53,380
and one of the topics is improving

00:51:51,310 --> 00:51:57,550
drupal.org and tatiana will be leading

00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:59,830
that sprint and she has probably some

00:51:57,550 --> 00:52:02,290
issues in mind of things that are

00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:05,980
relevant to drupal org right now it

00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:08,170
probably doesn't align with my list but

00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:11,230
not I mean it's not one to one is what I

00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:13,470
mean but there's still things that are

00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:16,840
relevant to drupal org that she thinks

00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:19,600
have an actionable thing to do on them

00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:21,550
and there and you can work with other

00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:24,550
people who know about how to work on

00:52:21,550 --> 00:52:26,110
drupal.org and and work together it's

00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:29,380
going to be a much better experience

00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:31,600
doing that on like fixing one small

00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:34,150
thing on an issue that there is already

00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:35,710
some work on the tatiana thinks is worth

00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:37,330
working on right now like that's going

00:52:35,710 --> 00:52:40,180
to be a really good contribution

00:52:37,330 --> 00:52:41,680
experience for you like pulling up one

00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:43,150
of the issues that we've mentioned here

00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,830
and going home next week and being like

00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:45,790
I'm going to solve this that is not

00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:47,890
going to be a good contribution

00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:49,300
experience for you but like you might

00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:51,820
want to follow the issues that we

00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:54,760
mentioned read like the background on

00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:57,850
them keep up to date on them maybe try

00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:59,710
some other issues that are about fixing

00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:01,570
drupal.org and gain some experience with

00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:03,640
that and then maybe come back to some of

00:53:01,570 --> 00:53:05,440
these or you you don't even necessarily

00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:08,050
need to work on them you might just want

00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,820
to know that they exist and be like if I

00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:11,380
have a you know if I want to give some
