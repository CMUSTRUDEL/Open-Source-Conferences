Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: 4 Webmasters and the Drupal Shining Star
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	Falling oil prices, budget cuts and hiring freezes are challenges many institutions have to deal with today. The University of the West Indies [UWI] is no different. When the campus web teams of the UWI spanning over three main geographical locations in Jamaica, Barbados and Trinidad and Tobago along with our fourth virtual campus, Open Campus, servicing some 17 contributing countries, were presented with the strategic objective to assist in making the UWI globally competitive, we realized we had a challenge on our hands.

With already stretched resources and little or no budget we knew that choosing the right strategy along with the right tool would be the deciding factor in our success. How therefore could we consolidate four campus websites running varying technologies from classic ASP, dotNET and PHP and each with itâ€™s own content management solution into a solution that is efficient, required little training and development and at the same time cost effective.

One of the major obstacles to overcome would also be to find a solution that could handle multiple sites, using varying themes and each having a feature set of its own.

Other issues such as content sharing among campuses, integrated user authentication, custom theme development, content management workflows and end user retraining, made finding a solution to handle all of this seem like an impossible task.

There was however light at the end of the tunnel all thanks to Drupal. Follow us on our journey as well describe how Drupal has helped to solve our major problems and how we plan to use it in 2015/2016 to help achieve that strategic objective.

well c'mon greetings everyone thanks for

00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:07,109
attending our session this afternoon I

00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,389
know me there are many other pretty

00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:11,670
awesome sessions that you can choose so

00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:14,700
we really appreciate you taking the time

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,500
to come to our session so let's make

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,230
sure that you are attending your right

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,359
one this afternoon if if you're now

00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,900
getting into Drupal or doing our

00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,580
fact-finding mission to see if Drupal is

00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,650
you know the one for you then you know

00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,500
right place we're not going to get too

00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,420
technical this afternoon I know if

00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,190
you're here because one of my team

00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,340
members said that we're raffling a

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,260
round-trip ticket to Jamaica then you

00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,290
feel free to leave right now and I do

00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:47,640
apologize on their behalf so our chatter

00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:50,789
is is about the ongoing journey taken by

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,680
the four main campuses of the University

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,949
of the West Indies to migrate our web

00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,300
platforms to Drupal so to help me along

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,329
this journey I haven't stayed with me

00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:04,320
the webmasters from University Center

00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:08,670
der Velde Ali Mona campus Jamaica ruin

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:11,460
sure the open campus Richard bath and

00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:16,020
myself Darren Dory representing a center

00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:17,189
Carson campus from Turner and tobago so

00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,830
this map will give you a good idea of

00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:22,740
where we are and how we are distributed

00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:26,130
across the Caribbean as you can tell you

00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:29,970
can see the main campus countries should

00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:32,579
run Tobago barbarous and Jamaica and we

00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,650
were also distributed across 17

00:01:32,579 --> 00:01:37,049
countries in the Caribbean so we

00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:42,799
responsible for ensuring the online

00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:47,130
presence across this reach of campuses

00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,810
so our geographic stretch does provide

00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:52,649
some challenges in trying to represent

00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:56,250
ourselves as one university instead of

00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:59,009
four campuses serving 17 countries so

00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,229
while we're working towards CVS staff

00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:03,329
and student mobility movie for one

00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:06,110
campus today necks and also offering an

00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,640
extensive selection of online courses

00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:11,700
the web teams also face a challenge of

00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,670
presenting ourselves as one face the

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:17,760
rest of the

00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:19,950
so in the past each of the four main

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,070
campuses has implemented your CMS that

00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:25,020
fits their skills and needs their budget

00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:29,040
and you can see from the example being

00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,120
shown so now our strategic plan once

00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,140
they represent ourselves as one

00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,730
university so we must shift gears a bit

00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:40,770
to come up with a solution that will

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:45,210
take us from here to here so to start

00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:47,730
you on this this junior we embarked on

00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:49,830
and to discuss the challenges that we

00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,320
faced along the way I'm going to

00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,930
introduce mr. Richard barred from the

00:02:52,320 --> 00:03:04,650
open campus who will lead you on the

00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:06,450
discussion Thank You Darren so back

00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:11,100
there and said it's a tough job but

00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:12,900
someone's got to do it clearly so let us

00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,560
look at some of the challenges we faced

00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:21,600
as a university puratos embarking on our

00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:26,610
Drupal journey maintain a consistent

00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:28,320
brand identity as you have seen from the

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,200
previous slide we are an organization

00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,390
that is somewhat splintered throughout

00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,720
the Caribbean what we have to ensure

00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:38,880
that our strategic objective of the

00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,420
university which is to present a unified

00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:45,600
front is maintained this has been

00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:48,000
problematic over the years even though

00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,860
we have a single web template each

00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,440
campus are that different adaptation of

00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:58,440
that design based on web platforms that

00:03:52,440 --> 00:04:01,880
exist at each campus over time vero CSS

00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:04,890
Styles scripting languages are employed

00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:08,510
resulting in inconsistent navigation and

00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,510
a poor user experience

00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:16,630
if anyone is here from an i ahead

00:04:14,299 --> 00:04:19,400
institution probably you know about

00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:23,240
enterprise system called banner which is

00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:25,850
a student management system now I'll

00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,340
give an example of a problem that we

00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:31,280
have in sharing resources so my

00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:33,910
colleague from Dimona campus would would

00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,199
have developed an application to

00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,479
interact with the burner software which

00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:42,889
would pull information then repopulate

00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:44,750
on the website no sadly due to the two

00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:47,120
due to the fact that we were different

00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,490
web platforms were unable to share this

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:54,320
module and result in experience that

00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:59,870
would have been garnered keeping up with

00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:04,660
the Joneses Jonesy's sir yeah I made

00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:08,240
this area this morning right so

00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:11,300
collectively we have to address the

00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,820
needs of over 600 websites and this

00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:15,229
number is growing rapidly keeping up

00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:18,650
with the request proved to be very

00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:20,449
challenging particularly with keeping in

00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:23,800
line with one of the university's

00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:28,750
strategic objectives of going green

00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:32,120
essentially going up sorry going online

00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:34,250
lastly the explosion of social media

00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,440
across the university we have had

00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:38,720
requests for integration into many

00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,710
websites with no easy one-click

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,750
integration or installation of any

00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:48,320
automated integrated integration modules

00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:51,970
on existing web platforms this proved to

00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,970
be very difficult and time-consuming

00:05:52,539 --> 00:06:00,650
security access and authentication

00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,599
working with our homegrown systems and

00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,510
trying to integrate with proprietary

00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:08,470
software that each campus runs you'll

00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:13,870
find we will always be doing patches and

00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:17,210
trying to defend against attacks right

00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:21,500
we're also a challenge it with two

00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:22,620
factor authentication when you have 200

00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:27,300
VPN users

00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:30,360
and you're using a USB key token for two

00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:33,060
factor authentication this proved to be

00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,030
very costly and of course you know in

00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:42,570
these economic times that's a challenge

00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:45,090
and of course ozan flaws no there's so

00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:49,590
much unknown more limited staff of the

00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:52,020
webmasters can do to stop attacks due to

00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:54,300
all the flaws but when you have a wide

00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:58,400
community of users sharing and helping

00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,400
to identify these flaws it's much easier

00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:09,930
money money money so it costs a lot to

00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:14,010
manage these proprietary systems we

00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:17,370
think about the cost to install them we

00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:20,280
think about annual licensing fee upgrade

00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:24,510
license and multiple support contracts

00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:27,389
and with budget cuts being done each

00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:32,070
year we have to find solution to these

00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:34,710
problems and so I'll introduce one to

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:41,720
speak on how Drupal became or rising

00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:45,000
star thank you Richard so in our

00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:50,190
2006-2007 we started researching a CMS

00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:53,360
solution and we were getting a lot of

00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:56,849
pressure in terms of delivering designs

00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,250
updating content we had calls from the

00:07:56,849 --> 00:08:02,389
Registrar the marketing department the

00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:04,740
principal wanted to get things done just

00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:07,530
faster and we needed to be more

00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,990
efficient and while we try to explain

00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:11,280
some of the technicalities I mean they

00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,220
are non-technical users it does didn't

00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:17,400
care just wanted more quick up faster

00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:20,430
and better quality so we enjoy make away

00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:22,349
know a few racetrack beers you know by

00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:25,590
the beach a few sunsets we discussed it

00:08:22,349 --> 00:08:28,620
we looked at the different solutions you

00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:32,329
can put a short lists it encompass duple

00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:36,110
joomla and wordpress we look at the

00:08:32,329 --> 00:08:36,110
costs ease of use

00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:44,250
frequency of updates the popularity like

00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:46,910
I mean we tried to use it the amount of

00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:49,980
modules and themes that were available

00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:52,800
best suited for what type of solution

00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:56,040
which is a small or large scale also if

00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:57,240
it were only our web development to our

00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,040
framework could it do more than just

00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,620
building websites could it really do

00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,110
apps stuff like that I mean current

00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:06,470
skill set in house and all easy to train

00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,150
our current staff to get them

00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:10,860
comfortable with the technology to be

00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:12,150
used to use it efficiently so that can

00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,310
deliver the products are the services

00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:18,210
that we need to deliver so all this was

00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:21,060
taken into consideration and the cost of

00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:25,200
course was one a big factor and I mean

00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:28,590
we had two were using a system we had to

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,530
install desktop clients for them to do

00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:32,970
their coding in and then update and stop

00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,790
and then you had to train these persons

00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:39,450
so it just really was working out those

00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:41,220
a lot to manage so I wonder some that

00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:43,680
was a lot more seamless a lot easier

00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:48,780
would reduce the cost so we looked at

00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,760
these in depth so we looked at you came

00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:53,040
on well jus / came out on top needless

00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,260
to say I mean it had all the benefits of

00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,420
all wanted but could remove the yearly

00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:59,370
our monthly fee for the licensing for

00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,320
the product on the desktop side as well

00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,000
as some was somewhat somewhat on the

00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,560
server side we were looking at a

00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,270
solution we would insert and a server

00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,800
then the clans will connect and push and

00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:11,370
sync up the content are the changes from

00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,870
the different Department users so we do

00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,850
part it was browser-based so I mean

00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,400
right there we cut all of those client

00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:20,160
licenses immediately and we had over 600

00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:23,610
websites across all the campuses so it

00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,040
was a big cut I mean it was significant

00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:27,660
it was really huge and we just had to

00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,300
made a decision it took a lot for

00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,190
retraining to get there but we decided

00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,960
this what we had to do if we want to go

00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,430
forward I wanted to be efficient the

00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:38,580
pressures from senior management was

00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:40,200
just a little bit too much to bear so

00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,810
wanted something that was flexible and

00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,720
dynamic that could respond in our

00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:47,880
environment more or less all departments

00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,550
we deliver the same kind of product

00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,900
you know but probably in terms of that

00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,640
courses which is a little bit different

00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,920
so chemistry da for chemistry courses

00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,870
physics lab for physics courses biotech

00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,550
what the process to do it is pretty much

00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,620
the same the process to get information

00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,940
on the website is the same it does have

00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,010
a different look and feel a different

00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:08,280
name more or less for the most part so

00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:11,150
what we did was okay okay how this could

00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:14,040
work easily I mean we can use the

00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:16,320
content type and blog get a custom

00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,210
content type and reuse it across the

00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,610
different sites so that would have cost

00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:22,860
significantly we have the similar code

00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:25,080
base deliver a different look and feel

00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,880
so would theme it differently everybody

00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,950
wants their thing to look different they

00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,390
don't really care about what's on the

00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:31,920
line the functionality is going to be

00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:34,410
the same but it needs to look different

00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:36,600
physics need to look like physics need

00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:39,720
to see whether its electrons jumping

00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,400
from this to that side detect magnetic

00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:43,050
field and software that chemistry want

00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,210
to have that feel of the molecules and

00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:47,550
so farrah so a different look could be

00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:48,840
the same chassis under the bottom it

00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:51,240
doesn't matter but differently that's

00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,730
what was key in their mind so this work

00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,160
for us perfectly bill it once we use

00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,300
reuse it reuse it this was perfect I

00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,940
mean we didn't have a challenge with

00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:02,130
that so it worked what they have to

00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,930
reinvent the wheel with us replicators

00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,460
okay we have it here once probably a few

00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:07,140
tweaks here and there only spin up a new

00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,210
site for a different department but for

00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,490
the most part it was very very flexible

00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:13,590
the custom teams modules installation

00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:16,440
profiles allowed us to spin up a side

00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:18,210
very very quickly we could pretty much

00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,530
as number of fingers spin up something

00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:21,600
for our new department if I got a new

00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:23,730
requests one of the things that we did

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,710
we tried to send off a client worksheet

00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:27,390
for the department's to fill out when

00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:29,010
they request a new website so could kind

00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,540
of get an idea of what it is that they

00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,340
want and this client works it with ax

00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,490
and boots on some intricacies of what

00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:37,140
they want when they want it what kind of

00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:38,970
look and feel looking for so Jeff some

00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,500
site so that they might like we'll take

00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:41,970
a look at those sites okay we can

00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,200
probably pull these elements from the

00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,360
side put it together when you're

00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,340
rebuilding it the graphic artists are

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,590
designer with the 18 consideration and

00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:51,240
give them a designer like the theme of

00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:53,580
calming and implemented on top of you

00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:57,120
while after spin up beside and that

00:12:53,580 --> 00:13:00,390
would work for us so extensive money

00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,440
library that was awesome web forms

00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,480
pulled shopping

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:06,420
the backup and migrate the back of my

00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,800
Margaret help help significantly and we

00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,750
did some training with all about in

00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,960
rhode island that was probably like well

00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:16,020
from five years ago and I saw Jeff

00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,460
Robbins yesterday I was surprised I mean

00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,950
he remembers me from the training I

00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,750
wasn't giving him too much trouble but

00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:25,050
it was really good and it helped us a

00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:27,270
lot we met the guy from the Josh and he

00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:29,580
showed us what could use to back it up

00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:31,650
and and you know so could move from

00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:33,060
development production and back from

00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:33,960
production because sometimes besides get

00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,910
all the things you have to tear

00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:37,470
production back into development do

00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,910
what're we doing with it rework it and

00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,590
in care back over the production and

00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:43,850
this helped us significantly see those

00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:46,770
at the time before that the process was

00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:48,570
tedious that was some thought it was

00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:51,120
really tedious so that helped us a lot

00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:52,830
that visit to road and got some training

00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:55,490
was a week of training from the lava was

00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:58,110
really cool and this is what the tighty

00:13:55,490 --> 00:14:01,620
work are typically looks like overworked

00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:03,600
underpaid short staff repetitive tasks

00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,120
and Walter tasks that he just can't get

00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,470
away from his answering the phone my

00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,930
boss is always on me to answer the phone

00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:12,000
I tell him to come back my this that's a

00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:13,410
lot easier if i take the cars i can't

00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,230
get any work done and we all know this

00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,490
so it goes without saying so it was

00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,050
answering for most of the time we get

00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,000
the work done is at it after all was

00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:22,980
like pretty much after the work they are

00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,690
becoming very very early but short of

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,160
course I they get cause about all kind

00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,500
of things and when to go to meetings to

00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,620
talk about stones and whatever else

00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:34,830
tough they want to talk about so

00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,510
flexible workflow now this is what we

00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,160
have you create a Content review the

00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,530
content the content published straight

00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,530
out the box drupal worked seamlessly it

00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:45,890
was a perfect fit in all set up we have

00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:48,960
occurred department publishers they

00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:50,490
create the content for the most part the

00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:52,650
head of department would review the

00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,520
content and in all at all universe at

00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:55,320
the head of department is responsible

00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:57,570
for whatever content goes out for that

00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:00,000
department so he or she takes

00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:01,800
responsibility for that content if

00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,560
something is wrong he's responsible

00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:08,339
she's responsible he or she can also

00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:11,070
have a designate for publishing so they

00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:12,120
review and publish if not then the other

00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:14,010
department is responding

00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,900
doing that it was pretty easy as I say

00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,310
it's a perfect fit it worked we didn't

00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:20,940
have to do much on the workflow side to

00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:23,700
get this working content types and views

00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:26,220
no I spoke about content type earlier so

00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:27,870
we'll go back to the same scenario yeah

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,500
but course of course as a name here

00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:33,029
certain amount of credits a lecturer

00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:35,820
location which faculty balance or which

00:15:33,029 --> 00:15:37,650
program belongs so so we use this this

00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:39,450
helped us significantly we could reuse

00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:41,130
it and then what were able to do were

00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,930
able to put views on top of that so

00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,490
we're creating our program database you

00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,680
could put views on top of that and pull

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:49,050
the probe the courses by department or

00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,670
by faculty are my lecturer so that was

00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:52,770
pretty easy we didn't have to rewrite

00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:54,300
and queries are in stuff that I it was

00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:56,010
pretty easy now didn't have to do any

00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,570
code and reading to get that done put in

00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:01,200
the content use your views on top and

00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:02,700
that worked so that was a significant

00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:07,190
tell a possible more efficient to

00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:10,320
deliver a lot faster for scalability

00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:12,480
we're talking about moving over other

00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:16,440
sites to Drupal as i said earlier after

00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:20,220
600 department sites we decided to use

00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,450
the multi-site solution back then I mean

00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,680
that was pretty much more days probably

00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,540
only solution are wanted better

00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,029
solutions that will avail at that point

00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:28,740
in time no you probably have another so

00:16:27,029 --> 00:16:31,200
she could really look at but that works

00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,880
for us pretty well we could assess

00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,140
peanut besides pretty easy we can manage

00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,730
them different than the same code base

00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:38,370
so in doing installs and stuff later

00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,110
that is easy to manage so we did some

00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:42,510
exploration spend some time on this

00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:45,180
figure out how to get it to work it went

00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:47,130
well a few tweaks here and there and you

00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:50,100
could scale too much too much and what

00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:52,170
do they need recently employed varnishes

00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,730
or reverse proxy it has somewhat a

00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:56,910
caching ability so that gives us

00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:58,920
performance and we needed that I'm don't

00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:01,230
want the site to be loading too slow so

00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,150
and also some cash in with in Drupal

00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:06,240
itself so that helped us to really scale

00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:08,900
and everything grow easily without much

00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,900
challenges

00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:14,959
end users they were a problem when we

00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:16,819
were before went to jewel pod we had to

00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,589
train them not many of them like writing

00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:19,880
HTML code that was not in your job

00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:22,130
description the configure why that

00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,959
should come to the training if your

00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:25,910
tragedy somebody HTML that is not

00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,400
interested in any kind of holding and

00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:31,059
only come to City the training because

00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,700
the boss a Moscow it doesn't work and

00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:36,200
that would I was like I didn't with this

00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,000
it's browser based they have to learn

00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,770
anything much extra it was pretty much

00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,179
cotton piece and click here click the

00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,700
check box click this click this button

00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:48,020
bump you get a page with all the course

00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:50,299
information easy no coding so this work

00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,549
for us will end user yeah I mean almost

00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:53,840
no specialized training pretty much does

00:17:52,549 --> 00:17:55,340
know how to use a browser are not to

00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:58,600
send an email and that'll be good for

00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:01,520
you and so it was just made for end user

00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:03,140
now this all orders to do some real I

00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,059
teamwork I mean we could sit by the

00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,650
beach have a few beers this cause really

00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:10,429
matters that really impacted the

00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:14,380
University and have some fun get real IT

00:18:10,429 --> 00:18:16,309
we're done I don't hand over to with

00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:19,150
therefore that it will take you to the

00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:19,150
rest representation

00:18:24,009 --> 00:18:31,669
thanks Marsh run no we're still on how

00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:36,200
Drupal assisted us in achieving the one

00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:39,919
you a concept so Brandon indesign 00

00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:43,909
marketing on legal teams they are big on

00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:47,179
Brandon and maintaining a consistent

00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:50,330
brand identity no drupal theming on

00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:53,960
templating system allowed us to maintain

00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:56,600
us systematic and consistent brand

00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:59,330
across all ourselves over 600 sites

00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:04,220
while at the same time not compromising

00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:06,619
on uniqueness and usability those

00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:09,529
achieving what the legal and marketing

00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:14,450
team wanted maintaining a unique brand

00:19:09,529 --> 00:19:18,409
identity now another aspect of brand

00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:23,629
identity is or domain name space which

00:19:18,409 --> 00:19:26,840
is U dot edu no currently you a dot edu

00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:31,100
is prefixed by the respective campuses

00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:35,950
so the campus in Jamaica is identified

00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:40,159
by mona you a dot edu the campus in

00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:43,460
Trinidad is identified by sta da you a

00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:47,409
dot edu so a challenge that was faced

00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:50,749
was maintaining a consistent web address

00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:52,820
with the you a brand while pulling

00:19:50,749 --> 00:19:54,649
content from multiple servers so as you

00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,980
can see in the diagram we are pulling

00:19:54,649 --> 00:20:01,489
content from for example two servers my

00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:03,980
spot and web upstream no that is what

00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:06,440
the user would normally see in their

00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:09,580
address bar and as you can agree that

00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:14,359
does not that doesn't do much for

00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:18,409
Brandon so how did we go on that we use

00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:22,450
varnish alongside Drupal to present a

00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:27,080
uniformed naming convention to the user

00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:28,700
so regardless of whatever server they is

00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:33,710
serving up the content to the end user

00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:35,420
all the user would see is Mona you a dot

00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:39,230
edu slash content

00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:45,290
or in center in st. Augustine skills sta

00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:49,010
you in that edu / content now security

00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:51,530
and authentication the standard method

00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:56,360
of authentication on the campuses is

00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:58,430
authentication via ldap and we realize

00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:02,240
that Drupal was able to integrate

00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:05,810
seamlessly with this so for the web team

00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:08,360
rather than creating new users new

00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:11,570
accounts we just allowed users to

00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:14,270
authenticate via ldap and the beauty

00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:16,330
about that is that if a member of staff

00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:18,710
no longer works with the university

00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:20,480
immediately their account becomes this

00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:24,160
year but so we don't have to worry about

00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:28,430
revoking privileges and permissions and

00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:31,190
if an added layer of security was needed

00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:34,790
for a particular application we could

00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:36,820
use two-factor authentication and so far

00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:40,580
we are using google authenticate and

00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:45,620
that again integrates seamlessly with

00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:48,890
our current setup no at the university

00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:51,260
we are very concerned about security and

00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:54,010
one of the things that we were looking

00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:57,500
at when we are evaluating CMS's we

00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:59,900
wanted a system that would provide

00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:03,830
timely updates on security patches and

00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:06,440
again Drupal stood out and early out we

00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:09,470
found that patching and all security

00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:12,440
issues were handled by drupal dedicated

00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:15,650
security team and so far they have just

00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,780
been awesome and I recommend that if any

00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:19,970
site administrator is here who hasn't

00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:24,160
yet signed up for the security

00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:24,160
newsletter that you should do so

00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:31,250
enterprise integration know as a

00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:34,820
university we had certain enterprise

00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:37,670
systems already in house and we never

00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:40,370
wanted to duplicate the content so we

00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:43,640
wanted a system that we could that was

00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:47,180
pluggable that we could use to integrate

00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,730
with these enterprise systems so for

00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:51,820
example we need a

00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:55,100
information for our students on

00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:57,860
programming course information so we

00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:01,130
created a module that would integrate

00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:03,409
with banner to show the program and

00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:07,309
course information to our end users

00:23:03,409 --> 00:23:10,429
which were our students and our online

00:23:07,309 --> 00:23:14,260
staff directory was information directly

00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:18,520
from PeopleSoft our helpdesk we also

00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:21,260
created custom emails using web forms to

00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:24,710
with using web forms and embedded code

00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:27,740
to automatically create help their stick

00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:32,870
its and this interface with manage

00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:35,149
engine help desk software extensive

00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,649
support know as Jesus said in the

00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:39,260
keynote earlier this morning the

00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:42,529
strength of Drupal lies within the

00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:44,270
community the users us and our

00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:48,260
experience so far has just been

00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:52,340
wonderful support is readily available

00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:55,039
if needed both peed support and free

00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:58,640
community support and as the university

00:23:55,039 --> 00:24:02,570
we have utilized both forms and it has

00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:06,980
just been awesome and again I recommend

00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:10,340
to those users here but many times we

00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:13,100
feel as if we cannot answer something on

00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:15,590
the on drupal.org but a little goes are

00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:18,950
far away and each person you know we add

00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:21,679
something to the community so I'll know

00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:28,929
turn back over to Darren who will wrap

00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:32,659
up thanks repeal so where are we know

00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:35,120
now our road map looks like this at a

00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:37,970
time of initiated into this project we

00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:39,950
decided to go with Drupal 7 that's

00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:41,690
really because of compatibility is used

00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:44,570
on the experience that we had on campus

00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:46,669
so obviously upgrades will be expected

00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:49,370
as you move towards Drupal 8 I don't

00:24:46,669 --> 00:24:50,929
happen in a similar fashion now Mona

00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,940
campus was chosen to be the lead campus

00:24:50,929 --> 00:24:53,870
as the very most advanced in a group

00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:56,809
with

00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:59,150
well so did they develop what we call a

00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:02,050
starter pack and I was handed down to

00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:04,490
the other campuses and provided trading

00:25:02,050 --> 00:25:06,920
as to how to go about installing a

00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:09,440
starter pack so now all the other

00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:11,750
campuses we're at various stages of

00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,910
customized and install fields as you can

00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:16,340
see there and we were all hoping to

00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:18,770
learn pretty soon but I didn't stop us

00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:21,380
from being here today to be presenting a

00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:23,990
drupalcon now it's all plan at the end

00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:26,750
of this process to develop a

00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:28,760
distribution park specifically for

00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:30,559
universities that way we can give back

00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,000
to the community and some of the other

00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,040
modules that we have developed as well

00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,240
we want to have those available so

00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:40,550
modular could speak directly to the

00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:43,600
banner or to be able store and so on so

00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:46,490
that's it folks as we say in turn add

00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:49,429
party done thanks and you've been a

00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:52,100
wonderful audience we have the website

00:25:49,429 --> 00:25:54,590
address of our campuses there and please

00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:56,270
do take your time to evaluate our

00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:58,700
session let us know what we could do

00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:00,559
better if ever we come back to present

00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,780
to you again so I guess the floor is

00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:05,480
open if anyone has any questions at all

00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,490
as pertains to what we had to say if you

00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,100
do so you can come up to the mic so that

00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:13,690
the sessions the questions could be

00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,690
recorded thanks again

00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:34,919
no questions so in case we were

00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:38,350
wondering that picture depicts our

00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:40,330
carnival in toronto bagel and it's once

00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:49,649
a year it's in February next year so

00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:52,360
feel free to come down are there any

00:26:49,649 --> 00:27:05,309
folks from to sri institutions in the

00:26:52,360 --> 00:27:20,980
audience no education sector okay well

00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:23,710
excellent i wish i had a price sorry in

00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:27,450
terms of publishing the content yeah

00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:27,450
sure Ron you want to take that question

00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:39,020
yes for the most part it is the same we

00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:41,480
have each department to add the

00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:43,040
identifier a department publisher that

00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,290
person just wants to put in a comment

00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:47,390
and making minor updates one of the

00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:49,880
things that we don't allow them to do is

00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:53,180
the theme in although we probably have

00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:55,370
one department that can unload them some

00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:57,710
flexibility in theme in and sing that

00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:59,810
simply because marketing have certain

00:27:57,710 --> 00:28:01,130
guidelines are branding and hold on i

00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:03,290
think the looks or an element from

00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:05,450
certain location so we don't allow them

00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:07,250
to do the theme in themselves but in

00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:09,020
terms of the workflow yeah it's the

00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:11,990
Creator created content the head of

00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:13,340
department reviews it and then says it

00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,230
should be cam it's approved for

00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:27,170
publishing are they themselves publish

00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:32,990
it but for the most part yes I didn't

00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:35,300
get how many theme the team's don't hear

00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:38,750
that much what we do would break up into

00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:40,460
web administrative theme academic and

00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:42,290
then we have a different theme for the

00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:43,610
top-level pages which would be the first

00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:46,610
feature heat win get there and probably

00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:47,900
two or three clicks down so the faculty

00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:49,640
would have a specific team to the

00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:53,570
academic department administrative

00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,340
Department this some schools at school

00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:56,870
of business kind of they're gonna get

00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:58,460
their own theme so i would say probably

00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:01,160
we're gonna end up with probably six or

00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:03,500
seven right now but we cannot group them

00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,240
and categorize them so different

00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:10,670
categories have different teams and

00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:12,140
different things up by okay and then

00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:16,940
what anyone else and you any more

00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:20,870
questions oh I wanted to also add that

00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:24,500
each department is able to customize

00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:26,840
their theme in your themes for example

there will be different color codes and

00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:33,520
menu placements so we allow some
