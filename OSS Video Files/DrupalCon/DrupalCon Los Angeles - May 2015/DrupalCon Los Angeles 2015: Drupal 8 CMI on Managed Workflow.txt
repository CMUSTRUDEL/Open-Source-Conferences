Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Drupal 8 CMI on Managed Workflow
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	The Drupal 8 Configuration Management Initiative (CMI) is a straight up game changer for Drupal development and deployment. As much as we all love doing it live, no longer will this kind of human powered configuration replay in production be necessary. Instead, developers will be able to natively export their configuration to code and deploy that configuration to production using the CMI tools.

This session will feature both a basic overview for how CMI will work in Drupal 8 and an advanced overview of how to use CMI with version control as part of a managed development - testing - production workflow. Forget the pain that was drush fe and drush fu-all. Come join Matt Cheney from Pantheon in embracing modern configuration management in all its glory.

a little-known fact about that song when

00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:07,560
Miley Cyrus is seeing like we can't stop

00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,300
we won't stop like she's not talking

00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,280
about the LA party scene she's actually

00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:17,580
talking about the Drupal 8 development

00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:20,850
cycle that you soon or come on hello

00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:24,470
everyone my name is Matt Cheney I work

00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:27,330
at the pantheon and this session is on

00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:29,699
Drupal 8 cm I in a marriage work flow so

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:32,160
hopefully you all at a good lunch we can

00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:34,079
get in and we can get to this you know

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,480
most amazing and wonderful of

00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,570
presentations today because i am a chaos

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,300
wizard i particularly love drupal i've

00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,640
been doing it for about 10 years and i'm

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:47,370
very excited actually to talk to you

00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,680
about drupal 8 cm I configuration

00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,230
management putting your configuration in

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,050
code and really leveling up your

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,610
development practice see a critically

00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,710
management is in fact my favorite

00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:01,379
feature in Drupal 8 I think it probably

00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:04,170
should be one of yours and I think it's

00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:07,680
like fundamentally going to change how

00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:10,110
we all build sites in the future that

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,409
it's something that i think in 2015 and

00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:15,750
beyond that's a necessary feature for

00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,460
any modern content management system or

00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,310
even software development project and

00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,320
hopefully today sort of as an overview

00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,610
I'll really give you a sort of

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,119
understanding of what configuration

00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,850
management is why sort of it got decided

00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,439
the way it was decided how it works and

00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,659
then we're going two hundred percent

00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,630
live demo the bait of 10 we're going to

00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:40,200
do it with groover to trash don't clap

00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:42,450
yet wait till it works because a lot of

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,360
people actually see Cece and rock this

00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:47,790
so anyway let's start the story so in

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,040
the beginning of the Drupal you know

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,530
bang sort of in a dorm room in Belgian

00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:55,680
we have this like you know explosion of

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,509
websites these all the sites that we

00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,759
sort of all make here in our small way

00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:01,710
are part of this sort of explosion of

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,530
Drupal of Drupal stuff you know our

00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,060
websites are either made of Stardust or

00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,569
of nuclear waste depending on how you

00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,319
think about it and that you know since

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:13,410
that time we've had this very powerful

00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,410
aspect

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:19,530
drupal specifically we have the ability

00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:22,080
in the website to like make little

00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,450
configuration changes and have it work

00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,180
differently and that's something that

00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,350
actually is very unique to Drupal or one

00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,450
silly as unique content management

00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,780
systems and gives it a lot of the power

00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:36,870
that it has because when we talk about

00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:39,480
websites and when we talk about building

00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:43,050
websites we have these two different

00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:46,980
pillars really of stuff on the website

00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:50,130
on one hand we have the configuration of

00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:52,530
the site these are the like content

00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:55,290
types to define the you know fields on

00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,420
the blog post these are the image styles

00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:59,730
of how you know the dimensions or the

00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,740
modifications would work these are the

00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,480
views of our listings of contents with

00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,130
their various filters these are the

00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,810
variables and the settings and all of

00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,030
the different things that go into it and

00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:10,740
these are things that as developers in

00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,320
the room we are responsible for

00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:16,110
developing on our sites we write some

00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:18,180
code we do some configuration and we

00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:22,320
really define that site and that is that

00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:23,970
is configuration in Drupal we also on

00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,959
the other hand the other pillar here is

00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,180
we have the content of the website

00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:29,880
really what we need to have on that

00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,830
website these are the actual blog posts

00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:34,200
the nodes that are created the user

00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:37,260
accounts that are set up the comments

00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:39,300
the menu items the taxonomy terms we add

00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:43,290
these are the you know the information

00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:45,420
about it and these two things exist

00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:47,430
together in Drupal which we can talk

00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,800
about some of that but this is what we

00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,780
need to do to make a website what

00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,280
becomes really important and this is

00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,110
sort of the crux of like figuration

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,150
magic is important is that the

00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,590
configuration that you're doing is

00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,390
something that you're doing as a

00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:02,850
developer you're doing it on your local

00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:05,880
machine or on your development instance

00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:07,410
and the content the stuff that the users

00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:10,020
are doing you're doing on the production

00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:12,330
site on the live web site and these

00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,730
things become very different when we

00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:17,790
start to talk about it in the context of

00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:19,530
a managed workflow which is also part of

00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,150
the advertised benefits of this talk is

00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,850
we'll talk about sort of using

00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:26,760
configuration management to sort of run

00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:28,770
a really modern web development practice

00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,110
because if you're not already you should

00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:33,000
all be doing some version of this for

00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,860
your projects you should have a

00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,020
development instance where you're

00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:38,970
writing and writing the code getting the

00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,190
configuration right and having that

00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:43,260
experience you have a testing instance

00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,030
that you can actually push all that

00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,550
information or that configuration and

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,470
code to to test it then you have a live

00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:51,240
instance where the new contents being

00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:53,970
created and a change is ultimately end

00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,140
up but what you'll notice especially if

00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,240
you have a site you've been working on

00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:00,210
for a while is that you also have this

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,640
other loop where as more blog posts and

00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:04,980
like taxonomy terms and stuff for added

00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,960
to your production site you need to pull

00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:09,980
back that information into your

00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:12,690
development environment refresh your um

00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:14,370
you'll refresh your sandbox so you're

00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:17,130
working from the latest and greatest and

00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:20,190
the problem here for those that are

00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:22,440
probably familiar is that for code this

00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,080
works just fine I can like push some CSS

00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:26,880
changes and do it in dev push it to test

00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,430
push it live and I have a pretty good

00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:33,210
expectation of what it will do the

00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:34,290
problem is configuration which is the

00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,030
stuff that we're going to sort of

00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:38,730
ultimately be carrying most about this

00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:41,700
hour is stuff that is actually sometimes

00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:44,880
very difficult to actually repeatably

00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:46,950
deploy to test and alive I won't ask for

00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,560
a show of hands in the room but you know

00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:51,510
I as a developer there are you know

00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,180
probably had the experience of having

00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,680
like a legal pad of like configuration

00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:57,690
things you need to do when you go live

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,670
so you push the code and then you like

00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:02,280
change some fields or modify some stuff

00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:05,130
or turn some things on or off and that

00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,430
process is brittle that process is prone

00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:10,260
to human error requires time and it also

00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:11,790
doesn't take advantage of any of the

00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:14,220
modern sort of continuous integration

00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:16,080
testing patterns a lot of which are

00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,180
talked about this conference you can't

00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,070
run unit tests you can't run you know

00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,410
visual CSS regressions you can't really

00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:25,230
even even truly test your end result

00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:27,470
because you don't have you have to do a

00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:29,790
human step to do your deployments and

00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,470
that's basically the problem

00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:33,180
configuration management is trying to

00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,620
solve is let's figure out that

00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,750
configuration that you're doing for your

00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,630
site and let's put that in code and

00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,590
what's that let that be deployed

00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:43,110
there are of course ways to do this

00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:45,389
right now in Drupal 7 when you know

00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,610
Drupal section before those will talk

00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:49,380
about as well but like the configuration

00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,360
management in Drupal 8 I think is sort

00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:53,790
of top notch and that's sort of sort of

00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,139
what we're doing because and this sort

00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:57,330
of is the crux of the problem with

00:06:55,139 --> 00:07:00,120
Drupal is that Drupal doesn't really

00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:03,120
care about that configuration content

00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,070
distinction on a data level these are

00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,500
some of the tables that Drupal site if

00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,120
you install it will give you you can see

00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,790
some of the tables are for field data

00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,950
summer for variables and figurations and

00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:16,139
that you know the idea of being able to

00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:18,240
sort of make some configurations on in

00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:20,220
the database and push some tables or

00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,169
even part of the database to a new site

00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:25,050
is very very difficult and that's

00:07:22,169 --> 00:07:27,540
something that um that all of the

00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:30,000
websites that we work on are going to

00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,860
have this problem that this um you know

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,110
the ability to sort of cleanly export

00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,360
that configuration is not has not in

00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,100
Drupal than possible till Drupal 8 that

00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,440
even the sort of most advanced sites

00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:42,990
with you know using features and like

00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,760
extensive work flows like they still you

00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:47,970
know as Charles Darwin said like mirror

00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:50,520
you know have the unintelligible stamp

00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,690
of their lowly existence and they don't

00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,000
have that kind of really cool

00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,470
configuration management so this is now

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,500
where we're sort of talking about we're

00:07:55,470 --> 00:08:00,000
talking about doing this kind of stuff

00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:02,520
because the world we live in without

00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,320
configuration management the world that

00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,889
probably most of us on a day-to-day

00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,870
process work in makes the idea of taking

00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:12,020
some of the configuration that's here

00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:15,930
putting it into code pretty difficult

00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:17,760
there are ways to do it and I don't want

00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,680
to under sort of cut those ways that

00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,710
those processes have gotten us a long

00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,020
way there's sort of in Drupal there's a

00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:27,389
hook update end system that a lot of you

00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,550
might be familiar with this is basically

00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:31,830
a function that you can put a series of

00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:34,349
functions actually in your install file

00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,450
for a module and every time you sort of

00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:39,390
you know push a new changes that module

00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,550
it'll actually run a set of a set of

00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,800
like PHP logic from the Drupal bootstrap

00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:46,050
that can do stuff it's an example from

00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,240
the monopoly images module it does a

00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:50,070
large variable set for some information

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,110
about some cropping cropping

00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:53,430
requirements and

00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:55,529
this is something when you're talking

00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:58,019
about sort of how do you Rhys emulation

00:08:55,529 --> 00:08:59,850
figuration instead of just having a

00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:01,890
legal pad with a bunch of settings are

00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:04,560
sort of things you have to do you could

00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:07,350
simulate this in PHP and some people do

00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,300
you can set variables obviously but you

00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,640
can also like do fake form submissions

00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,620
or do data import for stuff but this is

00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,180
a brittle process it requires every

00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,550
single time you want to do this to write

00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:20,160
some custom PHP code you have to like

00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:22,110
simulate certain user actions and this

00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,910
is that sort of you know bespoke kind of

00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,200
you know artisan thing you gather like

00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:29,640
write it yourself you don't have any

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:32,730
cool export tools so improving on this

00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,380
is sort of the features module which I

00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,019
think we all know and you know mostly

00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,300
love I'm a big fan of features I think

00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:42,390
it was a game changer for Drupal when it

00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:44,550
came out yeah it's more or less a shirt

00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,410
in this world of feature driven

00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:48,230
development where people have the

00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:50,640
ability to actually you know right

00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:53,310
modules that have feature files that

00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:56,519
have the configuration export and it's

00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,690
been around since 2009 it's been it's

00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,209
one of the most popular Drupal modules

00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:02,610
and it's honestly a requirement for any

00:10:00,209 --> 00:10:05,010
large or honestly even sort of seriously

00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:07,079
small site and it's gotten us a long way

00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:10,829
in the community and I think that's

00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:13,019
that's really awesome but there are some

00:10:10,829 --> 00:10:14,820
problems with it that i think are sort

00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:17,310
of really where configuration management

00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,290
sort of picks up and sort of solves and

00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:21,810
i'd say like the first issue with sort

00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:24,630
of features module is that it it wasn't

00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:27,089
built to be a place to store

00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,490
configuration in code like that wasn't

00:10:27,089 --> 00:10:31,410
it wasn't its purpose to sort of do what

00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:34,290
it is now for those that remember

00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:37,740
features modules developed to allow for

00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:39,899
a distribution of drupal called open

00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,640
atrium which is pretty fantastic to have

00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:43,500
actually packaged sort of content

00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,269
together features module can make an

00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,100
image gallery with a bunch of stuff or

00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,959
it can make go you know a blog system or

00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:51,449
something it wasn't designed to export

00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,560
all your configuration for your site it

00:10:51,449 --> 00:10:55,199
was just designed it's really sort of

00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:57,269
the packages now will do configuration

00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:59,250
and people have used it but it has a lot

00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:03,529
of limitations in terms of what's

00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:03,529
possible specifically it's a

00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,800
sort of enforcement of any sort of

00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:10,810
practice so if you've looked at the

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,580
features code it has a lot of sort of

00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,530
handling of like to do a view we use

00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,910
this system or to do you know this thing

00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:20,790
we do this system and you have to work

00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:20,790
around um work around each individual

00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,620
contributor little crazy people are

00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:28,570
feeling of catalyser module that's like

00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,670
as a ton of really interesting features

00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:32,260
integration but you know you have to

00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:35,350
sort of do it sort of each one little

00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:37,360
bit spoke you also have in Drupal core

00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:39,580
itself a bunch of like limitations

00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,470
around for example like there isn't

00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,740
unique identifiers for a lot of the

00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:46,180
objects configuration objects in Drupal

00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,890
so you'll have you know incrementing

00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,180
values but that becomes really difficult

00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:51,130
you know if you want to sort of

00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:53,800
associate you know this kind of thing

00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:56,260
with that kind of thing and you know

00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,510
features took us pretty far but it sort

00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,950
of has you know it had to sort of deal

00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,840
with a lot of sort of original sin of

00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:04,750
Drupal in terms of you know these

00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:06,940
limitations but one of the things that

00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:10,110
you know commander Worf here can attest

00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:13,180
to is that you know like you in Klingon

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:14,890
society if you have sort of you who

00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:17,290
dishonored or you do something sort of

00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:20,140
you know a little off-color who uses a

00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:22,089
council High Council talking about house

00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,790
of Duras and father's actions at

00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:26,950
Khitomer and such but the the issue is

00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:28,360
that um with Klingons you can have if

00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:31,390
you have this honor you have the

00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,980
dishonor for seven generations but one

00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,750
of the great things with Drupal 8 is

00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:37,860
that we're now at a point we're like

00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:41,410
some of this like old kind of history

00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:49,089
can be can be redone and this brings us

00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:51,010
to Greg Dunlap so basically in 2011 when

00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:54,070
the Drupal 8 cycle was sort of kicking

00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:55,720
up on Greg Dunlap and some other folks

00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:58,480
we'll talk about sort of got together

00:12:55,720 --> 00:13:00,280
and says look like these doing

00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,350
configuration with features and it's

00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,600
sort of like hodgepodge way is not the

00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,580
sort of like you know big picture way we

00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,400
want to do this that there's a better

00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:12,130
system that we can set up and develop to

00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:15,760
store our configuration and code and so

00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:18,490
he sort of got anointed by dreese as the

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,570
first Drupal 8 initiative lead to

00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,610
develop what

00:13:19,570 --> 00:13:24,580
knows the content configuration

00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,200
management initiative and there's a lot

00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,880
of little ass or a discussion that went

00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,590
on to this most of this with public you

00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,570
can read it on groups vegetable org and

00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:34,150
some other issues but the basic

00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:36,310
philosophy was let's create a system

00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:38,920
that will export all of the

00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:41,290
configuration the Drupal has into code

00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,240
and let sit for sit on a core Drupal

00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:45,820
core level so that all the config

00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,770
modules configure all the controls all

00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:50,710
the the custom code people right all

00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:52,390
have to use this feature and this will

00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:54,120
allow us to have a system where we can

00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:56,830
export all the configuration to code and

00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,140
I think that's really cool and he really

00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:00,490
kicked off a large sort of initiative

00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:03,790
that ended up including a lot of other

00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:05,500
people so data Strauss one of my good

00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:07,390
friends he also was really involved

00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:10,330
terms the technical architecture so this

00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:12,160
his slide I I took from him and the

00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,560
basic idea is sort of Greg and and David

00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,960
came up with is we're going to try to

00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,750
put configuration into code but let's

00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,340
not like reinvent the wheel on this like

00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,310
there are a lot of solutions of how

00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:26,710
people do configuration to actually keep

00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:29,680
it you know in a version of bowland and

00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:31,570
sort of testable way and so this is also

00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,490
in the world before symphony sort of

00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:35,740
became the de facto sort of Drupal

00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:37,960
Drupal direction so they were sort of

00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,330
looking around it on XML as an initial

00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:42,700
choice the idea being we could take all

00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:45,730
the configuration could put it in XML

00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:48,400
files and we can use sort of you know

00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:50,050
common parsing libraries but drupal's

00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,970
had a problem in the past for example

00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:53,680
it's dot info files where it comes up

00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:57,730
with a sort of custom format of its own

00:14:53,680 --> 00:15:00,100
does some fancy reg axes but for um for

00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:02,650
cmi it's like no we want to use a sort

00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,060
of standard what was also really

00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,100
inspiring sort of in terms of this

00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:09,250
choice is if folks are filled with a

00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:11,080
Jenkins system it's helps with some

00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,970
config asst integration stuff but

00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,760
Jenkins is really cool because Jenkins

00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:18,460
has the ability to do configuration in

00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:21,820
Jenkins in the UI and it actually will

00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:23,380
write that configuration to disk in what

00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,380
becomes a declarative way and this is

00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:28,600
very important that you can have a web

00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,370
UI to actually do configuration but as

00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,010
soon as you hit save you've made an

00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,750
assumption that says this is

00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:35,700
the configuration we will have and

00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:38,520
that's something that I think is a shift

00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:40,250
to from features if you're sort of how

00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:42,930
features does configuration management

00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,730
that Drupal 8 it's you know there's not

00:15:42,930 --> 00:15:46,290
like default values for things like you

00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:48,330
have the configuration is the

00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:50,610
configuration is the configuration and

00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:52,260
so you when you export it out you get

00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:54,150
that value it's declarative it's going

00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:55,740
to be that value and you sort of have to

00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,180
go for it and so that's sort of what

00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:59,910
Jenkins does that worked really well in

00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:01,340
Jenkins one symphony sort of became the

00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:04,980
sort of marching orders for the project

00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:07,440
it was switched from XML to Gamal Gamal

00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,750
zooskool format will be looking at it as

00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,370
well but there's a there's a cool parser

00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:15,840
for it in symphony student to write any

00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:18,210
of that stuff and the idea was okay

00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,860
we're going to use the Amal format we're

00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:22,950
going to put configuration into it and

00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:24,180
then it will be yambol time so I know

00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:29,670
these are camels I just thought it was

00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:31,110
funny and the way that the yambol stuff

00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:33,240
works and the way the configuration

00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:35,400
management works is really simple this

00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,710
is a settings form in Drupal it's the

00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,630
site information form we have some

00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:41,520
values we have the name of the site the

00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:45,470
slogan the email address the front page

00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:47,100
they are pages all values hit save

00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,270
traditionally this would go into the

00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,670
database with a bunch of different

00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:54,330
serialized values or individual values

00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:57,120
instead goes into llamo file this is the

00:16:54,330 --> 00:17:00,690
Amal file system dot sight that yamo you

00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:04,680
can see name male slogan error pages

00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:07,380
this cuff these fields save into these

00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:10,050
files and that is how the configuration

00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:12,000
Drupal 8 is stored those sort of

00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:13,740
starting a little basic but I think this

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,089
is important because every value in

00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,770
Drupal that you're going to have some

00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:18,780
configuration ability to deal with is

00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:21,270
going to be represented in this kind of

00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,310
format yeah milles the cool format to

00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:25,620
read doesn't have a lot of extra croft

00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:27,810
pretty straightforward looks great in a

00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:29,040
diff two will show that and the idea is

00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,770
that you know you from have this

00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:33,600
representation and there's of course a

00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:36,720
lot of representations you know for that

00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,060
these are blog types and blog fields so

00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,760
you can see on the Left we've got a blog

00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:45,150
content type on the on the right we have

00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,929
a blog body field and these are all if

00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,190
you sort of scan that

00:17:45,929 --> 00:17:49,139
and these are all sort of you know

00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:50,610
description taxed help tax these are

00:17:49,139 --> 00:17:54,600
things that you're going to probably

00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:56,820
configure as well and we have tons of

00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,580
them drupal Drupal 8 ships with all

00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,409
these different yeah are all these

00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,460
different configurations you export them

00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:04,950
out you get something that looks like

00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:06,990
this these are sort of logical chunks of

00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:10,470
configuration and you sort of have them

00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:12,779
all on the scene so that's sort of the

00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:14,999
idea configuration in the Amal not too

00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:16,649
crazy declarative it configuration to

00:18:14,999 --> 00:18:19,860
what's in the Amal file is what the

00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:21,840
value is there's a lot of magic here how

00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:25,440
do we work with it let's talk about that

00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,350
for four ways I'll show to actually use

00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,690
this system to actually set values so

00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:33,179
first option we're just going to take a

00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:36,210
single configuration change basic title

00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:37,860
change and get that and remember we're

00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:39,269
always working in a managed workflow

00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,490
setting so we have a dev environment in

00:18:39,269 --> 00:18:45,389
the live environment here so we're on

00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:47,009
dev we have a module in configuration

00:18:45,389 --> 00:18:49,019
management I'll show this in the demo as

00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:51,570
well but it's called configuration

00:18:49,019 --> 00:18:53,279
manager you can go to admin config

00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:55,710
development configuration and get it and

00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:58,289
you have an option here yeah single

00:18:55,710 --> 00:19:01,110
export at Fingal single I'd an export

00:18:58,289 --> 00:19:03,690
export simple configuration and let's go

00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:05,940
just get that same arm same yeah Mel

00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,549
file and right here in the UI you hit

00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:09,899
export it'll give you you know the title

00:19:08,549 --> 00:19:12,419
of your site with all this information

00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:14,429
so if you've changed your title and then

00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:16,889
you go export you get that you mo file

00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:18,389
that we have and that's on your dev site

00:19:16,889 --> 00:19:20,909
so you can have it all look look on your

00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:23,519
dev site pretty fun you have that tile

00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:25,529
you can copy down your computer copy and

00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,169
paste it and then if you go to the live

00:19:25,529 --> 00:19:30,360
site and you want to actually do it you

00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:32,789
go again to that single single import

00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,049
option go to import you type the system

00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:37,529
site yeah Mel file paste the

00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:39,779
configuration to hit import you ask you

00:19:37,529 --> 00:19:42,299
to confirm it and then you actually have

00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:45,240
that value saved in the system so pretty

00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:48,299
simple export out on the dev site copy

00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,100
it into the live site hit save confirm

00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:52,649
you now have that value change and then

00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,960
the system title would be changed and

00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:56,490
this is helpful because you have

00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,289
structured data that you're working with

00:19:56,490 --> 00:20:00,120
there's not a lot of room for error

00:19:58,289 --> 00:20:01,740
there's a lot of testability of this

00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,480
we'll get more advanced in terms of how

00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,010
to use this but the idea is you don't

00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,270
have to like remember to change the

00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,920
title of this stuff you just have these

00:20:06,270 --> 00:20:11,430
files and you do it pretty

00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:14,520
straightforward that's for a single file

00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:17,220
so so option two today we want to take

00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,540
all all the configuration this I think

00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:21,110
might be one of the more popular ways

00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:23,250
that we do configuration management

00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:24,780
ideas that I've done a dev site I've

00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,100
done a lot of work I've changed a bunch

00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,780
of settings I've done a bunch of

00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,150
different configuration now I'm ready to

00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:33,000
actually export it out so I go back in

00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:36,900
the configuration manager module I hit

00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:38,880
export and it gives me a tarball this

00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:41,490
has all my configuration in it that has

00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,410
all those files we showed earlier and I

00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:47,700
can take that tar ball go to my live

00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:49,290
site hit choose file and upload it'll

00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,000
like go through and actually now give me

00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:52,860
more information about what's changed oh

00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,020
look we've got a blog content type we

00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:57,570
have a blog body field we've maybe

00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,890
change the site name and next to each of

00:20:57,570 --> 00:21:01,110
the different operations you see this

00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:03,390
view differences button that will

00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:05,040
actually show us sort of a distinction

00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,110
so oh look the title has been changed

00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,700
from this to that and you can start to

00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:11,340
see sort of that configuration that you

00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,980
were doing in the UI actually sort of be

00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:16,020
reflected as a change and if you went in

00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,060
and hit that import button you'll upload

00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,400
all the sites all the stuff be able

00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,960
import it takes a hot second and then

00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,480
you actually import it and you've taken

00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:26,490
the full configuration on dev and pushes

00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,770
it to life and that's pretty cool

00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:31,260
because now you have like this ability

00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:33,480
to have your live site have exactly the

00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,980
same configuration as your dev site you

00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,590
didn't have to like go through like a

00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,630
checkbox list of things to do you just

00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:43,860
had to go export and import I thought

00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:45,150
that's pretty cool way three so of

00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,580
course you can use drush for all of

00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:49,650
these operations the UI stuff i think is

00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,240
easy as just to orient but as we go

00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:52,700
deeper down you know something that you

00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:58,260
can do a lot of some on the command line

00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:59,760
so odd content management has a bunch of

00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,460
different rush commands we'll talk about

00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:05,700
a few of them config get pretty obvious

00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:08,520
one basically we can specify that system

00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,200
site save want the name value and rush

00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,450
will actually kick us out that a

00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,210
specific values it'll say okay the value

00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,470
of sight is this

00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:16,450
and that's sort of how you would

00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:18,659
interact it's sort of on ad rush level

00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:21,850
get the data so you can take that string

00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:23,830
go on your live site usually dress i

00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:26,590
alive and say let me gooo configset

00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:28,690
another another value and actually set

00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:30,850
those values and you have this ability

00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:33,850
using josh take a single value get it

00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:35,620
from one set it to the other is enough

00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:37,480
last sort of thing before we get into

00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,669
some crazy stuff you can also use

00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:41,529
direction to do the whole thing i could

00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:43,330
take drush and run to the option called

00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:45,970
config export that's going to do that

00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,980
whole dump but instead of like giving me

00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:49,990
a tarball that i have to manage it's

00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:52,270
actually going to go and dump that on to

00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,130
the file system one of the things that

00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:56,289
you do when you set up sort of Drupal is

00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:58,000
you can define what directory you want

00:22:56,289 --> 00:23:00,730
for the configuration management like

00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,500
file the Ambo files to live by default

00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:04,360
it's set up in the files directory

00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:07,000
because that's writable in Drupal and

00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:08,950
you can do it they're not you know it's

00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,320
sort of its default behavior but you

00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:13,090
could also define other places so in

00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,919
this case i've defined sites default

00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:16,210
config is where the config lives that's

00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:19,149
just a value in the settings dot PHP

00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:21,220
when I hit address export it experts all

00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:24,070
that stuff in the site's default config

00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:26,049
what becomes cool is because that's in

00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:28,360
my like version control route when I

00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:30,370
actually do a commit I could actually do

00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,740
a full git commit and take all of that

00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:34,690
configuration and push it into you know

00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:38,140
specific commit hash there's one right

00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:41,230
there I can then deploy that code to

00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:43,029
live and then run a config import

00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,289
command to actually pull it all in

00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:46,600
you'll see I'll get some information

00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:48,940
there about what's going on and that

00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,620
this is the workflow this last one that

00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,970
I think is really you know from a

00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:53,919
programmatic level sort of what you

00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:56,799
would end up doing on a really regular

00:23:53,919 --> 00:24:00,010
basis so let's talk where's the magic

00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:02,409
it's in the workflow dev exports yeah

00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:04,899
mul yam will exist goes into import

00:24:02,409 --> 00:24:08,830
import goes to live site and we all you

00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:12,789
know party time okay all right now we're

00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:14,919
gonna do the demo I'm done loading out

00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:18,429
the latest version of Drupal 8 beta 10

00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:20,470
which is actually pretty nice and I'm

00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:24,520
going to show a few different things so

00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:26,230
first thing I've done that's get first

00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,780
thing I'd as I saw I've done except I've

00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:30,980
set up

00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:34,550
a site on the Pantheon which is which

00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:36,890
has dev test in life and we'll get that

00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:43,460
little bigger so I'm going to see ok

00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:44,750
cool and the only thing I've done is

00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,060
I've taken that latest version of Drupal

00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:51,850
and I've got ahead and installed it so

00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:55,670
we have a dev dev instance test instance

00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:58,250
live instance and I've also gone ahead

00:24:55,670 --> 00:25:01,010
and ran that drush config export command

00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:03,920
once just so we actually have all those

00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:06,200
yamo files so I can actually go in and

00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,480
you know that's uh you know you'll see

00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:10,430
this is basically all the Amal files for

00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,110
the entire configuration of the site and

00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:13,160
I you know only did the install so just

00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:16,130
as like the site name and some other

00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:18,590
stuff off the default and I've logged

00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:21,170
into each one this kind of thing so

00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:23,210
first thing I can just show you just

00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:25,370
from a sort of browse around standpoint

00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:27,440
is the actual configuration management

00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:29,530
the stuff i was showing all lives in

00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,610
this module configuration management and

00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:35,300
if you go to it you'll see the kind of

00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:38,150
stuff we saw before single export full

00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,980
export and then synchronize and the

00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:42,320
single export sort of i think the slides

00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:46,100
do pretty well you can just you know go

00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:48,350
to a simple kind of thing Oh pick a kind

00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:51,950
of pic the kind of thing you want from

00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:55,190
export and you can get you know any kind

00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:57,260
of values that you want depending on

00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:58,190
what Oh what the settings is and so

00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:59,930
that'll be helpful for a little

00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:02,270
individual thing but what we're really

00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:04,550
caring about here is that is that full

00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:06,440
full export so if I want to go ahead and

00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:08,960
get that tar ball looks like this I

00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:11,150
grabbed it and it'll generate it and

00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:13,040
then let me save it okay but let's do

00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:15,350
cool let's do some really cool stuff so

00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:17,300
here's the sort of scenario I've got

00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:19,400
this dev site that I'm working on and

00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:22,850
I'm trying to build you know make some

00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:24,110
changes to the site so well first just

00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,820
go in and we'll just make the basic

00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:28,160
change will make that site information

00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,940
change instead of calling it my grade

00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:33,800
drupal con la cité I'll say migrate cmi

00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:36,230
drupalcon la cité and I'll go ahead and

00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:38,270
hit save and this is a configuration

00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:40,429
this is now created you know that value

00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:45,769
and then what I can do

00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:49,519
is jump it on my command line I have my

00:26:45,769 --> 00:26:51,889
dress site set up so you'll see I can go

00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:55,970
ahead and this is doing on the dev site

00:26:51,889 --> 00:26:58,549
and I can run this command called config

00:26:55,970 --> 00:27:00,259
export which is what will actually

00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:02,659
expert on all the config so it's going

00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:04,820
to take all that stuff tell me oh look

00:27:02,659 --> 00:27:07,610
system site has an update to it great

00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:10,879
i'll go ahead and hit export and then

00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:12,889
weld am surprised if i go up here we've

00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:15,740
now seen sites default config system

00:27:12,889 --> 00:27:18,590
site yambol has been changed if i go

00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:22,100
look at it you'll see old value new

00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:24,259
value and i can actually go ahead and do

00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:28,460
a quick commit here you know changing

00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:30,350
the title and what's really great about

00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,820
this is that like now this is going to

00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,830
go ahead and actually make that a full

00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,990
git commit it'll have again hash and

00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:37,909
that as a developer you can sort of

00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,409
start to see you know what i might be

00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:40,999
interested in doing is not just doing

00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:42,889
config changes although those are

00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:44,480
powerful but i'm also might be

00:27:42,889 --> 00:27:47,090
interested in writing some other code

00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,190
too so i can do some configuration

00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:51,440
changes i can write some module code

00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:53,740
some theme code i can do it all in one

00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,669
commit and that's like you know and

00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:57,590
that's this commit that has this

00:27:55,669 --> 00:28:00,379
information so when i do a deployment

00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:03,320
now go to my test environment i'll do a

00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:05,690
deploy and i actually pushed that code

00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,789
it's going to move that from the dev

00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:10,309
environment to the test environment and

00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:12,559
now i have in that directory sites

00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:16,519
default config an updated yambol file

00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:17,840
which is pretty cool and that once i do

00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:20,720
that and I'll go back to my test

00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:25,330
environment I have a couple things I can

00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:28,269
do so looks like it's deployed okay cool

00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:30,470
if I go back to my test environment and

00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:31,730
CSD at the top it says tests just

00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:34,490
because we're in the test environment

00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:35,809
and I go to configuration and I go down

00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:37,549
to caught configuration management I

00:28:35,809 --> 00:28:39,860
actually will now use this a

00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:41,240
synchronized town and this is a

00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:44,029
synchronized tab is basically saying

00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,610
okay let's go scan everything in that ye

00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:48,080
of the Amal files and let's see anything

00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:50,419
that like you know looks like a change

00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,609
for what we had before let's let people

00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:54,050
see the change right here and then if we

00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:55,910
want to actually do the import

00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:57,980
we'll go ahead and just hit import and

00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:00,800
it'll do it right there so they'll go

00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:03,710
import that in cross your fingers looks

00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,970
like it's successful and not that I

00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:06,800
necessarily give it to you but now I

00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:09,110
have you know change the title of my

00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,420
great cmi Drupal la site which is really

00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:13,280
cool and as you guess if I went to live

00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:15,950
and do a deploy there it'll work

00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,540
basically the same way and this is cool

00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:19,970
because now instead of going just beyond

00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:23,150
the anvil files I've you know actually

00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:25,490
been able to think it's automated no um

00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:31,100
ok it's we're all good now let's go

00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:33,170
let's go even crazier yeah um it is it

00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,570
is this it is sort of like doing it

00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:37,310
features revert so the the process here

00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:40,100
is you're basically telling Drupal hey

00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:41,480
there's new config go push that in it be

00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,860
like doing a features revert but it's

00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,270
more because it's more declarative it's

00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,620
sort of like it's almost like installing

00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:49,670
a new feature and I have it told me to

00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:51,290
override everything so now let's now we

00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:53,690
can do a more exams case I can go to my

00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:56,180
dev site and I'll maybe go ahead and hit

00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:58,430
like you know create a quick content

00:29:56,180 --> 00:30:01,430
type so I'll go and the content type and

00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:06,950
i'll go ahead and add that blog post and

00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:11,240
i'll do you know blog post ooh burst of

00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:12,710
genius and i'll go save that because

00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,630
configuration isn't just like little

00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:16,310
variables like it can be full-on you

00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:18,770
know content types and feels i could go

00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:22,850
at an image field if i wanted as well

00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:26,390
I'll go show you that one and so go

00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:27,970
image you know picture and go ahead and

00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:30,520
save

00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:32,980
and so I'll go go create that kind of

00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:35,350
stuff hit field settings and tell you

00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:37,240
what maybe let's even go do just for fun

00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:39,400
because views is in Drupal 8 core which

00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:42,400
is pretty awesome I'll go ahead and add

00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:45,160
a new view for the blogs and call blogs

00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:48,370
and we'll just show all of olive type

00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:53,290
type blog and we'll go save and exit

00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:55,300
that and with a little bit work we have

00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:58,450
got that view we've got that content

00:30:55,300 --> 00:31:02,280
type and if you were to go back to that

00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:05,350
dev site and run config export again

00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:07,450
it's going to go and attacked hey we got

00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:10,360
some fields we got this view this kind

00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:12,220
of stuff and it'll go on it'll go drop

00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:14,170
that in and we basically can go through

00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:16,180
that same process oh here's now the

00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:19,690
eight files changed different yamo files

00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:21,070
you know my great blog system and what

00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:22,780
you would see here is that like not only

00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:25,000
let this configuration but I could also

00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:27,070
add you know maybe some CSS styles for

00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,390
the for the blog system or I could add

00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:30,310
you know some other modules that are

00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:32,710
depended or whatever and I can get one

00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:35,320
really solid git commit that has that

00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:36,730
configuration and that code that's

00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,890
necessary to really put it all together

00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:40,360
and that's something I could test

00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:42,490
against like I do visual regression

00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,620
testing I could run unit test against I

00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:46,270
could run any battery of tests on just

00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,710
that can bid and now I've taken this

00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:50,260
entirely out of the realm with any

00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:53,500
clicking I just have the export and then

00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:56,280
I get commit and it's good to go so

00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,280
we'll go ahead and play that

00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:03,460
yep yeah and that's an important

00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:04,929
difference I think like features you've

00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:06,429
used to like take little features and

00:32:04,929 --> 00:32:07,929
like you know put it in little box here

00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:11,370
in this case you just dump everything

00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:11,370
they're just cool yeah

00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:27,080
but yeah so well one thing that exists

00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:29,030
is the animal files are sort of in this

00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:31,070
in this sort of like storage kind of

00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,540
staging directory when you actually for

00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:34,370
the runtime it doesn't load all the

00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,840
files every single time it actually does

00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:37,580
all that cash to get cash is that

00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,530
information and then that's what it uses

00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:43,520
during the run time for performance

00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:53,980
reasons which are pretty cool yeah I'm

00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:58,360
Davis yeah uh yeah I've slide that later

00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,360
at Andres commands it yeah

00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:08,830
oh yeah um well so one thing that I

00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,940
think really cool about configuration

00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,950
management I'll get a little bit of this

00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,390
a little bit later but that because you

00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:15,160
have declarative configuration you don't

00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:16,480
necessarily have the same ordering crips

00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,770
constraints of other stuff you don't

00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,840
have to have one thing turned on before

00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:21,730
others you can turn on a module have the

00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:23,620
configuration for it but because the

00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:24,790
configurations like a clean yambol file

00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:26,890
it's not like you have to have all that

00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:28,450
runtime there in order to run the import

00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,770
process and stuff like that so you

00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:32,010
actually get some guess improvements

00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:32,010
yeah

00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:08,129
yeah yeah so great so great point just

00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,389
for the recording the UM so one of the

00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:10,619
things that this this is absolutely

00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:12,419
changes where I think a couple folks

00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:14,490
have picked up on is that we're talking

00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:15,600
about full config export so people are

00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:17,820
going to develop and they're going to

00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:19,740
dump a conic config every time because

00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:21,389
if you're doing Q take export I mean

00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,740
obviously a stuff I change there but a

00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:24,389
lot of developers changed a lot of

00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:25,590
things a lot of the time and I think

00:34:24,389 --> 00:34:27,629
there's some strategies to deal with

00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,830
that we can we chat a bit more about but

00:34:27,629 --> 00:34:31,470
I think you know that's that's a

00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:32,970
limitation I think things like developer

00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:34,530
settings I think there'll be ways to

00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:37,649
exempt some of this and there's some

00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:39,119
override stuff will show in a minute but

00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:42,030
you all I think get the idea on the

00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,290
workflow sort of makes sense a couple

00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:44,490
other things just I want it that are

00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:46,740
sort of related configured ashman

00:34:44,490 --> 00:34:49,080
they're really helpful the first is that

00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:51,240
like drupal mrs. new with beta 10 is

00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,429
actually has a lot of smarts nuit that

00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,350
config with the dependencies so i create

00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:57,390
even i made a blog type and i add that

00:34:55,350 --> 00:35:01,020
blog type and added it with a view on it

00:34:57,390 --> 00:35:03,180
but if i was to go in under my content

00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:06,510
type and I was to do like let me go

00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:08,100
remove that blog blog post content type

00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:10,470
there's a section here called

00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:12,570
configuration deletions that exists and

00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:14,310
it actually will tell me look yo if

00:35:12,570 --> 00:35:16,230
you're removing a content type call blog

00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:18,810
like you're going to need to lose those

00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:20,130
fields also and you're going to need to

00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,810
actually lose that view because you

00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:24,420
can't have a view of blogs without a

00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:26,550
blog content type what also becomes

00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:29,850
really cool is if I had actually gone in

00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:33,480
and added let's say an actual blog burst

00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:37,200
of genius so we'll go do you know my

00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:41,119
great post you know my grade blog post

00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:44,430
for le and if I actually have a full-on

00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:46,710
blog post like this and I try to go back

00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:48,780
and do the deletion similar to Drupal 7

00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:50,220
you know hey it's used by one piece of

00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,750
content we can't dissolution and

00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:53,609
understanding those relationships

00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:55,380
between things is really important

00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:56,640
because that means that like it's harder

00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,940
to blow away or hurt your site with some

00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:02,070
exports okay well so that's the workflow

00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,060
sort of you know did that make sense to

00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:05,400
people in terms of just getting

00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:07,800
deployments out of two basic to advanced

00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,210
but this is what you're going to do as

00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,840
developers you're going to create these

00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:13,030
situations where your

00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,860
doing commits with configuration and

00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:20,980
then you can do deployments with s kind

00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:22,570
of stuff all right let's get in some

00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,070
even more cool stuff so that's that

00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:25,810
that's basically the demo you want to

00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:27,670
try this out install Drupal 8 you can

00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:29,560
get a Pantheon we have the Drupal 8

00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:31,450
sandbox you can spit up in a few minutes

00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:33,160
a lot of other people have that you can

00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:36,880
stall yourself definitely try off the

00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:40,930
beta ten a lot of energy here so hopeful

00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:43,090
is good otherwise I'm you know blame

00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:43,990
factors beyond my control okay so let's

00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,280
talk about some or getting some of the

00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:46,750
more the development pattern some of the

00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,890
more sort of advanced kind of topics

00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:50,160
because I think this is going to be

00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:52,840
relevant to our sort of day-to-day here

00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,910
first up is that as developers things

00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,500
like variable get and variable set are

00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:57,880
no longer in Drupal 8 those aren't

00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,070
things that you're going to use as a

00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,890
developer instead you've got this Co

00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:05,950
configuration API Drupal Drupal 8 has 44

00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:13,330
api's of this sort configuration state

00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:16,780
um cash and then the which department

00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:18,760
yes thank you configuration api's like

00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:20,800
this you can do that you can all get

00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,360
again on a particular valuable so system

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,300
site name sort of see on that pairs up

00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:26,980
and get this value you can also go ahead

00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,930
and set as well so you can set a name to

00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:30,220
something else it save this is the

00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:31,780
pattern if you're doing variable gat and

00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,280
variable set that you're going to end up

00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:34,600
using so that's a pretty cool way if

00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,100
you're dying a module or you're writing

00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,010
some code you need to access for set

00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:40,030
stuff you do it this way sometimes

00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:41,920
you've got values that you don't

00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:43,870
necessarily want into in the

00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,160
configuration like stuff like brat was

00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:47,440
saying if you have a developer and you

00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:49,000
want to have a development API key for

00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,470
your google analytics but you don't

00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,570
necessarily want that to be part of the

00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:54,580
configuration you deploy to production

00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:57,100
you can use an API called state API that

00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:59,710
basically sets things like last time as

00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:02,020
Kron is Ron or developer API keys or

00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:04,090
settings that you need to run the site

00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:05,890
but aren't necessarily going to want to

00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:07,990
have in version control as part of what

00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:10,180
you deploy and so you can do getting

00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:12,250
sets for particular environments without

00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:14,110
having that effect the larger sort of

00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:16,030
configuration stuff so you'll probably

00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:17,140
end up doing this a little bit if you're

00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:18,970
trying to do some stuff that isn't

00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:20,140
necessarily configuration for deployment

00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:23,020
but you need it in a particular

00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:24,580
environment same thing if you're looking

00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:27,610
to do some overrides of configure

00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:29,380
so like in settings dot PHP right now

00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:31,570
you can override Drupal variables if you

00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:33,610
want configuration management sort of

00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:35,440
takes that same approach and so if you

00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:36,760
wanted for example to put your site in

00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,170
the maintenance mode and set a message

00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:40,270
you don't necessarily need to have that

00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:41,620
message be saved and Devon pushed up you

00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:44,080
can just change the settings that PHP

00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:46,030
file and it would override that same for

00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:48,130
any other use case and this could be

00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:49,600
situations for if i'm a developer and i

00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:51,640
have some develop settings I could drop

00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,900
that all of the settings not PHP and use

00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,340
it that way and then mine could be

00:38:52,900 --> 00:39:06,640
different than my friend who's also

00:38:54,340 --> 00:39:08,020
working on the site yeah yes yeah yeah

00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,760
if you don't like gifts you could you

00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:11,860
know have your image field settings you

00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,450
know not let that con that kind of file

00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:15,220
be uploaded or whatever you want that

00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:17,350
you have full access to the different

00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,790
configuration management stores and

00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:20,770
that's pretty cool because then you can

00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:27,490
have very localized localized kind of

00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:29,050
kind of offal I mean it depends will you

00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:32,260
I mean you say is that PHP you have a

00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:33,640
lot of like a lot of power like that but

00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,960
you know just a few want to just have

00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:36,430
the module babel you have to get friley

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,570
differently but you could have settings

00:39:36,430 --> 00:39:41,340
for the modules that you would override

00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:41,340
and haven't really clean me right here

00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:48,070
you could you could do that to bail in

00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:50,140
module there's the module naval there's

00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:51,520
vs. module name logical disable that you

00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,830
could call and that would you could sort

00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:56,490
of force that on say every time to run

00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:58,630
this I want this module Mabel no problem

00:39:56,490 --> 00:40:00,880
you also have the ability to modify

00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:03,130
different languages for developers you

00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,840
have like a multilingual site the EML

00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:07,210
files allow for the same sort of itn

00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,800
pretax prefixes so you can have you know

00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:11,980
hey we've got like some Dutch language

00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,480
or we've got some you know Hungarian

00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,160
language and because you're going to

00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:17,080
have like a site title other labels and

00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:18,880
different languages it supports all of

00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:23,020
this all this pretty cleanly which is

00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:24,430
pretty excellent few limitations okay

00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:26,110
that's sort of the developer kind of

00:40:24,430 --> 00:40:27,730
stuff you might end up using some

00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:28,990
limitations and some other modules that

00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:31,150
we can go and then we get into little

00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:34,180
more QA the last leg you know five ten

00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:36,640
minutes of this thing so question from

00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:38,109
before so one of the problems you're

00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,910
going to run into if

00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:41,950
you start to do this for real with other

00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:44,109
people is that you end up actually

00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:46,059
having a lot of different get branches

00:40:44,109 --> 00:40:48,249
and developers that are changing and

00:40:46,059 --> 00:40:50,410
doing stuff at once like I'm give you a

00:40:48,249 --> 00:40:52,180
pretty clean demo with like I'm going to

00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:53,859
add a blog post and push it from dab to

00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:55,569
task because I'm the only one working on

00:40:53,859 --> 00:40:57,519
the site and it's a pretty simple change

00:40:55,569 --> 00:40:59,950
but what happens when I'm making a blog

00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:01,630
system over here and my friend she's got

00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:03,730
like you know a whole different forum

00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:05,140
system and like somebody else is doing

00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:07,359
some other you know thing on the site

00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,980
we're all committing config in different

00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:11,079
ways we all have different feature

00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:12,489
branches were working from and we're all

00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:13,539
trying to sort of you know push up the

00:41:12,489 --> 00:41:15,099
latest and greatest we know what an

00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:16,359
override our stuff right we don't want

00:41:15,099 --> 00:41:18,460
to say oh I'm going to dump all my

00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:20,710
config and my dev site and force that as

00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:22,839
the issue because I might not have made

00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:24,519
a config change that somebody else made

00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:26,950
and because we have declared of

00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:28,539
configuration if I'm saying oh well you

00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:30,640
know let's like you know dropped out my

00:41:28,539 --> 00:41:33,450
config if it is a different value it'll

00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:36,730
start to override so the answer to this

00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:39,759
with mr. Greg Anderson has created a

00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:43,119
rush command called config merge which

00:41:39,759 --> 00:41:45,430
is currently and rush 7 rc2 should check

00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,039
this out and basically what this does is

00:41:45,430 --> 00:41:50,410
this says look if I'm working with cmi

00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:51,910
and say my local computer and I'm like

00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:54,099
you know wanting to actually like to

00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:56,559
knit my work instead of just doing the

00:41:54,099 --> 00:41:58,720
export and pushing up that code I can

00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:00,339
run config merge and I can tell it the

00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,650
targets that I'm interested in sort of

00:42:00,339 --> 00:42:04,509
like merging so i could say ok I've got

00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:06,700
my local sandbox where I'm working on

00:42:04,509 --> 00:42:08,349
I'm going to take that local sandbox run

00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:10,329
config merge it's actually going to get

00:42:08,349 --> 00:42:12,339
that export from the dev site or the

00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:14,440
life's I would ever pull it down into my

00:42:12,339 --> 00:42:16,720
local things merge the changes together

00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,759
and that has one commits sort of push it

00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,259
right back up and that this is the kind

00:42:18,759 --> 00:42:21,519
of thing when I'm actually interacting

00:42:20,259 --> 00:42:23,200
with feature branches and different

00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:25,690
developers that I'm going to do on the

00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,700
regular that like I'm very interested is

00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:29,230
when I actually do that merge to be able

00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:30,519
to kick you know all the different

00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:32,079
features together and give that clean

00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:34,779
commit that represents the most

00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,849
up-to-date configuration on and so you

00:42:34,779 --> 00:42:38,650
can get this it's a dress seven RC 2

00:42:36,849 --> 00:42:40,539
it's a new feature is in different kind

00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:42,279
of support for you no more remotes and

00:42:40,539 --> 00:42:44,079
this kind of stuff that's coming but

00:42:42,279 --> 00:42:45,220
this is something I feel as developers

00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:49,420
we're going to end up for using

00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:51,339
configuration management use a lot you

00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:51,890
also have this problem sort of in terms

00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:54,079
of limit

00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:55,849
that um Drupal 8 configuration

00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:57,890
management system was designed to export

00:42:55,849 --> 00:43:00,260
all the config for just one site that

00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:01,940
it's not actually very good or very well

00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:03,890
designed for doing you know sharing

00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:06,200
configuration between sites we work on a

00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:07,339
Drupal distribution or you have like you

00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,480
want to make it like a press room

00:43:07,339 --> 00:43:10,039
feature you're going to share it with

00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,319
all of your you know all the sites

00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:13,609
you're making for your organization it

00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,809
doesn't really let you do this yours

00:43:13,609 --> 00:43:17,839
getting a big export of all the

00:43:14,809 --> 00:43:19,519
configuration so luckily there's going

00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,099
to be a features for Drupal 8 that's

00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:23,210
going to directly address this issue

00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:25,339
features is something obviously that

00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:27,740
before was used to do that code code

00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:28,880
saving but in Drupal 8 features actually

00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:30,829
gets they'll do really what it was

00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,359
designed to do it doesn't have to deal

00:43:30,829 --> 00:43:34,220
with the setting and and getting a

00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,900
values it's just going to do packaging

00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:37,400
for features this is what it looks like

00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:39,650
in Drupal 8 there already is a version

00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:40,910
of it out you can play around with it if

00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:43,490
you're really interested in it i would

00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:45,950
definitely note on thursday to check out

00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:47,089
mr. Potter's talk and you'll refer to

00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:50,359
show you the whole thing and talk all

00:43:47,089 --> 00:43:52,099
about it a couple other things so this

00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:54,680
is Drupal 8 obviously as we talked about

00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:55,910
arm there is a version for Drupal 7 if

00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,829
you're interested in playing with it

00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:58,940
it's not exactly the same and i

00:43:57,829 --> 00:44:00,950
definitely recommend using the dev

00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:03,019
branch of this module but drupal org

00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:04,519
slash project configuration will let you

00:44:03,019 --> 00:44:06,740
try some of these same patterns in

00:44:04,519 --> 00:44:08,539
Drupal 7 i'm not sure i recommend you do

00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,190
this necessary for production production

00:44:08,539 --> 00:44:11,539
sites initially but I if you're looking

00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:13,250
to check it out and you're working on a

00:44:11,539 --> 00:44:15,470
Drupal 7 project and you want to sort of

00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,940
see how it work this will get you a lot

00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:22,160
of the same patterns with the different

00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:23,599
you know to see mi data stores something

00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,539
else that sort of becomes an issue is

00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:28,220
track ability of your of your changes so

00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:30,440
the demo i showed you have to formally

00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:32,240
go do that config export every time you

00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:33,589
want to actually export your stuff and

00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,509
sometimes it makes sense because you can

00:44:33,589 --> 00:44:36,740
like logically group your features but

00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:38,990
if you are very interested in having

00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:40,819
very granular auditing of the different

00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:42,829
other different stuff so drupal module

00:44:40,819 --> 00:44:45,049
called config tools that will actually

00:44:42,829 --> 00:44:46,670
set up to do a git commit every time you

00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:48,349
make a config change so you can get a

00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:50,210
pretty clean record of when and how and

00:44:48,349 --> 00:44:54,609
allow for sort of perversions if you

00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:57,230
need it one thing that's my favorite one

00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:59,240
so one other issue that you run into is

00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:01,220
I showed you the dev workflow dev test

00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:03,529
live that's totally a best practice also

00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:05,960
not necessarily something you have to do

00:45:03,529 --> 00:45:08,599
that all the config changes i was doing

00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:09,920
dev you could have done in life as you

00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:11,300
have a particular customer or client

00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:13,339
that's like sort of a little bit

00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:14,810
overexcited they may go in and do those

00:45:13,339 --> 00:45:16,940
those config changes on the production

00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:18,800
server and you know cause a little bit

00:45:16,940 --> 00:45:20,510
of mess of the project really great

00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,640
module is something called configuration

00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:24,740
read-only mode doesn't do a whole lot it

00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,960
just tells you not to do any config

00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:28,369
changes on the live environment and

00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,710
that's something that I think would be a

00:45:28,369 --> 00:45:32,839
totally good best practice to use hey

00:45:30,710 --> 00:45:34,160
look you shouldn't do config on the

00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:35,960
audio production sites you only do it in

00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,490
dev so we're just going to force that to

00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:40,520
not be the case you don't always want

00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:43,869
that but in some cases you do it's a

00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:45,859
module for that glass top of things

00:45:43,869 --> 00:45:47,599
sometimes you know sort of working with

00:45:45,859 --> 00:45:49,460
features this is the fantasy of features

00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,810
you if you have modules that provide

00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:52,700
their own configurations you can get a

00:45:50,810 --> 00:45:54,290
little bit of confusion around that it's

00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:55,849
a configuration update manager that will

00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:57,440
actually look and sort of say hey

00:45:55,849 --> 00:45:59,330
install this module have these

00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,920
configuration values the new version

00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:02,930
maybe he has changed some of them how do

00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,520
I handle that and this module does a lot

00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:06,410
of work work with that so this is the

00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:09,770
cool one how features will require it so

00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:11,030
it worked pretty well like that it's

00:46:09,770 --> 00:46:12,440
also sort of the case that you're doing

00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:13,250
a lot of development and you're trying

00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,170
to get out a lot of the different

00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:17,690
configurations that you know sort of

00:46:15,170 --> 00:46:18,920
getting a specific kind of configuration

00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:20,480
export out can be a little tricky

00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,310
especially doing a lot of development

00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,990
chicks maintains this configuration

00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:25,760
development module that does a lot of

00:46:23,990 --> 00:46:27,140
quick exporting so if your module

00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,820
developer and you try to develop this

00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:32,060
stuff we want to work with it this makes

00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:34,130
it really easy but let's just talk big

00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:36,050
picture like this is configuration

00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:37,609
management is really the kind of

00:46:36,050 --> 00:46:39,170
technology and techniques that I think

00:46:37,609 --> 00:46:41,240
will pretty much all use in this room

00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:43,339
for you know for pretty much the rest of

00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,990
our like web development life that you

00:46:43,339 --> 00:46:46,460
know having configuration values in the

00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:48,560
database those things that we can't

00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:51,109
version control we can't test against we

00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:53,180
have to like replicate on a like like

00:46:51,109 --> 00:46:54,650
production site it's just it's that's

00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:56,420
not not sort of where this industry is

00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:57,830
going and I think it was really awesome

00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,330
that we got you know configuration

00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:00,950
management into jubilate is one of the

00:46:59,330 --> 00:47:01,940
first things that got done it's one of

00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:04,280
the things a lot of people are really

00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:06,619
excited about using it is my favorite

00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,940
feature and I think that um you know I

00:47:06,619 --> 00:47:09,770
advice or to everyone and sort of try it

00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:11,810
out you know check out the different you

00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:13,609
know config modules and watch the space

00:47:11,810 --> 00:47:15,020
like the core system for configuration

00:47:13,609 --> 00:47:16,670
management is pretty powerful but

00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:17,930
there's a lot of contribs and other

00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:20,030
practices that are coming

00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:21,290
but with that I think you know

00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:23,000
definitely hopefully get a little bit

00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:24,859
excited occupation management see how it

00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:26,390
works other than that I like take some

00:47:24,859 --> 00:47:27,859
questions and on thank you all for your

00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:42,050
attention in time to watch this

00:47:27,859 --> 00:47:51,230
presentation yeah oh yeah i guess theres

00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:53,780
the mic can you exclude specific

00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:56,569
sections of conflict for export so they

00:47:53,780 --> 00:48:01,250
don't get export it anymore um yes the

00:47:56,569 --> 00:48:03,260
question is oh you're the mic um no

00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:05,000
actually that's I mean there are ways

00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:06,440
you could do that but that like the

00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,480
general practice is that you know you're

00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:10,550
gonna want to export export out you know

00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,170
the all the softer all the stuff for the

00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:14,000
site one of the techniques that have

00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:15,349
seen is that you know when you do the

00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,420
export your right you might have done

00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:19,220
some other configuration that you didn't

00:48:17,420 --> 00:48:20,390
want to do in the git commit and that's

00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:22,040
something you can actually use get to

00:48:20,390 --> 00:48:24,020
sort of handle that you can sort of you

00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:26,000
know sort of add only those yambol files

00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:27,859
when you do the export then on that

00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,839
exists although it wouldn't surprise me

00:48:27,859 --> 00:48:31,640
if that if the export function could be

00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:33,410
extended with some variable or some some

00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:35,390
parameters to have some restrictions I

00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:37,010
think you know it's one of the things

00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:38,480
when I demo it it's pretty clear like I

00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:40,400
made this change obviously I want that

00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:41,839
to go but in the real world you're doing

00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,730
a lot of different changes and you have

00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:45,049
to be sort of careful and not equate

00:48:43,730 --> 00:48:46,309
when you do the export you can do some

00:48:45,049 --> 00:48:48,650
management and get to only deploy the

00:48:46,309 --> 00:48:51,260
stuff you want the main reason is

00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:53,900
because features it was used as as site

00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:55,970
conflict was meant as packaging specific

00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:57,950
sections of config they can share

00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:59,210
between sites yeah if you want to do

00:48:57,950 --> 00:49:00,650
that or you just have one specific

00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:01,910
content type you want to share across

00:49:00,650 --> 00:49:03,799
three different sites you have to be

00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:05,780
able to exclude that from a site

00:49:03,799 --> 00:49:07,190
specific configuration export yeah

00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:08,390
that's well I mean that's this is the

00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:10,670
distinction that's that's it's very

00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:12,589
important from features to cmi is that

00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:14,329
in features you do have their your sort

00:49:12,589 --> 00:49:15,410
of your selecting the kinds of stuff you

00:49:14,329 --> 00:49:17,210
want to export you sort of have an

00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:19,190
opt-in kind of strategy for

00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:21,290
configuration export with with kuvira

00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:23,000
management Drupal 8 you assume you need

00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:24,950
all the configurations you do that sort

00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,940
of full export and you can play some

00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:27,680
games like making sure you're just

00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:29,359
getting out the stuff you want but the

00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:31,280
base assumption is that all the

00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:31,520
configuration will be exporting for

00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,080
Lance

00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:34,730
site and will exist in those yamo files

00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:36,530
and that's what would be important the

00:49:34,730 --> 00:49:38,030
site but it's a sort of different model

00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:40,130
but I think it'll work a better for the

00:49:38,030 --> 00:49:41,720
kinds of like sites we're building you

00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:43,250
know for a single site to do it with

00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:45,110
respect to features definitely check mic

00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:46,580
session on Thursday and he'll talk about

00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:48,380
using C and I'd actually share features

00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:52,970
across sites just pretty cool okay thank

00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:56,390
you yeah our blocks considered content

00:49:52,970 --> 00:49:57,680
or config and cmi I'm configure the box

00:49:56,390 --> 00:50:00,860
and configured chaotic Arkansas our

00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:02,840
configuration their their content though

00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:04,400
the settings are configuration Oh are

00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,720
they okay um so you can you could have

00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,700
for example you could change the blocks

00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:09,110
of the blocks on like your page you

00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:10,490
could push that into cmi and you can do

00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:12,560
the appointment for that okay yeah we've

00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:14,930
had some experiences with clients

00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:16,750
updating blocks on live having to

00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:19,250
regenerate the feature from live so we

00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:21,140
okies like the ordering and yeah crazy

00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:23,300
that's one of things i think that read

00:50:21,140 --> 00:50:24,590
only cuz various modules pretty cool you

00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,150
know sometimes clients do you want to do

00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:27,290
some configuration changes but try to

00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:29,170
lock some that down is helpful because

00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:34,430
you can move stuff around for weird ways

00:50:29,170 --> 00:50:36,620
yeah hi install profiles is there just a

00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:39,200
directory where I dumped a configuration

00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:42,650
in or do i have two registers somehow

00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:44,900
what i have in terms of configuration

00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:46,160
for install 10 yeah so great question so

00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:48,200
install profiles there's actually uh

00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:49,610
there's like a framework for doing this

00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,650
where if you're making a stall profile

00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:53,570
you can actually just dump your cmi or

00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:55,790
your configuration from existing site

00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:57,320
into a directory and then there's some

00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:59,240
logic that will actually import that all

00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:01,490
in as part of the install profile

00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:03,080
installation and so like to actually

00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:04,790
make an install profile is that being

00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,530
pretty easy because you just configure

00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:08,390
the site the way you want you export all

00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:10,190
the config into your profile directory

00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:12,230
and then you set it up so when you do an

00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:14,270
install for that installation profile it

00:51:12,230 --> 00:51:17,510
will actually dumped in all the config

00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:20,180
into the database so just just dump it

00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:22,010
in ya wholesaler in wholesale so and I

00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,720
could see James picked up automatically

00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:24,950
yeah well you have to put some watch to

00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,140
do it but yeah you pick up the whole

00:51:24,950 --> 00:51:28,520
thing automatically and what you could

00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:30,020
do on top of this is actually then add

00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:31,670
some additional configuration screens to

00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:33,200
like change things like the title or

00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:34,460
some of the other stuff but I think

00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:37,040
it'll make it a lot easier to make

00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:38,240
certain kinds of distributions with with

00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,950
CLI because you don't have to worry

00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,180
about I have features all work the right

00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:42,710
way you just build the site the way you

00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:44,390
want you can clone it sort of in mass

00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:47,779
which I think will be pretty cool

00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:50,869
cool awesome couple more yeah so when

00:51:47,779 --> 00:51:53,630
you change a setting from the UI it goes

00:51:50,869 --> 00:51:55,309
on and change the yamo file so once you

00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:56,690
do the export yeah yeah so what happens

00:51:55,309 --> 00:51:57,980
if you change the llamo file then you

00:51:56,690 --> 00:52:00,470
have to trigger dredge to pick it up

00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:01,970
yeah so if you change the ammo file

00:52:00,470 --> 00:52:04,309
directly which I wouldn't recommend but

00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:05,960
you could do on you then have to either

00:52:04,309 --> 00:52:07,940
go into configuration management and go

00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,829
to synchronize page or run the dress

00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:11,750
config import command and that will then

00:52:09,829 --> 00:52:13,609
scan those EML files detect a difference

00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:15,470
and then push that difference up here so

00:52:13,609 --> 00:52:17,240
Jen you talk about using Colonel events

00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:18,589
to see what Yama files are changing is

00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,930
synchronized on its own or anything like

00:52:18,589 --> 00:52:22,279
that um I mean you wouldn't need to rush

00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:24,019
rush will give you a pretty good set of

00:52:22,279 --> 00:52:27,019
output of what's changed and what's

00:52:24,019 --> 00:52:31,400
being imported okay thank you yeah last

00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:33,589
question hey Matt so it's actually

00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:35,059
similar to the installed profile but but

00:52:33,589 --> 00:52:38,829
slightly different I'm wondering if

00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:41,809
there is any concept yet of just

00:52:38,829 --> 00:52:44,119
increasing specificity of locations for

00:52:41,809 --> 00:52:46,970
config and the reason I'm asking that is

00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:48,260
in the install case if you're using a

00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:49,970
distribution and something changes

00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,990
upstream what you mentioned doesn't

00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:53,210
really work cuz that's just a single

00:52:50,990 --> 00:52:54,710
point of time you do an initial dump and

00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:56,559
then you're on your own from there that

00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:59,569
changes upstream you don't get that

00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:03,619
unless there was some sort of a well you

00:52:59,569 --> 00:53:06,380
know I'm more specific now and now my my

00:53:03,619 --> 00:53:07,759
configs now take over whatever was you

00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:10,849
know and you can see some diff at cetera

00:53:07,759 --> 00:53:13,039
yeah um yeah I would say I don't have a

00:53:10,849 --> 00:53:14,450
great answer for that honestly I think

00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:17,089
one of the things in this may be a good

00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:19,250
thing to close on is that like you know

00:53:17,089 --> 00:53:20,809
that the kind of specificity I think

00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:22,970
you're talking about that I think people

00:53:20,809 --> 00:53:24,619
will need are things where there's like

00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:26,569
there's some options to build additional

00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:28,519
contribs space kind of work and some

00:53:26,569 --> 00:53:30,140
additional patterns that like this is

00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:31,700
all really new like there's not a ton of

00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:33,710
Drupal 8 sites there's not a ton of

00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:35,599
people who have really developed big

00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,799
sites with this and that one of the

00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,329
things I think sort of in terms of

00:53:36,799 --> 00:53:39,559
watching this space is once

00:53:38,329 --> 00:53:41,779
configuration management because more

00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:43,339
wide stream the Drupal community has a

00:53:41,779 --> 00:53:45,109
great amount of like customization and

00:53:43,339 --> 00:53:46,609
different patterns and I think the stuff

00:53:45,109 --> 00:53:48,559
that we think now that house is going to

00:53:46,609 --> 00:53:50,509
be used is something that might very

00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:52,609
well change and it might be different

00:53:50,509 --> 00:53:53,630
adapted in different ways and I think

00:53:52,609 --> 00:53:55,250
when the great things about Drupal 8

00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:56,869
with semantic versioning is that a lot

00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:57,260
of tons of stuff can be update improved

00:53:56,869 --> 00:53:59,690
in droop

00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:01,730
8.1 so I'd say in general configuration

00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:03,320
management start learning start working

00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:04,940
with it see the different patterns and

00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:06,590
you know when you run to use cases that

00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:07,730
are sort of new start posting about and

00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:09,920
talking about it because I think there's

00:54:07,730 --> 00:54:11,360
a lot of flexibility as Drupal does to

00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,130
do this kind of stuff right both

00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,870
consumer and then contribute in shull

00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:19,030
that's right cool thanks yeah otherwise

00:54:14,870 --> 00:54:19,030
