Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Drupal 8 CMI on Managed Workflow
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	The Drupal 8 Configuration Management Initiative (CMI) is a straight up game changer for Drupal development and deployment. As much as we all love doing it live, no longer will this kind of human powered configuration replay in production be necessary. Instead, developers will be able to natively export their configuration to code and deploy that configuration to production using the CMI tools.

This session will feature both a basic overview for how CMI will work in Drupal 8 and an advanced overview of how to use CMI with version control as part of a managed development - testing - production workflow. Forget the pain that was drush fe and drush fu-all. Come join Matt Cheney from Pantheon in embracing modern configuration management in all its glory.
