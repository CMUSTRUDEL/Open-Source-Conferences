Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Fighting Core FUD: We Need a Contrib Champion
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	Drupal 8 is upon us. With a completely new core, developers need solid example code to guide their upgrade efforts. The Example module has long filled this need and will again for Drupal 8.

Or will it?

Drupal 8 is a massive change. Rewriting example code is no longer enough to find volunteers, inspire confidence, and prevent "contrib flight" as intimidated developers look to other projects outside of Drupal. This, and changes in longtime core developer involvement have created considerable FUD around Drupal 8's new core.

We can do better. We need to fight core FUD. We need a Contrib Champion. In this session, we examine how Example Module's rewrite exposed the need for a new category and initiative to support contrib developers through the dramatic changes coming in Drupal 8.
