Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Drupal 8 Theming with Love
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	Drupal 8 has many new exciting features, but none are as radical or as needed as the changes made to the theme system*!

For 10 years Drupal's front end was design and built by developers that tried their very best to figure out what the front end needed; the lack of dedicated front-enders in core; resulted in front end architecture that was "less than ideal" for the challenges that the front end has faced for the last 5 years.

Drupal 8 and twig changed it all!

A complete overhaul of the theme system started 3 years ago - PHPtemplate is now out the door, the twig template system is implemented, and most importantly, the core idea of how the front end is build has done a 180° from how Drupal 7 handled theming.

This means:

No more divitis
No more Class soup
No more of Drupal's standard markup and classes
No more yelling at the markup and not knowing where stuff came from
No more using regex for modify a CSS class!
Such a dramatic change would normally cause panic is a time for celebration.

The session will give you a solid understanding of the key concepts of Drupal 8 theming, as a themer.

We will cover:

The structure of a Drupal 8 theme
Classy and Stark themes (and  what it means for the future of theming)
Base themes - what happened
Debugging and looking for markup
How {{ twig }} works from a CSS/HTML coders perspective (how to build a theme)
What to tell your developers about theming
CSS file structure and how M.A.T. works
JS and how to drop 32K
This session is created with the themer / front-ender / html-css designer  in mind, so a maximum of 3 lines of PHP will be shown in this session.

*Yes I know that a lot of “big things came into d8” that weren't front end related ;)

and so if you have more people out out

00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:06,930
in the hallway who needs to learn how

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:09,330
beautiful the world would be after two

00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,650
blade comes out yes there is okay but

00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,880
I'm just going to start because else you

00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:15,920
guys and they were going to get lunch

00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,359
you're going to be running away so um

00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,430
those of you who don't know me my full

00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,930
name is more than birch hydrogen which

00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,750
is completely impossible for anybody

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:27,689
outside of Denmark or Minnesota to

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,369
pronounce so what I figured out early

00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:31,619
years i bought a bit using stairs more

00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:34,290
than DK and DK you probably know stands

00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,210
for denmark it's not completely true one

00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:37,800
of the secret identities i have the

00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:41,399
sides of being a badass is

00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,739
also being the unknown diff killer which

00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,210
is what DK actually stands for and this

00:00:43,739 --> 00:00:47,399
is also maybe a little bit of my Viking

00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,930
heritage where we don't use you know we

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,969
don't use polite ways of doing stuff

00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:53,160
especially not in Google where we just

00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:55,559
go in and pretty much take or remove

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,750
what we want at least in Juba late but

00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,309
my last name is actually perch so you

00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,550
can actually call me son of a birch

00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,619
without me getting any kind of offended

00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:06,450
because of you might gonna misspell it

00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:08,549
because int is really close by each

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,229
other on the keyboard I'm perfectly fine

00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:12,420
with that I've done that multiple times

00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:14,010
and that's always fun when you come to a

00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,630
conference and that's what you've gotten

00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:20,970
your name sexist anyways um back in 2006

00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,340
when Drupal 4.7 came out I was at my

00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,170
first Rubicon in Brussels I thought that

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,540
was six years ago because I can't count

00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:29,189
cuz I'm a femur it's actually nine years

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,680
ago and what I thought at that point was

00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:33,150
you know what this seemed system it's

00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,810
going to take me six months to clean

00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:40,200
this up and most he looked at me

00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,460
but I like dude you an idiot most was

00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,990
there as well you should have thought

00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:45,450
somebody should have told me what it

00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:48,720
actually takes um and and this also is

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,850
uh it's been a long process to what

00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,640
we're up to now nine years later and if

00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,409
channel open is to do is in the room no

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,840
he's not i will say I'm very sorry John

00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:59,130
that I accused you of being responsible

00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,560
favorite thing that's wrong with Drupal

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:02,670
7 but it is your fault because at that

00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,040
point you are you on this team are

00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:09,690
working on Drupal 7 so we can assign

00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:12,450
blame this also means that I now have to

00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,120
do a thing because Google a steaming

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,069
have been

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,870
our way of me being yelling but about

00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:18,909
five years about what was wrong actually

00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,409
before tuple seven came out so I will

00:02:18,909 --> 00:02:23,019
claim responsibility for everything

00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:24,700
that's wrong so you can start them on DK

00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:26,530
blaming if you want to do that if that's

00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,360
going to make you feel better I will say

00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,340
just right now that my name is not on

00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,680
any maintenance list so there's no

00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:34,269
actual proof of anything and you need to

00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,010
be able to actually handle get to see

00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:38,319
what kind of stuff I've put into call

00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,629
and not put it into call I'm just to put

00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,110
it right and normally in my sessions

00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:45,549
have a tendency to go 60 minutes so we

00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:48,819
might not going to get time for

00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:50,260
questions if we don't do that treat them

00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:51,700
out with the hashtag google trick

00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,620
because then we can as you find them

00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,560
afterwards or just treat me directly and

00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,930
ask me i'm also going to do another an

00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,540
interview session down at the tech one

00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,859
proof later today at two-fifteen come

00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,690
down there and ask me questions all hit

00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:06,489
me up at the bar or wherever you want so

00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:10,810
just if you don't get time for questions

00:03:06,489 --> 00:03:13,840
and when I'm in the States I always know

00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,640
that I kind of need to say it all by the

00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,769
way I am sorry if I offend somebody

00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,060
today in the theming sessions I'm

00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:20,769
starting out the session the last

00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,239
session is going to be done by two

00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:24,430
Canadian so they're going to be sorry

00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,280
for all the things I've set so we can

00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:28,930
get that done but being a Dana max is

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,239
not only a datum from Copenhagen and

00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:34,359
it's actually true in days please is not

00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:36,010
a word we have I kid you not but instead

00:03:34,359 --> 00:03:38,079
of talking about copenhagen i will go up

00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:39,220
up a little bit north long way from the

00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:41,230
most awesome place in the world

00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:43,540
copenhagen and to a place where there is

00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:47,109
only evilness and that is where the

00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:49,569
Swedes live where the sweet lift is is a

00:03:47,109 --> 00:03:51,849
thing you know about Stockholm Syndrome

00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:53,859
right Stockholm Syndrome in this case

00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:56,379
it's not the swedish chef or ikea

00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:58,959
stockholm syndrome is what themis have

00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:00,910
been been caught up in four years in

00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,709
google 7 and what is Stockholm Syndrome

00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,180
then well that is when a FEMA says this

00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:07,400
is perfectly okay

00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:10,549
that is when the beetus becomes to be

00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:14,120
it's a feature that is when 5,000 signs

00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:15,530
of PHP template code is completely okay

00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,150
to have because then we can really

00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,340
figure out what's going on right when

00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:21,530
classrooms becomes a feature that is

00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,180
also that is yet another this Stockholm

00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:25,220
standard when we think this is actually

00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,770
the way we want to build and for that I

00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,210
save our no more we need to stop

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,860
that and that's the thing we've

00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:33,110
been doing for Drupal 8 what we're doing

00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:36,229
here is we are introducing new steam

00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:38,599
engine say hello to twit and goodbye PHP

00:04:36,229 --> 00:04:42,680
a template close it all behind you

00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:44,599
off and while we're doing this and this

00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:46,370
is no disrespect to the developers who's

00:04:44,599 --> 00:04:48,560
busting ass for years between PSD

00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,479
template because here's the problem none

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,190
of us who were contenders were in the

00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,020
process at this time that was the

00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:55,910
biggest mistake we did as fun day that's

00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:58,669
not stepping up and being responsible

00:04:55,910 --> 00:05:00,740
and actually expecting good developers

00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:02,270
to do our job that we have changed this

00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:03,440
time or also we had a couple of good

00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,870
developers who are tired of hearing

00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:11,090
people like me bear it not bitching

00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:12,580
bitching and moaning so here's the most

00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:17,030
beautiful thing we're doing into it

00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:18,229
theme functions are now dead and what

00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,970
does this mean well that means that

00:05:18,229 --> 00:05:21,800
everything now is in a template file

00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,270
instead so now you can actually find

00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,380
your stuff actually what we're doing

00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:26,900
here is we're putting the theme and

00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,520
control of the markup on the CSS where

00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,190
it should be because that's what we do

00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,310
so pretty much what we change seeming to

00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:36,889
be done in Google aid is done by Themis

00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,960
faulty much and you know no

00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:40,639
developers because I don't know any

00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,740
develops with things it's fun to debunk

00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,780
you know five different kind of little

00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,180
fun devices like these for four weeks

00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:51,860
with CSS stuff is kind of nice to just

00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:54,080
do your development is dead um so how

00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:55,520
does this look this wonderful new thing

00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,229
well twig is actually really really

00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,759
simple so it's going to go really quick

00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:01,520
to this and you will understand it all

00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:03,500
um this is an output get out you have a

00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,419
food with some kind of available where

00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,699
you get your data and this is how your

00:06:05,419 --> 00:06:10,250
uncommon stuff that's how you get your

00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:12,169
data out a beautiful thing you can do

00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:14,300
see this is the kind of in Drupal 7 the

00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:16,039
first line you try to figure out where

00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,320
your data comes from and you got

00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:18,500
undefined or 0 or something else kinda

00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,090
like

00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:21,650
it can be a little bit hard for us to

00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,780
figure out where transform what we can

00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:25,310
do in twig instead withdraw do it we

00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,990
don't care if there's an off day goes in

00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,730
the array you can just go through that

00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,100
variable and figure out what comes out

00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:32,720
even better what we can do on these

00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:35,120
variables when we put them out with an

00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,620
also like do magic stuff with them do a

00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,110
little function so I want to make this

00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:42,290
extra pretty so using the pipe over here

00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:46,190
I can kind of like manipulate my my data

00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:49,250
somehow and we also have controls and so

00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:50,810
let's say the person is me they'll buy

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,600
him a drink that's kind of like the

00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:54,740
simple consult we have and the templates

00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,240
the good thing about this is can we can

00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:58,280
take a lot of the small things to be

00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,140
used to do it in a in a pre process and

00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,310
I kind of move that over to the

00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:05,270
templates where this could actually be

00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:07,520
um so twig by itself doesn't change the

00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:10,460
way the themes are done or thought in

00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,750
Google four or five six and seven the

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,910
biggest thing we have changed it's

00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,070
actually the way that the mark-up gets

00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:18,680
generated and for that we have a new

00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:21,800
theme called classy so in Drupal 7 it

00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,229
pretty much went like this you know call

00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,669
spit something out and you have the HTML

00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:27,080
and CSS in your class just comes out

00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:28,220
here and then you can try to like

00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,040
interfere with it you can try to

00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,900
override it that we have changed now so

00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:36,350
we have introduced a new base theme in

00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:39,950
google called class sees do a little bit

00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:43,010
too fast this over that so what class

00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:44,780
she does is google sends the data then

00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:47,169
into the theme classy that then

00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,940
generates all the stuff that then since

00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:53,390
it gives you the output that means that

00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:55,880
but you set up your new theme um this is

00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,919
how kind of works now now Google

00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,919
sensitive ass into class in class you've

00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,600
been provides all the markup and the CSS

00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:04,729
that we have a standard so that both

00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,100
seven and party right now is then

00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:08,600
getting the data from there so when I

00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,550
have my team and I kind of want us

00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,840
together what am I going to do here I

00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:12,979
can either choose to say well you know

00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,690
what I don't want to have anything of

00:08:12,979 --> 00:08:16,340
these standard class or standard mount

00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,140
up the google puts out i'm just going to

00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,729
ignore that all i can say well you know

00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,740
what I'm pretty satisfied with what

00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:23,810
Google gives me because I don't need to

00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,729
change everything it's not everybody

00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,110
who's like a maniac like me who I

00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:28,610
associate and I just a little bit new

00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,680
class names instructors or stuff you

00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,820
just want to get your stuff done so the

00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,270
thing we want to make sure that we can

00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,640
do

00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:36,680
things so basically what you do when you

00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,690
start your seam out to say well you do I

00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,130
want to have Google's base markup if I

00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,870
don't want to have that I don't defy a

00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,400
base theme but then you don't gotta get

00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:47,060
anything you're just going to get a

00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:49,130
couple of mg diffs a couple of dips with

00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,810
data in and we might even going to

00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,610
remove all these divs and I've heard

00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:54,170
earlier on the people there's been the

00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,880
slide already that says you can put all

00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,010
the dips into blade that you want to

00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,260
either prove to that and yes you can you

00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:02,420
can just copy it will classy and put all

00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:04,460
the crap in you want I don't care what

00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,130
you do in your theme but I can get a

00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,540
nice little play to Oregon um if you

00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,580
then define your base theme is being

00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:15,910
classy you're going to get the default

00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:18,980
markup equals 7 and body works on and

00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:21,590
just to show you really quick hard looks

00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:24,050
now so it can't be going to have we have

00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:26,090
our themes with these four different

00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:29,210
themes we have all the templates they

00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:32,390
all see there's a fuckton 110 templates

00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:33,500
at this point we have to group them up

00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,480
in different elements we have all the

00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:38,300
forms in one folder we have like layout

00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,580
control your pager note all navigation

00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,960
elements is as well as templates uses

00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:44,030
there as well and so forth so you

00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:47,120
actually have access to or get templates

00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:49,910
so classy from the get-go has this like

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,550
ton of different folders that we try to

00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:54,680
put the data into and try to group them

00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:57,080
logically anybody want to help us out

00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,000
test this has just not just a bunch of

00:09:57,080 --> 00:10:01,400
us discussing it it would be nice but we

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,350
can look at that later on so one of the

00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,670
ideas behind this is by having trashes

00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:06,830
the place where we put all our data in

00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:08,960
what we can do then is actually

00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:12,170
future-proof ourselves let's see we

00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:15,200
figured out in 2017 that all the stuff

00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:17,990
we done now was dumb and the chance for

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:21,980
that is really really high so in in

00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:24,560
pupil 8-point 5413 we figure out that

00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:28,580
this is like we did it wrong so we can

00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:31,010
actually help ship drupal 8 point 5413

00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:33,230
but a new base team called two classes

00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:36,770
that then has that new markup that we

00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:38,420
actually need to do something this is

00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:40,310
just a fault example of what you can do

00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,440
but this is kind of the idea so you have

00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:44,630
in Cuba late but we're going to have we

00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,700
have will change the way we do in class

00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:48,590
we're using them as a name system if you

00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:50,120
really hate that what you do then is

00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:52,190
just clone all the templates and you do

00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,870
your bam Sox team and you can then like

00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,210
rename everything without breaking

00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,830
anything that's the idea so the first

00:10:56,210 --> 00:11:00,680
thing you want to do when you start up a

00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:02,570
new scene if you want to be very sure

00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,370
that you have to find the base theme I

00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,500
do think it was wonderful when we got

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:08,750
the issue center of errors in the theme

00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,240
layer that there was not no classes on

00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:13,010
no markup to work with when you didn't

00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:16,100
define a base theme it made me happy

00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:17,540
because that's what I want but what we

00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,920
figure out is kind of an understanding

00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,720
issue that people need to understand

00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,310
that you need to define the base theme

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,320
and whoever says I've never I don't use

00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:27,860
a base team you always use the base team

00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,510
we just didn't tell you um so let's just

00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,760
try to set up this theme here and

00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:33,890
there's a good amount of files first of

00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:36,830
all themes now lives out in your root

00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:38,750
folder / themes which I do know is

00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:40,010
complete madness because why would you

00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:42,020
put your theme there where it makes

00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:45,350
logical sense when they've so good

00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:47,000
inside / all / defaults less something

00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:52,940
something something so it's now moved

00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:54,710
out here so um let's say that I can want

00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,450
to kill off my classic theme I go in

00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,220
here have a female called Lucas ill

00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:00,440
because i have my Viking stuff going on

00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,630
and I have done a ton of different files

00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,580
kind of had for configuration files

00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,570
we're going to look into so one of the

00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:07,580
things you can actually do when you

00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,960
start up your theme which can be a

00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,550
little sneaky one if you want to have

00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,630
access to all the templates and you

00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:15,050
don't want to think about what you're

00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:18,380
right and you'll jump into two classy

00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:19,940
copy out all the templates and Justin

00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:25,360
will drop them over and your new thing

00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:25,360
and see here

00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:30,180
and when you do that they'll remove

00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,439
classy as your base theme and done now

00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,399
you have complete control over your

00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:37,499
markup and Google let me just say that

00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:40,920
again now you have complete control over

00:12:37,499 --> 00:12:42,809
your markup into book its wake up we are

00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,610
drinking last night I mean this is kind

00:12:42,809 --> 00:12:48,050
of like this this has been the wet dream

00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:52,379
for me for like at least eight years

00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:55,069
nine years sorry and so what we have in

00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:57,809
our theme fold here have CSS images

00:12:55,069 --> 00:12:59,339
JavaScript our templates and then we

00:12:57,809 --> 00:13:02,189
have these four files and let's just run

00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:04,439
through these four five or even with the

00:13:02,189 --> 00:13:07,829
info file is justice in Drupal Simmons

00:13:04,439 --> 00:13:09,540
info file you have your basic info where

00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:11,670
put in your name it's a theme and so

00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:12,600
forth then you have these libraries and

00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:14,579
we're going to come into these labs

00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,920
that's where you add JavaScript and CSS

00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:18,899
files you have CSS files you can remove

00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:21,089
from the theme directly so we don't use

00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:22,980
to have used evil tricks as the

00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:24,600
often by methods in Google seven is

00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:26,339
actually built in now as a future and

00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,910
then we have to reach this definition

00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:32,069
this is your info file so let's go

00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:33,899
through quickly the wonders of removing

00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:35,850
CSS files here we have all the CSS

00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:37,620
father get loaded normally in a very

00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:38,939
very small group elite side you can see

00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:41,999
that I've really worked on the theme

00:13:38,939 --> 00:13:45,779
idea and what you do is you go in and

00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:48,059
you add this line of beautiful coaster

00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:51,990
set stylesheet remove slightly if we

00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:53,699
move well then by each file you tell it

00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:55,800
the way it should remove will actually

00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:58,110
remove that file and you have to put in

00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,149
the whole path toward so we just society

00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:01,920
remove styles for example you would have

00:14:00,149 --> 00:14:03,839
a ton of different themes on modules

00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,610
that would have that CSS file so you to

00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:11,429
be very specific what kind of CSS far as

00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:13,620
you're going to remove and voila now we

00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:14,970
have only loading the CSS files we want

00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,160
to so this is kind this is building

00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,899
directly as a feature and it's a little

00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,170
thing here you see the s-class you that

00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:25,079
refers over to the cash using all also

00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:27,540
has like give it a whole long name for

00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:29,069
where it's actually living that's simply

00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:33,299
to make sure we don't accidentally

00:14:29,069 --> 00:14:35,579
opaque the stuff every we got my brain

00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:36,360
to not work so well the first I'm like

00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:38,730
wow

00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,279
preventive adding CSS and JavaScript

00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:43,260
files well dubin modules into blade use

00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,760
libraries to add CSS and javascript file

00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,589
so it kind of makes sense that we use

00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,970
the same technology i know i had like

00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:50,310
that i like to pick a fight with

00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,740
developers I don't have to fight with

00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:55,230
them it could be nice like the different

00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:57,620
sunset and like happy life together so

00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:00,750
let's try to like do things the same way

00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:03,720
so a library is actually pretty simple

00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:04,890
in your info file you define what kind

00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:07,019
of libraries you want to add to your

00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:09,269
theme so here I add a library called

00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:13,920
global so over my library's file what I

00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:16,079
do here is I define my CSS files if you

00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,450
just clear my cache agency they're

00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,519
coming up right there it's and they even

00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:21,660
have a little media Korean no worries

00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:26,399
you're going to have you're going to see

00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:28,950
that as a normal file so what did what I

00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,140
do here is in my info file i define my

00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:33,740
global library i give it that same name

00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:36,390
global a version the CSS files and

00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:39,959
javascript down here javascript thing is

00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:45,690
actually pretty sweet now it's not all

00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:49,560
of us who always want to use see if it

00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:51,360
wanna play come here here we go so and

00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:53,279
you know with javascript we have always

00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,500
had like Jake I'll be like smashed into

00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,640
Jupiter so what if you really don't want

00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,470
to use Drake how you want to use

00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,730
something else so you just wanna usual

00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:02,760
of JavaScript because you're like a

00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:04,410
vanilla kind of upped available and you

00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:06,240
can add or remove that what you need to

00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:09,300
do now in google from the get-go you

00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,029
need to set a dependency up on jquery

00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:15,449
that ok my theme javascript is depending

00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:16,980
on Jake I'm so I have to add that in um

00:16:15,449 --> 00:16:20,220
so if you look at my whole library

00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:23,100
failure my name i have my CSS files if

00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,660
you want to add media produce direct and

00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,190
you do it over here you have the

00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,570
javascript files that you want to add in

00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:29,339
and if you have dependencies on

00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:31,110
something that you need you put that in

00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:33,089
as well there this is how you define all

00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:34,589
you CSS files it's just getting your

00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:36,750
mind into understanding it's called the

00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:38,279
library and me as being attained and all

00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:40,769
the despairing like in days and

00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:42,480
learning to spell libraries it's a pain

00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:43,920
in the ass I would our kind of like to

00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,600
put in the past as you say we call it

00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,040
the lip instead but that's what I

00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,300
probably going to be a bike for

00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,480
three weeks I'm not going to do that but

00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,120
my

00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,769
life again and another thing we have put

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,370
directly into Cornell is like the whole

00:16:52,769 --> 00:16:58,889
responsive images yes future proven

00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:02,250
something-something password the thing

00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:04,400
is we don't have a integral seventh as a

00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,360
modular did that has a nice UI for it

00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,740
one of the discussion we have had is a

00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,569
commonly nice you actually want to have

00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,429
fun steamers or do we actually just want

00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:13,589
to have goddamn control over directly

00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:15,179
from our team yes we want to have part

00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,650
10 control over directly from

00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:18,089
our themes because I'm not going to sit

00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,760
for week and click click click click

00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:22,890
click and try to save a file somewhere

00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:25,319
and do that stuff no it's built a baked

00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:26,569
into to a breakpoint smile that's also

00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:30,150
it's going to live in your theme and

00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:31,590
it's the same kind of idea what it does

00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,450
because you have so much other to go

00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,590
feel just like it defines your element

00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,780
and then when you go and you set up your

00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:38,970
funds it seems you can now add this in

00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:41,280
it took me a little while remember that

00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:43,500
use the label because it also kind of

00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,230
gonna say something else and weights are

00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:48,330
also pretty sweet exit so I've my small

00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:50,100
medium and large so you can kind of

00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,480
weight the way you want to have it so it

00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,169
makes sense when you're going to set up

00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:57,390
your responsibilities then you have to

00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:58,950
theme file so those of you who really

00:17:57,390 --> 00:18:01,380
want to do with ton of preprocess

00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,270
you still have that option we did not

00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,460
remove that you can still destroy your

00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:06,600
theme and drive me nuts so that is

00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,980
future proven the thing is that

00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,660
sometimes you want to have that control

00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,130
what we didn't want to do with the seam

00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:13,140
layer into will eight we didn't want to

00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:14,940
remove all of the like find clean

00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,290
control we had but would take like

00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,120
eighty to ninety percent of the stuff we

00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:20,700
did on a daily basis and put that out in

00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,500
the template files here's a cute the

00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,030
three lines PFD they'll be in my session

00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:26,700
here today let's say I want to add this

00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:28,860
very specific library on my maintaining

00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,140
space I can do that at a pre process I

00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,750
can attest that library and then in my

00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:35,970
library file I'm defining that as well

00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,500
and that's how you can do that that was

00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:41,220
all of the PSP let's get away from that

00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:44,010
that's evil what um so finding your

00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,570
template files in Google 7 was fun it

00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,549
was something about getting a class

00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:51,380
named looking at that go searching for

00:18:47,549 --> 00:18:54,570
that class name wait till full moon ask

00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:56,700
your first bone to be sacrificed and

00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,900
then you might want to get the file name

00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,610
is probably going to be wrong what we

00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,480
have done in truble aid instead is

00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:02,640
wonderful

00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,130
this is probably the sweetest things

00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,140
I've ever been put into google and i

00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,880
know that means a lot in a service file

00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:12,299
what you do is you go in here and you

00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:14,730
say Trick Deepak to true about 50 people

00:19:12,299 --> 00:19:18,210
to two will do is this here's my normal

00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:19,470
salt killed good old google right let's

00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,390
figure out what it is called they were

00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:26,640
just go up and clear my cache now after

00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:30,330
i said service debug the true then

00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,730
didn't intend isn't and boom alright so

00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:34,530
a ton of comments came in here so what

00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:36,299
are they doing well they're actually

00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:38,400
telling us where all the data comes from

00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:41,700
and even better it's giving us hooks

00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,590
suggestions for this exactly so this is

00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,410
the thing you're going to get out now so

00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:47,880
what does this do well first of all it

00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,410
gives you finally i'm suggesting so you

00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,360
think about it theme hook suggest in

00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:53,490
google seven it's the same thing here

00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,770
you just have all the filenames directly

00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:58,290
defined for you here and the real sweet

00:19:55,770 --> 00:20:00,000
thing is this little X also tells you

00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:03,150
what file is actually being used right

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,010
now and here's the real booty thing we

00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:07,559
even have the path to where the template

00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:09,090
comes from so now you don't not going to

00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:10,740
look like an idiot for 20 minutes

00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:13,010
because you're looking for this file you

00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:20,760
actually know where the files come from

00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:22,620
so if a good old room light whereas in

00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,990
Drupal 7 is kind of out we're using

00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:27,030
another thing called kindt instead my

00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:29,190
installation kind of exploded while I

00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:30,780
was installing tint so I kind of ripped

00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,880
the screenshot up this morning because I

00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:34,740
used an old version of the bell and an

00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,710
older version of Josh at the same time

00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:40,290
and when you're working it hit that's

00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:42,270
kind of a very bad combination and most

00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:46,410
down here he's not him that I told you

00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:47,850
to do but what do you do with if you

00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:49,710
want to get data figure out what's

00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,059
inside of this variable you do a kinder

00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:53,340
than the variable name and then it will

00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:55,140
give you these kind of nice little like

00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:59,400
drops of all the data and you get all of

00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:02,340
the data so when you want to debug sites

00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,740
or default services go in there fix that

00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:07,260
download duvall module and you can't

00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,909
Kindt on your on your variables that's

00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:10,429
how you can hack drill into available to

00:21:08,909 --> 00:21:13,190
figure out what's actually there

00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:14,600
now this letter is look into a little

00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,220
bit of layouts in our templates because

00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:18,409
we don't have layout controls and all in

00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:21,070
Google to blade at this point no you can

00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:23,570
actually just do that in your markup hmm

00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,669
do we really want to do all our layouts

00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:29,090
in markup as front-end developers yes we

00:21:25,669 --> 00:21:34,669
do exactly as I guess somebody very deep

00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:36,619
voiced over here said yes so here is my

00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:38,659
template and this is my no HTML

00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:39,799
templates up here I have some class

00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:41,749
stuff we're going to come to that a

00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,730
little bit later on and that is goddamn

00:21:41,749 --> 00:21:45,499
sexy by the way then down here what I'm

00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:49,610
doing here as I'm kind of splitting my

00:21:45,499 --> 00:21:53,119
stuff up the first thing I want to do is

00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:54,259
I'm plating the the content and removing

00:21:53,119 --> 00:21:56,269
elements from my content and then

00:21:54,259 --> 00:22:00,169
collect and print them out another other

00:21:56,269 --> 00:22:01,340
spaces so what without does if you have

00:22:00,169 --> 00:22:03,769
your variable and then you go without

00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:07,029
and then something so that could be a

00:22:03,769 --> 00:22:09,619
field name so let's say for the this a

00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:11,360
conceptual idea this is my dumb before

00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,289
my article i have my content here going

00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,629
to have an image see I'm going to have

00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:17,419
my tax over here that's how my staff

00:22:14,629 --> 00:22:20,889
should look oh thank you relative for

00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:24,649
telling me that my java is not updated

00:22:20,889 --> 00:22:26,869
so here's the pseudocode of how the

00:22:24,649 --> 00:22:28,549
trick template would look content here

00:22:26,869 --> 00:22:30,259
and then you have a dip in parables down

00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:32,629
here so how do we split them up well we

00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:35,419
use without content without an in the

00:22:32,629 --> 00:22:37,850
image then we can print the content

00:22:35,419 --> 00:22:39,889
image out over here so we just move this

00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,600
stuff around and we can keep doing this

00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:43,279
stuff so we also want to move to chat we

00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,619
do the same thing do content without

00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:48,110
image without text so now we'll just

00:22:45,619 --> 00:22:51,110
print out whatever I slept here is the

00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:52,549
text let's say you're that later on your

00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:54,169
three months later in the process we

00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:55,730
figured out we need a new fields then we

00:22:54,169 --> 00:22:57,259
got print that out in Google seven if

00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:59,210
you did this kind of tricks we didn't

00:22:57,259 --> 00:23:00,679
have to without what would happen was a

00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,240
developer will call you up and yell at

00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:04,759
you because why did you only print out

00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,440
this specific text field now we can kind

00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:09,529
of work the same way as a form work so

00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,820
you you just add in you remove the stuff

00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:12,559
you don't want to have how you want to

00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:15,289
split out and then you can move it

00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:17,269
around um so in the market that vaguely

00:23:15,289 --> 00:23:19,279
would look like this content without the

00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:21,049
things field under store image field on

00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:22,060
the store tags these are the names for

00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:24,700
the two

00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:27,310
fields in your article and then if I

00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:29,290
want to print it out I don't do content

00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:31,300
but field image as you remember that dot

00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:33,070
notation thing how can drill into a

00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,900
Content doubt field name would then

00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,250
print out this is that depending out

00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,510
that template so we can grab that

00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,520
template later on we can do math

00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:41,590
yourself with that and I also do my

00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,080
content field tags afterwards that's

00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:45,490
kind of how we split everything up so in

00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,280
my real template what it would look like

00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:50,110
is that appears my field trends label is

00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,240
over here my twenty dollars here's my

00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:53,980
field image is over here and if we put

00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,590
data in later on it's not going to be an

00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:58,240
issue um I said with this kind of

00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:59,920
control we can actually now begin to

00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:04,480
build the templates that we want without

00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:06,430
destroying all kind of forgetting about

00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,750
new template so the developers can still

00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:09,310
do their stuff and you can split your

00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:13,270
stuff up and be very specific or what

00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:15,460
you want to do so let's just look into a

00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:17,200
quick thing on the field so if night's

00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:19,840
work on that so now split up my stuff

00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,890
that's all good but what I really want

00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,980
to do is I want to do something like

00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:26,560
this on my my text I want to add an icon

00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:29,140
in and it needs to be like if the tag

00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,820
name is Xu at an issue if its eyes and

00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:32,920
an ice cream a bit skate add in a

00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:35,410
skateboard kind of the concept here so

00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,480
in my note template file what i'm doing

00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:40,120
is i'm just doing printing my content

00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,170
for your text and drove about that why

00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,270
do you do is you go in and look at your

00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:45,490
source code and it feels like here's all

00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:47,110
the templates fair enough i'm going to

00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:49,810
grab this template and they're not going

00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:50,950
to do something like this why do i do a

00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:52,930
for loop one of the things you're going

00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:54,070
to do all the time into a new blade

00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:55,660
which way you're going to do these four

00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:57,220
loops you to take your data you look

00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,330
through that and then you get whatever

00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:59,860
you want and there's like different

00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:03,220
control you can say on the first open

00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:05,080
the second Lewbert Andy you know 40 to

00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:07,270
make it pink or whatever you like to

00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,680
have different control of of that what

00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:11,710
i'm doing here is i'm drilling through

00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:13,960
them given the item front of the UL item

00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:15,760
content i'll add some content title

00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,830
again as the title thing so you can see

00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,960
here my icons west sneaky-ass park and

00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:23,650
then i put in also the title here I'm

00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:25,330
waiting for Carter to fix these pound UL

00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:28,840
when you're going to be done with that

00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:32,110
cutter never it's kind of an issue

00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,940
because there's something with what is

00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:36,030
their buds the technical explanation for

00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,030
it

00:25:37,059 --> 00:25:43,249
yeah basically so so if we don't do we

00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:44,299
can't just like it kind of destroys a

00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:46,249
little bit so this is kind of way you

00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:47,480
have to drill in right now but I've been

00:25:46,249 --> 00:25:49,580
talking about this for a year and a half

00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,440
but that's just how it is okay still

00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,940
this is just how I separate my stuff up

00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,220
and so what it's actually going to end

00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:57,409
up doing for me is this kind of model

00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:00,080
and this is all it takes so if you'll

00:25:57,409 --> 00:26:03,080
follow giving my elements print them out

00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:04,639
and done to me this is beginning to look

00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,619
like how we actually want to see my

00:26:04,639 --> 00:26:08,989
stuff I don't have any google stuff

00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:10,820
inside of this and by the way I still

00:26:08,989 --> 00:26:12,350
keep like all the attributes and things

00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,970
so we're going to look at that in a

00:26:12,350 --> 00:26:15,769
second when we get to the classes and by

00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:17,869
the way if anybody got completely lost

00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:19,220
it will just shout or run up to the

00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:21,320
microphone and say Morgan can you like

00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:24,970
slow down a little because my my mind is

00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:31,639
melting with all of this ultimate what

00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:35,450
speed up a little bit are you using that

00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:36,919
thing we call sarcasm oh we don't do

00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:40,789
that where I'm coming from you have to

00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:44,389
go to Sweden to understand that alright

00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:46,129
so now we have figured out where data

00:26:44,389 --> 00:26:47,480
come from we have our templates we can

00:26:46,129 --> 00:26:49,009
do all this awesome stuff one of the

00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,259
things that always piss me off in Google

00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:53,600
was this idea of here's all your fifty

00:26:51,259 --> 00:26:56,239
four classes wrapped into like a

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,529
ton of dips because you need that what I

00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:59,330
really like is just having one class

00:26:57,529 --> 00:27:01,759
name when I need my class name so how do

00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:03,289
we do that without breaking pupil in

00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:05,809
pupil seven you know everything just

00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:09,049
came down here's your class names you

00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:11,239
can do preprocess you can you can try to

00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:13,190
override in template file may be a theme

00:27:11,239 --> 00:27:16,129
function of do as I once did regular

00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:17,419
expressions because that's the thing you

00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:20,600
want to put in your theme by the way

00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:24,470
that is just future proving yourself for

00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:26,450
work for the next six years so in too

00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:28,669
late what we do instead they still call

00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:31,309
those are all these variables and then

00:27:28,669 --> 00:27:32,720
in classic as you said hey your front

00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:35,059
page well if you have the front page I

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:38,059
could do something like you actually put

00:27:35,059 --> 00:27:39,859
out these class names okay let's let's

00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:41,690
take a look at that so here's my note

00:27:39,859 --> 00:27:44,149
template file and here is my variable

00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:46,190
that says set classes I said two classes

00:27:44,149 --> 00:27:47,370
on this because I need tax because I

00:27:46,190 --> 00:27:49,290
used as

00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:52,020
and then I kind of want to have to feel

00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:54,600
them in just for the fun of it and then

00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:56,490
as you saw my last my last template then

00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:59,220
I'm printing all of this stuff out fair

00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:02,400
enough so up here my net I do attribute

00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:05,340
add class and classes the reason we do

00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,320
these attributes is that the modules

00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:09,180
still want to put data in and maybe a

00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:11,750
module actually want to add a class name

00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:14,430
in because it needs that for some reason

00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:16,260
which I might have a slight opinion upon

00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:21,270
but I'm going to keep that outfit for

00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:23,250
today and who believes that so act as we

00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:26,970
want to do is set class yo set my play

00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:28,590
my two names and then doing my day for

00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:31,559
my nap my tackle to attribute add

00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:34,490
classes and then what I get out is my

00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:36,840
classes very very kind of simple and

00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:38,910
what why we're doing this attributes

00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,650
thing is let's say we have to quick edit

00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:42,630
cricket is a thing really sweet thing

00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:45,929
into great but if you like quickly edit

00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:47,280
your stuff and we don't want to remove

00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:49,020
that we don't want to destroy what a

00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,030
module puts out but I want to be able to

00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,250
like control the class names intervals

00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:55,230
so what we can do here is by me using

00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,760
the attribute and then add my classes

00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:59,370
it's going to add the classes also of

00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,590
this existing class in coming in and

00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:03,270
that's all good let's say a module can

00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:05,700
add a class you can also remove classes

00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:07,770
evil module puts out to know a very

00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,179
wrong class that's called bit we want to

00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:11,250
remove that well when we go into the

00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:12,660
attribution do remove class read and

00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:14,160
then we only got to get the clue class

00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,780
out so these are kinda like little

00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,670
control should happen in your tie in

00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,660
your template files so in each of your

00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:20,220
template files what you're actually

00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,260
going to see normally it's like a

00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,910
definition is like the first three lines

00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,490
of all the classes that gets generated

00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:28,860
and there you can control the classes so

00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:32,070
let's say that you add in CSS library

00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,450
from somewhere and go to github you find

00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,220
this awesome new CSS library that makes

00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,809
everything pretty and they's using a

00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,040
class name that's also you've been used

00:29:36,809 --> 00:29:39,929
by Trubel somewhere and you want to

00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:42,510
change that you can then that begin to

00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:44,340
you can override what Google does out of

00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:45,900
the box really easy so you don't have to

00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:49,050
maintain your own version of that safe

00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:51,600
bootstrap or whatever it can be so to

00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:54,600
sum up this in a little bit more simple

00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:56,940
like graphical way we have core will

00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,340
provide classes that is essential for

00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,200
drew would work life is visible

00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:02,940
invisible or what it can be

00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,000
then we're going to have your modules

00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,889
can as well provide a module in so if

00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,720
you want to do this with your with your

00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:11,909
PHP even still at this until you have a

00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,250
need for class you can add it into del

00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:16,260
we're not going to kill you and then

00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,909
your theme can do the same thing also

00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:21,559
add the closet so all this get printed

00:30:17,909 --> 00:30:24,090
out to become this string of classes

00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:25,980
let's say that I then want to remove

00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:28,139
classes well then I do attributes remove

00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:30,330
from the module and that's going to

00:30:28,139 --> 00:30:32,220
remove them again so we have to control

00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,899
the vector on each class name I'm from

00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:38,309
your template level so you can go in

00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:40,500
that way and clean stuff up and that's

00:30:38,309 --> 00:30:42,389
kind of how everything's got how the

00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,970
class control works now enjoyable a

00:30:42,389 --> 00:30:49,610
little side note on the underclasses as

00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:53,039
well as no JavaScript so Google has

00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:54,740
bye-bye many many years used classes as

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,179
a thing to like to do javascript

00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:00,059
operations on and that's both good and

00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:03,120
bad I for one might have destroyed views

00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:05,220
multiple times because I just remove all

00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,610
the classes out of use when you do that

00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:11,669
it's kind of like the the HX navigation

00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:13,289
doesn't work anymore oops i had a maybe

00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:16,049
a slight amount of clients we've got a

00:31:13,289 --> 00:31:17,399
little bit irritated on me because it's

00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:18,809
kind of like and this if these are the

00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:20,970
things that you don't think about when

00:31:18,809 --> 00:31:22,710
you're sitting in CSS and you just want

00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:24,659
to work you have no idea if a class is

00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:26,279
used somewhere so one of the things we

00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:29,309
have in our documentation now as well is

00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:32,100
they will need to preface your

00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:33,840
javascript with a je s dash and then the

00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,940
class name actually the thing we really

00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:39,929
want to see is if i have a class name

00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:42,389
foo so if i want to use that then at

00:31:39,929 --> 00:31:45,720
that class in again so you have j s dash

00:31:42,389 --> 00:31:47,429
foo and then you have foo so my so my

00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:48,929
fool i can i can smile up on that i

00:31:47,429 --> 00:31:51,690
could give it pretty cause can do

00:31:48,929 --> 00:31:53,190
whatever I want my CSS and then the

00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:55,169
JavaScript clean then do what I want

00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,360
it's still a process where foo we're

00:31:55,169 --> 00:31:59,220
like seven patches something from

00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,010
getting this completely almost

00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:03,690
completely done it is like nine years of

00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:05,460
JavaScript we're trying to clean up and

00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:06,899
separate so it's a little bit hard but

00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:09,309
it's one of the things they were we know

00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:12,759
that this is a thing where a lot of us

00:32:09,309 --> 00:32:15,879
we kind of mess up and by the way in

00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:20,669
Google 8 now we do have real CSS

00:32:15,879 --> 00:32:24,340
documentation which if you go to 198 to

00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:26,320
256 note or just search for Drupal 8 CSS

00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,179
documentation you will access your whole

00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,580
documentation standards for how you

00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:32,470
should write just CSS so it can kind of

00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:34,840
get the same way of finding it it's been

00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:37,210
a long discussion it is based on them if

00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:41,169
you hate them well then go and hate on

00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:45,369
it but that's how it's going to be so I

00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:48,070
need more water so far people like kind

00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:49,840
of following the concepts it's not like

00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:52,629
I'm not completely speaking over the

00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:54,580
head of people good is nobody there to

00:32:52,629 --> 00:32:56,830
say I don't understand what you even so

00:32:54,580 --> 00:33:03,509
about and you can you like speaking on

00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:07,360
the accent what is Bam Bam is is a

00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:09,429
naming standard for for classes so a

00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,559
class will be named as a specific way

00:33:09,429 --> 00:33:13,690
and that makes it really easy to talk at

00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:15,190
the simple feels so we actually using

00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:17,619
BIM as a class naming system you're

00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:19,690
using smacks as the standard for how our

00:33:17,619 --> 00:33:21,700
CSS files it's going to be smacks is

00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:22,809
kind of the standard for how becoming a

00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:26,139
standard specially when you build really

00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:28,240
big systems so that's kind of the two

00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:30,159
things but everything is like documented

00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,779
in on the CSS documentation is it would

00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:36,610
really done a huge job of getting that

00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:38,499
stuff and so an office ESS don't need to

00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:40,119
check out this cool feature so a quick

00:33:38,499 --> 00:33:42,039
block interval is one of the things that

00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:43,330
made me really excited actually about

00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:45,009
three or four years ago when we first

00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:46,720
begin to talk about changing the theme

00:33:45,009 --> 00:33:47,769
system to something else was kind of

00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,320
this one on one of the selling points

00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:51,549
and a thing you have usual in Drupal

00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,409
you're going to end up having six or

00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:55,210
nine different of page stash something

00:33:53,409 --> 00:33:57,220
because you have like a little thing you

00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:59,320
want to change on that page this page

00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:00,610
type a little bit thing you want to

00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,889
change over in that page cyber instead

00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:05,230
anything can be kind of like frustrating

00:34:02,889 --> 00:34:07,690
um so a twix block what it basically

00:34:05,230 --> 00:34:09,669
does is let's say as my taste HTML trade

00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:12,220
file here and i want to add in a

00:34:09,669 --> 00:34:14,190
variation of it it's just going to be a

00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:16,359
little part of it ever going to head in

00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:18,790
what you can do now you can define a

00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:21,220
block inside of your template and that

00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:22,210
block you can then change all depending

00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:24,500
on what kind of

00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:26,090
team hook suggestions or file name

00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,740
suggests is we're going to have so on

00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:29,150
this concept it's like you have your

00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:31,790
page and then if you're on the front

00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:34,220
page and paste the front gate called you

00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:36,200
can then extend on the page and then get

00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:38,750
all the data in and I know nobody

00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:41,660
understood that so here is a simple

00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:44,270
little example on this I'm I'm going to

00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:46,610
add in at not a color to my front page

00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:49,370
and not on my other pages so what I do

00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:51,950
here is in my in my page I'm gonna do

00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:54,380
define a block i'm going to call this

00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:57,200
block more than DK is awesome because

00:34:54,380 --> 00:35:00,970
that is the truth i'm going to add in a

00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,970
class that's going to have a caller in

00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:07,000
let's make it between yes i remembered

00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:15,280
so this the percentage sign is kinda

00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:18,550
like the controller sighs you have

00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,140
inside of twig so block and in plug is

00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:21,880
coming on how you define this visa okay

00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:25,410
this isn't just want to change out now

00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:28,300
if I go in and look in my source code

00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:30,310
try to do that so there's no green fair

00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:32,530
enough I'm going to inspect my element

00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:34,270
and go it looks G ok what's that you

00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,520
going to be cold here ok paid stance

00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:39,849
bash this is a little trick I was

00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:43,930
go in and do it like this oh you copy it

00:35:39,849 --> 00:35:47,050
and file him i'll create a new file

00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:49,680
called paste ash ponds HTML so I'm doing

00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:51,609
up here i'm doing this extent command

00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,349
first I'm going to make sure i'm not

00:35:51,609 --> 00:35:55,270
going to screw this up so i'm copying

00:35:53,349 --> 00:35:57,660
this whole block ok then i can change

00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:57,660
this now

00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:06,610
so the whole idea here is to be able to

00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:07,960
like swap out little elements of markup

00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:09,850
inside of your templates if you do this

00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:13,450
on all of your templates and yes it can

00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:15,550
create a very chaotic steam system but

00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:18,220
that's up to you to like organized in a

00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:20,020
decent way the extent command what does

00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:22,150
this is an old demo I pretty we have

00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:26,050
shortcuts now it first at work this

00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:29,530
morning so what you do is you eat you

00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:31,180
told you you tell the theme which file

00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:33,430
is it down when I extend on and this

00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:35,740
extension then trick will understand

00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:38,020
okay don't load the whole page only look

00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:40,180
or load with this part of it not part of

00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:43,600
the block just she asked the new way of

00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:49,690
doing instead of clear cache 207 crs

00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:52,420
clear registry got it goddammit cash we

00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:56,230
built which is called now which makes

00:36:52,420 --> 00:37:00,190
sense anyways as you could see here we

00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:03,310
had when I see if a nice to go back a

00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:05,020
little bit when i hit my fun page I get

00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:06,280
another part of Margo when I don't on

00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:08,320
the front page I can do that so this is

00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:10,300
kind of a way we can begin to modify our

00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,060
templates very simple all kinds of

00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:15,760
different funds ways um so basically i

00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:18,940
define the block in my pace template I

00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,370
then extend on that page and extend this

00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:23,740
basis ayoo if you hit this page don't

00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:25,720
load this page but go to the original

00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:27,700
page which is defined here and then note

00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,860
this part instead and done and this is

00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:32,950
how it contains like move these these

00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:35,320
things around and it's basically just

00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:37,000
this block and the reason that we on a

00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,890
day to day basis is called a twit block

00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,090
is if we don't call it a trade block we

00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:42,130
know exactly what's going to happen

00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:44,410
complete confusion in the world cool

00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:46,360
could also try to rename blocks in

00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:48,250
Drupal and use like the next six months

00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:51,220
in that bike that's not going to

00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:54,250
happen so that's called 28 box and

00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:58,380
basically swap out an element inside of

00:37:54,250 --> 00:38:03,580
your page so that was quite a lot right

00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:05,590
now still with me okay sweet so let me

00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:07,390
just like one through this quick so

00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:09,700
classy is our Drupal default markup

00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:12,790
remember that if you want to have markup

00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:14,690
in classes set your theme basting classy

00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:17,150
if you don't do anything you're gonna

00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:19,369
get a completely naked Drupal which I

00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:21,430
personally prefer if you want to do find

00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:23,750
it bearable you drill into that and

00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:26,540
libraries of you at CSS and JavaScript

00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:29,240
files without is hard way to separate

00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:31,550
your variables completely attributes

00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,310
that add class adds closet or you can

00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:39,079
remove classes so that's kind of like

00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:40,579
this is what's in trouble aight lets

00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:42,530
crew say that's quite a lot pretty much

00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:44,359
we changed we put it on the head and

00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:45,500
change everything how it's done and a

00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:47,210
couple of other things we figured out

00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:51,140
why we're doing this is a there's a

00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:52,640
couple of minor issues around different

00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,890
things in google that we also want to

00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:59,990
change for example how many here enjoys

00:38:54,890 --> 00:39:04,579
seeming a menu in 207 this one and he's

00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:10,280
trolling you're not rolling okay you

00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:15,380
want to see this this is menus in google

00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:16,880
8 it's one file that calls itself and

00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:19,010
what you can do is here is actually you

00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,480
can go in and test on the devil let's

00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:23,180
say you want to add a specific classroom

00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,400
level two level three you do these loops

00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:28,520
and then you just say well if menu level

00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:30,230
is 3 add in green class add in that

00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,940
class whatever you want to do change the

00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:33,980
mark-up completely that's how we're

00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:36,770
going to do that one of my favorite pet

00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:39,079
projects has also been killed and this

00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:43,520
file is huge by the way it's also known

00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:44,930
as the devil itself by the way on the

00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,010
menus here what we have done in this

00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:49,700
seemingly as you can see here you have

00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:51,440
menu menu dest local task local task why

00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:53,569
do we have to either left to task and

00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,220
task you can see we by the way we need a

00:39:53,569 --> 00:39:57,349
little bit helps some of these things to

00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:59,599
clean the last templates up because this

00:39:57,349 --> 00:40:00,829
is just conversions to stop moved in you

00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,210
have your bread crumbs of all these

00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:03,410
things like separated out in the

00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:06,050
elements you can actually work with them

00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:08,680
directly my favorite hate object in

00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:10,730
google has been for years the pager

00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,619
getting the patron figure out how to

00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:14,930
actually change that in any way that

00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:16,760
made sense and i think at least three

00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:18,680
times and be like okay this weekend

00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,240
we're going to clean it up and we sat

00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:23,359
down three people in copenhagen and

00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,400
within six hours like this

00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:27,440
let's go to the bar because it was

00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:30,690
simply not worth it

00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,910
this my friends is the piece of evil

00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:34,920
also known as the page because pages are

00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:36,809
 complicated and this is one of

00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:38,219
the old discussion we have had with the

00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:39,900
developers and FEMA's what developers

00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:42,390
like hey you really want to have a

00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,579
template this complicated I was like yes

00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:46,589
I want why do you want that because then

00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:48,390
I can control this instead of

00:40:46,589 --> 00:40:50,849
having like to sit and I try to grab

00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:52,680
outside invincible things if I want to

00:40:50,849 --> 00:40:56,690
change anything in my paycheck I can do

00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,690
that now I can see what comes out of it

00:40:58,069 --> 00:41:05,729
so we also did this we killed I six

00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:07,319
seven eight because we didn't feel there

00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:09,210
was any reason to support that anymore

00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:11,339
what I'm still hoping for one side of my

00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:13,650
head I kind of want to have also to kill

00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:15,390
ie9 I mean I would be speed with

00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:17,700
developing a new blade right now that

00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:19,829
she is pretty high on the other side

00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:23,460
also just want to get a doctor

00:41:19,829 --> 00:41:26,009
or so but one last little thing that we

00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:28,499
actually put in and this is like the

00:41:26,009 --> 00:41:30,569
Steve Jobs moment right is it the

00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:32,039
stevedore okay so check this out sure no

00:41:30,569 --> 00:41:35,430
screenshots have always been kind of

00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:45,539
boring let's do screenshot 20 let me do

00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:47,549
a dance that Jeff instead dad dad dad so

00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:49,920
if you didn't get anything else out of

00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:52,799
what Drupal energy does my it's so much

00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:57,140
better you gotta divide here we now got

00:41:52,799 --> 00:41:59,190
animations inside of our screen shots

00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,930
which I kind of had an idea that would

00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:02,489
forget the biggest applause oh god yeah

00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:06,299
I understand that in my head it's like

00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:08,190
Google a gif file um so this has been

00:42:06,299 --> 00:42:10,140
kind of a journey we have been on I've

00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:13,289
been on this this task like six years I

00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:16,739
do kind of want to send out a ton of

00:42:13,289 --> 00:42:18,989
love to these guys Jen Lamson who is now

00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:20,999
I've been joking about calling her the

00:42:18,989 --> 00:42:22,349
trader which I figured out in the states

00:42:20,999 --> 00:42:24,269
like pretty much cannot do that because

00:42:22,349 --> 00:42:28,829
people think I would mend it seriously

00:42:24,269 --> 00:42:30,089
that's not really true no we have a we

00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:31,890
have a ton of people here who've been

00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:33,710
hopping out but I've been listening to

00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:36,680
me again moaning for so

00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:40,040
many years I'm still I'm still kind of

00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:42,500
how come they could even take this crap

00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:44,690
for me these yelling and moaning and

00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:46,099
being angry about everything I actually

00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:47,630
want to give a shout out to these people

00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:56,000
tests they've been doing a tremendous

00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:58,070
work and getting this stuff done here's

00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,660
and here's the thing by the way we

00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:01,220
really need and this is where I'm need

00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,770
to figure out how to get no new people

00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:06,320
in how many you have read about the

00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:08,270
First World War how you attacked you

00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:10,040
know you're laying down the changes and

00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:11,720
then you bond over them and you want

00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,250
direct you to a target you just get shut

00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,990
down that's how we've been doing

00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:17,750
developing tweaked for years because

00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:23,000
that's how of rain words and we need

00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:25,250
more bodies for the slaughter I mean

00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,070
since I'm the pretty much the only one

00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:30,710
still standing from three years ago it

00:43:28,070 --> 00:43:33,920
is kind of a solar it is hard tedious

00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:36,589
work it requires a ton of time it

00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,420
requires a ton of dedication a lot of it

00:43:36,589 --> 00:43:43,430
is not fun a lot of these discussions

00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:44,750
takes forever come join now so so exit

00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:46,339
edgeley what we need here we really

00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:48,290
really really need one thing we need

00:43:46,339 --> 00:43:50,960
people to begin to build base themes and

00:43:48,290 --> 00:43:52,700
test this stuff download Drupal 8 begin

00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,560
to test this figure out how base team

00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:56,660
works figure out how the template looks

00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:58,190
figuring out if the name organisation

00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,260
the final aim organization we did inside

00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:02,839
of classy if that is completely

00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:04,609
up all it's actually really good I think

00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:06,109
it's really good almost because not

00:44:04,609 --> 00:44:08,240
everybody was agreeing with me so

00:44:06,109 --> 00:44:11,000
there's a compromise has done but we

00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,099
have not tested it besides of the five

00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:15,619
geeks yelling at each other and an issue

00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:17,180
of you for three weeks these things we

00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:20,119
need to get tested because here's the

00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:22,280
thing when we released google age you

00:44:20,119 --> 00:44:25,730
know it's five and a half years since we

00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:27,740
released google 7 and i know that i said

00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:29,420
i would take all the blame i'm not going

00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:30,920
to take a storm for the next five

00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:32,810
years because we named the file

00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:34,730
something wrong somewhere and because

00:44:32,810 --> 00:44:37,359
none of you lazy bastards didn't want to

00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:39,800
test it before we came out with Drupal 8

00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:42,920
so actually we need I mean I personally

00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:45,589
our whole team really needs this help we

00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,830
need fresh eyes into the theme because

00:44:45,589 --> 00:44:48,780
the old google 8 is not really

00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:51,900
 and if anybody is likewise not

00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:53,280
released yet law as far as I know it's

00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:55,140
not a boss who have change the steam

00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:56,580
system it has ever gotten as much as one

00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:58,650
dollar for this work we have been doing

00:44:56,580 --> 00:45:00,570
a lot of us as freelancers doing in our

00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:01,950
spare time or whenever that was a client

00:45:00,570 --> 00:45:04,020
with like paying me enough money right

00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:06,630
oh yeah now I can take out the month of

00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:08,730
my life again and trying to clean up the

00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:11,720
note IDs oh yeah by the way we removed

00:45:08,730 --> 00:45:13,890
all the IDS as welcome to recall because

00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:15,150
those things but here's the beautiful

00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:16,140
thing we don't even have to think about

00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:18,300
that anymore if you don't like what

00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:20,400
google called it you copy class and say

00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:21,930
 you Jule here's my class you

00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,500
instead so you can know about these

00:45:21,930 --> 00:45:28,020
things um last thing is a couple of

00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:29,850
sessions that you should really know

00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:34,080
about if you want to hear more of the

00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:35,520
story of how I fought developers for

00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,840
years and how you actually raised an

00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,880
army to do these kind of things I'm

00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:41,880
going to be down at the Google the Watts

00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,980

plate stuff the thing is all a lot of it

00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:52,350
is already outdated which is a little

00:45:49,230 --> 00:45:54,960
bit set it could read the month and a

00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:57,090
half ago that's just how it is um if you

00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,370

00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:15,130
actually if it's good if it's bad this

00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:16,570
is a whole new session I'm testing a new

00:49:15,130 --> 00:49:19,030
format and stuff so that's been good I

00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:23,230
actually think we do have a little bit

00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:25,120
of time for questions nope anybody have

00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:28,150
questions I like more than shut the

00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:39,880
up i want to get lunch oh there's a

00:49:28,150 --> 00:49:41,710
question ha mmm what so what is the

00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:43,600
biggest issue right now we're not out of

00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:45,250
olive oil my biggest issue is the

00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,410
JavaScript separation which is not done

00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:51,550
yet because that will mean that we are

00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:54,070
still like hunting in like we're still

00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:56,890
depending on what Google does that's my

00:49:54,070 --> 00:49:59,590
biggest issue I know that their force

00:49:56,890 --> 00:50:01,690
have another issue and so there's like

00:49:59,590 --> 00:50:03,310
but that's in because that the

00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:11,280
conceptual level that's like the real

00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:11,280
big problem alright yeah at what

00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:22,790
I have a how about you come and play

00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,050
with us so you can figure that out as

00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:26,570
it's one of the things we have not

00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:27,890
really hammered on yet because it's just

00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:30,580
been getting all the rest of this stuff

00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:32,120
done but I can see we have a volunteer

00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:37,850
that'sthat's actually that's how

00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:39,200
development works by the way Oh exactly

00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:40,790

00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,500
got a company who actually makes money

00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:44,180
and ruble and you actually think that

00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:46,370
