Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Translating Success In Drupal 8: The Manhattan Associates Story
Publication date: 2015-05-13
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	In this session we will explore the business factors and decisions that lead Mediacurrent, Lingotek and Manhattan Associates to partner together and launch one of the first fully translated Enterprise Drupal 8 websites in the world. Co-presented by members of the Mediacurrent and Lingotek teams, we will highlight the reasons why Manhattan Associates chose to be an early adopter of Drupal 8, and how Drupal 8’s core functionality allowed them to execute on their Digital and Redesign strategy with mitigated risk and big savings over the long term.

The session will cover in detail how Mediacurrent and Lingotek’s unique expertise opened up the possibility of early adoption for Manhattan Associates. We will explore solutions to the problems encountered during the planning and architectural design process and lessons learned during development and implementation. Problems resolved include:


Risk management: Accounting for the risk of Drupal 8 architectural changes during development.

Proving the ROI of a complicated Drupal 8 build with Manhattan Associates stakeholders.

Managing scope during the discovery and planning phases to ensure timeline and development estimate success.


We will share exactly what you need to know to decide if your business is ready for Drupal 8.  We will show how to take advantage of its world class content publishing and translation capabilities as the platform for your current and future needs.

head start so hello thank you for coming

00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:10,530
to translating success in Drupal 8 the

00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:12,059
manhattan associates story i am james

00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,460
rutherford I'm director of client

00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,960
services at media current and I've been

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,900
working with Drupal for about eight

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,930
years spent the last almost five years

00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,820
at media current as a developer and then

00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:26,099
a lead developer and architect and then

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:29,519
finally as director of client services

00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:32,160
now so my role at media current at this

00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,480
point is to engage with our clients

00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,579
really understand what their business

00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,719
needs are and make sure that the

00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,559
projects that we're working with them

00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,660
are delivered on time and on budget you

00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,430
guys can follow me at james rutherford

00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,860
on twitter and I tweet a lot about

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,340
Drupal and about client services issues

00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,020
and also tweet a lot about Boston sports

00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,899
so hopefully you're interested in that

00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,000
so a little bit about media current

00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:58,949
media current is a full-service digital

00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,080
agency that specializes in Drupal or

00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:06,510
based in Atlanta and have about 50 plus

00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,850
employees ranging from a full

00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,220
development team to pull design and

00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,070
theming team as well as a digital

00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,720
strategy team so media current is going

00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,900
to strive to work with our clients and

00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,850
be that full service partner that allows

00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,250
them to excel in any era of a project

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,960
whether it's planning and understanding

00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,360
how to execute a successful business

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,579
strategy to actually doing the back-end

00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,570
development and making sure that you're

00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:35,250
building drupal correctly there also a

00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,829
lot of fun to work for and we have a

00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,590
booth down in 219 if you guys want to

00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:44,179
come by and see us we have

00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:48,049
the bags tossing thing so let's talk

00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:49,670
about our agenda as the title alludes to

00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:52,520
this is the story of manhattan

00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:54,350
associates and drupal and them

00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,670
implementing drupal 8 which is the

00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,840
project that we're in the middle of with

00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,640
them right now and that should be

00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,610
launching at the end of this week on

00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,109
friday so we're going to talk a little

00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:05,500
bit about the back story of how

00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:10,099
manhattan associates chose drupal and

00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:11,959
how they how they went from working with

00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:13,970
drupal previously to deciding to move to

00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,590
a drupal 8 site for their current

00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,690
platform and then what were the lessons

00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:19,310
learned and the challenges of actually

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,920
implementing Drupal 8 at this point in

00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,239
the data life cycle and then we're also

00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,129
going to take a deep dive into the

00:02:23,239 --> 00:02:26,599
translation component of Drupal 8 that's

00:02:25,129 --> 00:02:28,760
really one of the killer features in

00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:31,730
core and it's one of the main reasons

00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,500
why manhattan associates decided to move

00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:35,299
to drupal 8 which we'll get into in a

00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:36,410
little bit when we go to the translation

00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:40,310
component i'm going to be handing off to

00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:42,200
calvin from lingotek they are a partner

00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:44,930
of media currents and really the experts

00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,370
in translation in the triple space so

00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:53,380
and then at the end we should have time

00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:55,459
for QA so let's go back in time to 2011

00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,650
manhattan associates that just launched

00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:01,549
a brand new Drupal 6 site fully

00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:03,709
translated in six languages featured

00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:05,030
multi-domain publishing capability so

00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:06,680
they could have content that was

00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:08,239
translated in several languages and

00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,489
published it out to like a sub site or a

00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,870
brochure site really a great marketing

00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:16,579
tool for their team and we also featured

00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:18,260
crm integration on all of their assets

00:03:16,579 --> 00:03:19,910
so that they could do custom eloquent

00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,880
campaigns for different assets and

00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:24,470
publish those in different languages so

00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:26,630
really really powerful Drupal 6 site

00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:29,359
built sort of right at the end of the

00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:31,370
life cycle of Drupal 6 Drupal 7 had

00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:35,209
really just launched a few months before

00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:36,799
we launched a site we had a great

00:03:35,209 --> 00:03:38,419
project great successful launch with

00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,799
them and so manhattan associates and

00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:41,569
media current really enter into a

00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:43,190
long-term partnership at this point we

00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:45,340
moved into support phase with them and

00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:47,110
did a couple of small projects and then

00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,420
you know once they were ready for their

00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:52,900
internal team to support Drupal we

00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:56,709
parted as friends so that's the history

00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:59,530
now let's move forward to 2014 Drupal in

00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:01,060
2014 is an incredible platform you guys

00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,040
have all hopefully watched the

00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,239
innovation Drupal 7 and watched it

00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,530
really take over the enterprise space

00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,360
for open source and unfortunate side

00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:12,970
effect of Drupal 7 taking off through

00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,530
the stratosphere is that Drupal 6 really

00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:18,040
innovation Drupal 6 kind of stopped

00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:19,720
slowed down and by 2014 it's really hard

00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,060
to do new things and solve new problems

00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:25,450
in Drupal 6 without paying a really high

00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,100
development costs so just to recap

00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:31,540
Drupal 6 was actually launched back in

00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:33,280
two thousand eight so by 2014 were

00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:37,000
almost eight years in the life cycle of

00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:39,700
Drupal 6 and at the time that we were

00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,860
launching their Drupal 6 I the Drupal 7

00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,300
community wasn't really robust enough

00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:45,699
for mature enough for us to make that

00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,110
decision so Manhattan really got a great

00:04:45,699 --> 00:04:49,060
website out of it but it was unfortunate

00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:52,539
that they got in at the very end of the

00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:54,130
life cycle triple six so from the

00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:55,840
Manhattans team their web team

00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:57,760
perspective they recognize that they

00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,260
need to upgrade they have a good tool

00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,330
set that served them for a while but

00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:03,550
they want to go fully responsive they

00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:06,250
want to serve to all different devices

00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:07,990
they want improved translation tools and

00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:09,280
they're you know very involved in the

00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:10,960
Drupal community they see all these

00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,970
great innovations in Drupal 7 and they

00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,930
want to use them but they're hamstrung

00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:19,210
by being stuck on six so you know

00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,500
Manhattan is convinced that they're

00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,330
ready to upgrade they know that they

00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,460
have to but how do they choose between

00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:26,139
Drupal 7 or Drupal 8 I think it's a lot

00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,400
of question that maybe people in this

00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:28,840
room are asking that might be why you're

00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,400
in this session or something that is

00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:32,020
being talked about at the con all the

00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,310
time and that's really what we're going

00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,960
to try to highlight here is what are the

00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:37,690
decisions that manhattan associates made

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,310
and how did media current system working

00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:41,020
through that due diligence in order to

00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,479
to choose eight and feel comfortable

00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:46,180
with that decision so a little bit more

00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:49,720
background we're at drupalcon austin

00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,610
last year and manhattan usually sends

00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,260
their team out to drupal common to

00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,940
conferences and so we'd see them and

00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,470
catch up with them all the time and they

00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,970
came out to our after party

00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,920
and really engage with us and said hey

00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,020
guys you know our internal team has

00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:05,210
decided that Drupal 8 is what we want

00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:08,870
you know we've done some local builds we

00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:10,550
love the infrastructure it's amazing you

00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:12,530
guys are the drupal experts tell us can

00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,370
we go to Drupal 8 what what are the

00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:17,090
problems that were going to have going

00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:19,220
to triple-a and you know what do we need

00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,170
to do to prepare for a project in Drupal

00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,270
8 and then finally you know the really

00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:24,830
big question is when is Drupal 8 going

00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,570
to be released this is a full year ago

00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:28,130
at awesome and so here we are today and

00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,870
you guys are asking when is really going

00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:32,270
to be released everybody it's kind of

00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,520
interested in how do we answer that

00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:36,440
question the more important aspect of

00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,910
this question is you know for Manhattan

00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,340
and for media current to be able to move

00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,780
forward is do we have to know when

00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,520
Drupal 8 is going to be released in

00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,950
order to do a successful project we

00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,480
already know that Drupal 6 has reached

00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:49,220
the end of its life cycle and its

00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:51,350
usability for that team so do they even

00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,390
have the ability to wait even if they

00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:55,700
knew a concrete deadline this is when 8

00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:57,800
is coming out can they wait that long so

00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,200
we needed a plan that would allow us to

00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,970
move forward looking towards Drupal 8

00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,800
recognizing that we wanted to build for

00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:06,050
Drupal 8 but also recognized in reality

00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,610
that Drupal 8 might not be finished you

00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,860
know the community has committed to

00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:11,720
building Drupal 8 as a platform that

00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:15,020
will be done when it's done and not

00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,760
setting an arbitrary deadline so as we

00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:19,790
worked with Manhattan you know our plan

00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,590
was to make sure that Drupal 8 core

00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:24,169
could do what we needed to do for

00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:25,610
Manhattan make sure that we had a good

00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:27,650
fit there because we knew from prior

00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:30,140
experience that even if the Drupal 8

00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:32,990
quote sorry even if Drupal 8 was

00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:34,490
released the likelihood of the control

00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:36,320
community being caught up to that point

00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,150
and actually being usable was extremely

00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:40,430
low right so we can plan for Drupal 8 we

00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:42,410
can move forward but we can't be betting

00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:45,200
on a lot of contributed modules to be

00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:47,090
there for us so we took a look at core

00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,950
and we recognize that you know right out

00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:50,750
of the box we get internationalization

00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:52,760
which is the killer feature and it's

00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:54,560
baked into eight the initiative is

00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,750
pretty much complete and it's extremely

00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,610
powerful we get the ability for them to

00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,919
do responsive teaming with their own

00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:02,690
internal resources using twig and the

00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:04,130
ability to grow and change layouts on

00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:06,680
the site in a way that is sustainable

00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,190
and solves their goal of making sure

00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,870
that they're responsive all the time

00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,610
and then we solved that problem that

00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:13,110
they've had since they adopted Drupal 6

00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,290
is that they want to be on the forefront

00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:19,320
of CMS Innovation so Drupal 8 looks like

00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:21,450
a good fit from that perspective now we

00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,860
still have to move forward we have to do

00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,450
a discovery we have to look at their

00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:26,760
architecture and actually come up with a

00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:28,230
proposal but we don't know when drew

00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,760
plates coming out so the way that we

00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,560
solve that problem was to make sure that

00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,360
the architecture that we were working on

00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,630
with them the way that we design the ia

00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,940
and the solutions that we were providing

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,349
could all matchup in Drupal 7 so if we

00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,360
get to the end of this process we have a

00:08:40,349 --> 00:08:43,919
great design we have a great new digital

00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,290
strategy we have a great new information

00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,510
architecture and Drupal 8 is still eight

00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,160
months away nine months away we have the

00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:51,360
ability to say okay you know it would

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,890
have been nice to go to eight there was

00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,630
a lot of pluses we go into hate but it's

00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,640
okay if we go to seven seven is still

00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:58,440
going to be a robust platform and we can

00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,500
move forward and they felt comfortable

00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:03,750
that plan as comfortable as we did so we

00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,900
went ahead and started a design and

00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:09,690
discovery project back in May 2014 it's

00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,950
about two to three months and you know

00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,290
we worked really closely with Manhattan

00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,790
to figure out what their Drupal II

00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:16,110
website is going to look like and build

00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:19,140
an architecture that could actually

00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:20,700
launch assuming that it was ready at the

00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,040
time of the time that we finished

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,410
discovery it was key for us to make sure

00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,540
that we restrained ourselves with scope

00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:29,160
I mean anytime you get a new toy the

00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,200
idea is to solve every single problem

00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,090
that you've ever wanted to solve and we

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,290
can do this now we can do that and you

00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,120
know we really worked together with

00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:37,530
their stakeholders to say let's rain

00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:39,330
that in let's make sure that we're

00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:41,100
solving your core business needs so that

00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:43,500
we don't add a lot of unnecessary risk

00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,440
28 and we actually have a timeline

00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,180
that's achievable and then finally you

00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,370
know as part of the discovery process we

00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:53,160
were able to really dive in and

00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:55,620
understand you know what is the level of

00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,660
effort to get Drupal 8 ready for

00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,070
Manhattan which controls are the ones

00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:00,420
that are out there do we actually need

00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,190
and how much work will it take for us to

00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:04,770
get them fully ready and working with

00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:06,330
this system and can we do a real

00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,030
estimate that will put a real price on

00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:12,839
on this and understand the risk based on

00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:14,970
our timeline and on the estimate during

00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:18,089
this process which stretched into

00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:20,310
November of 2014 we got some great news

00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:21,540
drupal 8 beta was announced in october

00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:23,940
this is something that our team was

00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,430
looking forward to happening with Drupal

00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,230
8 beta being announced we knew what the

00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:29,790
core feature set was going to be at

00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:31,620
least from the standpoint that API is

00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,330
had pretty much gelled there really

00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:35,460
wasn't going to be too many more core

00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,900
structural changes and we really had a

00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,580
good idea of what Drupal 8 would look

00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:40,290
like it launched as far as what we

00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,450
imagined or hoped it would look like and

00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:44,910
what we were actually going to be

00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:46,860
launching with and so from our point of

00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:49,470
view the site that we needed to launch

00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,420
for manhattan associates we needed views

00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,330
we needed internationalization and we

00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,620
needed TMI to be rock solid and at the

00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,210
time that data was announced those

00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,790
systems were far enough along for us to

00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:03,750
feel comfortable with moving forward

00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:06,420
with a proposal so just to recap we

00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:08,400
spent the last year planning and trying

00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,350
to find a way to make Drupal 8 work for

00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,600
manhattan associates trying to do in a

00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:14,339
way that is actually you know not a

00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,279
pie-in-the-sky endeavor in a way that

00:11:14,339 --> 00:11:19,250
has low risk and and you know allows

00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,420
them to be early adopters without

00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:24,660
concern that you know we launched on the

00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:26,670
website falls over so we complete

00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:28,920
planning and deliver a proposal to them

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,089
in early January of this year which is

00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,580
right around the time line that we had

00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:36,240
wanted they had a or they have a mid may

00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:37,740
launch unfortunately it wasn't good

00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,330
enough so we have been working very

00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,920
closely with their web team and their

00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:42,900
marketing team and and the people that

00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,850
we had these long-term relationship with

00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,320
and we gave them what we thought was a

00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,730
great proposal but when they turn around

00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,040
and presented that to the leadership

00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:52,530
team the leadership team had major

00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:55,290
concerns they we had not done enough to

00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:56,700
let them understand you know why is it

00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:58,530
important to spend this much money to go

00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,970
to Jubilee right now and how are you

00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,560
going to mitigate the risk manhattan

00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,570
associates is a enterprise level

00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,250
software company and the idea that their

00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,990
new CMS was going to be based on a beta

00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:09,600
release was something that you know a

00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:12,930
lot of the leadership team was you know

00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:16,709
rightfully so sort of concerned about so

00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:19,920
we had to work immediately in order to

00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:21,600
alleviate this roadblock and and you

00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,100
know sort of help justify our decision

00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,330
and then also do so in a way that

00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,390
allowed us to actually make the

00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:28,860
proposals projected launch day right we

00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:31,560
couldn't sit there forever and try to

00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,250
figure out how to mitigate this issue so

00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,680
the first thing we did was

00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,970
do a cost comparison with Drupal 7 and

00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,830
we went through that whole exercise that

00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:40,240
we had talked about previously and gave

00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,770
them an estimate based on hey if you

00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,060
guys do seven right now this is what

00:12:41,770 --> 00:12:46,090
you're going to see and give them a

00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:50,230
billet of rinses between seven and eight

00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:52,150
at this point that took a little bit of

00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,560
work on both sides obviously to

00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:56,070
understand what the seven aspect of it

00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:58,660
was and then you know we still wanted to

00:12:56,070 --> 00:13:01,000
reduce the budget further for Drupal 8

00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,290
in order to say if budget is really an

00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,790
issue right now if you're not willing to

00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,790
spend this much to get to a what can we

00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:08,740
do to make that happen so we worked with

00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:11,290
Manhattan cut some scope and then we

00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:14,350
also reorganized our project around an

00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:16,990
MVP but with reduced risk so the MVP

00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,970
really was what exactly do we need from

00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:20,590
core triple-a and what's the minimum

00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:23,320
amount of controls that we can use to

00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:25,060
get there well with the buy-in from

00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,680
Manhattan's team were able to reduce the

00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:29,410
budget to within what the leadership

00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,450
group felt was worthwhile on spending on

00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:32,950
Drupal 8 and move forward and then at

00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:35,350
the same time we had to show you know

00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:37,900
what is the ROI of moving to Drupal 8

00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:39,130
right now over staying on seven one of

00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,560
the major factors that we talked about

00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:44,890
was you know do you want to pay for

00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:46,660
going through the move to Drupal 8 3 or

00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:49,660
4 years from now so we adopt seven now

00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:51,280
and eight releases becomes stable and

00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,630
then becomes the center of innovation if

00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,250
you're going to keep up with that

00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:57,040
innovation do you want to switch CMS's

00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,660
again and if that cost which is

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,550
hopefully reduce right because Drupal as

00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:03,040
a community is trying to learn from the

00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:04,120
pain of further migrations but there's

00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,370
also the hidden cost of your

00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,839
organizational costs right if you in

00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,910
three years have to move from seven to

00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:11,170
eight then that's the time that your CMS

00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:13,030
team and your leadership team is

00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:14,050
spending planning that instead of doing

00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:16,920
what they should be doing which is

00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:20,050
executing on their digital strategy so

00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:23,170
by demonstrating a cost savings there

00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:25,420
and going early and you know continuing

00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:27,790
to educate them on the Drupal model of

00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,350
how the contributed works and and where

00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,820
innovation happens in control we were

00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:33,640
able to demonstrate the ROI to their

00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:35,410
leadership and then I think the hardest

00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,000
tasks that we had to do was demonstrate

00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:38,860
that we had an expert level

00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,020
understanding of risk right that's a big

00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,790
unknown with Drupal 8 there is so much

00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:44,680
unknowns even in beta right now we could

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:46,420
see architectural changes that will

00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,160
cause your data to change or

00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:50,529
key features that you expected to be

00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,060
able to work with to work differently so

00:14:50,529 --> 00:14:54,070
how do we understand that risk and

00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,709
provide a clear roadmap that they can

00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:58,600
feel comfortable moving forward with

00:14:55,709 --> 00:15:00,399
well the very first thing we did was you

00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,800
know do a real analysis of where drupal

00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,570
8 was we'd open to the issue queue and

00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,980
looked at you know how many critical

00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:09,010
issues do we have right now for this

00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:11,050
beta and what's the velocity a critical

00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:13,660
issue over time right if we look back in

00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:15,639
december of last year there was 110

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,870
critical issues in the suq we move

00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:18,850
forward to the time we're having this

00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:21,760
conversation in january we're down to 72

00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:23,440
critical issues so you know moving

00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,570
forward two weeks later we expect that

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,410
to continue we talked about how with the

00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:30,910
API is gelling that you know development

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,800
momentum would continue on Drupal as

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,720
well and then finally we took a dive

00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,420
into those actual issues and said what

00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,850
are these issues mean to your project

00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:42,910
how do they actually affect us so of

00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:43,660
those I think we said 72 issues at the

00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,940
time that we're having this conversation

00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:48,550
we will determine that fifty three of

00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,870
them were affecting the actual core

00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,810
components that we wanted to use in

00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:54,940
triple-a and of those 53 only 22 of the

00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:56,230
more actual bugs so as part of our

00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:58,360
proposal to them and as part of our

00:15:56,230 --> 00:16:00,640
justification we went through that list

00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:03,010
of 22 and show them how those were you

00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,600
know we could mitigate those as part of

00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:07,329
the risk analysis that we had done a

00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:08,860
great example is a bug in the core menu

00:16:07,329 --> 00:16:11,140
system that would mean that updating

00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,790
menu items post-launch if which is a

00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,529
giant if that hadn't been addressed by

00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:16,089
the time that we had to launch you know

00:16:14,529 --> 00:16:18,010
how would they maintain the menu and we

00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:19,750
were able to demonstrate that their team

00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,100
had the programmatic expertise and a

00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:23,470
partner media cart that would allow them

00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,360
to do that through you know fairly easy

00:16:23,470 --> 00:16:26,680
code deployments so addressing each of

00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,570
those issues showing that we had planned

00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,610
from them and that's showing them where

00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:32,709
in the budget we had estimated for those

00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:34,149
tasks instead of just saying you know

00:16:32,709 --> 00:16:36,220
here's a pile of money and we hope that

00:16:34,149 --> 00:16:39,310
we don't run out of it I think really

00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:42,579
was what helped to sway the leadership

00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:45,069
team at Manhattan so what is that all

00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:46,540
add up to january thirtieth i got an

00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:48,880
email from one of the key stakeholders

00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:50,230
stakeholders at manhattan saying hey we

00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,389
you know we've got the green light we're

00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:53,740
moving forward and i took a screenshot

00:16:52,389 --> 00:16:56,440
of it because it was such a great email

00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,190
to get but this is us finding out that

00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,850
we're doing our first enterprise level

00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:03,620
Drupal 8 site so next we're going to

00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:05,260
talk about how to build an entire

00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,730
enterprise Drupal 8 site in three months

00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:09,439
which is really could be like three or

00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,310
four sessions and it's hopefully some of

00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,660
the stuff that you guys have been

00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:13,400
getting in the other session so what I'm

00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,079
actually going to do here is stay pretty

00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,670
high level and we can dive into some of

00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:18,949
that in the QA but we'll talk a little

00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:20,959
bit more about some of the leadership

00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:23,740
challenges with doing enterprise your

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:25,730
boy so we had an extremely tight

00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,470
deadline if you remember we actually

00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:30,470
lost the whole first month of January

00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,790
working with Manhattan to help them you

00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:34,190
know make that internal cultural

00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:36,620
decision to bet on Drupal 8 so now we're

00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:38,900
looking at februari to middle of May to

00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:40,850
execute on the project the way we did

00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,590
that was by you know continuing to

00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,670
leverage our partnership with Manhattan

00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,710
we've been working with them for over

00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:47,870
four years we know their team members we

00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,270
know what they're capable of they know

00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:52,100
what we're capable of so we divided the

00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,900
project up into three different teams we

00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,540
had one team working independently on

00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,770
the controls that needed to be upgraded

00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,840
allowing them to work in a vacuum and

00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:03,080
really just work against what the latest

00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:05,840
beta release of Drupal 8 was and then we

00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:07,490
had our other media current team working

00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,620
on the actual site build building out

00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:11,360
the theme building out the more

00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:13,010
complicated aspects of the configuration

00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,080
and then we worked with Manhattan to

00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:17,570
have them do some of the more basic

00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:20,120
Drupal configuration they found that

00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:22,370
Drupal 8 co I was intuitive and they'd

00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,410
already been using 6 for a long time so

00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:27,440
they were able to build views and build

00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:29,810
content types and move the data entry

00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,070
aspect of it forward so we have all

00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:34,640
three of these teams working in parallel

00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:35,870
and we also before we even got to the

00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,410
point where we kicked off had done

00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:41,180
preparation so Manhattan's team has been

00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:42,860
working with Drupal 8 to vet it for over

00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:45,650
a year testing building views testing

00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:47,060
building content types etc and media

00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:49,730
current committed our entire development

00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:52,400
team to Drupal 8 in symfony2 training

00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:55,790
which actually came in handy as we move

00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,810
forward in the project and then we've

00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:59,090
talked about this throughout the whole

00:18:56,810 --> 00:19:01,250
project but we budgeted for risk in

00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:02,780
order to say you know we understand as a

00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:06,170
company that there are unknowns in

00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:08,030
Drupal 8 and by budgeting for risk and

00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,610
forecasting for risk making sure that we

00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:11,890
had team members that would be avail

00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,270
well if you know a certain aspect of the

00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:15,070
project hit trouble and we needed the

00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:17,980
scale of team members we were prepared

00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:19,690
to do so you know and I want to

00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:20,980
highlight that budgeting for risk you

00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,450
don't just want to create a big bucket

00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,850
of money that you're hoping we'll cover

00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:27,670
you know what are the deficiencies in

00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:29,830
the planning you have are at all that's

00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:31,600
the recipe for disaster what you want to

00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:33,070
do is that due diligence and make sure

00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,270
that you're prepared to take the time

00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,220
and spend the money to do the due

00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:38,170
diligence to understand how am I

00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:40,090
utilizing Drupal 8 how does it match up

00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:42,220
with my actual business use cases and

00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:44,380
where are the deficiencies in Drupal 8

00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:46,660
right now that we need to mitigate so

00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:49,030
because we were able to do that work you

00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,770
know we were able to have an appropriate

00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:55,540
budget for risk and move forward as

00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:57,100
things got complicated it wasn't all you

00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,780
know easy as I'm painting the picture

00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,280
here hopefully there was a few hard

00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:02,559
lessons learned so i'm going to stay

00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,390
pretty high level but one of the

00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,309
toughest ones for us was that at this

00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,620
point in the life cycle and i think it's

00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:09,760
probably still true right now

00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:12,460
contributed modules are not as far along

00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,280
as we expected we plan to use core as

00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:17,740
heavily as possible but we still needed

00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:20,980
you know to target the correct controls

00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:24,549
and not bacon a totally custom solution

00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:26,530
that as contributor manhattan would have

00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:28,570
to pay then to move on to these contribs

00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:30,970
solutions so we did our due diligence

00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,799
but really when we went to implement a

00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:34,390
lot of these controls we found that they

00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:38,440
either weren't as far along as we expect

00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:40,330
them to be or that you know if a Drupal

00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,980
7 version that module behaves in a way

00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:44,410
that you expected it to behave for a

00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:48,760
long time don't bet that the Drupal 8

00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:50,530
version will work exactly like that we

00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,390
also learned that twig is not a magic

00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:54,549
bullet for those of you that don't know

00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:58,000
twig is the new templating layer and

00:20:54,549 --> 00:20:59,830
Drupal 8 and it's also you know using

00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,180
several other projects it's extremely

00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:04,200
powerful it's a

00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:07,200
according to the front-end developers

00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:09,060
great to work in so it's not really twig

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,950
but twigs integration with Drupal at

00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:13,530
this point lends itself to problems your

00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,240
expectation is that you know all of your

00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,160
data with minimal effort will be there

00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,960
in the theming layer in order to use and

00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:20,910
the reality is is that you'll have to be

00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,560
writing bridges at this point in order

00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:25,200
to do things like to get sub menus to

00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:26,820
show up in your templates so you know

00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,830
that was something that we expected to

00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:30,240
be a little bit easier and had to

00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:33,030
mitigate as as we move through the

00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,700
project and then finally even with all

00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:37,290
the training that we did and even with

00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:39,630
you know an entire staff of expert

00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:42,810
Drupal developers the ramp up speed is a

00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:44,160
factor for new Drupal 8 team members or

00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:46,410
for really anybody at all that's coming

00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,360
into it it's a new platform and the fact

00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:50,070
that it's a rewrite means that your real

00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,780
earning lots of convention and lots of

00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:53,600
little you know sort of veteran things

00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:56,190
that we already know about Drupal 7 and

00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,380
triple six that ultimately end up

00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,580
slowing down that time and making it so

00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,650
that even with training is very

00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,180
difficult to say hey we've got to

00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:05,130
developers over here and we need you

00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,690
know 10 more hours in this project let's

00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:11,160
just throw them at it because they need

00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:14,940
that time to get up to speed okay so

00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:17,010
what we have is a new Drupal 8 website

00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,170
launching for Manhattan on May fifteenth

00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:21,420
with an asterisk because it hasn't

00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:23,130
actually launched yet but we're

00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,810
expecting it to launch it's not my call

00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:27,470
whether or not it launches and we

00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:30,690
manhattan's but look for that on Friday

00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:32,610
I think the big takeaway for anybody

00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:34,410
that is you know endeavoring to move

00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:36,450
down to Drupal 8 right now you know you

00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:37,860
can't wait to get off the block is make

00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:39,840
sure that you can afford to do all of

00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,490
that preliminary research and to match

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,560
up all of your feature set with what's

00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:46,080
actually in Drupal not from like a

00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,330
high-level bullet point but get in get

00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,280
into the issue queue and get your hands

00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:53,700
dirty and make sure that your

00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:55,080
expectations are correct and then the

00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,850
other bullet point that I wanted is that

00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,800
even though this has really been high

00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:01,080
level you know one thing that our team

00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,850
has shared with me is that it's Drupal

00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,500
eights benefits even with the

00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:06,630
difficulties we're having now are pretty

00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:08,400
clear once the developers are up to

00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:11,190
speed they're able to develop

00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:14,070
efficiently and for the most part enjoy

00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:16,020
working in the new framework the same

00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:19,050
with the theme layer the translation

00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,670
functionality is you know another leap

00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:23,130
year ahead of Drupal 7 which already has

00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:24,210
incredibly robust translations so we're

00:23:23,130 --> 00:23:27,690
going to talk about that here in just a

00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:29,460
minute and the improve you I editorial

00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:33,150
experience is something that Manhattan

00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:46,460
has been very happy with so okay thanks

00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:51,260
so Kevin how's everybody doing today

00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:54,330
good how many people here have

00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:57,170
translation needs or they do translation

00:23:54,330 --> 00:24:00,270
when their websites everybody out good

00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:03,600
and everybody is in seven or six six

00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:06,110
seven seven and you guys are looking to

00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,250
move towards eight at some point great

00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:10,950
well we're excited let me just give you

00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:17,550
kind of a high level I'm from link

00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:19,380
attack hold on weird again maybe there

00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:21,540
we go lingotek we call ourselves a

00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:23,940
translation network I'm gonna go through

00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:25,380
these slides really quickly but i'm

00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,600
going to show you the power to translate

00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:30,420
is now inside of drupal drupal actually

00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,790
dribble seven and drupal 8 or have great

00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:36,510
multilingual functionality baked into

00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:38,610
the core and contribs i'll start out by

00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:42,150
you know giving some problems and

00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:44,400
solutions that we help solve and also

00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:48,330
show what the differences are between d7

00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,370
and d8r we appreciate that James and his

00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:52,470
team media current of great partners of

00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:54,210
ours appreciate them allowing to take

00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:56,280
some time here to describe some of the

00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:57,720
stuff today so I'm going to talk about

00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,850
today's challenges with multilingual

00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:02,270
websites I'm going to show you a

00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:05,460
flexible agile solution that's inside of

00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:08,700
Drupal will take a high-level tour of

00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:10,380
how it works currently in seven and then

00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,570
an installation setup to some quick

00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,880
workflows and then we're going to take a

00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:16,590
closer look at d7 and d8 and what the

00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,900
differences are and why we're excited to

00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:20,670
cd8 come out and part of the reason or

00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,620
big part of the reason these guys decide

00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:25,010
to go with the eight

00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:28,820
we'll do some Q&A so the problem we have

00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:32,600
is that you know today's websites are

00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:34,520
highly dynamic and that has a continuous

00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,290
lifecycle of change so you're always

00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,080
updating there's different types of

00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:41,030
content and whatnot and the legacy

00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:44,420
process for translating sorry that's

00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:45,950
really kind of hard to see is is lack

00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,780
seven speed and agility so it's really

00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,430
hard to translate stuff so currently a

00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:51,050
lot of people are copy and pasting stuff

00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:53,720
out and having to send it over to a

00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:55,340
translator they're hooking into you know

00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,800
google translate to do some translation

00:25:55,340 --> 00:26:00,020
and it's just kind of challenging and so

00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:03,800
you have this legacy translation process

00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:05,390
and so why is it what are what are we

00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,040
trying to solve here so if you look at a

00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:09,230
typical project and this is just the

00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,850
translation piece of it you have some

00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:13,010
project manager stuff and some web

00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:17,000
administrative stuff but it's identify

00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:18,800
content new pages edit pages you know

00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,809
download the pages export them as either

00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:24,260
p 0 files or X lift or something like

00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:27,440
that and most translation companies that

00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:29,900
you've talked to only do one box of this

00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,270
and so you have all of these steps in a

00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:34,040
translation agency or what's called a

00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:35,809
language service provider is only going

00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,150
to do the translation part of this and

00:26:35,809 --> 00:26:41,870
so what our software does is it starts

00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:44,240
to take you know parts of the system and

00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:45,710
well actually when we go back into this

00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,610
when you tie this by how many languages

00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:52,760
number of pages you know words per page

00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:56,030
you know how evolved the process is time

00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:58,190
zones steps in the process it starts to

00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:59,960
get kind of unwieldy and so you know

00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:01,820
even ourselves we have a 500 page

00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,440
website we're in 10 languages that makes

00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,440
five thousand pages so it's a lot of

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,660
content right you have to keep track of

00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,070
addition so it's inefficient man-hours

00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,140
of able to keep up with the pace of the

00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:14,690
change and how and the volume that

00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:16,670
you're looking at so there's too many

00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:17,990
steps if it's manual just to even keep

00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:19,220
track of I mean we have a lot of clients

00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:22,700
you see they're taking care of this

00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:23,750
stuff in spreadsheets and Google Docs

00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,720
and that kind of stuff is just kind of

00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:28,760
crazy there's not enough of automation

00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:31,100
in the process and so what we do is we

00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,740
provide a flexible solution allows you

00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:34,880
to automate for the managing all of

00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:38,020
these workflow

00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:42,200
and saves you time money mistakes and

00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:44,150
and makes the process much quicker so

00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,070
how does it work in our particular case

00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:48,860
we have your content your website in

00:27:46,070 --> 00:27:51,500
Drupal we have a module lingotek module

00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:54,290
that you can download on drupal.org that

00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:56,030
identifies or helps identify the content

00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:59,030
you want to translate that stuff is

00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:01,280
pushed up into our translation our

00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:02,390
cloud-based translation network you can

00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,530
run through different workflows and i'll

00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:05,090
go if the workflow so here in just a

00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:08,990
minute and then when those are done is

00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:10,940
published back into into drupal we're

00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:13,520
not replacing the core functionality of

00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:15,770
drupal drupal and all of the controls in

00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,960
seven and eight are really the plumbing

00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:19,730
to make your site multilingual what we

00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,080
do is help to translate that content

00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:23,090
like how do you actually get the content

00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,870
out and translate it and replace it or

00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:30,230
get that back into into the system so

00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:31,520
not all content is the same so some

00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,920
people say oh I have to professionally

00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:36,020
translator I don't we actually have what

00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:37,370
we call content value index where you

00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,800
can actually do different levels of

00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:41,720
translations so some translation or some

00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:44,090
content may only be machine-translated

00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,020
that's super inexpensive to do that it's

00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,240
like point oh three cents a word

00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:48,920
basically you can do community or

00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,690
crowd-sourced translation so if you have

00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:54,140
in country marketing managers or folks

00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:55,220
that can help you translate you can

00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:57,200
actually have them log into the system

00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,700
and do the translation some cases you

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,890
need professional translation or and

00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,390
review so there's just consider these

00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,890
all workflows and you can actually do a

00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:05,930
different combination of these some

00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:07,670
people will actually do machine

00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:09,400
translation and they'll do a post editor

00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:11,750
by a professional or community member

00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,520
our system does a flexible and nothing

00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,690
you can do it based on languages so one

00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,680
language might go through one workflow

00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,750
another language might go through

00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:19,280
another workflow which is really handy

00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:20,860
especially in like 10 languages and a

00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,700
lot of times you have 10 different

00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:24,050
locations that are each have their own

00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,910
offices and they kind of want to control

00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:29,060
content or at least have saying that so

00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:31,280
that's helpful for that as well so all

00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:33,260
of these pieces that you saw in this

00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:36,860
earlier thing are handled actually by

00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:39,500
the module so we automate the process of

00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:40,880
mailing the files or FTP and or emailing

00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,950
the files around

00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,330
and what not so all of these steps

00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:46,160
actually are handled inside of the

00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:48,440
Drupal site inside of the module and

00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,820
then the translation process is handled

00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,000
by the translation management system and

00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:55,610
again those different workflows and then

00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,440
the rest of these pieces are handled by

00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:59,750
the translation management system itself

00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,790
and so what we're eliminating is not the

00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:03,080
actual translation itself in a word by

00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:05,480
word but we're actually eliminating all

00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:08,990
of this this project management or

00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:10,880
webmaster stuff around translation that

00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:12,170
makes it very complicated so as you can

00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,830
see if you can start to eliminate a lot

00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:17,900
of these steps and all of them are

00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:19,970
handled in the system then it makes

00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,200
translation a lot easier so as we're

00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:25,580
trying to do so i'm going to do a quick

00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:27,610
tour of the product itself and this is

00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:30,980
just the power translators inside of

00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:32,720
drupal it's super easy to install we

00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:34,400
recommend if you're going to install it

00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,400
to use ad rush command there are

00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:40,790
dependencies that make in particular

00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:42,290
this is d7 make a multilingual so the

00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:44,690
dress command will actually install all

00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:46,670
those dependencies if you've ever tried

00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:48,350
to install or create a multilingual

00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:50,000
website and d7 it can be challenging

00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:51,710
because there's about five or six

00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,390
controls you have to turn on in a

00:30:51,710 --> 00:30:55,760
certain order and turn on certain

00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:57,170
content types and that kind of stuff we

00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,440
automate all of that in the install

00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:01,760
process so it makes it super easy to do

00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,680
so when you have the modules in you can

00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:06,950
go in and just enable the lingotek

00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,690
module you create an account which is

00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:11,030
the Cal that sends the content up to our

00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:14,450
translation management system just basic

00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:16,340
information you can do your source

00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:17,900
language which is in this case we're

00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,150
showing in English this is actually a

00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:23,240
commerce kickstart distribution that's

00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:25,010
were inside of once you get inside you

00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:28,340
have this translation dashboard that

00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:29,660
shows your content how much if it's been

00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,430
translated if you can see these you know

00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:34,100
there's different languages you can add

00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:36,170
languages you can sync translations it

00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:38,810
gives you a really robust way of seeing

00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:41,450
what is and is not in sync in this kind

00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:44,630
of dashboard of you it's actually very

00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:46,500
easy to tell if content is translated

00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:48,570
and you make a change on a page

00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,950
and Yuri translate that page you only

00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:51,300
have to translate the changes because we

00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:55,800
keep track of those in translation

00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:57,900
memories anyway makes it super easy sink

00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:00,320
the translations in this case we're

00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:02,820
going to just translate the entire

00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,160
website into machine translation this is

00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:07,710
an example in this this is really handy

00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:09,570
just to get an idea of what a your site

00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:10,890
looks like in a different language okay

00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:13,650
so we don't necessarily recommend doing

00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:14,940
all machine translation but you can do

00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:16,860
the machine translation and it certainly

00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:19,320
can show you we've your menus get

00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:21,150
translated and all of that and when

00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:23,610
where you need to to to work on

00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:25,650
different pieces of the product once the

00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:26,940
translation happens of course you have

00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:28,290
this kind of drop down to different

00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:30,180
languages and you can do a language

00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:32,490
switcher wherever you want but you now

00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:34,170
have this English site has now been

00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:36,750
translated into a machine-translated

00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:39,390
site so it's really that simple you can

00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:41,370
you know 5 10 page site or 50 page site

00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:43,830
can be machined translate translate in

00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:45,480
like five or ten minutes it's actually

00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:47,010
pretty fun to watch because it seems

00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,060
like it's almost like magic if the whole

00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:50,970
thing does translate the menus and

00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:55,290
everything they've done a great job now

00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:57,300
if you want to go into into editing you

00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:58,980
can you know send different translation

00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,630
engines we hook into different machine

00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:02,490
machine translation engines if you want

00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:04,170
to use those so we can do like Google

00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,810
and Microsoft and there's a variety of

00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:08,670
paid machine translation engines as part

00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:09,780
of that now you have all these settings

00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:11,070
I'm showing you this you know really

00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,720
quickly but there's you know all these

00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:14,430
settings where you can synchronize stuff

00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,380
you can include source text

00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:18,240
automatically send stuff up for

00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:20,960
translation you can do it manually or

00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,280
automatic you can pick different

00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,900
different engines you can decide to

00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,900
translate your URLs if you're using

00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:35,670
switcher on that but anyway so you know

00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:37,080
switch the page you can also do what we

00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,640
call community or crowdsource

00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,370
translation or this might be some of

00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,900
this an in-country marketing manager

00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:44,880
this is someone obviously was logged in

00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:47,280
and they do have permissions to see this

00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,420
and do the editing but we do a box here

00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,640
that says you know this page has been

00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:52,220
machine-translated and someone can click

00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,570
on the link and it actually brings up

00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:56,520
lingotek workbench it allows them to do

00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:58,080
a translation so this is a post edit of

00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,730
machine translation

00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,149
you can use that with you know your

00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:04,500
crowd or folks are on your team once

00:34:03,149 --> 00:34:06,870
they do the translation and they click

00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:09,240
Save and continue that page is

00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:11,250
automatically API back down and the

00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,080
translations are now live now all

00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:15,599
translations are stored inside of Drupal

00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,040
and we do that for indexing and for

00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,149
search purposes and you obviously for

00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,879
SEO in that you want to make sure that

00:34:18,149 --> 00:34:24,839
those are there so you know the it's not

00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:26,369
like a proxy based server where stuff is

00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:29,730
stored and then someone else's server

00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:31,619
and is not indexable so think of Drupal

00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:33,149
sites are you know highly dynamic pages

00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:35,730
come up with a different content based

00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:37,020
on who's logged in and and that's all

00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:40,260
served up from Drupal and we don't

00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:41,490
replace that functionality at all now if

00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:43,530
you want do professional translation

00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:46,169
this is actually where we start to make

00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:47,879
money or modules free to download and

00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:49,260
free to use we get free machine

00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:51,149
translation just so you can try it out

00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,740
so i recommend you just check it out to

00:34:51,149 --> 00:34:54,359
see how it works for you we also do

00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:56,790
professional translation it's based on

00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:58,980
the content type in words and languages

00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:00,690
so you can click on professional

00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:03,000
translation we give you an estimate

00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:04,859
based on good better best quality of

00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,210
translation and give you an estimate you

00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:07,800
can pay for it and and have that

00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:09,210
professionally translated so it's

00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,920
actually how we make the money once the

00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:12,480
translation is done then the site again

00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,970
API is back and your have and you have

00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,950
that translation so I'm going to jump

00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:22,130
into what the difference are between d7

00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:25,200
and dar the Drupal 7 language Drupal 7

00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:27,240
landscape had a lot of there's a lot of

00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:29,730
trouble spots and most of it's been kind

00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:31,140
of patched and worked around there were

00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,940
many things that were not translatable

00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:36,390
in core and English was not the only

00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:38,220
true source language so in da you

00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:39,900
actually pick your core language when

00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,640
you start so in these seven it assumes

00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:43,680
everybody's English and it starts in

00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,720
English and you can change it but when

00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:50,580
you first start you have to start in

00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:51,980
English so that gets fixed in there but

00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:55,290
when you look at the actual landscape

00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:58,230
you have this huge graph of all of the

00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:01,830
different dependencies to have d7

00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:04,380
workout green ones are in the core and

00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:06,480
then there's contributed modules I know

00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,310
these are too small to look at and this

00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,790
is not by any means of representation of

00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:11,400
every

00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:13,310
but there's just a lot of stuff going on

00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,170
there's a lot of relationships and that

00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:17,970
now with that being said d7 is actually

00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:20,640
still a really good translation and

00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:22,620
multilingual CMS it's we deal with a lot

00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,930
of different ones as a company and it

00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:26,250
actually does handle as messy as this

00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:29,630
may look it actually handles a better

00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:33,060
than most content management system so

00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:36,390
d7 taxonomy translation we have the i18n

00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:38,490
versus entity translation both are young

00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:39,870
both are active and who wins so you have

00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:44,250
to pick which direction you're going to

00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:45,600
do in your translation some have pluses

00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:47,460
and hit some of minuses you can ask

00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:49,140
those in the QA and I can I can have my

00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,210
developer give a little more explanation

00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:52,530
to which witch is which but if you pick

00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:54,240
one and then you want to change it is

00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:56,130
really difficult to change and mid

00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,790
process and so you really have to kind

00:36:56,130 --> 00:37:02,040
of know what you're going to do many

00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:06,930
translations is a source of a lot of

00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:10,320
headaches you know it's kind of hard to

00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:12,120
set up and you know you have this

00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:14,040
language neutral when do you use it when

00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:16,170
do you not use it a lot of times I just

00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,910
ignore it in certain circumstances and

00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:19,110
whatnot so you really have to start to

00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:20,730
understand and do a lot of research to

00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:24,840
figure out which of these which of these

00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:26,910
you want to use so Phil collections is

00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,980
always a favorite of folks to do it's

00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:32,280
easy to you know fun to set up it's easy

00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:35,370
to work with but it's not very friendly

00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,930
with translation and it's very fragile

00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:38,910
and so we have to do actually quite a

00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:41,250
bit of work around in our module to work

00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:45,540
through those issues and filled

00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:48,390
collections is not maintained very

00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:49,770
robustly I mean I think it's there's a

00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:51,960
lot of people use it but not a lot of

00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:54,090
time to spend fixing bugs and stuffing

00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:58,560
there so we have a lot of workarounds

00:37:54,090 --> 00:38:01,860
for that in there so the easiest way to

00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,950
get make your drupal 7 multilingual

00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,870
ready is to use our translation will

00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:09,150
detect translation like I say use the

00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:11,760
following commands it's at this project

00:38:09,150 --> 00:38:14,250
even if you don't use link attack I

00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,330
would suggest using us to set it up

00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:17,900
because it will set up all the

00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:21,230
dependencies automatically through

00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:23,060
command line it'll save hours and a lot

00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:24,050
of headache to figure out what what

00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:26,060
things you have to turn on and off

00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:28,070
there's books written about it you know

00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:30,020
that are 150 pages on how to get this

00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:31,370
set up and we can solve all of that you

00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:34,040
can have it all set up in like five

00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:35,720
minutes so use that just to get make

00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,460
your site multi-link ready and of course

00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:40,310
you can certainly try us out and use the

00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:42,400
free machine translation so let's talk a

00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:46,390
little bit about the Drupal 8 landscape

00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:49,250
really quickly so d8 is a huge

00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:51,760
multilingual effort it's one of the was

00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:56,930
at six main core pieces in it was

00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:59,540
there's 4 right 4 and language interface

00:38:56,930 --> 00:39:02,390
the content and the configure the ones

00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:07,250
that were looking at as the the main

00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:09,830
part parts of that and they've spent a

00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:13,490
lot of time and effort obviously you

00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:15,080
know as his grace is international I

00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:16,490
think it's kind of court his hard it was

00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:19,100
interesting to see this morning I think

00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:21,470
you know internationalisation was in 20

00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:22,670
or 30 and was one of the very first

00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:24,650
things that they've done so it's been a

00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:25,940
corp you know what they've looked at and

00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:30,890
obviously eight they want to take it

00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:32,540
even more deeply so what's interesting

00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:35,330
is when you open up Drupal you actually

00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:37,280
pick a base language and if you guys

00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:38,330
have any ones downloaded d8 and sort of

00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,520
play with it you'll start to see some of

00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:41,780
this stuff but there's no longer the

00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,460
sense that it's an English and you're

00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:44,990
going to and everything's gonna be

00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:48,920
translated you pick the core and then

00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:50,810
once the course started it's now in that

00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:52,790
language now that's a fundamental shift

00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:54,140
to say now everything is in this

00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:56,660
particular language and we're going to

00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:58,190
start from this point it also makes some

00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,230
interesting connections where you're

00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:01,340
translating stuff because in the United

00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,480
States we have a tendency to say

00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,980
everything is in English we're going to

00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,880
translate into another language and

00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,470
actually there's a lot of other

00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,970
languages that now want to translate

00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,990
into English so I might have a French

00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:10,460
side that now I actually want to

00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,110
translate in english or japanese that i

00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:16,940
won't translate in english this makes

00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:21,860
that easier for that to happen the in

00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:26,440
translation interface has the ability to

00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:26,440
set up account settings site information

00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,890
titles and descriptions on the buttons

00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:34,610
and that

00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:39,320
you can go into translations of chimps

00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:41,720
and chumps say here but it makes it

00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:45,790
which is based on entity translation in

00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:48,890
d7 configuration all of these

00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:52,760
configurations have been standardized so

00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:54,590
remember and d7 you could translate text

00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:56,420
so many terms of 24 different ways and

00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:58,670
now it's all done one way so that's all

00:40:56,420 --> 00:41:01,250
been combined the i 18 n and entity

00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:04,100
translation more clearly defined lon zip

00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,990
lines have been drawn so the difference

00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:09,140
between drupal 8 ihn any translation

00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:10,910
those are both contribs I 18 and or

00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,770
entity translation they're now part of

00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:15,470
core so you actually have people that

00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:19,250
are maintaining it at the core level as

00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:20,750
opposed to a side project for folks so

00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:22,790
what is the winner the winner is all of

00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:24,350
us so we've done from d7 which has all

00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:26,660
of these different dependencies in this

00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:31,580
kind of structure to you know very clean

00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:33,110
and easel easy interface now again

00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:35,090
lingotek sits on front of this this is

00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:38,480
the d8 is of the plumbing again for

00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:40,490
multilingual translation and lingotek is

00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,860
the the means of translating that

00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:44,390
content so people come up to us and say

00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:47,330
are you going to go out of business

00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:48,470
Wendy Wendy a comes out and actually no

00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,850
we're not a tech well you know it

00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:51,560
actually expands it makes it more

00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:53,300
prevalent in the community and it's a

00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:58,520
bigger thing and more internationalized

00:41:53,300 --> 00:42:01,070
market so just from our point in

00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:03,380
lingotek we actually do have a d 6 7 and

00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:08,150
8 version we are endeavors and we

00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:10,730
support I think up to beta 6 or 7 10 you

00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:12,290
got to 10 and we're going to have you

00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,610
know Wendy 8 comes out will be a hundred

00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:18,110
percent compatible and feature can

00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:19,610
compare parity to d7 so we do have that

00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:24,560
as a company that's committed towards

00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:27,140
that as well and here's my here's my

00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:29,420
contact information if you want to know

00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:32,630
more about lingotek lingotek calm /

00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:36,220
drupal you can go to dribble org project

00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:38,410
2 / project slouch drupal and download

00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:41,109
six seven or eight on there

00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:43,210
but we're very encouraged by the

00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:45,280
response we've added this conference and

00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:49,660
people coming by I know both of our

00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:54,609
booths and and asking about d8 and

00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:59,250
translation as well so got some time for

00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:59,250
some questions from either side of here

00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,609
one question yeah doesn't microphone you

00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:07,750
can go because they're recording all of

00:43:06,609 --> 00:43:17,230
this if you have a question you go up

00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:20,049
and ask that so are there any pain

00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:23,309
points in content migration from d6 to

00:43:20,049 --> 00:43:23,309
d8 for Manhattan

00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:44,530
you

00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:10,289
I'm in the position of trying to

00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:13,170
convince my boss who makes all the

00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:15,029
decisions to go with Drupal rather than

00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:17,670
some of the other content management

00:44:15,029 --> 00:44:21,509
systems out there and I was wondering if

00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:25,289
you guys particularly with Manhattan had

00:44:21,509 --> 00:44:27,299
explored any of the other CMS's or were

00:44:25,289 --> 00:44:29,400
you pretty much they were sold on Drupal

00:44:27,299 --> 00:44:34,200
you were sold on Drupal and it was just

00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:38,099
seven or eight and if even if not like

00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:40,410
is there any take away that I can bring

00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:43,739
back and say this is why we really need

00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:48,839
to go with Drupal rather than WordPress

00:44:43,739 --> 00:44:50,339
or something yeah so fortunately for us

00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:51,900
we didn't have to make an argument

00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:54,390
against another content management

00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:57,869
system even though you know we had to do

00:44:54,390 --> 00:45:01,380
a lot of work to justify our proposal to

00:44:57,869 --> 00:45:02,579
the leadership at at Manhattan which

00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,779
makes sense something that's the same

00:45:02,579 --> 00:45:05,249
thing you're going through now we had

00:45:03,779 --> 00:45:07,470
the buy-in from the core team that

00:45:05,249 --> 00:45:08,880
Drupal and from the leadership team that

00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:10,319
Drupal was the right way to go

00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,029
regardless of whether or not it was

00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:15,299
seven or eight it was really just

00:45:12,029 --> 00:45:17,130
justifying that you know making the jump

00:45:15,299 --> 00:45:19,650
to eight early because of their deadline

00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:21,569
they had to go to a new platform was the

00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:22,920
right way to move so it was fortunate

00:45:21,569 --> 00:45:24,779
for us that we didn't have to really

00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:26,400
deal with that question but if I'm in

00:45:24,779 --> 00:45:30,650
your shoes i mean i think that the

00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:32,880
absolute killer is that Drupal 8 score

00:45:30,650 --> 00:45:36,630
integration as opposed to it just being

00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,829
a module is is what differentiates it

00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:41,039
from the rest of the open source

00:45:37,829 --> 00:45:43,170
community by the fact that every single

00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:45,960
API and every single aspect of core

00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:48,539
takes the idea of translation as part of

00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,730
its fundamental step I think makes it

00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:55,170
you know an entire class above other

00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:58,019
open source CMS's yes certainly other

00:45:55,170 --> 00:45:59,759
open source CMS is have you know a

00:45:58,019 --> 00:46:02,880
little bit of the d7 problem where you

00:45:59,759 --> 00:46:06,029
have to have extra modules or plugins to

00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:08,160
make the plumbing work so to speak and

00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:10,079
we're pressed for example you know

00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,989
WordPress out of the book out of the box

00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,339
is not multilingual ready and so in that

00:46:12,989 --> 00:46:15,779
case you have to decide whether you're

00:46:14,339 --> 00:46:18,660
going to do multi-site or you're going

00:46:15,779 --> 00:46:19,380
to get a third-party plug-in to to do

00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:21,240
the plumbing

00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:23,130
so Matt and there's a whole security

00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,480
issue that comes along with with

00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:26,569
WordPress there's a lot more security

00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:30,059
holes and issues along that if

00:46:26,569 --> 00:46:33,119
multilingual is the is the kind of a

00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:34,650
gating factor we deal with lots and lots

00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,690
of different content management systems

00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:40,170
and Drupal even Drupal 7 handles it

00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:42,420
better than most if not all on the

00:46:40,170 --> 00:46:44,220
market right now so I'm going to be

00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:47,869
happy to help you make that case with

00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:50,430
your with your boss if you want to do I

00:46:47,869 --> 00:46:55,019
think you either said this or implied

00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:58,890
that there was some sort of system that

00:46:55,019 --> 00:47:00,450
in which so if i have a website and it's

00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:02,460
in five different languages and that

00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:04,049
everything's all translated and suddenly

00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:06,720
i decided i needed to i need to change

00:47:04,049 --> 00:47:10,430
the content on a given page is their

00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:14,759
subsequent like i can for every other

00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:16,319
page or node with that content in a

00:47:14,759 --> 00:47:18,000
different languages they're like the

00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:21,059
revision that's automatically created

00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:24,240
with the notation for what needs to be

00:47:21,059 --> 00:47:25,950
translated subject to you know

00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:28,470
translation and then publication of that

00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:30,720
node you can just wondering how that if

00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:34,559
there's like a waterfall effect where

00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:36,119
I've got my site in place we dive you

00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:37,680
know developed multilingual sites and

00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:39,150
it's like once once you've published a

00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,549
page everything is completely

00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:44,099
independent if you change the content of

00:47:41,549 --> 00:47:45,269
one page I just have to know that I have

00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:48,509
to go to the other page change the

00:47:45,269 --> 00:47:50,640
content to match is there some sort of

00:47:48,509 --> 00:47:53,880
system that lets you know that it has to

00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:56,309
be done for the other translated pages

00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:58,619
so Calvin do you want to take that from

00:47:56,309 --> 00:48:00,750
my home when I take platform perspective

00:47:58,619 --> 00:48:02,630
yeah so in our platform so our

00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:05,250
translation management system and I

00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:08,160
mentioned this and I didn't go into too

00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:09,569
much detail because of time but the the

00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,980
benefit of using a translation

00:48:09,569 --> 00:48:13,529
management system is what we call

00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:15,900
translation memories and translation

00:48:13,529 --> 00:48:18,299
memories are previously translated

00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:21,180
content that has been approved by a

00:48:18,299 --> 00:48:23,730
human so it could be machine-translated

00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:26,099
and then someone post edited and they

00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:29,970
said this is the correct you know

00:48:26,099 --> 00:48:32,790
sentence so to speak when that is stored

00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:33,900
in a memory that becomes a

00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:37,620
have the corpus for that particular

00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:39,720
content on a page and say you have five

00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:41,280
paragraphs and you've written the

00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,650
content you've sent it off and it's been

00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,410
translated and a week later you change

00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:48,660
one paragraph or one sentence you can

00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:51,630
resend that content back up to lingotek

00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:54,540
for translation and we match it against

00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:58,710
the translation memory and we only have

00:48:54,540 --> 00:49:00,630
the differences translated now we call

00:48:58,710 --> 00:49:03,000
that content reuse and recycle so you

00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:04,860
can reuse that content over and over

00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,380
again what that means is you don't have

00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:08,970
to pay for that content all of the

00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:11,220
content to be retranslated only the new

00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:14,220
piece or or have someone do the post

00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:17,610
editing on it if you have content that's

00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:19,110
similar on page to page that actually

00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:21,840
gets picked up too because it's not just

00:49:19,110 --> 00:49:25,200
the page you can match against any page

00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:28,860
in your site and so most marketing sites

00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:31,590
support sites knowledge bases have

00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:33,270
similar content in them right same

00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:35,400
writers are writing them or their copy

00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:37,770
and pasting one to the other if the

00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,480
translation memory has been set you can

00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:41,670
run any page against that translation

00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:45,120
memory and the differences are our cat

00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:46,890
now in the old days you know and before

00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:48,600
we were using translation management

00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:51,150
system you would have to keep track of

00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:54,570
the change so you would say here's the

00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:55,620
page I've made a change and then you

00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:56,730
know put that in some sort of a

00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:58,290
spreadsheet and then send it to the

00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:59,760
translator and the one who came back you

00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:01,590
would have to either replace the content

00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,790
of the entire page into the page where

00:50:01,590 --> 00:50:04,050
you have to remember which sentence it

00:50:02,790 --> 00:50:05,970
is and maybe it's different language you

00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:07,980
don't know how where to place it all of

00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:10,020
that is eliminated so when you see all

00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,790
those steps in the block boxes and you

00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:14,760
say oh how am I eliminating that's what

00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:16,920
the system does is it programmatically

00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:18,690
keeps track of all of that stuff and of

00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,070
those changes that's really where you

00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:22,320
save the time and money so we have

00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:24,660
clients that you will save twenty five

00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:27,150
percent in translation costs because of

00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:28,650
memories and using the system but

00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:30,750
they're actually can translate fifty

00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:33,000
percent faster because of these changes

00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:34,350
and so if you're going to market the

00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,630
product and you can go fifty percent

00:50:34,350 --> 00:50:38,370
earlier than you were planning to you

00:50:36,630 --> 00:50:42,440
can see the kind of the benefits of that

00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:42,440
does that answer your question

00:50:42,729 --> 00:50:48,920
it's a good that's a good question and

00:50:44,869 --> 00:50:50,390
that's a big benefit of what we do with

00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:52,009
the web connecting people from all over

00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:54,829
the world and people being able to come

00:50:52,009 --> 00:50:56,299
to sites and discovery in Alaska is is

00:50:54,829 --> 00:50:57,920
multilingual something that media

00:50:56,299 --> 00:50:59,539
current pushes to your clients

00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,099
prospective clients not just from a

00:50:59,539 --> 00:51:02,749
localization perspective but also from

00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:05,779
an accessibility one of the in terms of

00:51:02,749 --> 00:51:08,719
making the web of better place yeah

00:51:05,779 --> 00:51:10,910
thnkx that's a great question I don't

00:51:08,719 --> 00:51:12,979
like the term push that it's something

00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:15,739
that we try not to push anything on to

00:51:12,979 --> 00:51:18,109
any clients it's really you know

00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:21,619
speaking strictly from a media current

00:51:18,109 --> 00:51:22,940
perspective we have processes that we

00:51:21,619 --> 00:51:24,859
like to work through with clients so

00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:26,809
that essentially what we're doing is

00:51:24,859 --> 00:51:28,670
becoming a partner with you right so

00:51:26,809 --> 00:51:30,079
what that means is we're trying to

00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:31,729
understand what your business problems

00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:34,009
are why you're trying to achieve your

00:51:31,729 --> 00:51:35,900
goals so that any solution that we're

00:51:34,009 --> 00:51:38,209
recommending or working with you on

00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:40,670
really shouldn't feel like a push right

00:51:38,209 --> 00:51:43,039
it should feel like a natural fit if we

00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:46,039
have a client that we feel would benefit

00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:47,900
from internationalization because their

00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:50,089
goals their digital strategy their

00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:52,279
potential market then we're going to try

00:51:50,089 --> 00:51:54,109
to demonstrate them why what this would

00:51:52,279 --> 00:51:56,390
be a great move for you as a company and

00:51:54,109 --> 00:51:59,900
here's how we can do it you know fairly

00:51:56,390 --> 00:52:02,779
painlessly for you to move forward if we

00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:04,130
feel like it doesn't fit not because

00:52:02,779 --> 00:52:05,599
they would have gained some benefits

00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:06,559
from translation but because it doesn't

00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,690
match the budget that they have

00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:11,180
currently or they have bigger issues

00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:12,829
that the budget they have would probably

00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:14,630
you know be better off sitting them then

00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:16,190
in that case will you know kind of

00:52:14,630 --> 00:52:18,680
mention it as this would be an advantage

00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:20,420
for you but probably something that we

00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:22,989
should go in the back log or be type d

00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,989
prioritize

00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:34,910
when you were doing your due diligence

00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:36,410
and your risk management were you able

00:52:34,910 --> 00:52:38,000
to look outside the company if you

00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:39,590
needed the additional resources if you

00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,360
hit a particular problem with Drupal 8

00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:44,050
we're able to find resources that could

00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:46,640
help you or was that putting more

00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:48,440
internal resources into getting your own

00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:50,060
people up to speed even faster or you

00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,700
know how did you manage that risk and

00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:56,900
getting additional resources yeah that's

00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:59,060
great so we didn't plan on working with

00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:01,220
a partner certainly that would have been

00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:03,530
something that you know had the timeline

00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:06,050
called for that and had our own internal

00:53:03,530 --> 00:53:07,130
forecasting made its realize you know we

00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:09,740
know that we need to have these

00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:10,880
personnel and we know that you know we

00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:13,280
just we're not going to be able to have

00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:15,140
it if we get to that point where risk

00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:16,460
becomes reality and we need to ramp up

00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:17,780
the people aren't going to be there then

00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:19,070
that's something that we probably would

00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:22,010
have considered or at least you know

00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:23,960
discuss with Manhattan but you know from

00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:25,820
a forecasting perspective we felt like

00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:27,230
we kept the resources that we need and

00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:29,830
that we prepared the resources that we

00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:32,180
need in order to be able to flex so I

00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:33,500
think it's kind of a case-by-case basis

00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:34,670
right it's always hard to see where

00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:40,220
you're going to be at any point in time

00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:42,440
and so I think we have about time for

00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:47,410
one more question if anybody has one

00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:47,410
more Bob you got a question

00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:55,200
all right well if there are no more

00:53:51,840 --> 00:53:58,260
questions I appreciate your guys time

00:53:55,200 --> 00:54:25,200
today appreciate James and media current

00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:27,180
and appreciate everyone coming to think

00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:30,690
so yeah we're doing an after party

00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:33,690
tonight at city tavern so it's a

00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:35,580
partnership between mediocre and

00:54:33,690 --> 00:54:37,650
lingotek so come out and hang out with

00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:40,800
us and we'll talk translation all night

00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:43,740
if you guys have more quick that's it

00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:45,720
it's from eight to eleven it's at city

00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:50,690
tavern it's about four blocks from here

00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:50,690
Justin okay thanks guys

00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:13,650
