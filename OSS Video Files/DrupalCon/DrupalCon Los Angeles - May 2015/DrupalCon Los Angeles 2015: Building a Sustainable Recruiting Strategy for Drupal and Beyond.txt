Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Building a Sustainable Recruiting Strategy for Drupal and Beyond
Publication date: 2015-05-13
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	A reliable and predictable hiring process comprised of smarter proactive recruiting is the only way a hiring team can pivot with Drupal and our ever-changing industry. That process has to be more than just strong in its inception, it has to be sustainable as well.  How do you do this effectively with little staff or funding? You setup a framework and you decentralize it.

In this session Iâ€™ll share the recruiting strategies that Palantir has used to bring on a motivated, diverse, and highly experienced team. The framework and strategies that we use are not limited to professional services firms. They will work within any institution big or small.

Drupal 8 makes it easier to hire talent with strong front end development or software engineering skills who may have not worked directly with Drupal before. As the needs of our our ecosystem evolve, we have a unique opportunity to broaden the existing Drupal talent pool, bringing fresh ideas and perspectives to our work and enabling us all to be more successful.
