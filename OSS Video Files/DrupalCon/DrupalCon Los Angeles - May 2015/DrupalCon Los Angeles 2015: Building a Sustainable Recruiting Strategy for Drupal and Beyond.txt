Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Building a Sustainable Recruiting Strategy for Drupal and Beyond
Publication date: 2015-05-13
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	A reliable and predictable hiring process comprised of smarter proactive recruiting is the only way a hiring team can pivot with Drupal and our ever-changing industry. That process has to be more than just strong in its inception, it has to be sustainable as well.  How do you do this effectively with little staff or funding? You setup a framework and you decentralize it.

In this session Iâ€™ll share the recruiting strategies that Palantir has used to bring on a motivated, diverse, and highly experienced team. The framework and strategies that we use are not limited to professional services firms. They will work within any institution big or small.

Drupal 8 makes it easier to hire talent with strong front end development or software engineering skills who may have not worked directly with Drupal before. As the needs of our our ecosystem evolve, we have a unique opportunity to broaden the existing Drupal talent pool, bringing fresh ideas and perspectives to our work and enabling us all to be more successful.

well in the meantime I'll certainly

00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,319
introduce myself and hopefully will my

00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,970
slides will show up otherwise i'll i'll

00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:11,670
just have to do some hand gesture to

00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:13,620
show you what's up there this is

00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:15,509
sustainable recruiting building a

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,300
sustainable recruiting strategy for a d8

00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:23,220
and beyond if you were wondering which

00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:26,910
room you're in there we go my name is

00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,619
Colleen Carol I also known as Carol Tron

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:31,859
and the Drupal sphere as well as

00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:35,100
Twitter's and other social medias I've

00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:39,690
actually been in Drupal for roughly

00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:41,219
seven years now and one of the the

00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,540
things that I suppose you should know

00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,270
about me is that I'm incredibly

00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,640
passionate about all things that can be

00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:49,590
sustainable partially driven out of

00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,590
laziness the idea of like trying to

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,120
somewhat replace myself but at the same

00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:56,219
time realizing having been in the web

00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,100
for a very long time that you can't do

00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,750
things yourself forever that you have to

00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,320
build frameworks or systems that can

00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,760
scale beyond just you and so this talk

00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,140
in particular will be about recruiting

00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,710
in some of the lessons that I learned

00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:13,890
over time and put in in place at

00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:19,470
palantir that I think are good lessons

00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:22,950
to share today so the real question is

00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:25,610
why are you here so you know I wouldn't

00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,320
I wouldn't be able to do a sustainable

00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:31,110
session unless I had some kind of garden

00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,549
metaphor and for this it could be that

00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,310
you're here because you're starting

00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,229
fresh and you know the gardener in me

00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,759
says that that looks like cilantro and I

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:40,770
feel like I need to tell you already

00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,890
about the balance of like Sun and shade

00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,299
to make a proper garden there but but

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:47,100
really maybe you're here because it's

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:51,119
this is new to you and you really want

00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,860
to get some some some insight or maybe

00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,290
you're here with a group you're in

00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,060
progress you're starting to to build

00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:00,149
your you're recruiting garden you're

00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,009
hiring garden quite possibly you're here

00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:04,409
to weed out some people and that's also

00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,479
an important part of the process

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,069
or maybe you're here to just straight-up

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,929
compare because you have the most

00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:11,910
beautiful garden in the world and that's

00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:15,150
also ok I want to hear what you have to

00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:16,590
say but there's also there's also this

00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,970
you may be here because you're you're

00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,680
debating whether or not to go with a

00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,709
talent acquisition or if you should do

00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,180
it in-house because of of the burden of

00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,459
the challenges of having to recruit

00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:33,450
talent in in the technology world as we

00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:35,730
do so what is recruitment really it's

00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:37,500
you know it's a lot of things but too

00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:40,129
many of us it's about you know finding

00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,540
the best it's about making connections

00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:44,549
you know going out to conferences and

00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:47,040
making sure that you're hearing what's

00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:48,540
being said you're being present but it's

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,870
all about keeping that talent that you

00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:53,280
just brought into your team the reality

00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:55,769
is though is it so much more than that

00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,540
it needs to be consistent and used to be

00:02:55,769 --> 00:02:59,760
scalable and it needs to be adaptable

00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,099
without these values without these

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,950
principles you cannot make it sustained

00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:08,150
beyond you or with your team or as

00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:10,709
technology changes any of these things I

00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:14,099
feel quite strongly that it needs to be

00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:18,450
a group group effort that you can rely

00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:20,639
on on staff or other members of your

00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:23,280
team to help you with this this effort

00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,299
that you have ahead of you but most

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,690
importantly it does need to be

00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:29,549
sustainable and how do you how do you do

00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,919
that how do you grow something how do

00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:34,169
you build a framework and let it live

00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,230
and breathe beyond just you in your

00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:38,519
efforts if you are a recruiter yourself

00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,500
or if you're in charge of that hiring

00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,840
process you probably do some of it

00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:44,700
intuitively you may not even be able to

00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,190
completely articulate what it is that

00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:49,019
you're doing and hopefully through this

00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:50,370
through my story into some of the

00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,380
lessons I've learned that can help you

00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:54,269
articulate that so that it can you can

00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:58,139
grow a framework that you can share and

00:03:54,269 --> 00:04:00,329
invite participation to so I can't tell

00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:03,599
my story unless I give you some of the

00:04:00,329 --> 00:04:06,000
woes of hiring there's a lot of them if

00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,440
you've been in hiring or recruiting

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,599
you've gone through ups and downs you've

00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:13,109
gone through attrition it's exhausting

00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,940
it's never-ending and I think it took me

00:04:13,109 --> 00:04:15,880
probably four or five years to realize

00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:17,320
that it

00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:19,690
never going to stop and I just had to

00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,580
embrace it so here are some of the

00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:25,780
thoughts that go through my head in a

00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:28,240
hiring capacity this is kind of a latest

00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,160
one so technology is changing every

00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,740
single day the names are getting crazier

00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,810
more ridiculous I'm not a developer

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,900
anymore I used to be but it's

00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,760
challenging to keep up and I have people

00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,830
telling me I need to find somebody who

00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,320
knows Travis and I'm thinking to myself

00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:47,260
all right so i can i can figure this out

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,540
right I'm who's Travis he's got to be

00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,010
somebody somebody important but the

00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,600
developer roomie no smart enough I

00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,670
should probably google it first and

00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,470
maybe look at a few different pages and

00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,720
you know sure enough I find that it's

00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,580
yet another new technology that's that

00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,390
is important it's critical critical to

00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:06,100
our development process and there was a

00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:07,420
blip in time where I thought I didn't

00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,370
need to know this stuff and it's true I

00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:12,040
don't need to know every single tool as

00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:13,930
a recruiter however I do have to have

00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,130
conversations with my team I do need to

00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:17,500
know what it is that they're interested

00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:21,580
in and I need to set them up for success

00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:24,010
to help me recruit I can connect them to

00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,450
the people I can affect the people that

00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,730
we're recruiting to people on my team

00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:30,700
who know you know quite honestly better

00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,680
than I do and that I support that effort

00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,960
in and of itself is one of the most

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:37,030
beautiful ingredients to a successful

00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,620
recruiting strategy because I want to

00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:40,870
work with great team and if you can

00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:45,370
demonstrate that even better so there's

00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:47,410
Travis then there's my my other favorite

00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,060
you're getting promoted this one

00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,770
actually strikes anxiety of me now

00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:53,770
because what I've realized as a hiring

00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:56,320
person is that well that's great moving

00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,540
up in the team staying wonderful oh my

00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,740
god I have to fill their position and I

00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,420
hadn't been thinking about it and I've

00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,730
been helping them move to this new

00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:05,080
position which is fantastic i want that

00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:07,570
i want to i want to encourage that

00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:10,960
that's how you keep retention but you

00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:14,290
can't when you're what i've learned from

00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,670
from a you know employee advancement

00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:18,460
side is that you have to be thinking

00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:20,530
about a succession plan who moves into

00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,760
that position is there someone else on

00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,050
the team that's moved into that decision

00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,710
have you been having those conversations

00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,500
with your

00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:30,170
various managers or just purely even

00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,060
have you been looking out across the

00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:34,010
community that you're involved in for

00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,480
potential fits are you constantly having

00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,970
those conversations so that you're not

00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:41,630
caught off guard when someone gets a

00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:44,900
wonderful promotion there's awesome when

00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:46,400
somebody quits I wish I don't know if

00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,250
anybody's actually seen this video but

00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,930
it's totally amazing and I wish I was

00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,220
excited as I was to watch this video

00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,380
when someone tells me that they're

00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:57,200
quitting I keep thinking it's like my

00:06:54,380 --> 00:07:00,200
heart breaks no I just trained you up or

00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,520
you know you were amazing you were

00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,900
challenging everybody else on the team

00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,200
there's so many things that I was

00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,660
excited about but this is a reality

00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,940
people in our industry do not stay at

00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,370
places for a long time you know when I I

00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:16,340
grew up my father we don't work for a

00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:18,470
union he works at the city for 35 years

00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,570
that's what you did you you worked your

00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,070
craft across those years you got better

00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:24,290
and better and you moved into management

00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:26,570
you did these different things two years

00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:28,460
maybe maybe a little longer maybe a

00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:31,130
little less is is what you have to start

00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,960
to expect and I learned many years ago

00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:36,560
that I needed to embrace that embrace it

00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,110
as an opportunity sometimes we need to

00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,840
say goodbye that's also very important

00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:44,290
you you know back to the initial image

00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:47,180
laceup of a garden that we need to weed

00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:49,820
you're looking for a cohesive team a

00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:51,620
team that can perform a team that can

00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:54,470
sustain that can grow that can be

00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,840
challenged if you have people in the

00:07:54,470 --> 00:08:00,200
team who are not challenging others your

00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,180
team is at risk so you have to make the

00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:04,150
horrible decision to have somebody to

00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:08,330
leave it's not an easy thing to do but

00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:10,699
you know it's a part of the life cycle

00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:13,430
then there's this one which is really

00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:16,030
interesting this one I probably learned

00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:19,069
most recently this last year it's that

00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:20,569
if it's like never fails I just hire

00:08:19,069 --> 00:08:22,699
somebody and then all of a sudden we

00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:24,710
need to hire three more engineers or two

00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:26,479
more feds it's like I just I just

00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:28,759
finished this now I got to start over

00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,439
again so what I've learned is that i

00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,120
have to have a bench I have to say oh I

00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:33,560
got you I got I got like three

00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:36,440
candidates I've been talking to them

00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,209
it'll be great I won't now have to start

00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:40,909
my entire recruiting process over I'm

00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:45,709
not starting you know back on my back

00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:47,450
foot so truly this process or or what

00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:50,209
you need to embody as a recruiter is

00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:53,120
being proactive and adaptable it's key

00:08:50,209 --> 00:08:56,420
that you embrace the fact that we live

00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:59,810
and breathe a landscape that's changing

00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:01,700
every second and if we can anticipate it

00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:05,240
if we can be proactive if we can be

00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:06,769
adapted to it it won't overcome us so it

00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,070
needs to be sustainable you have to

00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:12,769
build a framework so then we introduce

00:09:10,070 --> 00:09:14,089
da and you're wondering probably what

00:09:12,769 --> 00:09:15,769
you know maybe you're here because

00:09:14,089 --> 00:09:18,170
you're thinking how do I prepare my team

00:09:15,769 --> 00:09:21,829
for da tour how do I get new talent for

00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:23,930
da and it's true dat offers a lot of

00:09:21,829 --> 00:09:25,100
challenges it also offers a significant

00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:26,779
amount of opportunities and I think

00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,970
actually quite honestly it shows a

00:09:26,779 --> 00:09:34,459
mirror to us as recruiters things that

00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:36,410
we should have known all along so to

00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:38,750
quote Larry Garfield here who works at

00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:41,810
palantir this is from a blog post he

00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:43,760
wrote about d8 for the wind your next

00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:45,649
higher is outside of Drupal essentially

00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,510
so he says one of the challenges to

00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:49,910
finding good Drupal talent is that

00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:53,449
Drupal has historically been well weird

00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:56,930
and by weird I mean entirely unlike any

00:09:53,449 --> 00:09:59,779
other system on the market I feel this

00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:01,670
statement so so far to my core I can't

00:09:59,779 --> 00:10:03,260
even tell you they said i started at

00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:05,720
palantir the front end developer about

00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:08,120
eight and a half years ago and you know

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:11,149
no I'm the director of operations so i'm

00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,649
i'm looking at how the company functions

00:10:11,149 --> 00:10:14,449
i'm looking at building the team about

00:10:12,649 --> 00:10:15,779
employee development all of these

00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:19,230
different things i'm not developing

00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:21,389
more but when I came into palantir we

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,699
were little CMS agnostic but then we

00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:26,639
embrace Drupal I was excited right

00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:28,949
because I was like ah no more like 500

00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:30,769
CMS's I don't have to learn he's five

00:10:28,949 --> 00:10:35,279
different languages I can specialize now

00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:37,319
but it was so unlike anything I had ever

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,089
met I wanted to fight it I wanted to rip

00:10:37,319 --> 00:10:41,759
it apart I wanted to you know kick it

00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:43,920
out the door because it didn't it didn't

00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:45,720
as a as a developer I was a curator I

00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,720
was I was I could create something from

00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:51,839
scratch I could build up on it and with

00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,100
Drupal you had to work with it or at

00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,749
least at the time when I was developing

00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,019
it was very much a system that you had a

00:10:54,749 --> 00:10:59,939
play nice with and what I found as I

00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:01,470
started to do recruiting for palantir is

00:10:59,939 --> 00:11:03,269
that people didn't want to go anywhere

00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:05,910
near it I mean I it took me probably

00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:09,449
about a year and a half to even embrace

00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:11,670
it and love it and you know and I still

00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:13,319
have a great deal of love for it but I

00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,449
know that that learning curve is so

00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:17,459
steep and what I found with many of our

00:11:15,449 --> 00:11:19,410
clients is that they had an even greater

00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:21,269
curve to hit they couldn't hit the

00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,589
compensation structures that we couldn't

00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:24,180
pound here because we were a profit

00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:27,930
company a lot of her clients are

00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:31,769
not-for-profit so their talent pool was

00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:34,769
much smaller and now they have this you

00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:36,629
know very elaborate system that we

00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:38,430
helped build in Drupal and they can't

00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:40,350
extend it themselves because I want to

00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:41,459
customize it they don't want to just do

00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:43,439
some build-out they want to do something

00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:45,930
more and that always made me a little

00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:48,360
bit sad it made me feel like it couldn't

00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:50,009
be sustainable beyond you know beyond

00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,480
that beyond palantir and sure muvek a

00:11:50,009 --> 00:11:55,500
high RS and we could train them up and

00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:57,569
that was also fantastic but I found that

00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,920
our clients also would go out and try to

00:11:57,569 --> 00:12:00,569
seek Drupal developers and they just

00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:02,129
couldn't find them and they had all

00:12:00,569 --> 00:12:05,279
these other systems that had nothing to

00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:07,500
do with Drupal so higher in a developer

00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,110
who just as Drupal but yet they have a

00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,209
handful of other custom systems a lot of

00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:13,980
not-for-profits have file maker pro you

00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:17,699
know things like that hopefully we don't

00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,800
hire file microphone developers but all

00:12:17,699 --> 00:12:21,000
this to say that in order to prepare for

00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,550
d 8

00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,110
this is where the mirror comes comes to

00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:27,720
play we have to look at ourselves and

00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:29,670
say what make good developers and what

00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:32,280
the answer to that is is people who have

00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:34,380
an understanding or have a background or

00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,910
have the desire to learn the core

00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,190
principles of many of the programming

00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:40,290
languages that we learned before Drupal

00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:43,290
or that they're doing outside of Drupal

00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:45,300
what is it you know pure PHP for

00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:46,920
instance or templating engines like twit

00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:50,520
all the things that are starting to be

00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:53,130
baked into da get us back to the roots

00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,260
of being web developers the handful

00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:57,210
years ago about the time that I was

00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,730
starting to come out of development and

00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:02,070
I was doing project leading at that

00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:04,170
point I was doing less code I don't

00:13:02,070 --> 00:13:06,690
remember who I was talking to but I we

00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:09,840
were specifically talking about Drupal

00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,850
and I said that this means I miss being

00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:14,880
a web developer I miss being able to

00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:16,230
create two to add things in and build

00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,230
this beautiful thing instead of having

00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:22,290
to unpack what felt to me like a box

00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:24,090
full of like you know knotted Christmas

00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,860
lights you know if I was really good I

00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:28,410
could probably get it all out and not

00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:31,320
break any of the life but that's how it

00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:34,140
that's how it felt so to prepare for d8

00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:38,370
you have to invest in your existing team

00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:39,830
but you also now have a new set of

00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:43,100
communities that you can reach out to

00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:46,290
different PHP conferences for instance

00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:48,990
get the message out there that Drupal is

00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:52,500
more than what has been that it is

00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:54,270
welcoming now too many other people who

00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,100
in the past may have steered clear of it

00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:57,720
because it was like the hutch just just

00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,040
a little weird don't understand it

00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,650
doesn't play nice with these other

00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:05,160
things the hope is is that it does and

00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:06,600
the reality is is that that we probably

00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:09,210
should have been doing this all along

00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,880
even with d7 even with these six doesn't

00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:16,170
matter what the tool is if we hire

00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,430
people who are you know have foundation

00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:20,940
in core principles of programming

00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:23,880
language they can apply it to most if

00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:26,400
not anything you know finding people who

00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,290
who are strategic thinkers who are

00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,529
strong problem solvers who have strong

00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:31,600
soft skills

00:14:29,529 --> 00:14:33,730
who can adapt who can grow with your

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,410
company with your team because who knows

00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:37,930
how long you're going to be in Drupal

00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:40,269
even you may have to expand your your

00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:42,790
tool chain you may need to include

00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:45,879
different different things so it's

00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:48,189
important not to get Drupal my ethics I

00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:51,579
think it's super important to think

00:14:48,189 --> 00:14:53,439
about this world out there beyond Drupal

00:14:51,579 --> 00:14:55,199
that has amazing talent in their sudden

00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,730
bringing them into our Drupal community

00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:01,509
you know and maybe even having them help

00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:05,439
train up our talent so let's talk about

00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:07,839
a strategy that I feel you know worked

00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:12,069
at palantir that you know for instances

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:14,589
is multifaceted that that you know uses

00:15:12,069 --> 00:15:16,149
this this desire to find people with

00:15:14,589 --> 00:15:19,509
soft skills to find people who are

00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:21,040
adaptable the best way for me to do that

00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:22,930
is is quite honestly to tell you a

00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,410
little bit more about my story and the

00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:29,410
journey that I took to get where I'm at

00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:31,300
so as i said i joined palantir about

00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:33,100
eight eight and a half years ago as a

00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,680
front-end developer there was seven

00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:39,129
people at palantir at the time that i

00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,709
joined pound here and it's work 40 right

00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:43,899
now throughout that entire time I've

00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:46,839
always been involved in in the hiring

00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:48,610
process in some way or another obviously

00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:50,829
now I'm much more actively it's under my

00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:53,649
domain I you know I run the process and

00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:55,899
I do quite a bit of the recruiting but

00:15:53,649 --> 00:15:58,750
prior to palantir I worked for a very

00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:01,059
large not-for-profit that you know

00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:04,689
couldn't keep talent we didn't have

00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:06,189
strong skilled talent you know or or

00:16:04,689 --> 00:16:08,050
tunnel that truly understood a lot of

00:16:06,189 --> 00:16:10,660
the systems that we were we were doing

00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:12,610
but I saw good people come and go and it

00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,500
and it was sad so I very much wanted to

00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:16,149
be a part of that hiring process I

00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,910
wanted to find the people who had that

00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:21,100
same passion that I had and and that

00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:22,480
would stick through it and help us steer

00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,100
towards what it was that we were looking

00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,519
for which was to do really great work

00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:29,769
quality work work that could scale work

00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:31,870
that could meet you know client's needs

00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:33,910
and especially in the not-for-profit

00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:35,649
world people who couldn't get like the

00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:37,990
big at the time systems that were like

00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:39,570
vignette and things that were just

00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:43,470
completely out of their reach

00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:45,060
so I did I did hiring by myself for the

00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,740
most part a couple people here and there

00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:49,830
but it was very intuitive his very ad

00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:53,160
hoc and it did not scale so about three

00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:54,660
years ago we hired Susan gowland who who

00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,160
works with me she's the people

00:16:54,660 --> 00:17:00,720
impressive coordinator she's incredibly

00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:03,750
level-headed I promise Susan was hired

00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,040
about the same time that I was a handful

00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,750
months before I was about to go on

00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,579
maternity leave it was really important

00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,140
that I somehow translate all these

00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:13,170
things that i've been doing intuitively

00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:16,290
to somebody else so that should the need

00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:20,010
arise you know processes could could

00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:21,150
keep going on without me so Susan was

00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:23,160
quite instrumental and actually the

00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:26,400
process of just training her was was

00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:28,560
very eye-opening for me the second thing

00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,470
that happened is is that I had my

00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:35,010
daughter Winnie you know about eight

00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:37,830
months after Susan joined the team and

00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:39,000
my life changed I couldn't be recruiting

00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,700
anymore I couldn't be going to

00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,680
conferences so everything changed for me

00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,060
the things that I could do so

00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:46,950
instinctively like get a beer with

00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:51,060
somebody or just have a conversation at

00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:52,200
at our booth or over lunch or I just

00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,600
didn't have access to these things

00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,840
anymore my priorities had shifted so I

00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,640
needed to change something so Susan and

00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,800
I work together to to essentially

00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:05,220
document our hiring process this was the

00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:07,200
first step and one of the first things

00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,910
that Susan said to me is that if you're

00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,980
going to delegate something you need to

00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:14,460
give it all you cannot give me part of

00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:17,760
it you need to help me both succeed as

00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:20,670
well as give me a space to fail that was

00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,800
probably the that's probably in a life

00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:25,950
lesson beyond just this alone it's just

00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:28,350
in life if you if you can delegate

00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:30,420
properly you can have a network of

00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,220
opportunity as a network that can can

00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:35,190
help you achieve what whatever your goal

00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,650
is so the hiring process that we

00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,330
establish was actually quite simple it

00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:41,010
took us a while to get there because it

00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:42,660
involved me having to articulate what I

00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,550
have been doing instinctively for so

00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:47,610
long but essentially the three-step

00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:49,820
process a screening process that was

00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:52,830
with she and I looking for soft skills

00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:55,740
followed by a skills

00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:59,039
based process or interview that was with

00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,630
peers on the team and was able to get

00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,000
into the weeds and I didn't have to be a

00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:05,070
part of that one maybe the development

00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,659
manager or somebody with in project

00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:08,640
management team Japan who we were hiring

00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:10,919
could be part of that and then the third

00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,360
round interview would be with the the

00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:14,130
final round though the people who were

00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,710
going to make the final say I might also

00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:18,269
show back up in that interview what's

00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:20,100
important about the fact that we had a

00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:22,230
three step process is that we knew what

00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,669
it was it was a framework that we could

00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,740
use but it was also something that I

00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:28,500
could communicate to the people who I

00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:30,600
was interviewing this to me is what i

00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,210
have found to be the most influential of

00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:35,639
all is that when you're interviewing

00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:38,100
somebody they are interviewing somewhere

00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:39,779
else and quite possibly somewhere that's

00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,730
got a that's got a better offer on the

00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:43,230
table so somehow you have got to hook

00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,539
them to stay with you through that

00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:47,220
entire process and i have found that the

00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:48,630
best way to do that is just to be honest

00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,190
about them about what the process is

00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:53,940
when you're going to get back to them

00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:55,590
and and how we do that is that we

00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:57,240
treated in three steps and we make a

00:19:55,590 --> 00:20:00,179
decision about who makes it to the next

00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:03,299
round after that first round genius I

00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:05,340
learned that because prior to soothe and

00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:06,720
helping me to find that I let things go

00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:08,580
a little bit longer and I lost some

00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:10,740
really great candidates because I didn't

00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,330
have my schedule I didn't have under

00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,309
control i didn't have things organized I

00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:17,610
couldn't clearly communicate

00:20:14,309 --> 00:20:20,220
expectations that means I I lost so many

00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:21,990
candidates because of that additionally

00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:25,169
when you start to involve peers in the

00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:26,370
interview process now the person who

00:20:25,169 --> 00:20:28,080
your interview and get the sense of

00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:30,210
culture they get a sense of who is going

00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:33,240
to be on their team and how smart they

00:20:30,210 --> 00:20:36,659
are how challenging they are and why do

00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:39,299
they really want to work there so that

00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:41,039
was that was fantastic so in general I

00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:42,720
decentralize the process it kind of

00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,340
started off just most like people wanted

00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,500
to be involved but then I realized no no

00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,450
this has to happen every time the second

00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,490
round always has to have peers it always

00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:53,070
has to have people who can ask the real

00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:54,690
questions get into the weeds and I even

00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,769
set that up in the first interview I say

00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:58,200
you're not going to talk to me about

00:20:55,769 --> 00:21:00,029
technology you can I will probably

00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,340
understand you but it's not going to be

00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:04,919
that fun so save it for

00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:08,549
central second round so this is great I

00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:09,870
decentralized amazing so now i have to

00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:12,360
be in less interviews which is really

00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:14,789
exciting what was an unexpected surprise

00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,470
is that i actually created recruiting

00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:18,150
ambassadors through this process this

00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:20,120
was not my intent this was never my

00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:22,740
target it was an it was an unexpected

00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:25,080
wonderful outcome the people who were

00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:27,929
involved in the pier process and the the

00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:32,520
skills based interview now became people

00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:33,960
who could speak to the values and you

00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,700
know values of the company the hiring

00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,740
process why we wanted to work there they

00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,299
were set up to ask the questions so when

00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:41,429
they would go to conferences or they'd

00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:43,980
be out with friends or at a meet up

00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:45,690
wherever they're at they already know

00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,539
how to ask the questions and they became

00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:50,490
recruiting ambassadors however I

00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:52,110
realized that that only went so far

00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:53,789
because while they knew some of the

00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:55,710
values they didn't truly understand the

00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:57,990
vision they didn't feel that they had

00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:00,390
all the information to make a decision

00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:02,100
about somebody who is truly a good

00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:04,770
candidate so they would say Colleen I

00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:06,630
like those three people were great I

00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,039
loved it can we just hire all of them as

00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:11,279
I know I'm sorry we can't actually hire

00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:13,230
all three we have to hire one and I want

00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,210
you to consider all of these factors so

00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,220
now I had to describe to them again an

00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:20,220
intuitive process that I had around soft

00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:21,840
skills married with with technical

00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:23,640
skills and how a wonderful combination

00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,659
of the two makes somebody who can truly

00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,950
scale with your team and so what I

00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:30,539
realized is that I really needed to

00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:32,250
articulate what the vision and value is

00:22:30,539 --> 00:22:33,390
not only of the company were to the

00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,179
people involved in the interview process

00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:38,880
but what the vision and value was of the

00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:40,470
interviewing process because I was able

00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,390
to do that now they're even more

00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:45,059
powerful recruiting ambassadors and

00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:46,830
actually another unexpected outcome is

00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:48,659
it they started to seek out people who

00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,549
fit that skill set and bringing them

00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:53,679
back to me without you know I didn't

00:22:50,549 --> 00:22:56,779
have to solicit solicit any of it

00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:59,179
so that being said then we hit the next

00:22:56,779 --> 00:23:01,100
maturity level which is that you need to

00:22:59,179 --> 00:23:05,499
identify your gap you start to realize

00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:09,590
that ah my team looks really similar and

00:23:05,499 --> 00:23:12,049
it's it's true we hire within or we

00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:13,879
network within people we know the only

00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:17,690
way to change that is to network outside

00:23:13,879 --> 00:23:19,369
of your familiar ground so you know one

00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:22,999
way to do this is to send people to

00:23:19,369 --> 00:23:26,289
conferences that are you know outside of

00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:29,269
your familiarity you have to look at

00:23:26,289 --> 00:23:31,279
your team and ask yourself if their

00:23:29,269 --> 00:23:32,570
representative of the population or the

00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:34,489
audience that's actually going to use

00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:35,989
your product and if they're not those

00:23:34,489 --> 00:23:38,299
are those are essentially the gas that

00:23:35,989 --> 00:23:39,649
you have to hire for and then when i say

00:23:38,299 --> 00:23:41,720
gaps i don't even just mean from a

00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:44,359
demographic standpoint i truly mean from

00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,889
from from all avenues even some an

00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:48,409
intellectual from a skill set from a

00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:50,989
problem solving background everything

00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:53,690
the the more diverse your talent is the

00:23:50,989 --> 00:23:55,519
more challenging the more challenges you

00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:58,879
can give a team the more willing they

00:23:55,519 --> 00:24:01,009
are to stay that was we I remember years

00:23:58,879 --> 00:24:03,109
ago we we lost somebody at palantir who

00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:05,690
said I system you know I'm looking for a

00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:08,119
new challenge it's just starting to feel

00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:09,649
a little cookie cutter and it was I just

00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:11,720
had to hear that want for us to change

00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:13,580
the way that we did things and now it's

00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,049
all about finding rich engaging

00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,489
challenge for the team and that's not

00:24:15,049 --> 00:24:22,999
just about project that's about your

00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:25,609
peers so I talked about this a little

00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:27,559
bit earlier but the way for you to truly

00:24:25,609 --> 00:24:29,659
be proactive and adaptable is to have a

00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:31,099
higher name bench you call us whatever

00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:33,289
you want the pounds here we call it a

00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:35,809
hiring bunch but it's it's people who

00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:37,970
I've met who I do a screening interview

00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:39,499
with so I only do a portion of my

00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:41,179
framework I do the initial screening

00:24:39,499 --> 00:24:42,619
interview at keep it short I get to know

00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:44,330
them I said I don't have a job available

00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:46,429
but I want to hear everything there is

00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:47,840
to know about you and then I keep them

00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:49,940
on my bench and I said expectations

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:53,029
again it's all about being transparent

00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:54,590
by being honest I have no job I really

00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:57,409
love what you have to say I'd love to

00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:59,269
keep in touch you know I'll let you know

00:24:57,409 --> 00:25:00,739
when a position gets posted or maybe

00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:02,330
here's how you can find out about when a

00:25:00,739 --> 00:25:03,940
position gets posted it's just about

00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:06,159
setting expectations

00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:07,509
if you don't like for instance that cat

00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:10,299
metaphor you could use a dog metaphor

00:25:07,509 --> 00:25:12,100
you know you have a small talent pool or

00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:14,409
maybe you have a large talent pool do

00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:17,230
you have it you have a way to track the

00:25:14,409 --> 00:25:18,970
people who come to you because I

00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:21,580
guarantee you you will forget that most

00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:23,320
amazing person when it comes time you

00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:25,299
know a year later and someone says you

00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,519
need to hire for a position that you had

00:25:25,299 --> 00:25:29,919
never thought about before it's a brand

00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:31,750
new position never in your hiring plan

00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,340
but you know you need it now and here a

00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:36,639
year or two ago you had actually met

00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:38,470
that person or or they knew of people

00:25:36,639 --> 00:25:40,240
those are the types of things you need

00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:42,730
to track that you need to be able to

00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,250
access when from your hiring adventure

00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:47,169
from your downsell when when the time

00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:48,549
arises this is what allows you to to

00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:52,210
pivot and to also not have this

00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:57,250
recruiting process you know be

00:25:52,210 --> 00:26:00,639
exhaustive so let's come back to the

00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:03,580
framework I talked about the whole story

00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:05,049
of how I got here and how it evolved for

00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,759
me and I'm still evolving I'm still

00:26:05,049 --> 00:26:09,669
learning I'm still making lots of

00:26:06,759 --> 00:26:11,740
mistakes the key is to be able to

00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:13,450
iterate on those mistakes to be able to

00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:15,340
have conversations with the people who

00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:17,019
are involved in your hiring and your

00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,090
recruiting process take their input

00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:22,240
seriously and incorporate it back in as

00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:24,879
soon as you can and you can't do that

00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:26,919
again if you don't set this vision set

00:26:24,879 --> 00:26:28,899
the vision and consistently communicate

00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:31,299
it make sure that they can repeat it

00:26:28,899 --> 00:26:33,460
back to you this quite honestly goes

00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:35,200
again to everything in life it's like

00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,960
how do you run a business set the vision

00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,220
how do you figure out schools for your

00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,840
toddler when they're going to go into

00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,570
kindergarten set your vision and goals

00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:47,129
like just focus on on where you're

00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:49,330
headed and then invite participation

00:26:47,129 --> 00:26:52,179
decentralize it you cannot do it

00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:54,370
yourself nor should you why wouldn't you

00:26:52,179 --> 00:26:55,600
you have I don't depends on how many

00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:58,269
people you have you could have three

00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,309
people you could have you know 20 people

00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:02,679
on your team but they're on the ground

00:27:00,309 --> 00:27:05,200
there doing the work they know what it

00:27:02,679 --> 00:27:06,850
means to be building these websites or

00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,860
designing these websites or being

00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:11,820
strategic consultants problem solvers

00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:15,080
whatever it is rely on them invite them

00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:18,080
that's another way to also retain at

00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:19,850
talent talent always wants to or team

00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:21,350
members i should say i always want to

00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:23,419
feel like they have an impact that

00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:24,919
they're adding value back to the company

00:27:23,419 --> 00:27:27,409
there's no better way to do that than to

00:27:24,919 --> 00:27:29,750
show them that you respect their opinion

00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:31,370
that you respect their professionalism

00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:33,860
that you want to invite them into

00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:37,669
helping build this team that they are

00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:39,890
part of but most importantly you have to

00:27:37,669 --> 00:27:43,070
also invest in them you have to let them

00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:44,570
practice in my experience the best way

00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:47,720
to do this is to encourage them to go

00:27:44,570 --> 00:27:49,519
speak at conferences at camps encourage

00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,019
them to go to meet ups speak at those

00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:53,389
maybe they're a little bit more friendly

00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:54,710
to do because some people might be a

00:27:53,389 --> 00:27:57,260
little bit nervous to do something at a

00:27:54,710 --> 00:28:01,760
larger scale invite them to do blog

00:27:57,260 --> 00:28:04,730
posts have get them out there you as you

00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,440
know going back to the the fact that I'm

00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:08,929
a mom of a toddler and I can't travel

00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,429
you know we have a team of 40 so there's

00:28:08,929 --> 00:28:12,409
a handful of conferences that people

00:28:10,429 --> 00:28:15,049
want to go to JavaScript conferences or

00:28:12,409 --> 00:28:18,710
or other open source conferences or you

00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:21,889
know women focus conferences the gamut

00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:23,330
is is across the board and I can't go to

00:28:21,889 --> 00:28:26,299
all of them I can't be in all these

00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:28,190
places at the same time but they can and

00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:31,090
I can train them up and that's something

00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:33,470
that I've started to do I've I've

00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:34,970
coincidentally been able to to get away

00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:36,289
without having to train people for a

00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:41,029
while because the people who have been

00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:42,980
doing speaking engagements it also been

00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:44,690
involved in the be hiring and the

00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:47,149
interview process and so they've just

00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:50,179
naturally embraces so I'm using them as

00:28:47,149 --> 00:28:51,950
sort of my my model ambassadors to say

00:28:50,179 --> 00:28:53,450
like let's bring some more people in so

00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:55,159
that when you go to that meet up you can

00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,200
say like oh you should absolutely join

00:28:55,159 --> 00:28:58,820
my team and here's why here's what it's

00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,549
like to work with us and here's how you

00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:04,039
get to impact the process I think people

00:29:01,549 --> 00:29:05,419
just want to feel that that they're part

00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:08,809
of something bigger that they're not

00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:10,760
just you know just does I don't even

00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:13,200
know of a good way say it but that they

00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:16,120
mean something

00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,880
but lastly I think it's so important so

00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:21,640
critical that you actually track it you

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,860
as I said you can't remember all of the

00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,000
people that you talk to doesn't mean you

00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,830
need to track every single conversation

00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,270
that you've ever had but you need to be

00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:30,429
able to access them and why they were so

00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:32,740
important so that for instance if you're

00:29:30,429 --> 00:29:34,360
at a conference like this you can find

00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,590
out or you can see if they're there and

00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,870
if they are then you can be prepared to

00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:41,200
talk to them and say hey how are you

00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:43,420
doing you know have our have our stars

00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,309
you know a line can you what do we think

00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,720
about some new opportunities being

00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:49,470
always ready to have those conversations

00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:52,780
always ready to make connections is is

00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:54,549
kind of the another important ingredient

00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:57,960
ingredient of being a successful

00:29:54,549 --> 00:30:02,500
recruiter so essentially this is it

00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:05,440
vision participation practice and to

00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:08,140
track it i'm sure there's like 500 more

00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:10,360
steps but this is this framework this

00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:13,540
four-step framework i apply it to so

00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,950
much at palantir and it gives me because

00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:17,890
of the framework it gives me so much

00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:20,799
room to adapt it to to change it as our

00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:22,570
needs change so for instance a penalty

00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,460
we're starting to do more Symphony work

00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:27,549
we're not we're branching out of out of

00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:29,919
the Drupal sphere so okay well oh man I

00:30:27,549 --> 00:30:31,780
don't even like word symphony people go

00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:33,760
for conferences I have no idea now I got

00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:36,309
to figure that out doesn't matter I have

00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,690
people on the team who do so I get with

00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:39,100
that might I sit down with them and I

00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:40,750
say okay here's the vision for hiring

00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,520
here the type of people were looking for

00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:44,410
here are the gaps that we're trying to

00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:47,650
fill don't forget that because it's

00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:50,320
important that our team still be diverse

00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:55,240
they be challenged that they're able to

00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:58,330
adapt with the company as as we scale so

00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:01,000
essentially it is it is critical that we

00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:04,000
have a community to come back to the to

00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,429
the garden analogy the community garden

00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,320
while it may have its little you know

00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:11,230
cubbies of where you're planting things

00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,850
it's a group effort and it is you know

00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:14,320
really is kind of why we're all here in

00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:16,809
the first place right open source like

00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,280
we do better together so why not apply

00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:22,490
that to recruiting as well

00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:24,890
I think the the other big thing though

00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:28,070
is that we have to market that this is

00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:32,180
an option that d8 isn't a scary monster

00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:34,640
or it isn't you know in like how are we

00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:36,500
ever going to train up our talent is yet

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,510
another version of Drupal it doesn't

00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:41,480
matter there's so much talent out there

00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:43,340
that already has the hard skills who or

00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,740
and the soft skills to get you to where

00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:50,200
you need to be and investing in them and

00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:50,200
supporting them is the way to get there

00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:57,250
so I think in summary I think that's the

00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:59,840
thing that's important to know is that

00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:01,700
you know as I said I've been at palantir

00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,950
for eight eight and a half years we

00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:07,400
started off with seven people were 40

00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:10,670
right now and i believe about 10 of us

00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:13,820
have had a tenure of over five years

00:32:10,670 --> 00:32:15,590
which is amazing in my first handful of

00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,300
years at palantir you know i would say

00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:19,730
our turnover rate was was fairly high

00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:23,480
which is to be expected in the industry

00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:25,130
they were in but by establishing some of

00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,990
this framework we've been able to keep

00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:28,670
people engaged we've been able to keep

00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:31,070
them challenge invested and feeling like

00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:34,160
they have an impact on this this bigger

00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:37,160
thing that is our team and so I hope

00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:39,170
that some of this you know is something

00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:40,760
that you can apply back to what what

00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,740
you're doing if it's with a team with

00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,050
you're by yourself or even if you are

00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:46,400
going to a talent acquisition service if

00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:48,320
you're going to them you still have to

00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,360
have a strategy you still need to know

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,170
what your vision is where you're going

00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,240
and how you're going to invite

00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:55,070
participation with your team they can

00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,540
help you find that talent but if you

00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:59,090
don't have that strategy if you don't

00:32:56,540 --> 00:33:01,190
have that goal to find you won't get the

00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:05,510
talent that we'll we'll stay and we'll

00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:08,110
help you as a company do better that's

00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:08,110
it thank you

00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:18,740
so I talked really fast and we ended its

00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:25,060
like by 30 but I welcome you know

00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:25,060
questions from from anybody yes

00:33:37,299 --> 00:33:41,030
sure I thought I'll repeat the question

00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:42,620
because I missing are we supposed to use

00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:46,220
the microphones to further okay so the

00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:48,049
question was actually at what point you

00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:49,580
know I joined palantir when we were

00:33:48,049 --> 00:33:52,220
seven people and that were 40 and at

00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:53,870
what point in my tenure did did I

00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:59,390
transition from available to a non

00:33:53,870 --> 00:34:01,880
belleville yeah employee and the answer

00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:05,480
to that is somewhere around somewhere

00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:08,419
around four years ago I it sort of

00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,010
started like five years ago but I was

00:34:08,419 --> 00:34:12,020
probably half there so it was it was a

00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:13,669
slow trickle I started off as front-end

00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:16,310
developer than I started doing project

00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:18,169
management and project leading and then

00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:22,190
I became the only director at that time

00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:24,369
so as palantir has scaled we've you know

00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:26,409
were slowly putting in pieces of

00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:30,230
overhead for lack of a better word

00:34:26,409 --> 00:34:33,340
because we can and we see that now what

00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:36,290
we were doing wasn't sustainable and so

00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:38,540
at that point in time was when I really

00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:40,639
was able to to focus on this but i would

00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:43,250
say probably not until about two years

00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:44,960
ago that i actually of all of that eight

00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,070
and a half years that I realized some of

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,609
the stuff that actually needed to be

00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:48,609
standardized

00:34:51,669 --> 00:35:02,250
we were about 12 people yeah thank you

00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,250
any other questions yes

00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:16,040
is it all now oh there you go I didn't

00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:17,510
you realize and I'm wondering so you

00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,300
talked about the participation piece and

00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:22,670
that's really intriguing to me mostly

00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:27,920
because you know as probably similar for

00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:30,350
you we have like eight extrovert and 32

00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,240
introverts where I think we're think at

00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:35,240
palantir for the record we're like 39 in

00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,710
interest and I am one of them I didn't

00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,880
mention that in my side so that don't

00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:39,710
what other conversations you I've love

00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:43,010
to have with you offline oh great are

00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:46,490
you recruiting I didn't know I did I'm

00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:51,370
just kidding but I am wondering like in

00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:53,240
terms of participation I struggle with

00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:56,200
maybe it's because I'm a control freak

00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:59,530
but like I struggle with the trusting

00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:03,560
these very introverted very non-social

00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:08,230
socially adept people to make a judgment

00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:10,970
call on cloth skills especially sure so

00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:12,650
let me think so that this is this has

00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:15,020
been this is something I certainly still

00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:20,780
struggle with not as much as I had in

00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:22,580
years past so for so I told you what the

00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:24,530
framework was as we've got it right now

00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:26,150
there was a period of time where I was

00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:30,310
actually still involved in all three

00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:34,010
steps and so so for instance right now

00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:37,640
the screen level it used to be me and

00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:39,050
and Susan she would work with me 22 you

00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,640
know screen for certain soft skills and

00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:42,050
I would tell her why I like certain

00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,210
things afterwards we would do a debrief

00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:46,250
almost immediately after each each of

00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:48,320
our our things and then I started to

00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:51,260
coach Ron okay well you know who do you

00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,940
think was the best candidate and why by

00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:55,490
doing that process this is with someone

00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:58,010
who's non non technical so again just

00:36:55,490 --> 00:37:00,110
the screen interview she was able to

00:36:58,010 --> 00:37:02,300
demonstrate to me that she was

00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:04,280
understanding exactly what it was that

00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,510
that we were looking for that worked

00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,790
well at palantir and she could

00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:10,070
articulate it back to me so I actually

00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:11,990
was able to step out of that process I'm

00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:14,330
not involved in the screening interview

00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:15,470
anymore the skillset interview is a

00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:18,349
little harder

00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:20,420
and that for I probably stayed in that

00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:22,250
interview for a much longer time and

00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:24,290
then I started to pull in the

00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:26,900
development managers which you may or

00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:29,840
may not have a management here but I

00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:32,570
coached them on again what soft skills

00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:35,619
we want and why and quite honestly I

00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:38,390
what I did is I compared or I try to

00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:40,280
reflect back on past experiences for

00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:42,530
people who did not work well and why

00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,330
that was the case and it's it's neither

00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:46,369
here nor there if it's not about the

00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:48,380
person being you know a good person or a

00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:50,630
bad person it's about whether or not

00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:53,119
they're able to succeed within this

00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:54,920
environment that we've cultivated and i

00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,740
will say quite honestly extrovert SAT

00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:59,630
pounds here you're outnumbered by

00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:01,369
introvert so like if you like to have

00:37:59,630 --> 00:38:03,650
conversations people are going to be on

00:38:01,369 --> 00:38:05,900
their headphones all day so it might not

00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:07,910
work out and what i'll actually what i

00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:10,849
will do in an interview processes i will

00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:13,190
i will let that candidate know that so

00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:15,500
the trusting process of your internal

00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:16,910
team is is hard it's not an easy thing

00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:19,640
to do but the best advice I could give

00:38:16,910 --> 00:38:20,960
you is quite honestly just to coach them

00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,480
through it and get them to demonstrate

00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,910
and if they can't do it they can't be in

00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,560
that process other than you then you you

00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:29,690
have to stay in there you have to coach

00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:34,400
somebody else or or bring somebody else

00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:37,040
in had a question about the

00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:39,650
decentralization part of it so that

00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:42,830
assumes that you can that there are

00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:45,770
multiple people to move things so what

00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:49,490
about even before that point and any

00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:51,970
strategies for like if we're not even at

00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:54,230
that point yet just to grow the team out

00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:59,750
so 0 because you don't have anyone you

00:38:54,230 --> 00:39:01,550
can decentralize to yeah sure so um let

00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:03,589
me think here it's like a chicken egg

00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:05,119
thing it is a chicken and the egg well I

00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:07,519
mean I

00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,599
in I'm sure there's if I think through

00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:11,450
that little bit i'm sure there's another

00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:14,269
strategy but the what i did is i had to

00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:17,210
do it myself for a long time i had to

00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:18,470
scream and what what that process turns

00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:19,730
out like is that you hire a lot of

00:39:18,470 --> 00:39:21,710
people who are actually not a very good

00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:23,420
fit because you're not doing for

00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:25,099
instance development anymore or maybe

00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:27,170
you're not doing you know project

00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:29,359
management but the minute you do have

00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:31,730
someone that you can rely on you should

00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:33,230
you should invite them in you know bring

00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:34,279
them under your wing and say you know

00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:36,710
hey we should have another project

00:39:34,279 --> 00:39:38,930
manager or or have conversations with

00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:40,609
them before you're even even

00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:41,690
interviewing somebody you know maybe you

00:39:40,609 --> 00:39:43,190
don't even you maybe you don't even have

00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:44,900
a job post it but you know it's going to

00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:46,309
happen at some point but are having

00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:48,559
those conversations with people on the

00:39:46,309 --> 00:39:51,049
team who you think can screen for that

00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:55,160
type of candidate and if you if you

00:39:51,049 --> 00:39:56,720
don't have or rather you need to

00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:59,150
actually articulate what it is that

00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:01,700
you're looking for so if for instance

00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:03,799
you put up a job descriptions what in

00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:06,200
that job description are the deal

00:40:03,799 --> 00:40:08,150
breakers and what things do you want

00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,980
people to expand on just highlight those

00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:11,210
bits and then and then you know talk to

00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:14,059
different folks on your team to see if

00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:16,549
if they can help you you know identify

00:40:14,059 --> 00:40:18,380
that in in a potential candidate but it

00:40:16,549 --> 00:40:20,269
is hard I mean you you got to get to a

00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:24,259
point where you have a team before you

00:40:20,269 --> 00:40:26,329
can actually do centralized I hope that

00:40:24,259 --> 00:40:27,799
answered your question well yeah I was

00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:31,700
just thinking more in terms of the

00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:33,890
specific skills that there I know people

00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:36,849
in my company they don't most of them

00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:39,880
don't do drupal for example sure so it

00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:42,680
refers more to like higher-level

00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:45,950
concepts may be in sort of vague hand

00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:49,099
pointy stuff right so yeah that's a good

00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:50,329
point yeah so right because one of inner

00:40:49,099 --> 00:40:52,099
skills around one of the other things

00:40:50,329 --> 00:40:54,410
that we do is we ask for code samples

00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:58,440
but obviously I can't review a code

00:40:54,410 --> 00:41:01,349
sample that's not going to go well so

00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:03,300
that is interesting I think I think what

00:41:01,349 --> 00:41:06,210
you I think the way that you do this

00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:08,130
actually is that you let's say you are

00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:09,720
hiring someone in Drupal for instance

00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:11,460
it's actually quite easy because if

00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:13,140
they're involved in the community when

00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,040
hopefully they are because there's a lot

00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:16,710
of people that are involved in community

00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:18,390
who are looking for jobs you you look

00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:20,400
them up you you try to see how much

00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:22,829
involvement they have yet you you check

00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,410
there you know comments on issue queues

00:41:22,829 --> 00:41:28,500
and see how often there's like positive

00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:30,390
versus negative conversations are they

00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,369
always starting troll wars or are they

00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:34,140
actually proceeding to move things along

00:41:32,369 --> 00:41:36,390
so you really just have to screen for

00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:38,310
the soft skills at that point and I

00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:40,579
don't hope for your best but by doing

00:41:38,310 --> 00:41:43,440
that you will end up with with

00:41:40,579 --> 00:41:45,329
incredibly strong talent that can then

00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:49,609
actually be part of that that process

00:41:45,329 --> 00:41:49,609
later on I do welcome

00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:15,160
so you're asking what does technical

00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:18,390
diversity a pound here look like given

00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:21,400
that for instance we are all drupal so

00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:24,130
the the first challenge of the challenge

00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:26,890
is the most obvious is actually the type

00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:28,750
of site the type of problem that we're

00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:32,260
solving so we tend to work with higher

00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:34,390
ed and you know for a while we were

00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:37,210
working at a smaller scale what we've

00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:39,070
done in that Avenue is actually moved up

00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:40,869
to a much more complicated scale within

00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:43,690
higher higher end we're starting to take

00:42:40,869 --> 00:42:46,750
on more migration work or you know

00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:49,060
multi-site situation so it becomes about

00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:51,520
governance challenges problem solving

00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:55,300
that actually doesn't can't always be

00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:56,619
done with code and because of that or at

00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:58,839
least what I've seen in my personal

00:42:56,619 --> 00:43:00,700
experience is that you end up in

00:42:58,839 --> 00:43:02,109
conversations about like oh you can't

00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:03,849
write code for that and then someone

00:43:02,109 --> 00:43:06,700
says home maybe you can and then it

00:43:03,849 --> 00:43:08,650
becomes a debate between the developers

00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:10,320
to say no no we can actually create

00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:13,089
something that would would streamline

00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,770
the the efforts of the people that are

00:43:13,089 --> 00:43:17,830
maintaining the site so it's not even

00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:19,660
necessarily about the the people the end

00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:21,670
users the audience that will be using

00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:23,619
the site but rather the administrators

00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:26,550
so sometimes the challenge is in there

00:43:23,619 --> 00:43:29,440
sometimes the challenges is in the

00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:31,030
requirements gathering but from a from a

00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:36,099
technical skills that I think it's it's

00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:38,830
about you know finding things that are

00:43:36,099 --> 00:43:40,480
maybe missing in Drupal that solves the

00:43:38,830 --> 00:43:44,550
different business requirements or or

00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:44,550
needs the client client may have

00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:10,680
right so so I can give you an example of

00:44:08,910 --> 00:44:13,410
a symphony developer that we've hired

00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:16,530
and we hired him for a symphony project

00:44:13,410 --> 00:44:19,820
that project is done and most of our

00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:22,020
projects are Drupal for instance so and

00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:23,670
and then some of our Drupal projects

00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:26,100
have ended and so what we've decided to

00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:28,380
do is actually get some training

00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:31,170
resources for our team so that this

00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:33,000
Symphony developer can actually learn up

00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:34,260
some Drupal experience maybe help us

00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,320
build out some internal infrastructure

00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:39,150
tools and then for the the Drupal

00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:40,500
developers we're saying hey you know

00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:42,330
what like there's some symphony says

00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:44,070
that you should learn and now there's

00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:46,100
there's internal resources within the

00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:48,030
team that can also help mentor

00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:50,340
collaboration among the team is also one

00:44:48,030 --> 00:44:51,810
of the biggest things that that is that

00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:53,580
I would say the retention thing for

00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:55,290
palantir people want to be able to talk

00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:58,200
to each other to brainstorm to come up

00:44:55,290 --> 00:45:00,060
with ideas for tools within our

00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,310
infrastructure stack so when you have

00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:06,960
gaps during projects that's a great way

00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:10,350
to train up people and to you know to

00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:12,330
help them flex on muscles but with this

00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:13,710
symphony developer you know we hired him

00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:15,030
and I was incredibly honest with him

00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:17,040
about the fact that like you know

00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:19,290
Symphony is a very small portion of our

00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:22,500
portfolio at this point we are still

00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:24,030
very drupal focused and I wanted to make

00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:25,530
sure I wanted to suss out whether or not

00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:28,980
that was going to be a problem for him

00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:30,540
if he wanted to learn drupal and you

00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:31,920
know an in vice versa if I'm hiring

00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:33,180
Drupal talent now the first thing I'm

00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,830
asking them is like how do you feel

00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:37,800
about Silex how do you feel about

00:45:34,830 --> 00:45:39,990
symphony do you know angular do you want

00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:43,350
to know angular you know what other

00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:45,410
technologies do you like and and be as

00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:48,450
Canada's transparent as I can about what

00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:52,050
limits exist both at palantir or within

00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:54,660
our team but also that there is a drive

00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:56,460
and a passion among the rest of us to to

00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:59,040
constantly be innovating to be

00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:02,490
constantly learning new tools and trying

00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:03,990
new tools and I that comes that gets

00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:05,820
demonstrated very quickly because of the

00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:08,790
projects that we select because our

00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:10,230
sales team talks very closely with the

00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:12,030
dev team about what it is that they're

00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:13,500
they're looking you know what technology

00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:16,049
they're learning or they want to learn

00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:19,579
and why it would be a good

00:46:16,049 --> 00:46:25,769
a good solution for some of our clients

00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:27,509
welcome any other questions so this is a

00:46:25,769 --> 00:46:29,400
question could fill up a whole whole

00:46:27,509 --> 00:46:32,249
session in itself if you guys do a

00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,559
really really good job about hiring and

00:46:32,249 --> 00:46:37,049
maintaining female developers an error

00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:41,459
that is really really hard to hire and

00:46:37,049 --> 00:46:43,829
retain female developers how beyond just

00:46:41,459 --> 00:46:45,089
having a really magnetic female

00:46:43,829 --> 00:46:48,349
president but what else do you guys do

00:46:45,089 --> 00:46:52,199
to make that happen we seek them out I

00:46:48,349 --> 00:46:56,579
you know I know I know that is a gap

00:46:52,199 --> 00:46:58,170
there other gaps you know putting gender

00:46:56,579 --> 00:46:59,999
aside people who don't want to identify

00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:04,380
with a gender and what does our space

00:46:59,999 --> 00:47:08,039
look like and is it is it an environment

00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:10,049
that is safe for them to to be

00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:12,499
themselves and I think we do a very good

00:47:10,049 --> 00:47:14,519
job of both blogging about that and

00:47:12,499 --> 00:47:16,170
communicating that and again that's a

00:47:14,519 --> 00:47:17,549
value that I hold as a recruiter but

00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:19,739
it's a value that comes straight from

00:47:17,549 --> 00:47:23,189
you know from the owners of the company

00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:25,079
from George and tip and so because we

00:47:23,189 --> 00:47:27,529
live and breathe that it comes across in

00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:30,239
any person on the team and that's

00:47:27,529 --> 00:47:32,759
surprise another thing that I screened

00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:37,949
for in the initial screen interview what

00:47:32,759 --> 00:47:39,150
is your are you an inclusive person that

00:47:37,949 --> 00:47:40,679
is actually used to be a question

00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:42,479
sometimes I ask it it just sort of

00:47:40,679 --> 00:47:45,420
depends on what the person divulges in

00:47:42,479 --> 00:47:46,859
there in their first interview but I try

00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:48,689
to ask a question about like what does

00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:52,410
it what does it mean to be inclusive and

00:47:48,689 --> 00:47:54,150
how do you create that in a conversation

00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:57,059
that maybe is a little challenging

00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:59,069
oftentimes people give me client client

00:47:57,059 --> 00:48:00,839
versions but I try to then unpack it

00:47:59,069 --> 00:48:02,400
from a peer-to-peer how do you handle a

00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:05,219
conflict within your team or a

00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:09,449
difference of opinion because of that it

00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:11,819
I I think that that is is something that

00:48:09,449 --> 00:48:15,509
people know about about palantir about

00:48:11,819 --> 00:48:16,829
our team is that we we value many

00:48:15,509 --> 00:48:19,529
different opinions many different

00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:22,709
perspectives many different backgrounds

00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:26,309
and and then you know I have to get out

00:48:22,709 --> 00:48:28,650
I hear like you know so-and-so is doing

00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:31,319
some sessions about this and that and

00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:32,849
if if it's something that I can go to or

00:48:31,319 --> 00:48:34,109
I know someone on my team is going to go

00:48:32,849 --> 00:48:36,390
to I'm going to ask them to start

00:48:34,109 --> 00:48:38,039
talking to them this is actually one of

00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:41,099
the other interesting things is to get

00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:43,349
your introverts to actually network

00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:45,930
that's even crazier it was like just

00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:48,900
just ask them like either happy at their

00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:50,579
job you know like you know or find a way

00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:52,079
to like just say like what kind of

00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:54,210
challenges are you looking for and then

00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,440
tell them about palantir you know I mean

00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:57,539
quiet that's what we're here it's what

00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,119
we do right we share our stories we talk

00:48:57,539 --> 00:49:01,529
about how you know why why we love what

00:49:00,119 --> 00:49:03,480
we do and why you should come work with

00:49:01,529 --> 00:49:05,700
us so you got to strike that

00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,380
conversation so some of that is also

00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:08,910
about demonstrating it's a certain

00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:11,910
people if I know somebody could be a

00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:16,049
really good recruiter then I try to find

00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:18,059
a way to talk to them about that

00:49:16,049 --> 00:49:20,430
recruiting process so it could even just

00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:22,410
be through you know not in person

00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:24,089
because at palantir were where a semi

00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:26,160
distributed company it may just be

00:49:24,089 --> 00:49:28,740
through hipchat and I'll say like hey

00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,660
you know Steve I heard you're you're

00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:32,460
going to be speaking at this this camp

00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:34,079
in that camp and like you should really

00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:36,299
like I bet they're going to be people

00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,950
like this there or I see these sessions

00:49:36,299 --> 00:49:40,799
I see these people can you try to have a

00:49:37,950 --> 00:49:42,119
conversation with that person or reverse

00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:43,740
it because maybe I don't know this

00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:45,900
information that I say you're going to

00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:47,430
be at these camps do you think there's

00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:50,190
going to be any good people that that

00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:53,430
you feel like would would be would love

00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:56,039
working at palantir I try not to use the

00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:59,430
word sit anymore like oh this is a great

00:49:56,039 --> 00:50:01,950
fit at palantir it's not about that it's

00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:03,750
about I feel I feel quite strongly that

00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:06,839
it's about challenge about safe

00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:08,789
challenge but it's about always moving

00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:11,609
the target a little bit further that's

00:50:08,789 --> 00:50:14,130
how you retain I you know I've seen it

00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:16,859
in in at least in the last four years

00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:18,510
I've seen as that has been the greatest

00:50:16,859 --> 00:50:20,460
success for us is by keeping the

00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:22,380
conversations challenging by by

00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:24,510
listening to our team to find out what

00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:26,190
it is that that excites them and setting

00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:30,170
them up for success to find more people

00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:30,170
that they want to work with so

00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:39,870

00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,180

I want to keep around knowing that I'm
