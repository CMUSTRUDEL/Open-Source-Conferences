Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: 0 to MVP in 40 minutes
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	Coder and Themer are at it again! This time they have set aside their differences for a noble cause: VC money. Watch them brainstorm a brilliant idea for a web-mobile-2.0-interactive-app-thingie, and then build a fully functional Drupal 8 MVP in time for their meeting with the bank.

Startups and big organizations alike use rapid prototyping tools like AngularJS to show how an idea will look in practice. The decoupled power of Drupal 8, makes it the perfect place for information to be ingested, created, and re-mixed to become great content. Imagine a rapid prototype with real, enterprise-ready data consumption and modelling power!

In this session Coder and Themer will work together to create a web application that ingests content from an external API, performs content management tasks (data modelling, relationships, etc.) through the Drupal 8 interface, and delivers it all to an AngularJS frontend. We will build a data model, configure Drupal’s REST components to consume and export data, and integrate it all with a decoupled interface that you can access and use by the end of the session.

We’ll talk about Drupal’s successes and challenges spanning the gap between complex technology and empowering its end-users, between providing fertile ground for coders and getting business done.

You’ll leave this session with a new toolset for making that rapid prototype into a real, working MVP. That means fertile development ground for your coders, and faster time-to-market for your product.

	00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,359
we are office mates we live in cologne

00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:09,000
germany we rent a four-person office

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:13,500
together and have a couch in place of a

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,420
fourth desk Campbell and I are very loud

00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,060
in phone meetings Adams job is to

00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:24,510
complain about that a lot and storm out

00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:26,460
of the room so Campbell and Adam worked

00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,930
for four and one which is based in

00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,359
Washington DC there's a lot of great

00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:35,309
drupal a lot of nonprofit governmental

00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:37,140
kind of stuff Adam is a gamble Adam we

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:40,680
get confused all the time that that

00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,260
black ninja Campbell is a team lead back

00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,940
end developer project manager but he

00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:46,500
hates doing it why don't we do when we

00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:50,309
reduce ourselves cuz then i can say that

00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,870
okay so i'm a team lead technical team

00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,500
lead project manager but i hate doing

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:57,210
that also the three of us we share an

00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,609
office space though we don't necessarily

00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:01,500
all work together so my name is Campbell

00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:05,939
vertice you might know me as oh the huge

00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:08,760
manatee on do or various other places I

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,189
am a technical architect for forum one

00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,680
which means that I'm the lead at the

00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,060
developer side of build teams and I've

00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,450
been doing Drupal for 10 years

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:23,310
officially this con well scares the hell

00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:25,920
out of me yeah okay hi my name is Adam

00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:30,450
jaron i'm a senior front-end developer

00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:34,200
for forum one in Washington DC I've been

00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:36,780
a web developer for about 16 years I've

00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,210
done everything from logo design to

00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,619
schema design and so I'm really happy as

00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,220
a front-end developer where I get to

00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:48,060
touch all the parts and I've been doing

00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:52,590
Drupal for about did that sound back for

00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,600
about five years my name is Jam horn

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:57,180
Cologne on all of the social medias

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,130
including drupal.org I got started in

00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:03,180
Drupal about 2000 and looking at the

00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:04,979
slides today probably 2006 I had heard

00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,780
about it from robert douglas right since

00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,599
the very first triple con and I fell

00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,790
down this deep dark beautiful hole very

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,640
soon after I've been working for a

00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:18,219
since 2008 i started in aqua engineering

00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,950
in 2011 i moved to the dark side and

00:02:18,219 --> 00:02:23,170
I've been in marketing ever since then

00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,390
my current title is open source

00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:28,780
evangelist and I have the tremendous

00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:30,370
privilege to speak with a lot of Drupal

00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,959
audiences around the world coaching

00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:34,090
Drupal shops how to have better

00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,709
conversations about business benefits

00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,870
with potential clients rather than about

00:02:35,709 --> 00:02:40,299
widgets I talked with a lot of business

00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,340
people governments about the benefits of

00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:46,269
adopting open source practices and tools

00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:48,879
and I have also had the great privilege

00:02:46,269 --> 00:02:50,470
through the great Drupal 8 expansion to

00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,139
meet a lot of other open source

00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:57,340
communities that we are now going to

00:02:53,139 --> 00:03:00,489
have a lot to do with as I said we share

00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:02,109
an office especially I meet an awful lot

00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:04,659
of people and there's been a lot of hype

00:03:02,109 --> 00:03:07,180
about decoupling and headless and back

00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:09,639
and forth and what we're about to do

00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,930
stems from a couple of simultaneous

00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:16,120
ideas on the one hand when I'm out in

00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:20,069
let's say Symphony land or talking with

00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:24,430
framework people who essentially hate

00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:28,479
what we've done with their code okay

00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:30,370
they're really disturbed to see the

00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:32,919
fundamental design decision that we've

00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:37,620
taken as a project which is empower the

00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:40,599
end user make as much as possible

00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,310
available in the UI to configure to

00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:44,560
assemble so this whole idea of this

00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,090
beautiful system that we've got to

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,449
enable people to communicate build

00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:53,650
community realize their visions without

00:03:49,449 --> 00:03:56,139
necessarily having a coder there is is

00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,939
unique and it makes us it gives us

00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:59,379
incredible superpowers and I think it

00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:03,699
really gives us a power to change the

00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:06,099
world so my help in maybe six or eight

00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:08,590
months when Drupal 8 is out and really

00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:11,229
really singing the initial mental model

00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:13,389
I had for this session right comes out

00:04:11,229 --> 00:04:15,729
of a lot of office be essing that we do

00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:18,909
all the time and I want to be able to

00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:20,769
show up at a symphony conference at as

00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:22,979
some PHP conference at some other

00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:25,870
technology very coder heavy technology

00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:26,740
conference and build a Minimum Viable

00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,810
Product

00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,539
and launch it talking about business

00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:34,180
value in 40 minutes so go from here's a

00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:36,520
URL where there's nothing to here's this

00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:38,050
act I've done data modeling I've done

00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,819
you know views I've done all this

00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,900
content management and I'm exporting it

00:04:39,819 --> 00:04:42,370
to a couple of different things maybe

00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:46,419
not maybe an angular front whatever it

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:47,620
is and say hey this right how long would

00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:48,970
it take you to do this in content

00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,419
because in Drupal I can do it in 40

00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:54,970
minutes in the UI can I add to that

00:04:52,419 --> 00:04:57,729
please this is another way of saying

00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:03,460
that building your data data crunching

00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:05,080
in JavaScript sucks how many hands up

00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:08,560
anybody here who's worked with angular

00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:11,740
react or any of these other popular site

00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,960
right so keep your hands up if you've

00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:16,000
worked with it all right so how many of

00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,430
you thought that building the front end

00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,759
using those systems was easy keep your

00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,349
hands up I like to see some hands going

00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,880
down that makes me feel better I've only

00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:27,099
gone to the point where it's easy very

00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,990
recently all right now how many of you

00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:31,630
felt like once you got to the point

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,969
where you're doing your data analysis

00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:38,830
and actually combining data sources that

00:05:33,969 --> 00:05:40,930
have remained extremely easy right this

00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:43,300
is the least of the eight can fill a

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:45,430
super great content management system

00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:47,320
it's amazing at managing content

00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:50,110
whatever else anybody thinks about

00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:52,240
Drupal Drupal's more or less the best

00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:54,099
thing out there for managing content and

00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,080
Drupal 8 gives us some incredible

00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:59,319
superpowers to ingest data from anywhere

00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,650
and output it to anywhere in any format

00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:08,500
that we want in the end so another way

00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:10,150
to look at this feat that the technical

00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,949
side of i have nothing to do with is

00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,469
you're a founder you have an amazing

00:06:11,949 --> 00:06:16,240
idea until until now you really really

00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:19,210
need a hacker this idea of hackers and

00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,240
founders going together what if we

00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:24,280
empowered with Drupal 8 the founders

00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,199
that the visionaries the entrepreneurs

00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,150
to build a proof of concept to build an

00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:32,080
MVP to build something that works

00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:33,639
without a hacker right there i think

00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,370
that's amazing i think that that a lot

00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:39,430
of us could you know really get behind

00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:39,810
that idea there's also this funny idea

00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,360
and this

00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,650
the third way we can look at this

00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,660
because they're all these amazing front

00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:49,020
end things out there nowadays a lot of

00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,870
people are you know starting their

00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:55,110
project by building the front end and

00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:58,580
then they get kind of stuck and we can

00:06:55,110 --> 00:07:06,919
fill the gap there too so like please

00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:06,919
all right so we don't have many slides

00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:15,270
those of you who have seen our previous

00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:17,430
presentations know that we really prefer

00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,840
to do code demonstrations I think that

00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,979
most of the people who come to this our

00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,900
advanced enough to be able to follow

00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:25,350
along in code and so that's what we

00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,090
really want to show you so let's be

00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:28,979
clear about what the objective is here

00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,229
now in the past you've seen Adam and I

00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:32,760
working competing with each other we

00:07:31,229 --> 00:07:35,250
thought this is a great chance to see

00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,110
all right well what happens if Adam can

00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,610
run completely separately like this is

00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:40,260
the point of something like angular is

00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,600
that you can have a front end or who's

00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:43,950
totally separate from the data layer so

00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,930
we'll see about that so this is going to

00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:48,300
be headless Drupal 8 that everyone gets

00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:51,000
so excited about right now it is going

00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,250
to be a totally decoupled front end that

00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,050
you can serve a static HTML j/s in fact

00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,640
at the end we'll give you a link so you

00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,600
can see this served on github pages

00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:02,340
because it's that simple drupal 8 will

00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:04,919
be in the back end it's going to be

00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,479
ingesting data processing it doing

00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,740
really simple processing because I don't

00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,010
actually have that much time and

00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:12,240
spitting it out restfully so the only

00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:17,220
part you need to deal with in the in

00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:20,190
angular is this super super easy bit why

00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:22,430
would you do this if you happen to have

00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:25,919
team expertise in a front-end framework

00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,780
that has perhaps already built something

00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:32,430
for you because it was a little bit

00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:35,130
premature or maybe you're giving a

00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:37,050
drupalcon presentation I'm looking

00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,430
forward to the Buffs about headless

00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:40,979
Drupal I'm looking forward to the beers

00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:42,810
about headless Drupal even after having

00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,890
done this I don't know how convinced I

00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:48,750
am so it's a bit of a contrived example

00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:50,910
so what you need to make this happen to

00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,250
follow along at home you need somebody

00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,960
who understands the front

00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,300
front-end framework well enough to build

00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:58,730
one that's not a light requirement by

00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:01,610
the way the basics are easy but it gets

00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:05,560
hard you need a back-end platform that's

00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:11,200
capable and you need a presentation slot

00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:13,730
so this is oh no it doesn't do my nice

00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,860
no oh well I'm going to have to read to

00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:18,530
you what's in the what was supposed to

00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:20,630
be an overlay down there this is the

00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:23,630
slide that was chosen by the angularjs

00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:26,090
expert who gave us a ton of help form

00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:28,400
one developer Alex Ford absolutely

00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:30,650
phenomenal resource and saved my butt

00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,800
many times on this he chose this slide

00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:35,660
because he didn't want a real picture

00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,400
for the backend platform we have Drupal

00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,230
8 but it turned out that Drupal 8 wasn't

00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,590
actually capable of what I wanted it to

00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:45,590
do so the only reason we can do this

00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:47,630
presentation is because of the fantastic

00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:49,790
help from Mike Ryan and chicks in

00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:53,900
particular who are very friendly guys in

00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:55,910
IRC once you get them going this is the

00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,980
enormous patch that got spawned by this

00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:00,980
presentation it turns out that Drupal 8

00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:03,110
didn't have a way to ingest CSVs in any

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:06,320
kind of complex way so it involved

00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:08,000
actually writing the CSV plugin for my

00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,110
great module you can check this out and

00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,280
help out with it this week I'm thankful

00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:15,380
be to get it final yeah you're welcome

00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:19,490
it was a lot of weekend nights my wife

00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:21,830
wasn't happy so our starting point we

00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:24,770
have a complete angularjs frame that we

00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:26,120
consider proof-of-concept worthy we

00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,130
figured you're not here to learn angular

00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:33,500
so that ugly part we're happy to hide

00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:35,660
from you it looks like crap it uses just

00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,070
static data in the angular back end we

00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:41,690
have a structure there but it's just

00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:43,550
flat JSON that's getting returned that's

00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:45,050
all the key that's all the presentation

00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:46,790
part that we need to do does anybody

00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:50,570
have any questions before we start into

00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:52,730
actually what we're building okay 11

00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:55,700
name-check more before we get going as

00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:58,280
camel mentioned we've been yessing about

00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,420
this a lot in the office and a lot of

00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,089
the ideas that there are some really

00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:04,370
valid use cases and some great

00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:06,060
possibilities that we have I'd like to

00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:08,400
be very very clear that

00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:10,680
twig theming system that we've adopted

00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:13,700
for Drupal 8 is absolutely incredible

00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:16,440
and the Drupal implementation especially

00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:19,410
is amazing and things like with thee

00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,630
with the help turned on that'll give you

00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:24,270
the source of every single tag and give

00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:25,650
suggestions on super super classes to

00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:27,090
override everything it's utterly

00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,950
astonishing and we shouldn't just run

00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:30,840
away from that and there's a great blog

00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:32,700
post that talks about pretty much

00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,920
exactly what we're doing called headless

00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:38,310
Drupal the cake is alive by the user foo

00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,020
be in in Austria and and that's really

00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,310
really good resource worth looking at

00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,780
when you think about this stuff alright

00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,950
so we're going to turn it over to Adam

00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,650
who's going to walk you through how he

00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:50,100
built the front end using all of those

00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:52,010
nice front Dendy tools and didn't have

00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,330
to care that there was nothing behind it

00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:56,700
so we're going to start with one of

00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:58,410
those front end tools and mrs. is

00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,060
showing this is the the starting view

00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:02,450
this is what I was starting with and I

00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:05,220
go to my terminal and we're using Bauer

00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:08,010
because that was made my life easier

00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:12,060
Campbell did set up a what was it

00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:14,190
exactly the CSS I know I know set up our

00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:16,800
and grunted yeah it compiled CSS for us

00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:24,420
and so I use the bootstrap but then I

00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:30,060
decided say it again don't know if

00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:31,880
there's a good way anybody know the

00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:38,340
iTunes video player better than I do

00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:40,980
sorry now command + doesn't do it maybe

00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:44,840
if we did make the whole screen a

00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:44,840
different resolution let's try

00:12:49,450 --> 00:13:01,850
uh it's a screencast yeah oh that's a

00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:05,030
great idea let's see let's just see if

00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:10,580
this works and then if not that is no

00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:11,750
better this is the audience

00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:17,350
participation section of the

00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:17,350
presentation oh this is even worse

00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:49,890
this is also not really good ok zoom in

00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:55,980
command option + ok let's see better

00:13:49,890 --> 00:14:03,870
marginally more legible that's ok you

00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:11,040
got plenty of time you sound just like

00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:13,770
my clients ok but now I have no idea how

00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:18,660
to get out of this to get back to the no

00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:21,500
don't do that okay you can just sit in

00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,500
the background that's cool

00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:46,380
best for this plan oh thank you and now

00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:49,620
we try again any better man i'm still

00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:52,320
getting ahead of you guys I'm sorry you

00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,430
may just have to squint also because we

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,680
don't really have time to monkey around

00:14:53,430 --> 00:15:01,760
of this any other good suggestions will

00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:04,440
post these videos online and then yeah

00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,760
that's a really good idea so Adam you're

00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,140
really gonna have to describe what's

00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,550
going on that's okay that's what i was

00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:11,700
doing anyway call out the letters that

00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:13,290
you're typing yeah right no i will i

00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:16,590
will describe exactly what I'm doing as

00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:18,660
I'm doing it alright so here we are

00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:21,300
installing bootstrap because what we had

00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:24,570
before was kind of ugly but after doing

00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:27,510
some fun research I actually came across

00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:28,950
a theme for bootstrap called which got

00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,600
material design based off from to

00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:32,520
Google's material design which is what's

00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:37,980
on Android and I thought that was really

00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:39,570
cool so I would install that and one of

00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:41,700
the wallets doing that one of the goals

00:15:39,570 --> 00:15:44,490
I had for this was to make it as simple

00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:48,960
as possible and I decided that I would

00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:52,260
set the the restriction for myself that

00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:53,790
I would write no new CSS so everything

00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,600
you're going to see me do I'm only

00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:59,550
adding classes to the HTML of the

00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,210
angular framework hang their app so

00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:05,520
there we are really awesome photo site

00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:08,580
builder or a really bad aimer that's

00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:11,190
because i'm a really bad Famer so here i

00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:13,440
am i'm adding a container class to the

00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:15,600
main div and i think i'd pop back today

00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,830
and then you can see what that does we

00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,880
had off a container where you have some

00:16:16,830 --> 00:16:23,550
padding and then I'm let's see what am i

00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,490
doing where I can't even see that situ

00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:30,420
so I'm just adding classes to like this

00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:32,550
is the page header for the title giving

00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:35,190
it there's an existing class called

00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:39,310
jumbotron and it does cool things like

00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:43,650
that no CSS it was already there for

00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:47,020
I don't think I then I Center it boom

00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:54,510
it's very exciting right but I mean even

00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:56,710
a developer could do this yeah it's

00:16:54,510 --> 00:17:01,390
bootstrap material design on top of

00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:03,220
bootstrap same so now one of the cool

00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:05,770
things about material design it is has a

00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:09,910
ton of icons hundreds if not thousands

00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:12,189
and you can include them relatively

00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:13,750
easily and I'm just throwing in some

00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:15,280
classes for the button and then I'm

00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:19,600
going to tell it what kind of icon I

00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:21,280
want in that button this is all done

00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:24,880
with just adding a class or two right

00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:29,170
yeah I think I tell it I want it to be

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:31,810
blue or 10 lots of classes yeah i mean

00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:33,910
that's that's the plus or minus no new

00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:36,520
CSS but lots of oh there we go we have a

00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:38,170
little indigo blue star because the name

00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,470
of the app as you saw its state versus

00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:43,090
state it's our original session was

00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:46,929
coder versus themer and we thought this

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:49,000
would be a nice little play on that all

00:17:46,929 --> 00:17:54,850
right so now I'm adding a bunch of stars

00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,170
changing a few colors boom right pretty

00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:59,230
want to describe a bit but what the app

00:17:56,170 --> 00:18:03,340
does while you're sure so what this app

00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:05,650
does is that it well ultimately when we

00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:10,570
see campbell's part it parses data from

00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:12,490
the US Census based on state comparing

00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:14,050
the states on three key categories what

00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,540
were those categories kemple all these

00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:18,280
are the three most important categories

00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,620
for comparing any place that you might

00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,840
want to live this was very

00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:25,350
scientifically selected the number of

00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:25,350
single people

00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:34,280
was it number fiber-optic modems that's

00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:36,610
right how many fiber optic connections

00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:40,670
that are in the state also key and

00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:42,290
number of toilets you do not want to be

00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:45,530
trapped in one of the states that loses

00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:53,740
in that category tell you Alaska does

00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:53,740
not do well I know it's gone here we go

00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:02,690
so now I'm in the form and making it

00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:04,700
look pretty so that the drop downs don't

00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:10,190
look like plain old HTML elements and

00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:12,260
that they have a nice little frame to

00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,210
them for those of you that haven't used

00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,560
angular or a similar time wait hold on

00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:17,120
i'm going to interrupt you so what i'm

00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:19,520
doing here is one of the groups of

00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:24,680
preexisting classes allow you to layouts

00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:27,530
so that's a co l LG five i want it it

00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:30,200
comes out of the box with a 12 column

00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:32,630
grid layout and so I want the left

00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:34,400
column to be 5 the right comedy 5 in the

00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:38,240
little space in between with the the vs

00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:41,170
reverses to be too that's all done just

00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:43,160
by adding classes to your dip structure

00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,960
yeah for those of you that haven't used

00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,760
this kind of framework before this might

00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,590
be a bit confusing it allows you to

00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,890
separate out chunks of the page into

00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:54,920
separate HTML files so in index of HTML

00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:56,030
you define your own HTML element

00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,850
whatever the heck you want to call it

00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:01,360
and you can fill in and you can insert

00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:04,059
from another file so you cannot refuse

00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:06,940
so that this is called state hyphen form

00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:10,750
dot HTML and in index dot HTML it's

00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:13,510
referenced by a HTML tag called state

00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:17,290
dash form it's not div classical stay

00:20:13,510 --> 00:20:18,309
formats the element is state horn so

00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:25,450
here I'm still trying to make that

00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:27,850
pretty and i've added a panel heading to

00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:31,890
it panel title and I'm centering it I

00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:31,890
think I give it a background color I

00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:44,350
probably got confused right here oh and

00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:46,090
then I'm in the pain body panel body and

00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:53,230
then I'm going to drop the Select into

00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:57,240
there why don't you tell them Kimball

00:20:53,230 --> 00:21:01,540
wire using ng-repeat not ng options

00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:04,419
because I got confused a couple of

00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:08,110
different ways to skin a cat and I'm

00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:12,090
really bad at one of them difficult

00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:12,090
syntax all I really know is PHP

00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:34,910
all right come on Adam yeah this is just

00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:36,530
be writing HTML it's very exciting does

00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:38,150
anybody have any comments about how he's

00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:39,380
doing this wrong can you read well

00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:46,040
enough to tell us why he's doing it

00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:47,800
wrong how would you know it's all magic

00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:54,190
that you guys do in the front end anyway

00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:54,190
pretty much this is the office every day

00:22:01,929 --> 00:22:05,900
all right so i just copied the that

00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:10,309
structure i'm going to drop in change a

00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:12,650
few texts change variable change from

00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:17,090
the ng model because it's the second

00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:18,470
state get rid of that tighten up cuz you

00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:26,150
know what you want to H do I look good

00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:28,490
and all right almost there I do not one

00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:30,679
of the interesting things about these

00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:32,240
panel headings and tight titles that I'm

00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:35,570
probably trying to figure out right then

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:38,510
as I'm doing that is uh wondering why

00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:44,150
this isn't working no not grow i'm using

00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:46,520
firefox for this chrome had like 30 tabs

00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:48,679
open anyone else have lots of tabs open

00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:53,990
under a good basis yeah alright solid

00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:56,630
eight ER solidarity this is almost

00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:59,090
entirely unedited i see almost entirely

00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:00,559
because at some point i got panicked and

00:22:59,090 --> 00:23:02,690
told that him to stop because the back

00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:06,500
end wasn't in place but i didn't need

00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:08,980
the back end so this is me where i

00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:11,179
figured out that oh I needed the panel I

00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:14,780
think heading class around the panel

00:23:11,179 --> 00:23:20,490
title class to make the CSS work

00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:23,910
properly it had a direct

00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:27,870
just descendant selector on it if that

00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:29,400
means anything to anyone here that

00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:32,340
didn't mean anything to me explain that

00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,890
a bit better basically the CSS was

00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:36,750
particular about what class had to be

00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:39,960
below the next class in order to get

00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:42,800
that blue border on top which you'll see

00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:45,150
again when I changed that color to

00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:48,300
indigo I think we're Knights enter the

00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:50,490
text yeah you'll see it again in a

00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:54,570
second the first time you saw it there

00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:57,630
was no the selected US state was a did

00:23:54,570 --> 00:24:01,260
not have the blue background so it's

00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:02,790
because of needed div class panel

00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:05,640
heading and right below that div class

00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:10,290
panel title and if it wasn't the direct

00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:17,370
child wasn't going to work small details

00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:20,640
ah now I'm making the adding the form

00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:22,980
control class and Firefox doesn't render

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,720
select very nicely but you do get that

00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:27,660
cool green underlined you'll see right

00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:35,130
there boom it animates in chrome but

00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:36,960
like I said I had 30 tabs open it

00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:43,750
animates and firefox to if you do your

00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:45,640
updates Adam bite me

00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:47,820
anyway so here we're going to make the

00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:51,070
the fight button look a little prettier

00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:53,470
make it orange I probably could have

00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:55,360
used an orange class but they're well I

00:24:53,470 --> 00:25:06,520
already knew about the BTM dash warning

00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:09,210
in material design so I was lazy there

00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:20,310
it is but it should be in the center

00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:20,310
let's fix that text centered so easy yay

00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:31,210
center that and make it larger like an

00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:33,160
h1 alright we're happy with that and now

00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:34,930
we're going to go on to the result set

00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:41,770
so I'm going to pick a couple states

00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:45,760
which we're he had hard-coded in yep Pam

00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:49,680
reverses there you go there you go there

00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,680
are the hard-coded results

00:25:52,810 --> 00:26:08,090
so go to the result and let's see what

00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:09,890
we're going to do so you can see I think

00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:13,960
right at the top there's an NG show

00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:17,780
which is yeah right there and says if

00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:20,480
this is the winner then add the text at

00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:21,890
a span which has the text dash winter

00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,640
but I wanted to do something more

00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:28,100
interesting with colors so we added

00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,050
adding an NG class at the same

00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:33,740
comparison with a ternary operator and

00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:37,550
I'm going to tell it to make the the

00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:41,590
heading green if it's the winner and the

00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:41,590
heading red if it's not

00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:03,230
and i miss something clearly

00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:23,070
yes please yeah so it'll be the question

00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:25,020
for us for the recording I'm assuming

00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:28,590
that there's a mock service set up to

00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:31,020
provide the answers we didn't have a

00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:32,940
service all we had was the ball i'll

00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:35,360
show you and we get to my video but all

00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,440
we had was the controller initializing

00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:40,350
initializing variables that are in scope

00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:46,200
and since they're flat variables there's

00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:51,510
no need for a service yet so see if it

00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:52,560
works this time and the answer is no but

00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:55,080
one of the cool things this is

00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:57,210
demonstrating is that front end

00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:02,160
developers these days don't actually

00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:04,170
need to wait for the the back end to be

00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,660
completely done especially with these

00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:11,280
types of frameworks but the same can be

00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:14,010
true in a normal Drupal project a form

00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,990
one we use pattern lab which is a great

00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:17,940
front end tool a bit of a learning curve

00:28:15,990 --> 00:28:19,590
but it allows theming to happen

00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:22,890
concurrently with development if not

00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:26,250
before and then you guys then we have to

00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:27,660
wrestle spar really what the developers

00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:32,820
to figure out who's going to handle the

00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:35,580
layout issues this is where I figure out

00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:38,160
why my colors aren't showing up because

00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:40,730
I needed that pain panel heading class

00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,730
again

00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:58,030
oh yes so additionally going back to the

00:28:55,210 --> 00:29:03,360
icons so many icons thumbs up thumbs

00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:06,460
down so using ng showed this time if

00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:12,700
this is the this partial is being used

00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:15,610
for both state result pains and so if

00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:18,160
this is the winner I'm gonna next to the

00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:22,140
state title give it a thumbs up if it's

00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:22,140
the loser it'll get the thumbs down if

00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:30,460
there are other questions while we're

00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:37,060
doing this this is a very good time yep

00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:39,120
it's a little slow for a second yeah go

00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,120
ahead

00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:49,190
yep just a JSON object there's actually

00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:51,380
two times that it makes well what will

00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:52,990
be callbacks to services the first time

00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:55,010
is to get the list of available States

00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:57,020
because theoretically maybe you don't

00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:58,970
have data for all of the states and so

00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:00,649
you don't want to offer a handful on the

00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:04,090
second time is actually get the results

00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:15,529
for the given states yeah they're just

00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:17,950
statically defined for now yep its

00:30:15,529 --> 00:30:23,059
popular could've just as easily been the

00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:24,860
differences backbone is not as out of

00:30:23,059 --> 00:30:26,750
the box I think the actually there's a

00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:28,309
stronger case for working with backbone

00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:30,020
in conjunction with the system like

00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:32,090
electro ball whereas angular is really

00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:34,789
built around the concept of this is

00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:38,360
going to provide your entire entire

00:30:34,789 --> 00:30:39,590
experience I'm sure good back when

00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,600
people would complain that that's not

00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:44,570
right but that's the way I see it what

00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:46,039
about it could totally have been done

00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:49,250
and react but hardly anyone's using it

00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:52,640
yet outside of the Facebook's so part of

00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:56,440
the point of this exercise is to show

00:30:52,640 --> 00:31:00,590
that what Drupal does can be just

00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:04,070
outputted by drupal as a Drupal site or

00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:07,100
a responsive you know web app or be the

00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:08,899
back end of a native app or put data

00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:11,360
into anything else that needs data and

00:31:08,899 --> 00:31:14,090
in any format so next step you could

00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:16,159
actually have this output powering a

00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:18,020
proper website and a proper native app

00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,840
and we don't have to change anything

00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:22,820
about what he does except the final

00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:26,210
service that outputs it so here we are

00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:30,440
in index that HTML you can maybe see the

00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:36,409
state there I am there's a state form

00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:39,110
tag itself I'm adding some layouts to

00:31:36,409 --> 00:31:42,049
this the layout classes so that it

00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:46,200
aligns underneath the selects that I had

00:31:42,049 --> 00:31:49,090
already themed I guess

00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,110
is it seeming if you don't write CSS I

00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:52,929
don't know that's a very good question

00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:55,950
the website is built and no one writes

00:31:52,929 --> 00:32:01,390
in ecss doesn't make a sound there we go

00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:04,090
boom oh now I'm just demonstrating its

00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:10,059
already responsive because it's

00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:18,700
bootstrap there you go okay would you

00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:19,750
hit possible so I'm going to jump

00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,100
through this a bit because you don't

00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:23,289
have to watch 20 minutes of repetitive

00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:26,260
Drupal 8 but this is starting from a

00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:27,309
totally clean d8 site and the first

00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:30,190
thing we're going to do is we're going

00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:32,260
to define the taxonomy that's going to

00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:34,750
be States so I mentioned that what we're

00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:36,940
doing is really simple data crunching

00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:39,880
bike i'm using crunching very liberally

00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:42,130
here we're going to take in I think it's

00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,779
three no four different data sets and

00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:46,630
we're going to relate them to each other

00:32:43,779 --> 00:32:48,419
by a common field by state so first we

00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:51,820
have to create that state taxonomy

00:32:48,419 --> 00:32:55,720
that's done now i'm using drupal console

00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:59,950
to generate a module so drupal generate

00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:01,809
module and it gives me a nice set of

00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:04,210
prompts that allow me to not know

00:33:01,809 --> 00:33:07,179
anything about drupal 8 code and still

00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:10,179
create a module which is always kind of

00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:13,380
a weird use case in my mind so we're

00:33:10,179 --> 00:33:15,669
creating one called cv cv st import

00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:19,929
telling it has dependency on my great

00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:21,250
and my great plus and then triple

00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:22,450
console throws an error because that's

00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:24,690
one of the things that's very good at

00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:24,690
doing

00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:33,460
am I doing here oh I'm just going to

00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:35,110
make make the directories so in

00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,400
approaching this I first thought that I

00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:38,440
was going to do this using Twitter data

00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:41,110
turns out the Twitter module four dat

00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,790
even though it's even though it's

00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:45,190
supposed to be reasonably stable isn't

00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:46,390
turns out the OAuth module for Drupal 8

00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:49,420
even though it's supposed to be stable

00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:51,340
isn't so the last fall back was well we

00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:54,310
know that we've got my great module in

00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:56,560
d8 right so we can just use my grade

00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:58,750
like it would in d7 to import from a

00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:04,150
static data source we can import from

00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:07,690
census gov CSVs so hands up if you've

00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:09,580
used rupal eight migrated yet yeah okay

00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:13,240
so have you hands up in views Drupal 7

00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:17,200
migrate all right so Drupal 8 migrate is

00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:18,460
only for Drupal to Drupal migrations it

00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:20,890
has the basic framework there's a

00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:22,270
separate module d2d migrate and it

00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:24,370
doesn't have any of those nice sources

00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:27,880
for CSV i mentioned i had to add one it

00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:29,260
also doesn't have a UI these were

00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,090
important things for me to know who

00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:33,730
before i proposed a session about this

00:34:31,090 --> 00:34:36,160
so actually the way you define a

00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:38,470
migration in Drupal 8 is just by writing

00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,360
a llamo file it lives in your cut in a

00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:43,840
custom module in a in a subdirectory

00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:46,270
config / install you name it after your

00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:49,150
migration and it's actually quite simple

00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:52,300
there's three there's three pieces to

00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:55,840
this llamo file the top if you can read

00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:58,720
that it says ID States label state terms

00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:02,350
and some general group information the

00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:04,090
second section says is about the source

00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:06,400
so we get to say okay well this is

00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:08,320
coming from a CSV that's the plug-in we

00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,660
want here are the arguments that that

00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,870
plug-in need so in the case of a CSV we

00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:15,190
need to know what's the path I'm just

00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:20,290
verifying that it's actually called

00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:21,910
state yeah that is what I'm verifying we

00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:23,710
have to know that it's got what the path

00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:26,020
is are there header rows what's the

00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:28,060
unique key all that kind of stuff the

00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:29,320
next section is process that's where you

00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:31,660
get to put in what are the field

00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,430
mappings and the field mappings are

00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:36,040
really simple and deposit for a second

00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:37,710
it really is Drupal name of field colon

00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,540
csv name of field

00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:41,970
if there's anything more complicated

00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:43,920
than a direct one-to-one mapping you get

00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:45,780
to use a plug-in and that's the same so

00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,180
this is the Vig field that my mouse is

00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:50,640
around right now and we say the plug-in

00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:52,170
is default value because I just want it

00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,820
to be the same for every line that's

00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:59,220
imported the default value is states

00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:01,530
actually way easier than it then writing

00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:04,680
a seven migration it's just it's kind of

00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:06,540
too bad that there's no UI for the last

00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,700
section is destination and all we have

00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,980
to do is say this is handled by the

00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:16,020
entity plug-in and it's a taxonomy term

00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:26,070
entity so that's it now I'm going to

00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:28,470
enable the module yep yes the question

00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:30,660
is is it possible to add more processing

00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:33,300
in Drupal 8 migrate and it absolutely is

00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:36,270
you can actually chain plugins like that

00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:39,000
so you could start for example i wrote a

00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:42,030
plug-in that's to identify a taxonomy

00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,270
term by name and vocabulary and then you

00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:47,010
could use that and then add munch the

00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:48,599
title a little bit if you want it you

00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:50,820
can chain them one after the other I

00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:53,339
wrote that plug in the week before we

00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:56,609
removed attacks on taxonomy references

00:36:53,339 --> 00:37:05,280
as a field type in core so it's not

00:36:56,609 --> 00:37:07,550
useful anymore another question yeah I

00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,920
wrote it and it's on it's on drupal.org

00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:13,349
so so I repeat the question where did I

00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,330
get the CSV plugin so migrate in core

00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:17,940
doesn't include the sources for things

00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:20,820
like CSV there is a project called

00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:22,440
migrate underscore plus that's the

00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,820
staging ground for all the stuff we

00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,280
would like to ultimately put into my

00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,869
great my great core this is very

00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:30,030
important and you're going to watch me

00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:31,349
enable it in a minute this is very

00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:33,990
important if you want to do a migration

00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:35,849
because it contains things like add rush

00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:39,810
integration so you can run a migration

00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:43,020
it doesn't exist in core yet now it

00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:44,099
contains now it contains the CSV plugin

00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:46,290
and it's going to have a few other ones

00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:49,290
by the end of the week hopefully so i

00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:51,079
just installed my great module my great

00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:54,529
plus so i have those drush commands

00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:56,809
and my own custom module and cleared the

00:37:54,529 --> 00:37:58,759
cache and now i'm running drush mi

00:37:56,809 --> 00:38:02,839
states states being the name of my new

00:37:58,759 --> 00:38:04,369
migration and it runs and despite the

00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:05,599
fact that it comes up with a big air

00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:07,999
because that's one of the things that

00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:10,670
Drupal 8 is good at it says at the

00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:12,739
bottom fifty two items imported

00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:14,209
successfully done with States so I'm

00:38:12,739 --> 00:38:16,999
going to go back here and have a look

00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:18,440
and let's just see very important

00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:19,789
actually validate your migration you're

00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,979
going to see a couple to go wrong here

00:38:19,789 --> 00:38:24,219
soon but this one I think is just fine

00:38:21,979 --> 00:38:27,650
we'll have a look for terms in state

00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:31,089
like magic there's our Terms & state it

00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:31,089
took me weeks to make that happen

00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:36,229
alright so now we're going to add a

00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:39,140
content type and I decided to do this

00:38:36,229 --> 00:38:41,630
with one content type for each discrete

00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:43,670
source of data expecting that you might

00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:45,349
want to have quite different structures

00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:47,180
for different different sources of data

00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:53,630
so the first thing I'm going to import

00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:56,630
is what are we doing first huh number of

00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:58,459
toilets so this is a content type called

00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:01,519
toilets I'm just adding a field using

00:38:58,459 --> 00:39:04,839
the normal field you I this is a float

00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:06,709
for a number of toilets in the state

00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:09,410
great now I'm going to add another

00:39:06,709 --> 00:39:10,910
fields totally normal field you I term

00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:12,440
reference right we're going to we're

00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:18,859
going to reference that taxonomy term

00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:28,430
for state another question actually yes

00:39:18,859 --> 00:39:30,319
sometimes yes urinals are only three

00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:36,099
fifths of a toilet right something like

00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:39,319
that so here is the migration and now

00:39:36,099 --> 00:39:40,789
I'm going to start by creating a new

00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:43,209
migrated file and then I realized that

00:39:40,789 --> 00:39:46,009
stupid i'm just going to copy and paste

00:39:43,209 --> 00:39:48,170
because i can never remember quite all

00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:50,749
of the fields in there actually the best

00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:52,339
purpose of the d2d migrate module when

00:39:50,749 --> 00:39:55,430
you're doing something like this is it

00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:56,869
is a wealth of examples when you think

00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:59,780
about it they have to create a separate

00:39:56,869 --> 00:40:01,910
migration for every little detail in DC

00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:04,520
so everything from the variables that

00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:06,770
you set for site-wide information to the

00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:09,740
taxonomy vocabulary to the taxonomy

00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:12,200
terms it's very helpful so here I'm

00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:13,700
looking at my data source trying to

00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,290
figure out first of all which of the

00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:17,030
almost identically named files I'm

00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:18,890
looking for and secondly trying to

00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:24,980
figure out what is the actual column

00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:29,810
header that I want I think i'm going to

00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:35,240
skip ahead well i'm going to skip ahead

00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:38,660
just a little bit here right so this is

00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:41,350
the same migrate llamo file and what we

00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:43,970
see is now the now the difference is

00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:47,840
it's a different CSV file in the point

00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:51,830
in the CSV source we have different

00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:53,600
fields one thing this is another example

00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:55,790
of a plug-in that I'm doing for the node

00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:58,700
title is concatenating two strings I

00:40:55,790 --> 00:41:00,170
have to define a constant under source

00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:02,000
and I can concatenate that with the

00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:08,710
geography so this will come up saying

00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:10,880
Alabama colon toilets as the title and

00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:12,530
here we're setting what is the fields

00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,040
title that we want so this is the simple

00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:17,270
use case field under school toilets is

00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:22,910
copy and paste whatever your CSV

00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:24,320
titleist field state term so this is

00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:26,300
another plug-in that you're going to use

00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,460
a lot the plug-in is called migration

00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:30,650
this means that there's going to be some

00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:33,740
kind of unique identifier in the value

00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:36,020
for this field it's not gonna match a

00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:38,180
Drupal unique identifier right the rose

00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:40,700
in my toilets sheet their unique

00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:42,440
identifiers the name of a state and drew

00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:44,090
when Drupal goes to import that it tries

00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,440
to put the name of a state in a taxonomy

00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:48,140
reference term it's going to bork

00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,570
because that's not a taxonomy ID so we

00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:52,430
use this migration plug-in to say look

00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:55,340
up in this previous migration you did

00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:58,010
called States something that's matching

00:41:55,340 --> 00:42:01,810
the geography field then pull out the

00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:04,700
tid and use that as the imported value

00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:07,099
this is also even easier than it wasn't

00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:09,390
d7 and I quite liked it in d 7

00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:14,219
so now we're going to run the migration

00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:15,869
oh no this is very important actually

00:42:14,219 --> 00:42:17,459
notice that the animal files are in

00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:20,029
config installed that means they're only

00:42:17,459 --> 00:42:22,319
parsed when the module is installed

00:42:20,029 --> 00:42:24,660
which means every time you add a new one

00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:26,729
you have to run drush see I am to

00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:29,400
re-import the configuration from that

00:42:26,729 --> 00:42:32,459
from that file from that directory so it

00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,880
finds a new one now we run my toilets

00:42:32,459 --> 00:42:37,769
and can you guys see all those errors

00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,479
that's not just Drupal 8 that's actually

00:42:37,769 --> 00:42:41,099
important so what is really what it's

00:42:39,479 --> 00:42:43,859
complaining about is missing the bundle

00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:45,089
for the entity type and that's when i

00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:47,849
realized that i forgot to change

00:42:45,089 --> 00:42:52,079
destination it's not a taxonomy term

00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:56,039
it's actually node and I think there's

00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,900
one other oh no I got title this time so

00:42:56,039 --> 00:43:02,880
this is another thing that's missing in

00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:05,459
my grade 8 anyway to revert so I do rush

00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:11,670
SQL see and I truncate the table the

00:43:05,459 --> 00:43:13,949
migrated map table it's not clean but it

00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:15,900
works and I get those errors again

00:43:13,949 --> 00:43:19,319
anybody have a guess as to why i got

00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:23,489
those airs again because i didn't mari

00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:24,959
import the configuration duh this one

00:43:23,489 --> 00:43:28,499
took me an hour to figure out the first

00:43:24,959 --> 00:43:32,910
time it's brutal here so I'm going to

00:43:28,499 --> 00:43:36,420
re-import that migration now we're going

00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:38,039
to run the migration again now we just

00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:39,959
get the air that we were expecting and

00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:42,449
it says 52 item is imported successfully

00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:44,729
we'll have a look and see Magic imported

00:43:42,449 --> 00:43:46,499
content so all I do for the rest of this

00:43:44,729 --> 00:43:48,599
video is bit well for most of us this

00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:52,259
video is copy and paste and tweak the

00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:57,329
values in that yamo file so what you

00:43:52,259 --> 00:44:00,989
could see back there is that it let's

00:43:57,329 --> 00:44:03,420
look at Mississippi toilets and you can

00:44:00,989 --> 00:44:05,220
see sentences you never thought you'd

00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:08,310
say into a microphone

00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:19,950
please just let's have a look at the

00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:21,450
Mississippi toilets oh so you can see we

00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:23,400
did successfully get a decimal number

00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:25,230
for the number of toilets we did

00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,210
successfully associate it with a state

00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:29,609
term that's wonderful now we can move on

00:44:27,210 --> 00:44:31,920
to copying and pasting another yamel

00:44:29,609 --> 00:44:33,150
file so I'm going to create another

00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,470
content type and we're just going to

00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:36,240
skip over this because you don't need to

00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:42,359
watch that many times unless people want

00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:43,710
to write yeah that's what I thought so

00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:47,070
what am I doing here am I just closing

00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:49,349
these more yamo you know you're making

00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:51,720
me look bad since I made them watch my

00:44:49,349 --> 00:44:57,349
entire video it's what gave me the idea

00:44:51,720 --> 00:45:00,800
Adam the torture you're welcome haha oh

00:44:57,349 --> 00:45:03,420
this is me reverting another migration

00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,220
when it actually managed to create the

00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:07,530
nodes but doesn't have the values in it

00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:09,420
so now we have to truncate the map table

00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:12,480
we have to re-import on our improved

00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:19,109
config file and actually go in and

00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:23,099
delete all the nodes manually just like

00:45:19,109 --> 00:45:25,980
this so old school you don't realize the

00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:29,550
little things that you miss working with

00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:31,170
d8 alright so we delete a bunch of nodes

00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:34,220
that's great it's going to I can tell

00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:34,220
you right now that it's going to work

00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:40,800
yeah there we go so once all of our

00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:43,050
content is imported now we've got three

00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:46,470
content types and a taxonomy taxonomy

00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:49,050
type all populated with data now we have

00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:50,730
to do the rest endpoint how many people

00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:54,930
have done a rest endpoint in Drupal 8 so

00:45:50,730 --> 00:45:59,760
far it's super easy how many people have

00:45:54,930 --> 00:46:01,770
used views in seven it's identical all

00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,619
you gotta do is enable this one module

00:46:01,770 --> 00:46:06,599
called rest web services and it offers

00:46:04,619 --> 00:46:10,440
you a new kind of view so here add new

00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:13,849
view states and even in the wizard I can

00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:13,849
say it's a rest export

00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:21,610
taxonomy view would get need to give it

00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:21,610
some kind of a URL good question title

00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:30,020
and restful I didn't need to use restful

00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:34,040
so I didn't bother and frankly the the

00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:37,010
state of non-core is such that I didn't

00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:40,010
want to risk it everything is breaking

00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:43,250
on a weekly basis at this point despite

00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:44,690
the best efforts of good contributors so

00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:46,430
now we're creating the second one the

00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:48,260
second view which is going to actually

00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:52,880
offer state data if you give it an

00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:56,570
argument so even if you can't read that

00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:58,070
you can see that it's just like the

00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:59,930
regular views interface there's an

00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:01,820
absolutely no magic that's different

00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:05,960
here except that what gets output in the

00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:07,730
preview is now rest I think I managed to

00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:12,410
do this in record time working with

00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:15,650
views so we're going to say provide a

00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:18,320
default value and we want to say query

00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:21,130
parameter because that's most reliable

00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:28,880
for me with my JavaScript fields

00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:30,320
JavaScript skills rather okay and we'll

00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,640
have validation and that's going to

00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,640
that's the end of that view

00:47:36,210 --> 00:47:42,930
I'm just selecting the fields just like

00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:45,859
you normally do and in 30 seconds or so

00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:50,070
we're going to just test this state data

00:47:45,859 --> 00:47:51,780
? state ID is I had to double check what

00:47:50,070 --> 00:48:03,000
the parameter is but state ID is we'll

00:47:51,780 --> 00:48:07,080
just pick a number 53 can anybody read

00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,990
the rest no no but it's okay because

00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:12,150
angular will be able to that's it that's

00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:19,550
all I had to do to be able to create a

00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:21,540
rest back end in Drupal so whoa so I

00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:23,420
said that we're not going to teach you

00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:25,349
guys angular there's going to be a

00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:27,150
35-second video to show you how we

00:48:25,349 --> 00:48:29,970
modified the angular to make it take

00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:32,280
this rest this rest back end because

00:48:29,970 --> 00:48:34,970
it's totally normal I'm going to turn on

00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,970
the volume maximum

00:48:54,860 --> 00:49:00,030
so all I'm doing is I add two services

00:48:57,870 --> 00:49:03,750
using HTTP they don't even have any

00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:06,330
failover totally simple for anybody who

00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:14,970
knows angular and in the end we have our

00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:22,470
out in one second all right now go back

00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:29,640
to the browser sorry for the deafening

00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:33,300
guys why can't I go back to my it's okay

00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:35,160
you guys can save you oh that's why so

00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:38,280
if you are interested in having a look

00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:40,020
at the code for yourself we have the

00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:43,050
front end completely separate that's

00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:45,930
hosted it on github you can see this on

00:49:43,050 --> 00:49:49,440
github pages as well which i guess i can

00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:51,150
show you and the back end is also on get

00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,180
that's where i'm continuing to work on

00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:55,770
that on when I work on my great plus so

00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:57,720
we're just going to do you a quick demo

00:49:55,770 --> 00:50:08,250
of what the final state versus state is

00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:09,690
like versus 220 actually maybe it

00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:10,740
doesn't work on the github now I think

00:50:09,690 --> 00:50:13,070
about it maybe I have to do it on

00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:13,070
localhost

00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:22,940
things you should prepare before your

00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,940
presentation

00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:38,390
it's the shortest one I've got thank you

00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:40,860
ma'am all right so this is using our

00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:42,530
this is using the tablet layer now

00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:44,970
because of the size of the screen

00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:46,620
because I used views to provide the

00:50:44,970 --> 00:50:49,200
backend did anybody notice that I did

00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:50,760
not remember to take off the limitation

00:50:49,200 --> 00:51:00,270
on the number of results we only get ten

00:50:50,760 --> 00:51:02,100
states to work with touch wood oh and i

00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:05,040
got my field definition wrong for cable

00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:14,550
modems what a pity anyway so it works

00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:15,750
any other questions before we get we're

00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:18,600
going to need to follow on support

00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:26,160
contracts for this client just to clean

00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:27,630
up a few last things question yep mostly

00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,970
because it was so eat and repeat the

00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:32,160
question did we have to rest services

00:51:29,970 --> 00:51:34,830
yes mostly because it's so easy to

00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:36,120
create rest endpoints that why not if

00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:37,980
the end goal is a drupalcon

00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:48,540
demonstration sure we'll do like ten

00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:49,830
rest endpoints that's cool ah that's

00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:52,260
really good question I could have done

00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:53,670
at that why do I have three content

00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:55,320
types instead of one content type with

00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:56,760
three fields it's a good question it

00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:59,910
could absolutely have worked with one

00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:01,890
content type and three fields when I

00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:03,900
started planning this the idea was to

00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:05,790
have actually much more divergent data

00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:08,100
sources than that and take in more data

00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:09,750
but in the end trying to keep it simple

00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:14,910
into something we can show in half an

00:52:09,750 --> 00:52:17,090
hour or 45 minutes had to simplify other

00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:17,090
questions

00:52:28,930 --> 00:52:51,380
github repos for you so the question is

00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:53,060
this is to separate repos to separate

00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:55,490
apps what would I do in a production

00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:58,160
environment in terms of I guess

00:52:55,490 --> 00:53:01,160
repository structure is your question I

00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:03,980
would keep it actually separate I do

00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:07,190
that because they have wildly divergent

00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:09,980
requirements the place where I'm hosting

00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:11,660
Drupal 8 needs way more horsepower needs

00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:13,610
way more tolerance and a totally

00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:15,440
different system in team actually and

00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:16,940
where I'm putting the front end just

00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,900
needs to be able to handle a ton of load

00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:22,310
and basically sort of flat HTML you

00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:25,010
could serve those out of the same box

00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:31,420
but they would still be out of different

00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:31,420
doc routes last question

00:53:36,260 --> 00:53:41,030
very good question why couldn't we just

00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:48,260
put the angular in a theme since it's

00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:51,790
all front-end code because if you're

00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:54,320
going to use drupal theming layer anyway

00:53:51,790 --> 00:53:56,690
what are you going to use angular for

00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:59,210
drupal steaming layer is already tightly

00:53:56,690 --> 00:54:01,310
bound with the back end you don't need

00:53:59,210 --> 00:54:06,200
to have a rest webservice to get the

00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:10,340
back to get the back end its it would

00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:12,080
make it even sillier especially it's

00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:14,990
worth noting jus plates theme layer

00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:18,590
out-of-the-box responsive extremely

00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:21,050
machine readable multilingual lots of

00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:22,760
great perks that you lose when you're

00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:26,690
using when you're using a third-party

00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:28,790
front end like this so when you put the

00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:32,570
angular into the drupal theme you're

00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:34,550
really spitting in its eye alright guys

00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:35,900
thank you very much for coming we will

00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:39,250
be around the conference and happy to

00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:39,250
