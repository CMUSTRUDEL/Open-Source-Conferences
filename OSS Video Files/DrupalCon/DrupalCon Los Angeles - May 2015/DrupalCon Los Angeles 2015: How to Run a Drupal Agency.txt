Publication date: 2015-05-13
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	We're open with our software, so why can't we be just as open with the tools and ideas we use to run our businesses? 

In an entertaining talk, Steve looks at some of the hard lessons that founders of Drupal agencies have learned the hard way so you don't have to:

How to define what you do and what makes you different
How to select and win the 'right' clients
How to build a great team
How to sell web projects
How to manage client accounts
How to actually be profitable and stay in business!
He'll share tools and approaches that you can take away and use in your business.



Steve Parks has been running businesses since he was 25 â€” learning through plenty of mistakes as well as successes. 

Now, as one of the management team of Wunderkraut, the largest European Drupal agency employing over 150 people in 10 countries, he shares some of the lessons learned along the way.

Steve was one of the founding team of Wunderkraut, leads the UK team (where it is known as Wunder) and also leads the group's consulting business. He has also written a number of books on entrepreneurship, published in multiple countries and languages by Pearson.
