Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: How to Run a Drupal Agency
Publication date: 2015-05-13
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	We're open with our software, so why can't we be just as open with the tools and ideas we use to run our businesses? 

In an entertaining talk, Steve looks at some of the hard lessons that founders of Drupal agencies have learned the hard way so you don't have to:

How to define what you do and what makes you different
How to select and win the 'right' clients
How to build a great team
How to sell web projects
How to manage client accounts
How to actually be profitable and stay in business!
He'll share tools and approaches that you can take away and use in your business.



Steve Parks has been running businesses since he was 25 â€” learning through plenty of mistakes as well as successes. 

Now, as one of the management team of Wunderkraut, the largest European Drupal agency employing over 150 people in 10 countries, he shares some of the lessons learned along the way.

Steve was one of the founding team of Wunderkraut, leads the UK team (where it is known as Wunder) and also leads the group's consulting business. He has also written a number of books on entrepreneurship, published in multiple countries and languages by Pearson.

well good afternoon it's exactly 3 45

00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:11,400
and I promise to finish at exactly or

00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:13,620
before 445 my name is Steve parks this

00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,199
talk is how to run a drupal agency if

00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,690
you are here to find out about the

00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,520
Drupal render pipeline you're in the

00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:22,350
wrong room so now is your chance to

00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,960
shift you might prefer to hear about

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:26,820
that anyway it's upstairs so I'm from a

00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,400
chemical wonder with the largest Drupal

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,170
agency in Europe but not doing too much

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,230
yet in the states that may change in the

00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,570
future and as I say the talk is on how

00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:40,320
to run a Drupal agency now the prime

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,300
focus for this talk is those people who

00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,430
are in management positions in the

00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,840
Drupal agency already and want to grow

00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,520
it or deal with some of the issues

00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,590
they're facing while those who would

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:52,230
like to run a Drupal agency but there

00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,750
are secondary audiences to this talk

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,460
those who work in Drupal agencies and

00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,559
want to understand the part they can

00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,320
play and the way that things work can

00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,899
about top and those who are contractors

00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,280
or freelancers I want to understand a

00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,110
little bit more about the business of

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,650
agencies and whether that's something

00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,960
that they could do themselves as well

00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:15,509
now i want to just stress that like

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,729
everybody in this room i am an absolute

00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:23,790
expert at this topic there is that

00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:25,799
disclaimer so this is just literally the

00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,780
stuff that I've tried stuff that I fail

00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,180
that some stuff that's work and it's

00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:33,240
sharing we do have a policy within

00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,720
wonder of extreme transparency and the

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,520
policy is open by default so we are

00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,549
willing to share practically anything

00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:43,890
except our HR records for example but

00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:45,210
anything else is out there to share and

00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:46,979
I'll provide you with URL of where you

00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,770
can download all the sorts of tools and

00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,390
resources that we develop but before I

00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:55,740
get on to anything geeky I want to take

00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:58,259
you on a road trip la California

00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,020
beautiful isn't it I arrived last week

00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:04,409
and I decided to rent car and travel up

00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:07,200
into the mountains and I went up to the

00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:09,569
Sequoia National Park is amazing place

00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,740
at driving up the mountain roads with

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:13,390
all these huge trees growing up

00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,090
by the side getting higher and higher

00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:18,040
from the air get thinner and the

00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,290
freshness of the air as well such a

00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:23,020
beautiful experience in such a great

00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:25,920
drive but these sequoia trees are quite

00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:28,930
incredible they are the world's largest

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,510
living thing by volume and they grow to

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:34,450
some incredible Heights but also some

00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:37,480
incredible widths so for example this is

00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:40,960
the General Sherman tree in Sequoia

00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,640
National Park and it is huge I mean the

00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,770
photo almost can't do justice but look

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,840
at a normal tree to the right and then

00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:50,950
look at the tree look at the General

00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:53,050
Sherman it's huge this is the largest

00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,510
living thing by volume unpacked this

00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:59,080
actual tree the General Sherman its

00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:01,300
enormous and all the trees in the forest

00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:08,350
are absolutely amazing the longevity as

00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:09,730
well this tree is 2200 years old but

00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:12,670
it'd be incredible if we could know that

00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:15,610
our businesses could last as long and be

00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,500
as durable and if we took cross-section

00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:19,600
through a tree like this this is a tree

00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,400
of kind of almost the same age but just

00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:23,560
counting the rings and you think of the

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,130
history that it's seen the troubles that

00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,420
it's been through all of the adverse

00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:30,640
influences from the weather or fire

00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:34,990
whatever else but it's survived as long

00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,120
alders that until this fateful moment so

00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,530
if we took a slice through a Drupal

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,300
agency I wanted to kind of have a feel

00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,880
of what we would see what is it that

00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,010
makes up a Drupal agency and I think

00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,140
there are these things and so first of

00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:50,020
all clients team and tools are are

00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:53,860
equally important and clients and team a

00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:55,360
fairly self-explanatory tools and kind

00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,040
of think of it as like a carpenters

00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,200
tools yes he does have all sorts of

00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,260
tools to use but it's also his knowledge

00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:05,170
his technique his expertise these things

00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,850
together that make an agency of any kind

00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,010
of a professional services firm and

00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:11,530
these things together that formed brand

00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,720
don't think the brand is a logo the

00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,459
brand is everything that you mean as an

00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,680
organization and we're going to step

00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:19,930
through each of these within this

00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,930
session so let's first of all focus on

00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:24,580
clients and now the sections in this

00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,830
we're going to look at selecting the

00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,360
right

00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:28,129
clients because that's really important

00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,780
establishing a solid and equal

00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:32,110
relationship the clients the billing

00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:35,270
principles and managing the account and

00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:37,759
we as droop agencies tend to be pretty

00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:40,909
bad all this stuff we're in a very very

00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:44,150
lucky position where for years clients

00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:46,129
have just come looking on up plumpton up

00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,469
yo oh yeah we want Drupal we here it's

00:04:46,129 --> 00:04:50,300
the cool thing we need a Drupal agency

00:04:48,469 --> 00:04:52,310
but the thing is the Drupal world is

00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,349
going to get a lot more competitive it

00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,849
already is look at the size of this

00:04:54,349 --> 00:04:57,770
conference look at some of the companies

00:04:55,849 --> 00:05:00,469
that are moving into the space we're

00:04:57,770 --> 00:05:02,449
seeing now professional digital agencies

00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:05,360
who have been around for years who are

00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:07,310
adding Drupal to their list we as an

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,650
industry need to step up and adopt more

00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:11,599
professional processes but also we need

00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,009
to be better at satisfying our clients

00:05:11,599 --> 00:05:14,930
we've kind of had a little bit of

00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:16,849
arrogance haven't me in the Drupal were

00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:19,969
like yeah we're Drupal I'm a drupal

00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:21,979
rockstar we are amazing but not so great

00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:24,169
at the customer service and holding the

00:05:21,979 --> 00:05:26,449
customers hand through the process so

00:05:24,169 --> 00:05:30,440
first of all let's start with selecting

00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:34,129
the clients now a great agency knows

00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:36,319
that they're defined by the word no more

00:05:34,129 --> 00:05:39,620
than anything else it's about that

00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:42,710
selectivity it's about really knowing

00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,750
what you are for as an agency what are

00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,699
you the best in the world at and which

00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:49,310
clients should you select to support

00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:52,819
that if you're not as selective with the

00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,139
clients as the clients are with you then

00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:56,539
you've got a problem you're just taking

00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:58,069
any work that comes in and that's going

00:05:56,539 --> 00:06:00,080
to lead to problems for you it's going

00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:01,759
to lead to problems for the clients it's

00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,210
going to lead to unhappy relationships

00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:07,520
so it's really important that you are

00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:09,440
selected with your clients I know it's

00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,060
hard when the phone rings or that email

00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,159
comes in goes yeah we've got a great

00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,949
project for you come in and talk to us

00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:17,569
it's so exciting but it's that really

00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:21,190
the right project you should be taking

00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:24,250
on to grow your agency to the next level

00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:28,510
so you need to know what your kind of

00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:31,450
client is for your agency what would be

00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:34,780
the dream kind what kind of clients do

00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:37,630
you want and select a stick to selecting

00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:39,400
only those now for us it's these now

00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:41,230
it's a lot of words on a slide I'm not

00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,670
going to go through them this slide is

00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,080
mainly here for if you just want to

00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,050
download the slides from the talk page

00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,060
afterwards and review these or watch the

00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:51,970
talk online they're also available on

00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:55,510
our site we very publicly talked about

00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:56,830
the right kind of clients for us but one

00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:58,120
of the key things the bottom there be

00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:00,520
willing to work in an open and

00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:04,330
transparent way so we assess our

00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:06,130
potential clients from this list and we

00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:08,620
are thinking about are they a good fit

00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:10,870
with us because if not it leads to whole

00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:12,580
load of pain not just for us as a

00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:15,360
business but for our individual staff

00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:19,060
members and for the clients themselves

00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:20,890
so knowing the kind of client you want

00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,110
to have you then take them through a

00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:25,240
sales process now at first you get the

00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:27,250
initial contact whether it's an RFP or

00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:29,860
you have an idea about whom I like to

00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:32,860
serve and you have to make a stop go

00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:36,790
decision then in there as early as

00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:40,840
possible too much time is wasted by

00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:45,160
drupal agencies and any agency chasing

00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:48,669
sales that a they can't win but be they

00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:50,350
shouldn't want a huge amount for wasted

00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:52,419
time one of the biggest differences you

00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:54,820
can make in your business in terms of

00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:57,430
making your time more productive is

00:07:54,820 --> 00:08:00,910
being more selective about the rfps you

00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:02,740
respond to or the customer inquiries how

00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:06,220
many frustrating days have you had

00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:09,340
writing proposals going to pitch and at

00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:12,310
the end to get that rejection email you

00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:14,710
wouldn't get it anyway and you could

00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:16,840
have saved all of that time think how

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,000
much that's worth so the stop go

00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,410
decision this is how we do it we just

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,419
have this spreadsheet we're assessing

00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,950
some of those things again the print is

00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,630
quite small it's designed for if you

00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,460
want to review the materials that you

00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,130
download after

00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:31,800
words but we're assessing things like

00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:34,409
the procurement process is reasonable

00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,500
for the project sighs have you ever

00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:40,140
found that not to be the case we have a

00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,779
kind of rough rule of thumb which is one

00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:45,779
page of proposal one page of rfp for

00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:48,600
every ten brand or every 10,000 of

00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:51,930
budget so if you've got a client that's

00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:55,200
you know pitching a 50,000 pound budget

00:08:51,930 --> 00:09:00,000
to you and they've got a 200-page RFP

00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,800
walk away so so that's a good point of

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,380
clients as well because it's wasting the

00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,610
clients time all of this as well and

00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,339
we're checking things the project

00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:09,450
delivery time scale is reasonable and

00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:11,580
our resourcing things we have the right

00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,930
people available to the dates and so on

00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,600
there's a lot else that we're checking

00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:18,660
we have two people review the RFP or the

00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,700
opportunity and score it on this basis

00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:23,220
and at the bottom it comes out with a

00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:25,260
score but that is not a decision the

00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,480
automated calculated score is not a

00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:29,520
decision it's a starting point for

00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,770
conversation and we have that

00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:34,800
conversation and then the humans decide

00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:36,660
whether it's a go or no go you can't

00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,190
have some spreadsheet that decides what

00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,270
business you're going to pitch because

00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:41,550
at the end of the day there's an amount

00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:44,070
of gut feel or those you know what's in

00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:47,070
the pipeline or whatever and one day you

00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:49,529
know a total score of you know 72 might

00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,270
be a go another day it may be a no-go

00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:53,010
because you're too busy so you can be as

00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:55,680
selective as you need to be but it's a

00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,690
starting point for a conversation so

00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,850
have this kind of formal process where

00:09:57,690 --> 00:10:01,829
you are assessing the opportunities you

00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,570
get and you're scoring the client

00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:06,110
because you know what when you send your

00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:08,850
proposal they will score you like this

00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:11,850
what why shouldn't it be equal it should

00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:15,300
be an equal approach between client and

00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:17,160
supplier all of the time so back to the

00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,779
sales process we've done the stop go

00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,660
decision we've run that spreadsheet and

00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:24,839
we've decided that this is a go next you

00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:26,640
come to discovery don't leave this for

00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,950
starting the project don't just

00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,320
automatically read the rfps you that's

00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:33,000
the extent of information in the

00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,560
discovery in the sales process you want

00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,080
to really understand

00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:39,960
who this client is and who the key

00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,300
people at the client are you want to be

00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,890
knowing who are we trying to impress

00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,230
with this who are we trying to connect

00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:47,820
with what buying power do they have what

00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,440
are their worries what is their

00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,300
background so you want to build up a

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,920
little map of the people on the client

00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,050
side that you know you'll be dealing

00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,779
with and what matters to them what are

00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,310
their kind of key motivators and also

00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:01,260
you want to be discovering about the

00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:03,060
project what is the history of the

00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:05,490
project what's involved what are the

00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:07,589
unknowns and map out the risks as well

00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:09,870
so that discovery phase is really

00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:12,420
important then you want to have the

00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:14,040
prepare and prove stage now that's very

00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,830
important that is both words you're

00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:20,880
preparing to pitch for us but you also

00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:22,970
have to create proof so in the preparing

00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,170
stage what you're doing is you are

00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:27,180
understanding what is involved in the

00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:30,510
project and then you need to provide

00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:32,850
actual proof that you can do that and

00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:34,770
it's amazing how often we don't do that

00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,120
as agencies we just go oh yeah you need

00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,529
to download this module you need to do

00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,600
that you need to do the other and we'll

00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:41,400
do that for you and here's the price

00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,530
whereas what you client is wanting is

00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,870
they've got a number of worries in their

00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:47,460
mind they might be worrying is this

00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:50,310
agency large enough to handle this

00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:53,910
project or is this agency too big to

00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:55,710
care about us as a small customer do

00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:58,050
they really have drupal experience do

00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,880
they have experience in our sector so in

00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,160
the prepare improve think about what

00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,130
their worries are and then think about

00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,000
what proof you can provide to answer

00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:11,220
those then you write the proposal and

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,960
possibly also do a presentation those I

00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,970
will leave out of scope for this talk

00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,610
today but then you come to the agreement

00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:19,620
and this is really key and we'll talk a

00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:21,270
little bit more about this later on but

00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:23,400
it's it's an agreement i call it an

00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:26,010
agreement rather than a contract because

00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:27,839
it has to be an agreement both parties

00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,710
have to be an agreement and it has to be

00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:30,780
equal

00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,700
but it has to state really clearly what

00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:35,430
the parameters of the project are and

00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:38,190
set the expectations and all too often

00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:40,710
the sales process tends to stop just

00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:42,480
before then you get the email saying

00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,460
congratulations we've selected you get

00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,960
all over excited and you rush into the

00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,880
first meetings and you start delivering

00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,820
you have to make sure that there is a

00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:52,110
proper agreement in place you know

00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,300
because the relationship seems fantastic

00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:56,400
now but you want a framework for this is

00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,110
how we are going to work together then

00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,660
you want an internal retrospective so

00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:02,820
you can learn from each sale that you do

00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:05,340
and then you want to get the project set

00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:07,380
up for delivery but never skip out the

00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:09,660
retrospective stage it's exciting to the

00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:13,380
new ser but you have to learn from it

00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:15,000
continuously learn all the time so once

00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:16,490
you have the client one you need to

00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,130
establish a relationship and i can't

00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:24,990
emphasize enough how much the equal

00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:29,520
nature of the relationship matters too

00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:32,940
many client vendor relationships are

00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:35,460
abusive based on abusive relationships

00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:37,170
where one partner is kind of kept down

00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,240
and under the whip and the client is

00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:42,090
there I've got the budget you do

00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,590
whatever I say and the agency has the

00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:45,870
experience and has the knowledge and may

00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:48,030
know from previous experience what the

00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:52,170
best direction is but the client has the

00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:54,780
budget the budget does not outweigh your

00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:58,560
expertise and experience the client is

00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:00,330
hiring you because you are expert and

00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,090
experienced and can deliver what they

00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:04,680
need that has an equal weight that is

00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:06,540
why they are paying you that money

00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,010
they're not saying you know what will

00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:11,220
pay those people a lot more than they're

00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:13,950
worth they are paying you this amount

00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:16,320
because you are worth that amount that's

00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:20,160
an equal relationship we get too hung up

00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,020
on money talking money is just one half

00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,700
of the equation there needs to be

00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:26,370
equality in the relationship and that

00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:29,430
means both parties need to have input

00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:31,290
into all the key decisions both parties

00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:33,750
need to have open communications and

00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:35,940
collaboration and all the way through it

00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,870
has to be an equal approached

00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:41,050
we do have to have this relationship

00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:43,089
defined now this can be in the contract

00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:45,790
but also i really recommend doing a

00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:47,830
client onboarding process just as you

00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:49,240
would with a new staff member because

00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:51,339
the client doesn't know all of your

00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,920
processes and approaches and you know

00:14:51,339 --> 00:14:55,360
the way that you do things but you just

00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:58,000
suddenly turn up and you start hacking

00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:00,730
away stuff do a client onboarding

00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,529
process so they know what to expect so

00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:04,420
that you are setting the parameters for

00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:06,339
relationship you may have need to do

00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:09,130
client training because we only do agile

00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:12,490
projects we at the start of all projects

00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:14,710
and do two days of agile training with

00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:16,540
clients to make sure that we're all on

00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:18,550
the same page with the language we're

00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:22,360
going to use the methods we're going to

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:24,250
use and all that kind of stuff and all

00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,170
of this is to set the expectations which

00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:28,930
is really important and it's what we

00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:30,940
mostly fail at most of the time when

00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:33,480
projects go wrong when clients are

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:35,980
unhappy it generally comes down to

00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:39,100
miscommunication and the Miss setting of

00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:41,650
expectations and also what's important i

00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:43,270
think this zipper effect normally in a

00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:45,190
project you have project manager talking

00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:46,870
to project manager and none of the

00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:48,670
others talk to each other you want to

00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:50,140
zip perfect everyone talking to each

00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,180
other you want to engage from a

00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:55,990
stakeholder level project manager level

00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:57,820
develop a level all the way points of

00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:59,709
the zipper you want to be connecting

00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:03,120
because that creates a really strong

00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:03,120
bond and good communications

00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,090
we prize ourselves too cheaply as an

00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:16,040
industry we don't value the work that's

00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:18,380
being done and that means that it's

00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,450
really difficult for Drupal agencies to

00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:22,670
reinvest in good processes and good

00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,690
training and good development so make

00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:25,610
sure that you're setting the right

00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:28,040
billing terms for your agency the right

00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:31,070
billing rates and the right payment

00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,380
terms don't let clients make this an

00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:35,720
unequal relationship make sure that the

00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:37,760
client is paying properly for what you

00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,950
are delivering the level of experience

00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,080
and make sure also that they're paying

00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:44,570
you on time because that's just simple

00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:47,390
respect at a point of invoice that's

00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:51,350
your money you've earned it they don't

00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:53,330
pay their salaries late you need to be

00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:55,520
paid on time and enforce that as a

00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:58,040
matter of respect stop projects if

00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:00,080
invoices become late pause things and

00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,450
they'll soon get paid just a simple

00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:05,270
matter of that quality the trust and

00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:07,670
respect so the relationship is key other

00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:09,530
things with the billing and billing by

00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,940
hours is really inefficient and

00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,530
complicated you've got the context

00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,880
switching all the time you got

00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:15,470
developers constantly thinking what now

00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:17,960
what was I doing there and what was

00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:20,150
going on there and clients should be

00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:22,430
booking on any reasonably large project

00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:24,950
clients should be booking people by the

00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:27,560
day or even by the Sprint resound

00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:29,150
Sprint's effectively and you know for

00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,250
the project okay we're going to have 16

00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,350
two weeks pranks and each sprint is

00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:34,790
going to be costing this much and

00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,440
therefore here is the project budget

00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,940
here's the budget burned down here's how

00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:40,400
we're going to bail and we bill at the

00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,840
end of each sprint so at the end of each

00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,120
sprint we have a sign off with the

00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,340
client and when they've signed off the

00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:48,590
invoice goes out and they've then got 30

00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,990
days paying terms and that means the

00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:53,270
client has always real visibility on how

00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:54,800
the project budget is doing because that

00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,870
reassures them as well actually we find

00:17:54,800 --> 00:18:01,370
clients like this because they have

00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:03,440
visibility transparency all the time and

00:18:01,370 --> 00:18:06,210
don't undervalue your talent of people

00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,150
we keep doing that we keep under billing

00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:11,490
industry the one thing you can do though

00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:13,050
clients who are good clients you can

00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:14,160
reward them with discounts because if

00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:16,590
they can help you improve your

00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,840
utilization that is the percentage of

00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:21,180
potentially billable time that can

00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:23,520
actually be billed if they can help you

00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:26,700
improve that by say committing to

00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,980
booking 10 Sprint's or whatever it is

00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,770
then you can offer better eight but it's

00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,810
a train it's an equal trade if you help

00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:35,580
us improve utilization will provide a

00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:38,340
discount that's the way that the

00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:40,500
discounts can work never offer just a

00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:41,970
discount as they ask for because what

00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,380
you're in tourney doing them saying yeah

00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:46,920
we're not worth as much as we said we

00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:48,900
were that's fine I'm so stick in it

00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:51,120
you've got a rate never offer discounts

00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,860
for no reason so if the client needs a

00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:55,200
discount to fit their budget then you

00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:57,480
have to negotiate what comes out it's

00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,000
all back to this mutual respect and

00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:03,990
Trust it's equal relationship that sets

00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,840
things up fairly and honestly this is

00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,900
the thing that we are worst at as

00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:11,940
agencies and it's sometimes embarrassing

00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,560
because we kind of wind the client and

00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,600
then we bury our heads in our laptops

00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:18,660
download load of modules and calculate

00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,910
together and tada and you really need to

00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,010
manage client counts and clients want

00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:26,070
this we've actually been seeing RFP is

00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:27,690
recently where the clients specify that

00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:30,810
they need this because they have been

00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:32,400
burned and this account management is

00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:34,890
just simply someone who's taking a

00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,960
higher level view of the relationship

00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:39,020
with the client so we appoint from our

00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,700
side a project director to each project

00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:44,640
and their job is not to get involved in

00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,890
the day-to-day ever not to do all the

00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,630
stuff relating to the project but simply

00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:50,970
to engage with the stakeholders in a

00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,770
regular basis at the client side and

00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:54,690
also to keep an overview on what our

00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:56,370
team is doing many issues and blockers

00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,590
and things that coming up that should

00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:00,660
create alarm bells and check what we are

00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:03,510
following our ways of doing things in

00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:04,980
correct processes so they have regular

00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:07,680
reviews with the client which we call

00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,870
steering groups once every other sprint

00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:11,970
they have steering group with the client

00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,650
and they meet the client senior

00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,600
stakeholders and they run through a

00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:17,880
standard slide deck about the project

00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,730
which is covering the budget is covering

00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,370
the timelines covering the risk

00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:24,200
it's covering the you know the all the

00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:26,210
changes that have come into the project

00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,950
it's covering all sorts of things that

00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:30,860
are relevant to the high-level

00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:32,930
stakeholders so that kind of regular

00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:35,170
review that steering group is really

00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:38,120
valuable and building that relationship

00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:41,300
and you're always of course looking to

00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:43,130
demonstrate your expertise and because

00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,380
that's the thing with clients and we

00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:47,270
hear this again and again that the

00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,890
clients will often say our previous

00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:50,930
agency just came in and they did the job

00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,910
fine but they didn't give us you know

00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:55,010
any kind of steering or advice that it

00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:58,760
was any ideas we got nothing from them

00:20:55,010 --> 00:21:02,900
they just built site the clients are

00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:04,850
really thirsty the digital world is so

00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:08,150
complex tour so many things going on all

00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:09,830
the time they feel a bit lost we face it

00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:12,410
if we're honest sometimes we think at

00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:14,150
last so I'm with it we're the experts

00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:17,300
working at every day and there's always

00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:19,580
something new so your job is to be their

00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:21,530
radar scanning the horizon looking at

00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:23,720
what's coming up what they could do so

00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:26,270
for example this google google mobile

00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,040
get an update recently you should know

00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:29,900
about that and you should be flagging up

00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,930
to your clients well in the drives and

00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:35,030
suggesting they prioritize getting their

00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:38,120
sites ready for that and demonstrating

00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:42,290
why so that kind of expert advice is

00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:43,970
really highly valued by clients and the

00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:48,100
other thing it's really important to

00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:52,100
remember is that no customer is forever

00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:54,920
and I know it's hard to grasp for us as

00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:57,320
agencies because we think give best in

00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:00,320
the world why would they go anywhere

00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:03,380
else we're amazing look how much fun we

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,870
have um but it happens they will get a

00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:07,490
new person at their end who will want to

00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,960
make their own mark on the project or

00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:11,120
they will just have different

00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,980
expectations or something will happen

00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,630
and people want change after a couple of

00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:19,130
years anyway so even if you've been

00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:21,230
amazing change would come but also you

00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:26,390
may change as an agency and you should

00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:29,270
be the clients you 135 years ago may not

00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:32,300
be the clients you should have next year

00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:33,260
or the year after there's a time to move

00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,270
on on

00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:37,610
either side and you should constantly be

00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:40,070
reviewing your client list and seeing

00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:42,530
are these necessarily are right clients

00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:45,530
now if you've started as a five-person

00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:48,140
agency when you're a 50-person agency

00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:50,780
you're probably not the best person for

00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:52,730
the first clients you want and you may

00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:55,340
be running around like crazy dealing

00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:57,380
with really small bits and pieces and in

00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,150
not giving them the best service so be

00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:01,850
ready for that change and reviewing and

00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:04,040
pruning that finest it's best for the

00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:06,020
client and it's best for you but do

00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,450
manage it smoothly find them another

00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:11,240
good agency and help them through and

00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:13,370
even if they fired you give them time

00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:16,460
help them transition in a really

00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:17,930
professional way so we've talked about

00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,670
for the clients selecting the right

00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:21,590
clients establishing a solid equal

00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:23,660
relationship setting clear billing

00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:25,610
principles and managing the account

00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:28,040
that's the clients section let's look at

00:23:25,610 --> 00:23:30,080
the team and these the sections that

00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:37,160
we're going to be covering in this part

00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:39,350
the right person is key and we again is

00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,390
a Drupal thing we would hire people like

00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:44,090
oh my god they're a triple rock star

00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,860
we've got to get them though they may be

00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,540
amazing but they may not be the right

00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:51,140
fit for you as a company because what

00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:55,360
you need to be recruiting for mostly is

00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:57,890
character because you can't change that

00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,630
you can train people you can develop

00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:01,430
people if you get people who are and

00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,810
middleweight trooper developers you can

00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,760
provide them so much training and

00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:07,490
support and resources and mentoring for

00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:11,900
others in the company but if someone

00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:13,970
just doesn't fit the culture that's a

00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,860
much trickier thing it's important to

00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:17,900
recognize that so recruit for that it's

00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:20,720
start and that means knowing the kind of

00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:24,830
person that is a your kind of person

00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,480
that fits the agency culture so you know

00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,850
if it's like for example somebody works

00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:31,370
at Google will probably hate working at

00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:33,260
Microsoft and yet they're not a bad

00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:35,570
person they're an amazing person and

00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:37,400
somebody works at Microsoft would

00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:40,040
probably hate working at Google and

00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:42,380
they're a great person so this is not

00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,169
about whether someone is amazing this is

00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:45,789
just about whether someone fits

00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:47,350
culture and there are very different

00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:51,820
cultures and different companies and

00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:54,789
there should be it's a sign of a really

00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:58,149
good strong culture if there are some

00:24:54,789 --> 00:25:00,369
people who would hate it not fitting

00:24:58,149 --> 00:25:04,019
that's actually a sign you've created

00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:07,389
something strong and durable and lasting

00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:09,609
so with every recruit you are building

00:25:07,389 --> 00:25:12,999
the culture of your team matt mullenweg

00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:15,369
up wordpress personally interviews every

00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:17,499
new recruit because he knows this is

00:25:15,369 --> 00:25:21,190
true he is building the culture of

00:25:17,499 --> 00:25:23,830
automatic so therefore it's better to be

00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:25,210
really selective don't just hire people

00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:28,629
because they're available and you've got

00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:30,820
potential projects hire people only when

00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:33,489
they really do fit your culture and it'd

00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:36,369
be better to slow down your growth than

00:25:33,489 --> 00:25:38,080
take on people who aren't right as part

00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:40,450
the recruiting process we have a policy

00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,580
we never ever use recruitment agents

00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:44,799
because they do not have the same

00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,690
incentives as you do for getting the

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,460
right people they just want to get

00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:50,649
someone in the role so they can bill you

00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:51,999
and six months later they'll be ringing

00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:55,210
up that person and trying to get them to

00:25:51,999 --> 00:25:57,609
move somewhere else so we don't use them

00:25:55,210 --> 00:26:00,700
we put it all over our job ads we have a

00:25:57,609 --> 00:26:02,950
special web page explaining why we don't

00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:06,039
use Drupal agents and it's been shared a

00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:07,570
lot however every week I get an email or

00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:12,419
call from the fruit agent saying I know

00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:14,950
you don't use recruitment agents and

00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:16,570
they have some reason why they're

00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:18,909
supposed to be different but it just

00:26:16,570 --> 00:26:21,369
doesn't work for us it's that personal

00:26:18,909 --> 00:26:23,499
connection you need to be responsible

00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:26,109
for the people in your company not

00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:28,929
outsourcing it somewhere else it's only

00:26:26,109 --> 00:26:31,210
you so therefore what you need to do is

00:26:28,929 --> 00:26:33,279
have a process that you use for bringing

00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:35,049
these people on board and a process that

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,450
you use for people to be able to find

00:26:35,049 --> 00:26:38,559
out that there are vacancies so think of

00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:40,720
all the places that you're going to

00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,940
advertise so instead of that paying that

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,279
fat feed recruitment agent how you're

00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:47,200
going to use that potential fee to

00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,330
advertise approving spread the word

00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,190
widely there are lots of great people

00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:53,769
out there looking for jobs use your

00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:54,520
networks use all sorts of ways to track

00:26:53,769 --> 00:26:56,380
them down

00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:59,200
but then you need a good process for

00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:00,820
selecting people now because our culture

00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:05,080
is such a strong thing for us our

00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:06,850
approach is peer interview so a manager

00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:08,560
so for example at me and UK or for a

00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:10,060
consulting business I will meet with

00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:12,400
someone interview but that's pretty

00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:14,950
short we then have someone who does

00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,630
exactly the same job as they spend an

00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:19,420
hour and a half or so with them talking

00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:22,360
much more in depth and again it's equal

00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:24,340
like the client agency thing this isn't

00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,320
as interviewing them we want it to be

00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:28,030
them interviewing us as well and we want

00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:29,920
them to get a feel of what the company

00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:31,570
is really like and they can only do that

00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:34,180
if they're talking someone who does a

00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:36,220
similar job at a similar level so match

00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,540
them up with someone similar and do the

00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,550
interview for that there are other

00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:42,100
companies that use videos they get an

00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:43,630
old lullaby to get people submit youtube

00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:46,690
videos they've talked about that and

00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:49,140
that's been very successful from and all

00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:52,810
sorts of ways that you can use just

00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:54,040
check is this person right front now for

00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:57,490
our culture the kind of person that's

00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:59,920
right for us is someone who is a really

00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:01,930
keen on loan really curious always keen

00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:03,760
to learn more stuff always got side

00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:06,100
projects someone who's a great

00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,110
communicator there isn't anybody in our

00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:10,270
company I wouldn't be happy to put in

00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:12,910
front the chief executive of any one of

00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:14,920
our clients so someone who is a great

00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:17,770
communicator and someone who is very

00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:20,560
professional they care about the detail

00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:22,990
they care about the job that we do how

00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,310
we perceive the results that the client

00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,720
gets they've got that professional

00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:28,960
approach and they want to have the

00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:31,000
professional tools together so one way

00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,030
you can do is give people a chance to

00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,830
try out some companies I think automatic

00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:37,420
are the same with this as well they give

00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:39,040
people a chance to do a small project

00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:41,410
from the evenings or weekends just a

00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,270
really small task just to see how it's

00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:45,220
done they pay them for it but it's

00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:47,470
chance for that person to check out do

00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:49,330
they like working for traumatic and for

00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:52,030
automatic to check out do we like this

00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:54,670
person so you've got to be very

00:28:52,030 --> 00:29:02,030
selective on that

00:28:54,670 --> 00:29:03,590
sticky subject next tricky okay let's be

00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:07,430
open about this let's be frank we don't

00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:10,010
talk about many much but there are some

00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:11,510
ways that agents have structure their

00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:13,220
rates and structure things that have

00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:14,900
done and I think it's really important

00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:17,180
than Asdrubal agencies we've tend to

00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:19,550
overlook it a bit and we end up with can

00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:22,490
vary squeeze margins which creates

00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:23,990
unstable businesses so this is kind of a

00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:26,630
good rule of thumb this is not an

00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:28,580
absolute rule it's a rule of thumb but

00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:31,070
the pay package for staff should be

00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:33,650
roughly a third of their likely billing

00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:35,810
for a year come on to why in a moment

00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:37,550
and and that you know there's quick

00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:40,490
formula there but essentially it's

00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:43,010
saying 176 days times the day rate

00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:44,810
divided by 3 gives you a good rule of

00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:46,340
thumb guideline there are many other

00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:47,990
things that you may want to factor into

00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:50,480
that but that gives a fairly good

00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:52,640
guideline and this is because this is

00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,730
how the finances of your company should

00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:58,160
be structured to have a healthy agency

00:29:55,730 --> 00:30:01,790
that can survive and weather the storms

00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:03,800
team costs so imagine you're billing on

00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:06,890
a project team cost should be about a

00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:09,290
third of what your billing the direct

00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:11,750
team costs the rest should be a

00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:13,670
contribution to overheads another third

00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:15,530
degree of contribution to overheads this

00:30:13,670 --> 00:30:17,090
is funding all of your training its

00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:19,310
funding offices if you have them its

00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:21,680
funding the laptops its funding trips to

00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:24,650
Drupal conex funding all the stuff that

00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:26,780
makes you what you are and also the

00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:29,600
management overhead the support for the

00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:31,070
staff it's the expertise that they can

00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,680
call on within the compass so all of

00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:36,830
that stuff that is their backup and this

00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:38,690
is what makes an agency because if you

00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:42,410
don't invest in all there you're just

00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:44,600
freelancing as an agency as a company

00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:46,580
you're investing in a team of people and

00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,790
you're investing in the support and the

00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:51,380
resources for that teams do a great job

00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:54,560
and then you need a third allocated to

00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:56,390
contingency and profit because you have

00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:59,060
to make sure you have good margins

00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:00,650
because times will not always be good

00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:03,500
we'll come on some of the problems in a

00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,450
moment but that third is a good metric

00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,100
train for

00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,390
that will boil down to at the end of the

00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,770
day won't boil down to making that

00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:10,390
amount of profit at the end of the year

00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:12,940
because they'll always be other stuff

00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:14,830
but it gives that contingency for profit

00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,930
levels themselves your net profit as a

00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:18,550
company if you're making ten percent or

00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:20,320
less you're in trouble that's going to

00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:23,410
leave cash flow comes ten percent net

00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,140
profit year or next ten to fifteen

00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:28,690
percent okay fifteen twenty percent is

00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:32,380
good that's that's fine twenty percent

00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:34,120
you're amazing or more so yes you want

00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:36,280
to be in the ten to twenty range at

00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:38,860
least under temp think you really need

00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:40,900
to start addressing the way you've

00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:43,120
structure and run the company because

00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:45,610
what if you hit a problem you're done

00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,770
for so you need to be make that profit

00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:52,780
it is the responsible thing to do for

00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:55,030
your staff of your clients your clients

00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:57,220
do not want you to suddenly go bust or

00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:58,990
to be too focused on a cash flow

00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:01,600
problems sort their problems in your

00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:04,960
staff want job security and they deserve

00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,810
it for working here so do make sure that

00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:09,430
there is a good profit being named then

00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:10,630
when you have the staff you need to make

00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:16,150
sure you're not making lots of stupid

00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:18,220
rules because again it's really tempting

00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:19,930
particularly we coming for if anyone

00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,310
comes from a technical background it's

00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:23,440
all too easy to fall into this idea that

00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:25,450
humans are programmed programmable and

00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,460
if we just create a big list of rules

00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:29,740
that we do in the company then everyone

00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:31,870
will go away and do that so you need to

00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,420
be setting people free hiring really

00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:36,550
talented people and setting them free to

00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:39,760
do their job really well you are hiring

00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:43,210
knowledge workers after all this is not

00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:46,630
some factory in the 1920s or whatever it

00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:48,420
is this is modern-day highly educated

00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:51,760
workforce highly trained highly

00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:55,930
experienced knowledge workers use their

00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:57,640
brains set them free set parameters that

00:32:55,930 --> 00:33:00,760
they can work within but not lots of

00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:03,670
rules and the main rule is but it's your

00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:05,920
job to look after the team they will

00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:09,070
look after the customers you focus on

00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:10,060
looking after that and so much of your

00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,010
time

00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:14,200
as a manager as a leader of the business

00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:18,220
needs to be focused and looking after

00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:21,190
the team then let them look after the

00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:23,620
customers so rounding up the team

00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:26,920
section these the points that that we've

00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:30,940
covered there so let's move on to the

00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:33,160
tools section now this is again what

00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:35,110
differentiates really good professional

00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,240
services countries really good agencies

00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:39,880
from those that just kind of tick along

00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,650
in that you know a lot of agencies they

00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:44,110
just have the kind of team and the

00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:46,210
clients and then the tools is a fairly

00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:49,210
random thing you know it's fairly round

00:33:46,210 --> 00:33:51,580
yeah we use Drupal but if you can

00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:54,760
develop a way of doing things in your

00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:57,210
company it can really transform you so

00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:59,320
let's take a look in this section and

00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:03,040
documenting the way you do things we

00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:04,390
have put a lot of effort into this we

00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:06,520
fly people from all the different

00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:08,650
countries who will treat someone we have

00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:11,650
a great time yet there may be a bit of

00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:14,290
beer drunk maybe a bit of whiskey but we

00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:15,880
work very hard and we really capture

00:34:14,290 --> 00:34:18,100
what we do but all the project managers

00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,630
together all the consultants and we

00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,920
document what it is that we do is

00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:22,810
business of how we want to do it's not

00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,910
management saying this it's the teams

00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:27,790
getting together in deciding this is the

00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:29,500
way we will do stuff and it's been so

00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:30,880
valuable in the business because then

00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:33,250
that's a resource for training new

00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:35,440
people that's also where of explaining

00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:37,480
to the client this is how we do the

00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,610
thing we do and this is why we are great

00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,170
this is why you should hire we actually

00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:44,020
make this public i'll give you the URL

00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:45,310
later on and it's a creative commons so

00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,650
if anyone wants to copy it for their

00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:49,480
agency go ahead we want to be as open

00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:51,430
with our business as we are with

00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:54,130
software in the Drupal community and

00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:59,650
want to share everything so we have

00:34:54,130 --> 00:35:02,500
actually one business purely because

00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:04,900
well documented processes we have one

00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:07,210
large client recently who just said I've

00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,830
seen the way you do stuff it's music to

00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:10,740
my ears because we've had so many

00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:13,930
agencies coming in and just doing stuff

00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:16,360
you have this process so if you document

00:35:13,930 --> 00:35:18,970
the way things work then it's a really

00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:21,430
persuasive things for clients as well as

00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:24,040
giving a stable base to your business um

00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:25,330
in terms of other tools just use the

00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:27,610
simplest things that work one of the

00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:31,330
things I keep saying is as we triple

00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:34,990
agencies we think we need a system to

00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:40,930
match our clients and our billing let's

00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:43,570
build it in triple don't do that because

00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:45,580
so much time is absorbed on internal

00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:47,860
projects and that time just vanishes

00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:50,650
into the ether it's unbuildable and it

00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:53,500
seems to never end because there is no

00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:56,140
client saying that's you're spending too

00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:58,120
much on this so use the simplest things

00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:59,740
that work there are great tools out

00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:02,710
there that agencies news whether it's

00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:05,680
harvest for time billing or Trello for a

00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:08,380
simple board of cards we actually so we

00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,360
manage the group board wonder crowd is

00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:12,400
managed in an agile way and we're all

00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:14,740
we're working one month Springs with

00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,630
weekly stand-ups and we just use Trello

00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,880
for managing all of the stuff we're

00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:22,140
changing in the business it's all it

00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,760
needs use the simplest things that work

00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:26,860
and there are so many tools there and

00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:29,290
share with other Drupal agencies what

00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:31,450
you use and what works well trained

00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:34,450
people in these things and then all the

00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:36,370
way through measure track and report now

00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:38,980
if you have the way that you do stuff

00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:40,960
you can all the time review are we doing

00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:42,790
this in every retrospective on every

00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:45,070
project or in every retrospective on a

00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:47,110
sale are we doing this the way that we

00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:49,420
said we would can we improve the way we

00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:51,640
do things and what can we implement now

00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:55,000
and and young you can continuously

00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:58,000
improve that now under our tools are

00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:59,920
managed by this man he's a wonderful man

00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,320
he deserves a name check Steve huntin

00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,970
has is the kind of keeper of the Wonder

00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,770
way and he works across all our

00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:07,870
countries now sharing that experience

00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:09,910
and helping knowledge move between the

00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:12,160
countries and he has taken the entire

00:37:09,910 --> 00:37:12,760
way we work to be through being I so

00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,120
annoying

00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:18,880
iso 9001 certified so it's a quality

00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:21,520
standard the clients recognize saying

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,170
yes we do do this stuff now I know that

00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,970
sounds very serious so I want to show

00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:30,430
you that Steve huntin is not always

00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:33,670
serious so this is him at weekends um

00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:36,430
and so that's the tools document the way

00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:38,260
you do things develop a process a great

00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:40,240
example of this is we decided recently

00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:42,460
that all of our countries have kind of

00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:45,850
evolved the discovery process on

00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:47,980
projects in different ways and with all

00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:49,780
sorts of good ideas around but it needed

00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:52,150
unifying so we flew everyone together

00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:54,010
for two days of working on this and we

00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:56,410
developed the Wonder way of doing

00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:58,000
discovery and again that's going to be

00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:59,110
shared out as well but it's the stuff

00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,450
that really works developing all these

00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:03,480
modules that can be put together into a

00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:06,690
disk good discovery process and that

00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:09,370
tool then creates value for the clients

00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:11,890
because they know that whoever they get

00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:13,630
on their project knows how to do a

00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:15,550
discovery process the same as anyone

00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:17,800
else and will follow through the same

00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:19,810
tools in same processes and has been

00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,360
trained and delivering that discovery

00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:24,010
and they know that they it's going to be

00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:25,540
delivered efficiently because you're not

00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:28,060
making it up as you go along with time

00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:29,530
so having these tools is a really

00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:32,320
valuable thing to do to create a good

00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:34,810
agency then we get on to the brand now

00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,570
the brand is kind of a mixture of all of

00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:40,990
these things and the brand is not about

00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:42,580
the logo the brand is kind of who you

00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:45,490
are as a company how you are perceived

00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:49,800
you need to differentiate yourself in a

00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,800
market where everybody looks the same

00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:58,960
that differentiation is is key because

00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:05,220
from the clients point of view a web

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:09,760
agency is a web agency is our web pages

00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:14,080
why are you different why should they

00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:16,240
hire you now for us we turned that we

00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:17,560
try to focus on delivery being the

00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,690
differentiator which shouldn't be a

00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:23,020
competing factor in our industry but in

00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:25,420
the UK at the moment it is but delivery

00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:26,260
and the processes that we use is a

00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:29,100
differentiate

00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:31,720
so we focus on that what is it for you

00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:33,940
what makes you the best in the world of

00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:36,340
what you do now Theresa spoken before

00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:40,210
about focusing on a real neat shore as

00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:43,480
you say in the u.s. niche and you know

00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:45,640
so whether that is very scalable Drupal

00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:48,130
citing a huge amounts of traffic or

00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:50,740
whether it is for you know marketing

00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:53,470
automation focus at what is your area of

00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:55,900
expertise that could be a sector it

00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:58,360
could be a particular range of skills it

00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:00,220
could be a way that you approach that or

00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,350
it could just be that you're really fun

00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:04,990
to work with and you want to picture the

00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:08,380
creative industries so your USP is that

00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:10,540
your fire so what is your differentiator

00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:13,150
and it will come from all of those three

00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:15,430
things around the outside the client the

00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:17,050
team and the tools somewhere in the

00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:19,870
middle there will be your differentiator

00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:21,610
think about what that is and then the

00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:25,660
name of you can be the branding people

00:40:21,610 --> 00:40:29,290
get far too hung up on us you make the

00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:30,910
name what you want it to me it doesn't

00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:33,270
need start being amazing think some of

00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:36,010
the the big brands in the world walmart

00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:37,690
things like that when you start if you

00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:39,100
had a big branding session and sat down

00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:42,100
and said yeah we're going to call this

00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:46,180
walmart we'd ever get oh my god that's

00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:47,500
amazing name is so cool no so it doesn't

00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:50,400
matter for you sometimes the simplest

00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:50,400
things work best

00:41:00,569 --> 00:41:06,550
key person no need to go over the top

00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:08,260
with these cruel fancy names the main

00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:10,540
thing that matters way more than the

00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:13,089
actual name or anything like that is

00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:14,890
that sense of purpose that comes out of

00:41:13,089 --> 00:41:16,930
your differentiator comes out for real

00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:20,079
want to do something different and it's

00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:22,210
what will motivate you every day and

00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:25,569
it's what will motivate your team and

00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:29,020
it's what will motivate your clients is

00:41:25,569 --> 00:41:31,260
that sense of purpose that sense of you

00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:34,119
are going to do something great for them

00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:36,579
and they're going to love you from what

00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:38,619
is your purpose find your purpose and

00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:41,230
that's one of the key things about

00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:45,480
making your agents are different so it's

00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:49,180
a very short section on brand and now

00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:51,609
not everything always go smoothly for

00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:54,400
the redwood trees as much as for a

00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:57,400
Drupal agency forest fires can sweep

00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,290
through problems out of your control now

00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,150
the trees are very Hardy at dealing with

00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:03,369
this here you can see some of the you

00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:05,410
know thousands or hundreds towards a

00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:06,849
thousand year old trees and they've got

00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:08,829
these it's hard to see with the light

00:42:06,849 --> 00:42:11,650
but they've got these bite marks up the

00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:14,589
tracks this is where forest fires have

00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:16,089
raged through the area but the trees

00:42:14,589 --> 00:42:19,390
have survived they've built themselves

00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:21,760
to be so solid so tall so thick that

00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:24,819
they can survive this fire they can you

00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:27,490
know survive all these big bite marks

00:42:24,819 --> 00:42:30,579
and if you look I mean that's a close-up

00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:34,060
of one of the trees I saw it's basically

00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:36,550
charcoal this part of this true but if

00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:38,890
you look up its green shoots at the top

00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:41,829
the rest of the tree is surviving and

00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:43,990
these trees actually heal round and over

00:42:41,829 --> 00:42:45,730
the years they heal themselves and can

00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:48,940
then survive the future fires that are

00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:51,790
coming through and the other great thing

00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:56,230
about the forest fires is it's actually

00:42:51,790 --> 00:42:58,300
really good for the forest and it seems

00:42:56,230 --> 00:43:01,119
counterintuitive doesn't it a fire

00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:03,970
raging through destroying some of the

00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,430
trees damaging others and it's great for

00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:07,589
the forest

00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:09,359
now what happens is when the fire comes

00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:11,430
through its at a fairly low level so it

00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:14,280
no date ditch the damages the trees at

00:43:11,430 --> 00:43:17,250
the bottom but the heat that rises makes

00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:20,130
the pinecones open up and drop from the

00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:23,819
tree and they drop into ash which is a

00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:27,089
beautifully fertile soil to drop into

00:43:23,819 --> 00:43:30,569
and they grow and you see within a few

00:43:27,089 --> 00:43:32,550
years all of this amazing new growth so

00:43:30,569 --> 00:43:34,619
what would that be like if it was for

00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:37,349
your business if when big problems

00:43:34,619 --> 00:43:39,150
happened you could survive them but you

00:43:37,349 --> 00:43:41,400
could use it for new growth you could

00:43:39,150 --> 00:43:43,559
use it to regenerate your company what

00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:45,059
would that be like let's look at some of

00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:50,300
the typical problems that we come up

00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:50,300
against do you recognize any of these I

00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,849
think we need a quick show of hands if

00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:01,849
anyone has ever had any of this happen

00:43:59,849 --> 00:44:05,609
in their business I'm including me here

00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:07,920
okay everybody yeah nobody is on their

00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:10,200
own gang no actually I run the perfect

00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:13,740
business and we've never had any of that

00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:15,299
happen to us it just doesn't exist the

00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:18,150
top of the list there is of course all

00:44:15,299 --> 00:44:20,670
of the financial stuff we undervalue our

00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:23,309
time massively all the time we are

00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:24,660
terrible at estimating projects and we

00:44:23,309 --> 00:44:27,780
keep going into fixed everything

00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:30,599
projects so fixed one get out of fixed

00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:32,579
everything projects and also under

00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:34,559
billing that kind of thing of our well

00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:36,660
yeah I did work few extra days on this

00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:39,000
or even a few extra weeks but I don't

00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:41,280
really think charge don't tell the

00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,260
client I did it and so all the time

00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,960
there's this free work that's been given

00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:48,750
away but you know what people still

00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,609
expect to be paid their salary so we've

00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:53,010
got to make sure that the same way we

00:44:50,609 --> 00:44:55,559
respect the people that work for us and

00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:57,630
we pay them but our clients respect ours

00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:59,520
in the work we do and pay us and we have

00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:01,710
to earn that respect don't get me wrong

00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,410
but we have to make sure that we get

00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:06,299
paid for what we do another big problem

00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,690
taking on the wrong clients projects

00:45:06,299 --> 00:45:10,270
that's very common and

00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:12,720
here's a key one we do all of the time

00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:15,250
in Drupal we focus on building the sites

00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:17,800
and there's nobody focusing on building

00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:19,839
the business every single member in a

00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,940
small agency will be hacking away

00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:24,609
developing sites or designing something

00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:26,290
or doing cool stuff and nobody will be

00:45:24,609 --> 00:45:29,319
there doing the building of the business

00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:30,579
the hard graph to really grow then

00:45:29,319 --> 00:45:34,030
that's not knowing how you're doing you

00:45:30,579 --> 00:45:36,700
kind of finances bring I don't want to

00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:39,160
look at the numbers I don't do

00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:40,630
spreadsheets all that kind of stuff you

00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:43,859
need to know how you're doing all the

00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:46,480
time for the safety of your staffs jobs

00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:48,849
one day this big good motivator for you

00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,980
get all of your staff together for a

00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:52,690
party at Saturday afternoon picnic or

00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:56,680
something get them to bring their

00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:59,109
families including the kids you stand

00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,750
there and look around and you look at

00:45:59,109 --> 00:46:04,510
the children that depend on you for the

00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:07,390
home and the food that depend on your

00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:11,920
business going well and being safe going

00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:14,349
forward do that and then buckle down and

00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:16,270
check your finances and plan ahead have

00:46:14,349 --> 00:46:18,010
a good cash flow know what your

00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:19,750
profitability levels are no the

00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:22,420
profitability levels of each of your

00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:24,369
projects know that level of detail

00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:26,710
because that's what keeps the business

00:46:24,369 --> 00:46:28,780
safe that builds your tree trunk nice

00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:32,770
and solid so you can withstand the

00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:33,730
forest fires and wasting time it happens

00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:35,890
all the time whether its internal

00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:37,599
projects or gang clients you shouldn't

00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:40,960
whatever it is look for where you're

00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:43,270
wasting time and learn to fix that so

00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:46,540
here are some of the quick fixes based

00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:48,369
on those some of these you maybe have to

00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:50,140
go away and do after this drupalcon if

00:46:48,369 --> 00:46:52,089
there's something that kind of speaks to

00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:54,160
you that thinks yeah you know what I

00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:55,660
want to do that in our business could be

00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:58,240
one of these it could be something else

00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:59,740
but do take a look at this and see is

00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,050
there anything that you could do in your

00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:03,310
business because I know with me and mine

00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:06,460
and my business partners business

00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:09,069
there's always stuff we're learning and

00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:12,190
we're fixing all the time we're looking

00:47:09,069 --> 00:47:14,290
to learn the key thing is this is

00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:16,069
Michael Gerber he did a great book years

00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:20,829
ago called the e-myth

00:47:16,069 --> 00:47:25,880
and the key message from it was this as

00:47:20,829 --> 00:47:28,459
the business owner business manager your

00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:31,849
job is not to work in the business doing

00:47:28,459 --> 00:47:34,009
the job of the business so you shouldn't

00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:37,219
be one building Drupal sites or

00:47:34,009 --> 00:47:40,279
designing Drupal sites or whatever your

00:47:37,219 --> 00:47:42,019
job is to work on the business you are

00:47:40,279 --> 00:47:44,329
growing the business establishing the

00:47:42,019 --> 00:47:46,519
business making it safe and solid that

00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:49,910
big thick trunk so it will grow tall

00:47:46,519 --> 00:47:52,009
that should be your focus you know what

00:47:49,910 --> 00:48:01,130
we're really bad at it because we're

00:47:52,009 --> 00:48:03,289
stuck and we like that on all of us yeah

00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:05,630
yeah yeah I know the last line on this

00:48:03,289 --> 00:48:08,029
button but I'm better at doing this I'm

00:48:05,630 --> 00:48:10,069
going to focus on dings so you sometimes

00:48:08,029 --> 00:48:13,099
have to stick to the hard stuff and do

00:48:10,069 --> 00:48:15,859
things just to improve the business and

00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:17,209
learn lessons and maybe that you haven't

00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:19,579
always been doing the right way I know I

00:48:17,209 --> 00:48:21,109
haven't I've made so many mistakes have

00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:22,729
you ever seen I think they have it over

00:48:21,109 --> 00:48:24,140
here as well they know the cordon Ramsey

00:48:22,729 --> 00:48:26,569
program where he goes around to

00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:27,949
different restaurants and fixes them do

00:48:26,569 --> 00:48:30,829
you ever see that so there you've got

00:48:27,949 --> 00:48:33,289
this international michelin-starred chef

00:48:30,829 --> 00:48:35,509
one of the most highly rated chefs in

00:48:33,289 --> 00:48:38,890
the world he goes into a small-town

00:48:35,509 --> 00:48:42,739
diner and gives them some advice they go

00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:44,420
no you're wrong nope not doing that note

00:48:42,739 --> 00:48:45,859
we're not changing yeah I know we're

00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:47,059
nearly out of business but we're not

00:48:45,859 --> 00:48:49,670
changing we're not going to do anything

00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:51,380
so the fact is this there's always stuff

00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:52,999
we can learn even if you're not at a

00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:55,069
pain point even if your business is

00:48:52,999 --> 00:48:57,859
going great there are so many ways to

00:48:55,069 --> 00:49:00,229
improve it all the time so let's not be

00:48:57,859 --> 00:49:02,660
stalking about so what we want to do is

00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:04,969
start a culture of sharing within the

00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:08,900
business community within Drupal we all

00:49:04,969 --> 00:49:11,269
share code freely I mean free do we get

00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:13,099
that we get that it's valuable what else

00:49:11,269 --> 00:49:14,900
could we share what we share about the

00:49:13,099 --> 00:49:17,359
way we run our business so we've started

00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:19,309
open sourcing all of our processes all

00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:21,410
of our staff so this is the website ASAP

00:49:19,309 --> 00:49:23,930
wait wondered oh I oh it's the Wonder

00:49:21,410 --> 00:49:28,030
way and we're sharing everything so that

00:49:23,930 --> 00:49:30,550
spreadsheet for evaluating new rsps is

00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:32,530
they're all of our sales process details

00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:34,720
are up there everything and we're

00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:36,130
gradually putting it all up there but we

00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:38,980
would also like to encourage other

00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:40,840
businesses to do the same what would

00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:43,270
Drupal be like is if in the same way

00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:45,700
that a modulus released by one company

00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:47,890
and another company releases bug fixes

00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:49,570
and improvements that matter what would

00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:52,690
it be like whips the same the way we run

00:49:49,570 --> 00:49:55,210
our businesses what would it be like if

00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:57,340
you know we would release the way of

00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:59,350
evaluating new sales processes and

00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:02,680
someone else you know a queer for

00:49:59,350 --> 00:50:04,480
example or you know anyone else said I

00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:07,300
actually we've tried a different rain it

00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,460
worked great here it is so let's share

00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,080
stuff so maybe think about you can open

00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:13,710
source within your business what you can

00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:18,180
share what processes are working for you

00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:21,010
so we now have 10 minutes for questions

00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:23,530
I've reached the end of my kind of my

00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:24,640
bit so does any of those there anything

00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:28,120
anybody wants to know we've probably got

00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:30,880
time for about four questions maybe how

00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:33,940
long who's got the first question this

00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:36,130
chapter on Mars so you've talked a lot

00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:39,430
about things like Jones maintain twenty

00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:40,690
percent of turnover how without not

00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:42,760
committing more than twenty percent of

00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:44,290
turnover to one company how do you

00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:46,060
manage that when you're a very small

00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:48,280
company what advice would you give to

00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:49,720
smell companies on the really large

00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,610
projects where it starts getting above

00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:53,890
that twenty percent seeked partner with

00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:55,450
another business spread the risk between

00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:56,950
different agencies I know it's tempting

00:50:55,450 --> 00:50:58,990
to go out there and grab all of the

00:50:56,950 --> 00:51:00,850
money and you see this great big

00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:02,890
paycheck that's up there that they want

00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:04,510
to give you all this budget but you will

00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:07,300
start fell it's more than you can manage

00:51:04,510 --> 00:51:08,770
as an agency or the horrible thing of

00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:11,470
you know you take it on and it comes

00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:13,540
fifty percent real turnover suddenly the

00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:15,850
club the key contacts the client leaves

00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:17,680
someone new comes in and they have their

00:51:15,850 --> 00:51:20,770
favorite agency from the last job and

00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,960
you're out the business is doing so I

00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:24,730
would say at that level starts spreading

00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:26,320
the work between different agencies and

00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:27,790
you'll then build relationships you'll

00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,710
show how collaborative the Drupal

00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:33,100
community is and you'll spread the work

00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:34,990
around okay we had another hand up just

00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,770
here comes chap and then you over there

00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:39,540
what's your question

00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:42,600
you mentioned the 1 to 3 ratio of

00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:44,880
employee pay packages to revenue how do

00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:49,590
you empower employees to grow their pee

00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:51,000
in that is such fantastic question

00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:54,030
because that's what we're looking at at

00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:56,310
the moment and there's a couple of

00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:59,490
things that we're looking at to enable

00:51:56,310 --> 00:52:02,490
that one is transparency so make it very

00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:04,350
clear how everyone's k is calculate what

00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:06,780
formula is and how we approach things

00:52:04,350 --> 00:52:09,510
but also showing how clearly it's linked

00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:11,760
through to the Keith stuff of what

00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:14,640
clients pay us and what we're valued at

00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,950
and therefore showing that the extra pay

00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,960
rises are available through becoming

00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:21,360
either more billable being more

00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,190
productive or by being billable at a

00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:25,230
higher rate and that's increasing your

00:52:23,190 --> 00:52:28,080
expertise and their knowledge so

00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:30,390
therefore we provide training relevant

00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:32,370
budgets and a lot of unit times go to

00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:34,260
conferences and whatever else therefore

00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:37,260
it really motivates people to want to

00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:39,210
learn to be involved in stuff all of the

00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:41,430
time because then they can move up there

00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:43,800
billable rate which increases their

00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:46,530
salary rates what's most in a way like a

00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:49,290
profit chan everyone benefits the more

00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:51,540
we can bear so that's very clear does

00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:52,830
that seem okay as a pheasant but there's

00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:55,440
more we can learn we're looking at this

00:52:52,830 --> 00:53:00,890
alone it was a question round here let

00:52:55,440 --> 00:53:02,850
me check that this doesn't hallo okay I

00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:06,600
think this is a good segue to that

00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:09,060
question um do you do you advertise a

00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:12,810
blended rate to your client based on the

00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:15,450
sprints that you tell them this is the

00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:17,880
day rates that you talked about or does

00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:20,380
every person in the organization have a

00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:23,289
different rate

00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:25,630
yeah we don't use blender drapes and

00:53:23,289 --> 00:53:27,640
because what we want to do is

00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:30,519
demonstrate the different value of

00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:32,680
different expertise and experience so

00:53:30,519 --> 00:53:35,829
there's a reason why some people build

00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:37,720
out at more than other people and we

00:53:35,829 --> 00:53:39,819
want to make that very transparent to

00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:41,769
the client but also because otherwise

00:53:39,819 --> 00:53:45,069
what what happens is the client quickly

00:53:41,769 --> 00:53:47,319
identifies who they feel has most

00:53:45,069 --> 00:53:49,240
experienced expertise and demands more

00:53:47,319 --> 00:53:51,730
of their time and if it there isn't a

00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:54,160
cost associated with that then there

00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:55,900
isn't a an incentive for balance and

00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,029
okay we can see some of the smaller

00:53:55,900 --> 00:54:00,670
tasks can be done by more junior people

00:53:58,029 --> 00:54:02,829
and senior task done by these people so

00:54:00,670 --> 00:54:05,410
you want to make it very transparent for

00:54:02,829 --> 00:54:07,720
client because a that's a key principle

00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:10,210
as the transmatter but then they can

00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:11,589
make decisions so they can say okay well

00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:13,869
our budgets have been cut so therefore

00:54:11,589 --> 00:54:15,940
this really senior person we see the

00:54:13,869 --> 00:54:18,160
value but for a couple of you know the

00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:20,470
next few strengths or the next in five

00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:21,910
Sprint's we feel that they've set up the

00:54:20,470 --> 00:54:23,920
work enough that the more junior team

00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:26,349
can continue and they can come back and

00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:30,970
order the work out so yeah we don't do

00:54:26,349 --> 00:54:33,069
blend friends so i'll just be that seems

00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:35,289
like a logistical headache not too much

00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:37,569
because you're only doing the planning

00:54:35,289 --> 00:54:39,789
and your billing a bit between every

00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:41,470
spring so we finish a sprint and we bill

00:54:39,789 --> 00:54:43,480
what was done there we plan the next

00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:45,730
sprint and you for class who's going to

00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:47,230
be on the team and you work that way and

00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:49,000
we in fact even allow our clients to

00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:51,730
fire as a sign of respect if they want

00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,990
to we don't have long tions we only want

00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:55,119
clients to be tied into us by being

00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:57,609
happy because otherwise it's are not

00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,500
matter view so so yeah that's not an

00:54:57,609 --> 00:55:01,420
acronym headache filling and by the

00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:03,970
screen apps things a lot more simple

00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:07,089
advanced we have a question just back

00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:09,069
here jumping here I wonderful

00:55:07,089 --> 00:55:11,019
presentation cherelle morning if you can

00:55:09,069 --> 00:55:13,089
probably give a couple makes all of you

00:55:11,019 --> 00:55:15,039
I how you guys got started around giving

00:55:13,089 --> 00:55:17,180
business when you have the Drupal and so

00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:18,710
forth

00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,940
a couple of minutes is a challenge

00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:23,150
because there's quite a history I'll

00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:24,530
give a real snapshot of view and wonder

00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:26,300
crowd was the name that committee was

00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:30,140
merged it was announced at droop calm

00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:31,940
Munich two and a half million ooh and it

00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:34,609
was the murder of four of europe's key

00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:36,859
drupal agencies and each of those have

00:55:34,609 --> 00:55:39,079
been working at work been running for

00:55:36,859 --> 00:55:41,059
about four or five years so there's a

00:55:39,079 --> 00:55:43,369
long history panel to the fore we

00:55:41,059 --> 00:55:45,349
brought all four together VES upon mu is

00:55:43,369 --> 00:55:47,270
the CEO and his guy that did the deal

00:55:45,349 --> 00:55:49,369
and brought everybody together and at

00:55:47,270 --> 00:55:52,670
the time of the merger I came on to open

00:55:49,369 --> 00:55:55,190
up a new office in the UK and start

00:55:52,670 --> 00:55:57,859
building up consultancy work as well so

00:55:55,190 --> 00:56:00,410
I've been involved since the group was

00:55:57,859 --> 00:56:02,680
formed as well so that's a very brief

00:56:00,410 --> 00:56:05,329
potted history we've always used Drupal

00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:06,829
Drupal is our thing but these days we

00:56:05,329 --> 00:56:08,839
don't fill ourselves as just a drupal

00:56:06,829 --> 00:56:10,180
shock because we're about processes

00:56:08,839 --> 00:56:13,339
Mutchler about technology and

00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:14,960
communication okay thank you one more

00:56:13,339 --> 00:56:18,140
final question and then we'll wrap up

00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:22,309
we'll go around this side I feel like

00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:25,700
Jerry Springer it's fantastic ok where

00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:27,500
was the hands are here you what kind of

00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:30,380
expectations you put on your employees

00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:33,049
in terms of hours worked every day and

00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:36,319
vacations and things and do solicit

00:56:33,049 --> 00:56:39,819
their buy some time for hope so

00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:39,819
just like that projects

00:56:40,390 --> 00:56:43,930
well that's quite actually quite a

00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:46,119
complex question for me to answer about

00:56:43,930 --> 00:56:49,569
us because one of the things that we do

00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:52,210
is we try and be as management light as

00:56:49,569 --> 00:56:55,630
possible so there is we're a very very

00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:58,750
flat organization so all of our

00:56:55,630 --> 00:57:00,279
management team are you know very close

00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:01,480
the actual day today doing of the

00:57:00,279 --> 00:57:04,630
business there's no kind of big

00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:08,200
hierarchy in a a big office somewhere or

00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:11,849
in a volcano headquarters but in terms

00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:15,839
of the question was kind of about

00:57:11,849 --> 00:57:15,839
empowering the employees is that right

00:57:16,109 --> 00:57:27,609
yeah the hours yeah so what we tell our

00:57:24,099 --> 00:57:30,400
clients is that a day is effectively

00:57:27,609 --> 00:57:32,980
seven hours trust because there's always

00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:36,220
an hour of sorting out other stuff and

00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:38,829
calls and things like that and but

00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:41,019
employees when there are really

00:57:38,829 --> 00:57:42,880
responsible for their own time so in a

00:57:41,019 --> 00:57:44,079
sprint you're agreeing and you're

00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,660
committing to the work that you're doing

00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:48,640
and we care more about work that gets

00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:50,589
done rather than when it gets done or

00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:52,559
where it gets done so we operate with

00:57:50,589 --> 00:57:55,720
distributed teams were in 10 countries

00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:57,640
across Europe with very distributed

00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,740
teams and it doesn't really matter

00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:02,349
exactly when they work where they work

00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:04,150
as long as things get done and client is

00:58:02,349 --> 00:58:06,910
happy with the result there's a huge

00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:08,920
amount of flexibility to self-manage for

00:58:06,910 --> 00:58:10,390
every member of our team and that's one

00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:12,220
of the things they really value if I

00:58:10,390 --> 00:58:16,500
were able to attract some very good

00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:16,500
candidates because of that that power

00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:22,380
no we don't track in that way so for

00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:25,200
example we are selling by the day we

00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:27,570
just it's just to buy the day thing all

00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,670
that we care about is results we do not

00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:31,380
care about is someone in the office at

00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:34,110
nine in the morning and are they there

00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:36,750
until five or six we had one client

00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:38,490
actually it was a large US company that

00:58:36,750 --> 00:58:40,530
said to us well I will want to know your

00:58:38,490 --> 00:58:43,020
developers are at a desk 10 hours a day

00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:45,690
working for us I would say haha I'm

00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:48,030
sorry but they won't be you know ten

00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:49,500
hours a day people get burnout you are

00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:52,110
not getting the best productivity of

00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:55,320
people and in fact in the UK on the UK

00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:57,420
team we do only four days a week client

00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:59,700
work and one day a week training

00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:02,000
development developing our tools our

00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:04,290
systems working in the Drupal community

00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,840
all that sort thinks that's what enables

00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:09,120
Louis nyman who's one of our UK team to

00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:10,890
do a lot of work for Drupal 8 is the CSS

00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:13,050
leave maintainer and doing that front

00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:15,330
end work so a lot of people are doing

00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:17,880
contributions like that so four days a

00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:19,770
week is billable in the UK and clients

00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:21,930
love that because on Fridays they get to

00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:24,720
rest catch up with what's happening

00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:27,600
because a motivated smart team actually

00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:28,830
works damn fast and down hard and if

00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:31,560
they're having to do evenings and

00:59:28,830 --> 00:59:33,300
weekends there's a problem and you don't

00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:34,980
want the work creeped out and hide a

00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:37,200
problem and on the problem to be

00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:39,480
surfaced so now we don't manage and

00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:42,750
track time to a really precise level we

00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:44,790
track work done ok that is all the time

00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:46,050
we've got for questions if there's

00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:47,850
anyone else who wants to ask anything

00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:50,640
I'll wait up the front for a little bit

00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:53,070
but let me check how we're doing ah my

00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:55,470
goodness it is five seconds to the end

00:59:53,070 --> 00:59:58,670
of the slot so with that I'll say thank

00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:58,670
