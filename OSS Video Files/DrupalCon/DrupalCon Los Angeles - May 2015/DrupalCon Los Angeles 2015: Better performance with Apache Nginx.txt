Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Better performance with Apache Nginx
Publication date: 2015-05-13
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	In this session we will explore the ways that an Apache/Nginx hybrid surpasses pure Apache in both performance and functionality. We will be comparing the two servers with Identical Drupal 7 installations. Attendees will learn how to install Nginx on CentOS along with the configuration up a Drupal installation on the platform.

I welcome everybody my name is Scott

00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:06,500
Mitchell and here we have a talk on

00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,120
managing Drupal with engine X

00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,370
specifically this is going to be

00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:14,460
performance at appendix hybrid versus a

00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:18,840
regular pure Apache set up guys enjoy in

00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:22,439
Drupal cons before i get to get keen it

00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,820
was awesome right every time i come to

00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,430
one of these it just gets better and

00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,199
better so very often you guys can follow

00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:31,470
along if you have the Wi-Fi it's at

00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:34,920
inmotion hosting com / support /

00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:38,700
drupalcon with a capital D capital c /

00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,969
2015 should be exactly the same as out

00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,480
here this is local copy no variable

00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:44,480
think it's up there

00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,210
all right a little bit about me am i

00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,489
again my name is Scott Mitchell working

00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,949
with the web on and off or mostly on

00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,470
since 1997 basically started by

00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,449
deconstructing home pages and you know

00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:02,520
figuring out HTML like that learns in

00:01:00,449 --> 00:01:04,680
perl i was ordered a programmer just

00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,950
nothing web-based that's how I got my

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:11,310
start since then been working on and off

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,960
with various different technologies been

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:18,060
with my company inmotion hosting since

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:21,450
2010 so such five years there and I'm a

00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,759
customer community developer and while

00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,470
not a full-time coder we do develop some

00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,240
tools to help both our customers you

00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:30,210
know internally externally but what we

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,979
specifically do is as the customer

00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:35,580
community we hope the global customer

00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:37,830
which is not necessarily our own but

00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:41,310
anybody that has questions on the web

00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:44,070
about Drupal or any CMS through using

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,360
set up so we field questions from all

00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:49,830
over the only thing we can't really

00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,530
specifically address is the customized

00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:53,640
you know set up from servers so much but

00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,320
we do get a lot of questions from

00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,020
everywhere whether it's a wam setup at

00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,509
home or even from you know other

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:06,259
competitors or whatever been working

00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:08,549
with Drupal since 2012 not really a lot

00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:12,030
another super deep experience there but

00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:14,610
since version 6 mostly 7 because that's

00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,560
where most of our customers are based

00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,860
and we're starting to reach into 8 as it

00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,860
goes along

00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,560
okay now i know he guys it's 5pm we have

00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,930
an hour block you guys want to eat so

00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,580
well plug won't take the whole hour so

00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,840
i'll do a best and if that starbucks

00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:36,310
hasn't worn off it'll prob be pretty

00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:39,460
quick so we'll see how that works out so

00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:40,960
we have going on here next alright so

00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,620
about in motion we've been around since

00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:47,050
2001 so working on 15 years here and our

00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,660
focus is small to medium sized business

00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:51,130
hosting so if you have doctors or

00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,140
lawyers whatever they have more the

00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,990
business card type websites who work

00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:57,730
with those we have a lot of mom pop

00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,920
style ecommerce businesses whether they

00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:03,280
run in their kind of a little etsy

00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,500
projects or in a little bit bigger with

00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,240
other reselling some things guy that

00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,470
cuts my grass down the street the kid he

00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,600
has his own website so pretty much

00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,250
everybody has web sites and we focus

00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,600
mostly on those guys we do have some

00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,130
enterprise-level some commercial class

00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:17,980
level but right another more they

00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:21,940
outliers then then they mean you can

00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:23,440
find a set in motion hosting com and our

00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,450
specific department my specific

00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,180
department is inmotion hosting com /

00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,610
support so if you get home later on

00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:32,950
you'll find you have any questions about

00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:36,370
about this about Drupal or anything else

00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:37,900
in general no server configuration but

00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:39,400
anything else just hit us up which is

00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,590
more of a forum style where you asked a

00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,810
question we come back to you and you can

00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,440
follow us a course on twitter at in

00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:46,440
MOOCs and boosting

00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:52,690
alright so what about this project

00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:54,940
before you get to the agenda it was more

00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:57,580
of a theory for us we hadn't really done

00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:00,100
this yet we knew about it was setting up

00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,750
a hybrid system from reading you know

00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,240
other people have done it and so we kind

00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:09,180
of wanted to see what would happen if we

00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:11,410
took basically a Joe average site and

00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,790
perform this test on it and see what

00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,320
kind of performance increase here we get

00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,760
and what that could mean to to our

00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,250
customers or anybody they might be in

00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,190
the same situation because women help

00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:22,780
everybody I'm we didn't fine tune the

00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,280
patch your engine X we're kind of just

00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:28,030
jumped in there with it and just this is

00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:29,620
like the only big change we made okay so

00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,530
there wasn't a lot of back-end

00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:34,300
configuration because we want to see

00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,940
what happened just purely on this one

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:41,020
instance all right so we did a normal

00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:43,000
site and this is a cPanel only set up

00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,460
because the plugin we use this working

00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,050
for cpanel working with cpanel so this

00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,270
is something that works with hosts that

00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:52,600
have the cPanel set up some hosts don't

00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:57,820
work that way but don't have data for

00:04:52,600 --> 00:05:00,190
that side ok so the agenda here we have

00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,750
first a quick history of Apache and

00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:03,820
engine X these are kind of a brief

00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,710
history just to show where the state of

00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,260
the web was at the time and kind of

00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:10,120
background of why they were written and

00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:12,760
then we have a patchy vs. engine X and

00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,350
that's not a comparison to say who's

00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,090
more dominant two different features

00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:18,669
they have and once we want to try to

00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,800
optimize in this hybrid model the test

00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:24,520
setup just basic rundown of our specs

00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,120
and the site and the server and then of

00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,120
course the results

00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,349
alright going over to the patchy all

00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:37,000
right so John will jump with mr. Peabody

00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:40,930
here in the Wayback Machine can go to

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:44,379
1995 and dominant server at the time

00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:49,870
HTTP server was the ncsa written by mr.

00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:52,539
Robert McCool of that name McCool ahead

00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:55,060
of me in like that microsoft also kind

00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:59,259
of jumped on the market there is one

00:05:55,060 --> 00:06:01,779
point oh and August came out with NT

00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:04,599
3.51 was packaged with so they were

00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:05,710
entering the fray there Apache actually

00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:08,020
started the development in early

00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:11,710
nineteen ninety-five it was basically

00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:13,840
built off the ncsa model the product

00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,550
ended mr. McCool had left the project so

00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,009
he were kind of picking it up and

00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:21,969
working with it from there which gave it

00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:22,960
a quick release date here of December so

00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:25,150
you're looking probably April May ish

00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:29,110
and then moving forward December they

00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:30,870
released it's just kind of what it

00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,699
looked like with the HTTP server

00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:35,289
saturation I guess you could call it

00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:37,990
ncsa here topping out fifty two percent

00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:41,259
Apache of five percent that's basically

00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,460
release month but you know people that

00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:44,110
were kind of involved in a project new

00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,360
was going on and these are people are

00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:49,089
kind of coming off the ncsa it's kind of

00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,639
early adopters son was in there with

00:06:49,089 --> 00:06:53,469
five percent and Microsoft now they just

00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:59,830
jumped in in August they had just less

00:06:53,469 --> 00:07:02,979
than one percent so shoot forward six

00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,870
months 1996 June Apaches already

00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:07,719
dominating at thirty-three percent with

00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:09,639
the ncsa run in 22 now on the previous

00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:12,819
slide we showed the two combined ran

00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:14,650
about 57% total and here they have

00:07:12,819 --> 00:07:19,810
fifty-five percent so it largely was

00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:21,669
just Apache taken over ncsa share their

00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:24,129
son course jumped up a little bit

00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:29,409
microsoft growing nice three percent

00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:31,360
there and the other guys 8926 so

00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:33,039
websites the 90s weren't exactly what

00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,900
they are today if you remember these

00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:37,599
this sites actually still up on the web

00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,250
somewhere they're very bland didn't have

00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,990
a lot to worry about there wasn't the

00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:45,970
interactivity that there is now

00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:48,820
you know videos were rare you can see

00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:51,250
this is normal site very bland various

00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:54,370
static pictures they're not even really

00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:58,090
any columns going on most formatting was

00:07:54,370 --> 00:08:03,130
tabular so real easy not much to worry

00:07:58,090 --> 00:08:04,540
about and the most active the social

00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,250
media was not big none of course but

00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,680
everybody had a homepage you guys

00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:11,530
remember Angel City even angelfire tier

00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,850
cities there's kind of things and gets

00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,980
the most active you got at the time was

00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:16,990
the spinning icons the animated gifs you

00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:19,390
guys were theirs and one more famous

00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:23,010
ones the hamster dance you guys remember

00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:26,050
that one anybody know there you go

00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:27,460
couldn't make him dance sorry but you

00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:31,320
know still wasn't a lot going on very

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:34,420
easy page so what recent history though

00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:38,470
2005 we had Apache peek at approaching

00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:40,420
seventy percent of market share now

00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:43,840
imagine how much the web grew from 1996

00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:45,760
to 2005 now back then big players would

00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,920
just get on the market you know

00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,730
everybody like I said everybody has a

00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:53,710
website and so they had the fifty-seven

00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,450
percent or so back in 96 they took that

00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,320
over to seventy percent plus all the

00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,480
growth sun's down so they were

00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,640
definitely a dominant force but you can

00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,560
see now 2015 they're down to

00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,870
approximately 39 which is the lowest

00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,270
since 96 it's not because they're bad

00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,660
it's just cuz now everybody needs to

00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:13,000
configure to their own specific you know

00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:15,300
nish and so there's other options out

00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,300
there now

00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:24,200
alright so index who created the wayback

00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:27,130
machine for a DeLorean so we started

00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:31,100
development here in 2002 hi mr. Igor

00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:33,170
Cecilia said that right from Kazakhstan

00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:35,450
and he started from scratch so a little

00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:39,440
bit longer development time there and we

00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:41,240
released in 2004 and one of the things

00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,880
that was created is to handle the sea

00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:46,670
10k issue I'll this is for handing

00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:50,330
10,000 concurrent connections on your

00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:52,400
site at one time I don't know what that

00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:53,779
would be to my site but you know a lot

00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,360
of sites they were looking forward to

00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:58,070
that might crash a lot of people's sites

00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:00,710
now even they have especially heavy

00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:01,640
ecommerce site so that's one of the

00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:05,089
things that would look at and they

00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:06,710
wanted to handle a lot of traffic so

00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:08,510
high traffic sites like Rambler which is

00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:12,170
a Russian search engine anybody heard of

00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:14,960
that before one God Aten ever done

00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:17,450
before either so 500 million requests

00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:20,089
per day in 2008 pretty nice half a

00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:22,370
billion by comparison at the same time

00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:25,310
Google was doing 1.6 billion searches a

00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:28,160
day but it's google they have their own

00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:29,540
set up and now they're doing 3.5 so but

00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:34,040
so he was looking to fill the needs of

00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:35,870
sites like this all right so three years

00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,760
after release Apache still dominating

00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,160
the 50 / six percent and Microsoft now

00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,110
at 32 so together putting out probably

00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,839
almost ninety percent eighty-eight

00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,930
percent their son is shrunk back down

00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,180
the to pretty much on their way out and

00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:51,680
Google popped up there at two percent so

00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,650
three years after release engine X has

00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,250
new under one percent just kind of get

00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:57,250
noticed out here

00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:02,450
google web Syria I don't they don't use

00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:04,720
it commercially on thing but I don't

00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:06,530
know i'm not sure what their goal is

00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,530
with that they are they they're out

00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:12,170
there still run around two percent now

00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:14,450
this is more recent data now so forward

00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:15,890
eight years apache at thirty-nine

00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:18,830
percent Microsoft twenty-nine percent

00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:21,650
you see a slight decrease there but

00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:22,850
engine X up to fifteen percent now over

00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:25,880
eight years doesn't seem like a great

00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:28,790
human huge leap but the big story there

00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,530
is at the top 1,000 sites on the web at

00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:32,720
top 1000 busiest sites they are the

00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:35,180
dominant server so they are kind of

00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,620
finding their niche there doesn't mean

00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,090
Apaches bad has just does things

00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,820
differently so I'm not trying to knock a

00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:42,620
patch you know alright so sample sites

00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:46,070
so we have top 1,000 sites you know when

00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:48,950
and what kind of sites relays that three

00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:51,590
my favorites Netflix anybody have a

00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:53,120
netflix account motors to you in my

00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:55,250
circle it's like having a cell phone if

00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,320
you don't have one you know to kind of

00:11:55,250 --> 00:12:00,830
have the loop up some I might go to for

00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:02,750
movies and too lazy to go to the shelf

00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:08,240
and open the box so I just turn on the

00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:10,130
netflix hulu another one anybody if i go

00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,940
to TV spots so these two bringing its

00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:17,230
cable but they run their front end there

00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:20,780
buffa the engine X and then pinterest

00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:22,160
alright how many guys have interests I'm

00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,350
the only one not unless like four or

00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,570
five okay there we go don't knock it

00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:28,220
it's full of my boards are full of food

00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:31,160
I will never eat and projects I would

00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:33,320
probably never start but I like to look

00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,970
at them and dream one day but three

00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:40,040
real-world examples these guys run into

00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:42,230
next and doing quite well on it alright

00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:44,990
so Apache you vs. engine XO again it's

00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:48,710
not a who's better but it's more of a

00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:50,600
comparison with features we're staying

00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:51,860
pretty high level here zone alright so

00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:56,060
it connections how does a patch you

00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:58,490
handle these connection well it uses NPM

00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:01,550
multiprocessor modules our specifically

00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:04,880
users the worker and it spawns these

00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:09,260
processes all right and each process can

00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,850
handle multiple threads all right each

00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,920
thread has a single connection so it's

00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:17,720
thread just uh can't dedicate that one

00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:21,350
connection engine next a little

00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,060
different it does spawn workers and each

00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:26,840
worker handles thousands of connections

00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:30,560
I use a fast looking mechanism of checks

00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:32,150
events and they're processed and then

00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,360
once they're handled it's removed from

00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:36,590
the loop what does that really mean so

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,750
basically if you're a worker if this

00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:42,560
room was in the worker and everybody in

00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:44,780
here was a connection you had something

00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,460
you need to be worked on we need to

00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:49,280
spawn an event so basically would raise

00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:52,400
your hand like it runs through everybody

00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:53,900
has her hand raised crabs to and handles

00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,000
the process and once that's done the

00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,610
hand goes back down so everybody without

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,600
their hand raised just kind of like in

00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,770
the word but just you know you're

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,470
glossed over because you're not needed

00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:04,730
because kind of how that works so with

00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:06,590
the hill now everybody raise your hand

00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,840
at one time there may be a problem it's

00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:12,470
knowing about the case but that's how

00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:15,350
that works so the static and dynamic

00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:17,180
content and apache on this core level

00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:20,810
their handles it by default which is

00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:22,700
great and passes the dynamic content or

00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:25,940
to a processor in bed to the work for

00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:30,350
instance hours uses mods you PHP because

00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:32,810
we use the MPN worker mod PHP also

00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:34,550
another one and swaps modules in turn

00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:40,910
out as needed for the requirement so

00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:42,800
it's like library tool box over here and

00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,390
genetics also handles a static by

00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,480
default and it's a really good at it in

00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:49,700
the fast the dynamic content it passes

00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:51,440
to an external processor and then it

00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,940
fast cgi here because of a pure in

00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,380
genetic environment it's pretty much

00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,220
they go to you spot it this will go

00:14:54,380 --> 00:15:00,020
through please I basically outsources it

00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:02,090
completely and that leaves the overhead

00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:09,590
only for a static content which makes it

00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:11,810
more efficient go to configuration here

00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:14,080
so Apache has a distributed

00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:18,550
configuration via HT access files and

00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:20,990
love them or hate them too pretty nice

00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,880
now the problem is it checks each

00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,980
component in the path or nhg access file

00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,380
so if everybody in here was a component

00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:30,530
directory you have the opportunity to

00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:32,540
have an HT Access file Apache itself has

00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:34,190
its main configuration file but as a

00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,260
director eating or component you can

00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:40,040
modify or change these rules through

00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:42,320
htaccess file Apache has to ask each and

00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:45,080
every component whether it has a rule

00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,370
change as a chance that's cloud so that

00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,160
can take some time especially if it gets

00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:51,170
bigger and bigger you have small number

00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,940
not so much but as it gets larger and

00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:57,320
you see how many files and folders are

00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:58,490
in some of these CMS's typically though

00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,500
they're used for you oral rewrites

00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:06,589
access rejection authentications like

00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:09,020
that pretty urls engine X on the other

00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:10,339
hand has no decentralized configuration

00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,940
so it doesn't have to go around and ask

00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:15,110
everybody it doesn't mean that it can't

00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,180
do the same things he just does things

00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:19,010
differently but because it doesn't have

00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,810
to go around ask each component do you

00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:23,360
have an htaccess file do you have a rule

00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:25,250
change do you do you do you that makes

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,700
things a little faster so it increases

00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:31,000
performance it's also better security

00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,290
because only the admins with admin

00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,390
figure this so you don't have to worry

00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:39,530
about too many people having their hands

00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:40,970
in the security department however a

00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,589
patch you can turn that off so if you

00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,370
had a concern with that about the

00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:48,810
security issue you can turn off

00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:51,690
Apache Apaches as modules kalite Drupal

00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:52,700
so you can go in and enable disable them

00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,750
you can turn them all on turn them off

00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,760
you have something need to use turn it

00:16:54,750 --> 00:17:00,630
on it's great if you're done with

00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:02,760
something turn it off engine X doesn't

00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:05,790
do that so the modules are compiled into

00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:07,980
the core so every time it has to add a

00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:14,069
new function with the module or remove a

00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:16,230
function if you're an rican pilot okay

00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:18,199
so that's the run down there so what

00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:24,780
does an Apache engine X hybrid look like

00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:26,790
other than ugly I don't know we want to

00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,070
use engine X in front here it's reverse

00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,630
proxy that's what you want it's going to

00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:35,100
handle all the client requests it's kind

00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:38,270
of like the receptionist no sort of

00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:40,679
place things until things were to go

00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:43,590
when i use our speed here is serving a

00:17:40,679 --> 00:17:48,150
static content so your CSS or javascript

00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:49,500
your your image is your HTML and we want

00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:51,480
to pass the dynamic content off to

00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,130
apache hostile sources anyway so we

00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,370
wanna i patch you to do its job over

00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:58,500
there now we could use like I said the

00:17:56,370 --> 00:18:00,630
seeds fast CGI and just do it no

00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,809
straight engine X but we want this to be

00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:06,090
easy to install so anybody here wants to

00:18:03,809 --> 00:18:07,590
do this at night tonight door to get

00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:09,210
back home and so I don't do it want to

00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:11,790
be very quick and easy to do without

00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:15,750
having to reconfigure a bunch of stuff

00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:17,400
on your server which makes easier

00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,110
configuration for content management

00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,970
systems Drupal specifically because

00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:22,380
we're talking about that here so when

00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,780
you create your install your Drupal

00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:28,170
creates the AC access file and has all

00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:30,330
the you know decoration there got your

00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:33,179
URLs turned on everything so if you add

00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,350
this engine X in here you don't have to

00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:38,990
change that you don't have to set the

00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:38,990
configuration to work with index

00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:45,190
and no need to change hosting companies

00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:48,190
in most cases most cases mean if you're

00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:50,500
with a shared host and that's all they

00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:52,570
have this probably isn't gonna work for

00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:55,870
you going to need a VPS dedicated server

00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:58,590
root access to do this so in those cases

00:18:55,870 --> 00:19:02,440
you might need to change but if you were

00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:04,690
in a host it has all three of those or

00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:08,710
at least VPS and dedicated certainly do

00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:13,300
this any idea is if you're on the cusp

00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:15,460
of having to let's see change with the

00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,590
support system or the system admins are

00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:20,770
trying to urge you to possibly upgrade

00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:26,320
change house whatever this can hopefully

00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:27,700
buy you some time it's ultimately

00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,660
they'll pretty much if you like your

00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:31,540
assets you should be able to say with

00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:34,210
your host so the test itself r an Apache

00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:36,520
banks benchmarking tool and that's what

00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:38,650
gave us our data here and the data

00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,150
itself like said we ran for speed wanted

00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,740
to see what's going on well touch other

00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,510
things a couple other things in addition

00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:49,090
to that and we vary the concurrent users

00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:51,370
between 100 150 and 250 so just like 150

00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:54,390
200 people 50 people visiting your site

00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:59,530
simultaneously we also vary the requests

00:19:54,390 --> 00:20:01,150
for 2500 5,000 10,000 requests again

00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,470
we're trying to stay pretty normal we

00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:05,470
first started to do it with two

00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:07,140
different servers but then we went we

00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:09,850
didn't want any configuration or

00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:11,920
hardware differences or anomalies to

00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:13,810
play any part in this so we stay with

00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,630
the same physical server which is you

00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:19,720
know standard VPS without and that's to

00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:22,960
run an SSD eight gigs of ram my server

00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:26,020
italy and we're in a drupal 7 test site

00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:28,180
again we've worked mostly with drupal 7

00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:31,780
so we wanted to stay with what most of

00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:33,130
our customers use we basic we didn't

00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:34,300
need to a hello world site make your

00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,430
want anything on the hello world site

00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:39,370
that's going to work so we built a

00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:41,380
recipe site about 10,000 or so recipes

00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:43,480
on it and gave it a fame we put the you

00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,770
know your panels your views your chaos

00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,930
tool cell account stuff in there it's

00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:48,429
the normal Drupal stuff and a few other

00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:50,230
modules

00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:52,899
let's say a theme would change the theme

00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:54,549
just make it a nice little site but

00:20:52,899 --> 00:20:56,259
nothing ecommerce see or anything like

00:20:54,549 --> 00:21:01,779
that but just kind of a normal everyday

00:20:56,259 --> 00:21:04,240
kind of site you run against now this is

00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:05,559
the plugin we used engine xep or if you

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:09,369
can read that you can find it at engine

00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:11,590
xcp calm and it's free that's one thing

00:21:09,369 --> 00:21:12,669
we aren't we picked again we want

00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:14,220
everybody be able to do this we want

00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:17,139
this to be very easy for everyone and

00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:19,509
sometimes cost is a factor so free was

00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:22,980
the one of the reasons my partner he's

00:21:19,509 --> 00:21:25,269
not here today helped us pick this thing

00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:27,220
detox protections really largely because

00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:30,399
the engine X the way it handles HTTPS

00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,929
UTP requests so that's helpful this is

00:21:30,399 --> 00:21:35,619
these are listed as features on the

00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:37,149
website as well so it does have a double

00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:40,379
HM interface which makes it easy if

00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:44,019
using the Apache I'm sorry cpanel setup

00:21:40,379 --> 00:21:45,490
works for gzip compression and cpanel

00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:47,580
service launder support so no need to

00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:51,990
specifically turn it on and off

00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:54,159
individually PHP be right compatible and

00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:56,440
you can manage which domain uses

00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,919
internet in which domain is Apache via

00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:04,629
SSH alright again that's engine X CP if

00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:07,690
you guys are interested okay and the

00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:10,419
installation super easy I'm not sure how

00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:12,340
technical most you guys are on the back

00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:14,129
end side of things this is literally

00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,820
everything we needed to do seven steps

00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:17,919
you don't have to know what the code

00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:20,799
means but this real quick i'll run it

00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:23,710
it's easy we just changed directory then

00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:26,950
we grab the file open it up change to a

00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:30,509
new directory run the install add

00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:32,740
executable missions and then activate it

00:22:30,509 --> 00:22:34,929
our customers specifically will have a

00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:36,549
little bit shorter because we took the

00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:38,559
first five and made into an our own

00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:39,840
script will just compress them into one

00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:43,330
so we can really do it in three steps

00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:45,519
the uninstall is basically just as

00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:47,769
simple but you can also just turn it on

00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:49,240
and off so something you can try test it

00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:51,100
you like it great you can keep it if not

00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,119
you can go right back to where you were

00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,860
without having to worry about anything

00:22:52,119 --> 00:22:55,860
it's kind of weird looking for there

00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:03,050
alright so first results app actually

00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,790
kind of supported us in this I'll show

00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:07,970
you how it works but we had 100 users

00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:10,790
and we weren't like 31 for speed and the

00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:15,890
2500 request processed here in 20 6.5

00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:18,890
seconds 150 shouted to 41.3 but sadly

00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:21,740
250 did not finish we had configured

00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:23,840
Apache to hold 250 but it got pretty

00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:26,630
close but just died out before it

00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:32,080
finished it to him to 2500 and sadly

00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:34,370
you're going to see that a career in

00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,830
jenks hybrid which literally just layin

00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:39,680
right on top of it we had some speedy

00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:41,630
stuff going on here I 100 at nine point

00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:43,220
five seconds and that was pretty as

00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,570
faster than I was expecting be honest

00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,490
with you and then we ran several

00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:48,890
instances of this so it wasn't they

00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:50,420
weren't always exactly the same this is

00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:54,050
one example but they were fairly

00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:58,820
consistent in how worked out went to 150

00:23:54,050 --> 00:24:01,390
up to 19.7 and 250 slightly slightly

00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:07,240
faster but I did complete which was a

00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:09,680
good thing so what can show here is that

00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,810
in genetics obviously had a lot faster

00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:16,250
time processing these guys whereas

00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:18,920
Apache did do the first two

00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:21,620
they both had the same kind of arc at

00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:24,110
first first two and i'm not sure what

00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:25,940
the apache would look like at 250 but so

00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:27,530
you kind of level off there they do work

00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:28,910
within a range so sometimes we ran them

00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:30,500
there look a little bit differently but

00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:34,520
they still pretty much felon in the same

00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:39,860
range so a few milliseconds few seconds

00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:42,970
I'm sorry so test two we ran with five

00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:48,230
thousand requests and with Apache ran

00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:51,170
44.8 with 100 and then 47.9 150 again

00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:55,370
with the 20 100 to 250 I'm sorry it did

00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:57,920
not finish the hybrid the slain hilltop

00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:02,000
fit brand here at 30 3.8 seconds per

00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:05,540
hundred users 36.1 for 150 and then

00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,980
actually faster with 250 I don't know

00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:09,080
why we ran this a few times and it did

00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:11,390
occasionally happen this way when we

00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,980
were happy with it so again you can see

00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:15,050
the same thing you know there's a big

00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:19,730
disparity there between the van Gen X

00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:21,650
and the Apache halias request and again

00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:23,600
like to arrange so the curve is not

00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:25,280
really concerned but we did run a few

00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:31,580
times and kind of sell the same kind of

00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:33,140
thing one so went for 10,000 all right a

00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:35,360
hundred users were in 10,000 requests

00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:39,680
we've got 111 here Oh point three with

00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,730
Apache 150 users we had 104 so went down

00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,430
a little bit still within their range

00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:47,990
kind of thing and then again 250 just

00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:51,920
died out on this but the Hobbit was

00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:56,510
quicker here with 100 users at 68.5 150

00:25:51,920 --> 00:26:00,920
users at 64 8 faster and then 250 at

00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:02,720
76.1 gave us nicely sorry

00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:04,280
like that

00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,909
the interesting thing is they both

00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:09,530
dipped from 1 to 1 50 I wondered about

00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:12,200
that scratch our heads but it was

00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:14,350
consistent and again you see the same

00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:20,840
thing where the difference between

00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:23,900
engine X hybrid and the Apache kind of

00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:26,600
maintained it's different there so the

00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:29,570
rules here we had 2500 tests the hybrid

00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,980
was twice as fast as the Apache we

00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:33,020
weren't really expecting that girl

00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:35,419
expected more enough third three thirty

00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:37,250
five percent range like we got for the

00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:38,360
five thousand test it was consistent

00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:41,000
there with thirty five percent faster

00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:42,909
and then the ten thousand tests came in

00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,250
also thirty five to forty percent faster

00:26:42,909 --> 00:26:48,350
than Apache plus the hybrid was able to

00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:52,480
process all the concurrent user levels

00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:52,480
for his Apache dying out with the 250

00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:01,720
alright so what does this all mean the

00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:03,549
increase in overall performance was was

00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,429
gained by layering in genetics on top of

00:27:03,549 --> 00:27:08,080
it okay definitely able to handle higher

00:27:06,429 --> 00:27:10,360
level of traffic so if you have a site

00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,789
that may be getting some kind of local

00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:15,340
media attention or you have a client

00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:18,910
maybe gets local media attention radio

00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:21,010
plug in your local news take it Mitchell

00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:23,410
no press plugin to crash it but we've

00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:25,330
seen that before but still might hold it

00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:27,850
a little bit longer before it crashes so

00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:29,799
that'll help it's really easy to toggle

00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:32,860
on and off so you don't have to worry

00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:34,360
too much about you know I set this up

00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,070
and it doesn't work the way I wanted to

00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:38,289
or does it perform for you the way it

00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:41,409
did for us you know do I have to go

00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:43,659
through a whole mess to turn it off not

00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:47,110
done up the case here no need to

00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:49,980
reconfigure Drupal which is always nice

00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:53,650
anytime you move a site even from one

00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:54,970
you know apache server to another you

00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:57,340
guys understand that can be a pain

00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:59,559
anyway so no need to reconfigure drupal

00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:02,620
to work with this stuff plugin i just

00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:05,020
kind of set him forget we can't plug

00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:06,309
right into plug-and-play basically all

00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,320
right you may save some time and money

00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:10,200
by increasing the time before you

00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,010
upgrade a server like I said this is

00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:16,179
something want to test for our customers

00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:17,830
we have a few a few main certain

00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:19,990
percentage of them that are always kind

00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:24,850
of riding that line and they call in

00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:26,530
when they kind of hit the limits and ink

00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:30,520
definitely upgrading is one of their

00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:31,990
options but you know if you'll have the

00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,419
money yet or just kind of want to

00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:36,640
optimize yourself a little bit this can

00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:39,400
definitely save you 36 maybe 12 months

00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,610
of time if we have to increase or I have

00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,610
to upgrade

00:28:53,389 --> 00:28:57,509
now there was some concern from our

00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:01,740
system admins we were in this test about

00:28:57,509 --> 00:29:04,220
memory engine X was me faster but was it

00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:08,279
going to cause any memory problems and

00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:11,100
we saw this is we had a eight gig server

00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:13,860
there with doing the test that we had we

00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:16,110
maxed it out about three gigs so not too

00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:17,460
bad it did go up probably doubled the

00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:19,889
ram that we were using with the Apache

00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,620
but it was still well within the VPS

00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:23,759
limits so it wasn't a concern of

00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:26,129
overloading the node or overload in that

00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:28,169
particular container and causing issues

00:29:26,129 --> 00:29:28,919
again with the system admin because

00:29:28,169 --> 00:29:32,659
that's kind of what we're trying to

00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:36,509
avoid altogether and as far as the

00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:37,980
number of requests a process that didn't

00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:40,259
process there was pretty consistent

00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:48,809
between both so we didn't we didn't

00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:51,080
really list that because they were yeah

00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:54,779
that starbucks was still kicking I guess

00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:56,639
that was it but you guys have any

00:29:54,779 --> 00:29:58,139
questions on that is just like says high

00:29:56,639 --> 00:30:00,539
level tests to see what's going on we're

00:29:58,139 --> 00:30:05,129
going to do more tests with different

00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:08,360
aspects of hybrid versions for our

00:30:05,129 --> 00:30:08,360
customers as well yes

00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,900
you

00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:23,570
so it's an application that's very

00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,570
intense in the configuration in Apache

00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:33,500
right no it's going to work off because

00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:34,520
it's passing down to Apache so Apaches

00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,080
still going to run and do the dynamic

00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,430
stuff and all the rewrite stage to

00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,700
access files anything just like it

00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,700
normally does

00:31:00,909 --> 00:31:06,369
ins xep is a yeah it's a plugin for a

00:31:04,479 --> 00:31:07,960
cpanel that puts engine X in the front

00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:09,879
so in genetics grabs all the stuff

00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,950
coming in first and it reserved runs a

00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:15,279
static content and then passes the other

00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:17,109
stuff down to 22 Apache so Apache

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,999
remember in the first part I talked

00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:21,239
about in genetics running and it passes

00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:24,519
things it outsources out to say fast CGI

00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:26,169
so engine X is in the front and it grabs

00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:27,759
you know all the static content is that

00:31:26,169 --> 00:31:29,379
comes in and then anything left over

00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:32,409
which is like the dynamic stuff then it

00:31:29,379 --> 00:31:34,779
passes down to Apache so Apache doesn't

00:31:32,409 --> 00:31:43,090
even really see it on the back down

00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:44,889
sorry not that we saw we just thought it

00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:46,809
was just installed a string with the

00:31:44,889 --> 00:31:48,129
like say this is real default kind of

00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:50,619
installation for Apache we didn't have

00:31:48,129 --> 00:31:53,759
to increase the configuration or change

00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:53,759
it really for Apache

00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:03,569
No

00:32:00,999 --> 00:32:03,569
yes

00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:15,120
it gave

00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:21,480
right I had like the 200 codes I guess

00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:23,489
we'd say in the non 200 codes I did we

00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:33,230
did those were consistent among both of

00:32:23,489 --> 00:32:33,230
them that was speak yes yeah exactly yes

00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:40,790
we didn't test that that's probably one

00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:42,410
of our future tests we do want to touch

00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:46,760
that this one was specifically because

00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:48,320
we run apache as far as we host and we

00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,300
don't have a lot of engine X customers

00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,880
pure instincts customers so this is like

00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:54,770
a first step for a lot of these guys and

00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,590
we definitely want to test that and see

00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:58,760
how it runs just with pure engine X and

00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:00,470
get that as an option to our customers

00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,480
as well because we have a lot of people

00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:04,820
some did you ask for it so but this is a

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,530
first step for there was that maybe

00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:08,170
aren't looking to completely reconfigure

00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:10,430
or completely do another thing yet and

00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:12,080
buy them some time at least until we can

00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:14,120
until they can come up with either

00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,960
upgrade or by this time we might have

00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,960
the other option out forum

00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,690
we didn't use that it's odd there's

00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,480
actually a reason for that my partner

00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:33,400
told me but as far as the this is our

00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,950
standard configuration so we went ahead

00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,060
because we use worker and there's

00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:40,810
actually a couple technical reasons we

00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:46,030
use worker / event lets off top my head

00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:47,740
right now I don't know but right right

00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,900
and I fiancée I don't think we run into

00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:51,540
for right now and that's probably the

00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,070
biggest reason but we have worker we

00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:57,310
work here I think is a little more Oh

00:33:54,070 --> 00:34:02,050
with um we use worker because of the

00:33:57,310 --> 00:34:03,400
which has to use to PHP but because

00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:06,700
they're a DSO option that's why we use

00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,960
worker versus the pre fork but as far as

00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:12,270
the event we haven't tested the event

00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,270
yet yes

00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:26,429
we didn't we drain it straight like you

00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:29,280
know that kid to that could very well

00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:31,230
come to a lot of it um again we try to

00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:34,409
create what normal customers are going

00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:37,770
to run with and a lot of them for some

00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:38,970
reason don't want us to oh they want the

00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:40,440
server side to be as quick as possible

00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:41,669
before they implement the caching kind

00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,929
of thing so we're trying to go with

00:34:41,669 --> 00:34:45,149
their request and say okay what can we

00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:47,280
do for them first even though it seems

00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:49,919
like might be a little bit more involved

00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:51,659
in turning on cashing but a lot of them

00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:52,919
want to like me Lisa crockpot kind of

00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:54,300
thing on a set and forget a kind of

00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:56,280
thing and if we can help them get this

00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,780
store even do it for them then that

00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,980
helps them out then the caching is

00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:01,200
definitely involved we just didn't want

00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:02,849
to run we do want to do all this

00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,190
different tests and put those results

00:35:02,849 --> 00:35:07,170
out as well that's the definitely

00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:12,650
definitely in the works just for this

00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:12,650
particular we didn't do that yes

00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:25,660
good question

00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:38,250
you could I don't actually know that

00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:39,540
doesn't like a check into definitely uh

00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:41,640
if I give your information I can

00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:43,200
definitely check the debt and I want to

00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:51,630
put it on the test yeah test results as

00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:53,430
well I definitely check into that we

00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,540
will do want to post all the different

00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:55,830
data that we didn't put up here because

00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:58,470
like said this was just more concerned

00:35:55,830 --> 00:36:00,690
that the speed level with the memory

00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:02,970
issues i mentioned and the consistency

00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:04,950
of the non-return codes or not returned

00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:06,180
successes but I do want to put all that

00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:10,820
out there so i will check into that too

00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:10,820
and put that up there as well then yes

00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:21,520
we did it running its varnish yet we

00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:23,890
wanted to again just another test we

00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:27,490
haven't run yet but we that's definitely

00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:29,140
another thing because we want to test

00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:30,280
all the different options here and

00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:33,250
varnished is definitely one of the

00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,440
options thing with the varnishes as far

00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:38,590
as their VPS s go it's definitely going

00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:42,340
to really work against the memory of the

00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:43,780
module in there so we want to wait to do

00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,400
partners as its second step maybe

00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:51,210
because it really it really increases

00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:51,210
the memory usage yes

00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:59,690
it seems to I mean it doesn't have a

00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:02,680
problem with you running everything any

00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:05,779
configuration changes we made it worked

00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:07,400
through the drupal like we added like

00:37:05,779 --> 00:37:09,849
the different URLs rewrites or something

00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,420
like that of the particular

00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:13,990
authentication then if things seem to

00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,990
hang on every well

00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,579
we did not we did not try that out

00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:36,069
that's definitely something before we

00:37:24,579 --> 00:37:37,299
should try it seguin right we will yeah

00:37:36,069 --> 00:37:39,420
that's another thing we can put in there

00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:39,420
as well
