Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	As a part of their mission to reinvent Drupal.org, Drupal Association staff partnered with Forum One Communications to collaboratively develop a comprehensive content strategy for Drupal.org.

In this session we'll describe our process and share project outcomes. We'll walk you through Drupal.org Content Model and Governance plans around Drupal.org content. We'll share updated Site Map for Drupal.org and details of our Content Audit process.

Were you always wondering how not to miss important news and announcement in Drupal community? We'll share our new Communication channels structure, which will make it easy to understand which content goes where and how to stay up-to-date with the things you care about in Drupal

come on I think we're going to go ahead

00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:08,400
and get started welcome to content

00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:12,480
strategy for drupal org I'm Courtney

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,179
Clark I work for a forum one and I was a

00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,699
partner in crime with fellow friend

00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:20,369
Tatiana as we embarked on this content

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:23,100
strategy journey I'll turn it over to

00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,320
her to get started hi everyone i'm

00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:28,260
tatiana I work for drupal association

00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,269
and so essentially Drupal the top is

00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:32,669
kind of my full-time job which is very

00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,770
exciting and today we're talking about

00:00:32,669 --> 00:00:36,780
content strategy for the pulpit or and

00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:38,670
want to start from a little bit of

00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:42,440
background to kind of explain to people

00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,440
why we even doing this

00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:06,020
so some of you might not realize but

00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:09,470
Lupul dork is actually over 13 years old

00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,270
and obviously it's visual look evolved

00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:13,700
over the years and you can see some of

00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:15,710
these steps on this journey here thanks

00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,380
to internet archive which kind of saves

00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:20,720
everything so the current design is

00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,490
based on the work done by Mark Bolton

00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,030
and Desiree killed back in two thousand

00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:28,970
eight shows a great job it also happened

00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:32,060
more than five years ago so danwon time

00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:34,880
went by and the website kept growing and

00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:38,539
at some point to kind of it became

00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:41,539
obvious that a change is needed how

00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:44,360
Drupal the door is not a typical website

00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:46,280
it is one of the largest and oldest

00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:48,830
continuously operated websites are

00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,259
Drupal websites in the world and until

00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:53,479
recently it was primarily maintained by

00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:56,720
volunteers there was no full-time staff

00:01:53,479 --> 00:02:00,080
to do it and so I just kept growing

00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:03,290
organically the amount of content we

00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:07,239
have by now is huge there is more than

00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:11,660
1.2 million pieces of content about

00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:16,010
29,000 projects over 800,000 issues on

00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:17,630
the side the amount of audiences we have

00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:20,120
is also pretty impressive and every

00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:22,730
diverse all the way from project

00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,160
managers to writers to designers

00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:28,660
developers and this list goes on and on

00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:32,390
we have marketers trainers evaluators

00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:36,200
system admins etc and all these people

00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:39,799
also range in their skill level all the

00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:42,470
way from newcomers to masters now in

00:02:39,799 --> 00:02:45,290
addition to all of that also have lots

00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:49,280
of tools the website is not just text on

00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:52,280
pages and the tools we provide are quite

00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,049
complex and very diverse as well in one

00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,590
way or another Drupal the door provides

00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:59,750
functionality similar to that of stack

00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,350
exchange for support get help and

00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:06,680
trigger for cold and issue tracking

00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:08,919
systems we can be there for and look

00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,460
alike book pages we have on the side

00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:14,510
Mozilla just in terms of being

00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:17,460
phase of a huge open source project

00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:20,940
double showcase showcase studies etc and

00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:23,910
all of that in one single website so on

00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,770
when Duke Association staff and Drupal

00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,710
the door content working hope started

00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:31,380
talking about possible redesign we kind

00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,940
of felt like just the simple visual

00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,950
refresh wouldn't do you know let's

00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,460
change a couple colors here and there

00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,740
and done that won't really work and so

00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:43,620
what we wanted to do and this was the

00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:46,020
word George came up with this we wanted

00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,440
to reinvent the website and wanted to

00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:51,870
reinvent it to support the following

00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:54,480
kind of objectives we wanted it to be

00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,940
the home of Drupal community wanted it

00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,880
to provide learnable and effusion tools

00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:02,580
to our users and we wanted to encourage

00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:06,750
people to develop themselves on their

00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:09,690
Drupal proficiency their carriers so

00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:12,360
where do you start doing something huge

00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:15,420
like that we decided to start with user

00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,940
research we decided to develop content

00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,920
strategy next and then work on creating

00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,170
a visual design system which would be

00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:25,440
based on all the data or we accumulate

00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:28,320
on the previous steps so our user

00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,090
research happened last summer and was

00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,250
performed by a double cessation staff

00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,590
and few community volunteers with the

00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:36,960
help of rittenhouse user experience

00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,450
coach who's by the way and given Kim a

00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,560
presentation tomorrow and you're all

00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:45,300
welcome to come I'm sure to awesome so

00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:47,040
as a result of that project we are

00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,780
developed user personas for Drupal the

00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,780
door and I won't be talking a lot about

00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,400
them today but they are published if you

00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,820
follow that URL on the slide you can

00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,070
read all our information about those so

00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,380
our next step after users your choice

00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,690
content strategy which is the topic of

00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:05,250
today's presentation and for this part

00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:08,040
of the project we partnered up with

00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:10,110
foreign one company and Courtney was

00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,300
leading the team from their side and

00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:14,340
since she's here today we can ask her

00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,600
the main question what is content

00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:20,690
strategy anyway

00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:26,090
good yeah it's just posted notes that's

00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:28,970
it good question so content strategy as

00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:31,850
defined by Christina Halverson in this

00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:34,520
book content strategy for the web she

00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:37,940
defines it as planning for the creation

00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:41,740
the publication and the governance of

00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:44,000
useful and usable content now that's

00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,220
just one sentence but it's actually a

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,770
really huge definition of what the heck

00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:52,730
content strategy is so for this project

00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:55,580
specifically we saw out to uncover the

00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:59,180
content problems that drupal org was

00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:01,760
facing and develop a plan of attack to

00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,850
uncover those and then start to solve

00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:09,620
for them and create some recommendations

00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:11,900
so that they could move forward so we

00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:14,570
started off with an awesome kick off in

00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:17,810
Portland at their offices complete with

00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:21,110
voodoo doughnuts Thank You Holly crowns

00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:23,930
and Google Hangouts and it made for a

00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:25,790
really great two days and we did a lot

00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,920
of brainstorming and a lot of chatting

00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:30,560
about again the current issues they're

00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:33,710
facing and what our next steps would

00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,910
look like in this project to outline

00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:40,970
outline them more thoroughly so out of

00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:43,400
that we did a couple of things that are

00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,900
listed here first we created a vision

00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,700
brief and that was just so our whole

00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,440
team could get our heads around what

00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,180
what the heck we were trying to do on

00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:53,030
the project itself make sure we all

00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,970
agreed on that and started talking about

00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:57,500
a Content audit this wasn't completed

00:06:55,970 --> 00:07:02,090
but we were getting our heads around

00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:04,030
what that step looks like well we plan

00:07:02,090 --> 00:07:06,020
to talk about content types

00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:08,630
understanding what content types exist

00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:11,270
now and then where there are holes and

00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:14,000
gaps because on the drupal association

00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:15,560
and others are creating a lot of great

00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,460
content that didn't always have a place

00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:22,870
to live and then as tatiana will talk

00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:26,070
about later there's some weird usage and

00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:28,180
overlap and how content types are used

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:30,850
governance recommendations and

00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:34,570
governance for the web is generally like

00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:37,750
who owns what and who can edit what and

00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:40,480
because as you know drupal.org has grown

00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,850
organically over a time it's a very

00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:46,320
complicated web or maybe too simple of a

00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:49,570
web as far as who can edit and then

00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,340
lastly a sitemap so figuring out what a

00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:55,870
new structure might look like to

00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:57,850
accommodate all of these new ideas that

00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:00,400
we were talking about so this was just

00:07:57,850 --> 00:08:02,860
the framework to organize our thinking

00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,710
on the project the really juicy part is

00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:08,740
what we actually learned and so tatianna

00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:11,320
will talk about that so what did we

00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,300
learn first we took a look at the

00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,750
existing content types on the side and

00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:19,330
how they've been used we took all of

00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:21,430
them and we map them against kind of

00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,590
high level user tasks which cover

00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:26,530
everything people trying to do on the

00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:29,740
website you can see this whole thing

00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:31,780
here and the first thing to notice some

00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:35,050
of the content types are used like all

00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:38,080
over the place one of them would be book

00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:41,160
pages which are heavily used across lots

00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:43,660
of different areas same for forum posts

00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:46,390
similar you can say about users groups

00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:48,430
at the same time for some areas you can

00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:50,560
see that there are either no adequate

00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,730
tools or content types metal such as

00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,250
like if you look at the project

00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:56,740
management those tools aren't really

00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:58,930
project management tools are searching

00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:03,640
discovery for example has nothing at all

00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:06,070
to enable people to discover content if

00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,910
you look deeply into some of those

00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:11,860
overused content types for example books

00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:14,590
they have been used for very different

00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,060
things for general documentation for

00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:19,240
example understanding Drupal

00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:21,640
installation guide etc for project

00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,190
specific dogs so like how to use this

00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,890
particular module how to configure it

00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:29,560
and cetera tutorials are so kind of

00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:32,530
step-by-step guides right now they're

00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:34,770
mostly in user tutorials and set recipes

00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,770
book

00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,060
community instructions by which a mostly

00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,860
mean contents in getting involved guide

00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:49,440
which are not really documentation but

00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:52,230
kind of instructions how to get involved

00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,730
how to start doing something book pages

00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,800
are also used just for general

00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:58,500
information about Drupal and Drupal at

00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,370
all they used for marketing content that

00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:04,259
little bit of market and content we have

00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:06,839
sometimes they even used for managing

00:10:04,259 --> 00:10:09,269
initiatives and people try to organize

00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,399
work and communicate status of something

00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:14,579
using book pages which is not really are

00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:16,529
convenient at all if you look at forum

00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:18,810
pages again they're used for very very

00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:20,880
different things obviously they're

00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:23,579
heavily to support asking questions and

00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,040
getting answers but they also used for

00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:28,589
official news and announcements which go

00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,850
on the front page on the side for

00:10:28,589 --> 00:10:31,920
various community posts and

00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:33,899
announcements not many people realize

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,000
about security adviser as you can see

00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:40,170
they actually forum posts which kind of

00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,680
makes little sense apart from that there

00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:44,970
are also kissed Allison forums events

00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,949
discussions general group discussions

00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:48,569
are Drupal services there's a place

00:10:46,949 --> 00:10:51,510
where people look for like vendors and

00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:54,019
help with their websites and those last

00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:57,000
four use cases there are actually many

00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:59,190
much better sections on the side for

00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,449
those things right now so there is just

00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:05,850
duplication of of content going on if

00:11:03,449 --> 00:11:09,149
you look at user groups there are also

00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:11,550
very very different types some of them

00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:13,440
are used for announcements so those are

00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:15,300
kind of worried weird announcement only

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,880
groups which you can't even join you can

00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:20,970
just see announcements there for example

00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:23,459
core or governance there are project

00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:25,949
based groups so groups which I use to

00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:27,930
organize work around some contributed

00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:31,019
projects or distribution where people

00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:33,750
may be discussed roadmap some upcoming

00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:35,939
features and things like that reten

00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:37,380
groups and initiatives so those are

00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:39,810
groups for official or maybe

00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:43,790
non-official Drupal 8 initiatives such

00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:46,860
as mobile multilingual whiskey etc

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,360
obviously one of the most popular group

00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,010
dives

00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,320
our local user groups so this is just

00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:55,250
groups of people based on location such

00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:57,680
as Portland Italy Spain etc the last

00:11:55,250 --> 00:12:02,660
type would be interest groups those are

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:05,450
groups of people around around software

00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:08,000
unknown software interests such as

00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:10,250
usability be had Bob's women and Drupal

00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:18,050
and meeting I hope Holly you're in one

00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:20,870
of those so Audrey what you see overall

00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:24,529
is that a single content type on

00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:27,410
drupal.org is often used to for many

00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:29,269
many different use cases and those use

00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:31,790
cases actually require different field

00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:33,769
structure different layout different

00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:35,990
permissions and different access

00:12:33,769 --> 00:12:38,240
restrictions for those things and the

00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:40,459
very same time we see that a single use

00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,170
case is often met by multiple different

00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:44,660
content types which makes it very very

00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:47,240
unclear especially for newcomers and

00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:49,910
loners so which content type is actually

00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:53,480
the right thing to use for specific use

00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:55,220
case in addition to all of that there

00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:57,320
are also some user needs which uncovered

00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:59,930
during use the research which currently

00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,360
aren't met completely by any of the

00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:04,310
content types we have it now for example

00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,040
the heard that people would like to have

00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:09,490
browsable archives of videos from Drupal

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,839
demons which is nice thing to have

00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:14,120
functional topic and tech so many pages

00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,730
to just be able to find related content

00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,720
to something they interested in

00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:19,370
browsable distance of genuine

00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,740
opportunities right now our training

00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:23,300
session section is just a listing of

00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,790
companies which provide training

00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:29,839
services which kind of is helpful but

00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:32,029
not very helpful another thing will be

00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,860
having an actual archive of you PO

00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:37,220
planet posts on drupal.org which you can

00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:40,310
actually search and filter and find

00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:42,589
something interesting for you so members

00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:44,720
so all of that our team got very very

00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:46,910
excited obviously and we started

00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,820
brainstorming all the wonderful content

00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:52,670
types you can create and the number was

00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:56,120
growing really really fast now you don't

00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:58,670
actually need to have like 200 or 300

00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:00,250
content types on your website to be able

00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:03,720
to meet different use case

00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:07,240
for different audiences you have and so

00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,680
next looked at how our content on the

00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:11,050
site is actually organized and

00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:14,050
structured and if there is any sort of

00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:16,600
room for improvement and spoiler alert

00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:20,730
that there definitely is and now

00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,730
Courtney will say more about that part

00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:27,610
so there are a couple big highlights

00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,370
first of all we saw that content on the

00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:33,730
site is largely organized by content

00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:38,050
type not the persona the newcomer

00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:41,080
learner master and so on or by the

00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:44,800
actual task that people want to complete

00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:47,650
so right now for issues you need to go

00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,070
here for book pages you go over here for

00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:53,200
forums they're here and so on but as you

00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:57,070
know people don't always think about it

00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,690
based on the content type instead they

00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:01,290
might think I want to know what the

00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:04,450
status is of this Drupal core initiative

00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:07,839
well the answer might be in on that

00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:10,030
issue it could be in a group on groups

00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,570
triple dot org it could be on a book

00:15:10,030 --> 00:15:15,640
page or even on a custom external site

00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:19,120
there are many content types that

00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:21,460
support that question so what this all

00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,280
means is that it's super hard for people

00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:25,660
to find what they're looking for

00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:28,630
especially people who are new right

00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:30,940
newcomers and learners it's hard for

00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:34,810
them to know the quote right place to

00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:37,300
look for this stuff the next problem is

00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:40,330
that a piece of content is generally

00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:43,210
only displayed in one single section on

00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:46,330
the site so that means that we're not

00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:48,130
contextually displaying it in other

00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:50,110
places so when you're looking for

00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:52,630
something you'll see that piece of

00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:55,360
content but you don't see anything there

00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:58,570
relates to it anything that's contextual

00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,010
that goes along with it and as you can

00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:03,280
imagine this really hurts

00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:06,310
discoverability and it creates dead ends

00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,810
it doesn't continue people's journey on

00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,820
the site so it's hard for people to

00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:11,950
naturally discover other things they

00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,030
might not think to look up but it's

00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:16,780
still very

00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:19,960
much related it also creates a unique

00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:23,440
habit for drupal.org users when you look

00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:26,860
for a page and Eureka you finally find

00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:30,460
it what do you do well you might

00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:33,370
memorize the URL you might book market

00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:37,570
you might drupalcon it and so people

00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:40,810
have these long lists of the URLs just

00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:45,400
so they can find that page again so huge

00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:47,170
pain point another thing so the primary

00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,870
ways of structuring content on

00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:53,380
drupal.org are through the book

00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:56,080
hierarchy or through custom coded

00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:59,140
horizontal menus so this has its

00:16:56,080 --> 00:17:02,140
limitations a big portion of the content

00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:05,920
on the site is grouped into just a few

00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:08,950
top-level books and oftentimes they have

00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:12,880
a very deep hierarchy or yeah hierarchy

00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:15,970
beneath them so we have two issues here

00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:18,010
right when you're structuring the

00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:20,650
content or the navigation on a page

00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:24,280
first of all you've got the horizontal

00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:26,380
menu along the top excellent so the main

00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:29,410
problem with these horizontal menus is

00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:33,130
that they're custom coded so that means

00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:35,200
that they tend to be inflexible and to

00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,810
take more time to be updated they're

00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:40,990
harder to update the second thing is

00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:43,900
that with the book hierarchy you get

00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:46,750
books to have so many pages that

00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:49,750
navigating within them is not

00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:51,370
particularly usable like as you see this

00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:54,840
page I didn't even show the whole page

00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:58,330
this is cut off there's a lot more there

00:17:54,840 --> 00:18:01,330
so in this example so many pages hard to

00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:03,940
navigate between this is also

00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:06,760
problematic because in some cases like

00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:09,370
the getting involved guide there's

00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:11,980
different types of content aimed at many

00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:16,600
different audiences and it's just all in

00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:18,760
one book so there could be stuff for new

00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:20,800
learners and then there could be stuff

00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:23,620
for people who are masters of Drupal as

00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,890
well and it's all mixed together and the

00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,330
expectation is that

00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:31,360
person has to come in and figure out

00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:34,460
what's appropriate for them so not ideal

00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,780
the last thing is that permissions the

00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:39,650
permission structure tends to be pretty

00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:42,320
flat so because there's no organization

00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:45,200
structure between the puck behind sorry

00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:48,770
beside the content type the permission

00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:51,650
system is flat so either everyone can

00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:55,190
create and edit within that content type

00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:58,790
or a group of people based on their role

00:18:55,190 --> 00:19:01,430
can do that and so it makes it difficult

00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:04,850
if you want to assign a group like

00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:06,530
maintain errs and have them be able to

00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:08,360
create and edit and then create

00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:11,140
different permissions for everyone else

00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,340
it's very limited and right now

00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:17,570
sometimes that's handled through the

00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:21,020
full HTML input filter so that you can

00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:23,480
quote lock certain book pages from

00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,520
editing from every user on the site so

00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:29,060
the big thing here is that it's a little

00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,700
bit of everyone or no one can edit this

00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:34,540
content type and there what we saw is

00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:40,940
there's some of that nuance was missing

00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:43,880
so what does this all mean so what so

00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:45,560
I'm sure a lot of you found the things

00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:48,430
you just said familiar if you at least

00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:51,620
use the website for just a little bit

00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:54,110
and so this summary of our findings can

00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:57,170
actually be boiled down to two main

00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:59,510
things the first one is that we really

00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:02,390
need to separate content from structure

00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:04,490
we need to use content types to create

00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:06,710
content and we need to use different

00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:10,580
means to bring structure to this content

00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:12,410
and the second thing is that we need to

00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:14,720
actually structure content around user

00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:17,150
tasks so instead of having five

00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:20,090
different places about the same thing on

00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:21,290
topic each using different content type

00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:23,360
in different places on the side view

00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:25,340
that should help one place about this

00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,650
topic which has five different content

00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:29,390
types inside of it depending on what is

00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:32,930
the type of content you want to create

00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:35,390
or find and so the following is our

00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:36,510
recommendation how to actually try and

00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:39,270
achieve this on

00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:43,170
the door so separate and content from

00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:46,820
structure we can do this by having a set

00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:49,860
of generic content types which were very

00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:51,810
specifically use case for each one they

00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,570
will be reused across the site and

00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:56,220
various sections so you can see here

00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:59,100
proposed new content model for the

00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:00,360
bullet or the green boxes are the new

00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:03,360
content types which currently don't

00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:04,500
don't exist at all the yellow boxes are

00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,750
the content types which you currently

00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,670
have but we might want to change them a

00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:11,130
little bit maybe change fields may be

00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:13,350
changing just name of the content type

00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,850
and the gray boxes are content types

00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:16,440
which you currently have and we don't

00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:19,740
really plan to touch them they're like

00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:23,340
fine so on the left side you can see

00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:24,900
basic content types on those are the

00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:27,120
generic ones which will be used for

00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:29,670
actual content creation and there is

00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:32,340
that it's pretty clear if you want to

00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:34,080
create static content to use page if you

00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,940
want to create something dynamic and

00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,640
have a discussion of comments you use

00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:45,660
post if you want to publish an event you

00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:47,970
use event obviously on its own now if

00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:51,360
you look to the right you will see group

00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:53,340
content types those content types won't

00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,640
be used to create new content but they

00:21:53,340 --> 00:22:00,230
will be used to actually bring structure

00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:02,580
so you see all different kinds of groups

00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:04,560
some of them already exist so for

00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:07,890
example local user groups or obviously

00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:10,230
some of them are new or they might exist

00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:11,880
now but they aren't actually groups so

00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,610
the first example of that would be

00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,710
projects as groups and this is not a new

00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:21,240
idea it has been discussed in the issue

00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:23,250
queues for five years or so but turnin

00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:25,860
projects into groups actually gives

00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:28,230
maintain errs much better tools to

00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,660
organize our work around their projects

00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,760
so they will be able to create different

00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:35,790
types of content inside of the project

00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:38,430
such as posts or documentation which is

00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:40,530
specific to this project are they might

00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:43,160
be able to announce events if you have a

00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:45,920
sprint around on this project

00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:49,910
specifically

00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:51,920
and another advantage here is that other

00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,600
people will be able to either join or

00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:55,910
fall of the group and they will actually

00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,500
receive notifications and something new

00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:02,390
is created which is kind of sounds

00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:04,430
awesome isn't it another example of

00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:06,650
resistant content type which we actually

00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:08,960
want to turn into a group is

00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:12,680
organization right now those are just

00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,230
static pages of text and if we turn an

00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:16,880
entire organization will give companies

00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,590
much better tools to manage their

00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,780
presence on the side again they

00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:22,250
potentially will be able to create the

00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:25,580
following content types inside the

00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:29,690
organization so post case study page

00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:33,050
maybe video what this also helps with is

00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:35,570
they were actually able to control who

00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:37,150
lists themselves as staff members of

00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:39,650
this company because right now

00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:41,300
essentially anyone can say they work in

00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,880
any company on drupal.org and there's

00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:46,310
nothing you can do about it so here we

00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:48,680
would have a set of permissions where

00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:50,390
the list of staff members is actually up

00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:54,350
to date and those other people who

00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:56,690
really work in the company the next next

00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,520
example of potential group content type

00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:00,950
is initiative and this is something

00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:03,590
completely new we don't have anything

00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:05,990
than this on the site right now and this

00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:08,900
is the idea behind this content type is

00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:11,570
to provide project management tools for

00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:13,970
people on the side enable them to manage

00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:15,670
big initiatives and big projects

00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:18,290
sometimes they span across multiple

00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:21,140
country projects or maybe it's a big

00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:23,330
initiative for triple core so you can

00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:25,850
see here some of the potential content

00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:30,280
types which will be available inside of

00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:33,080
the initiatives or post page event video

00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:35,690
but the interesting part is that you

00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,120
will be able to relate things like

00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:40,730
projects in issues to the initiative and

00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:43,430
the relationship to go both ways so you

00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:46,340
can say this initiative is related to

00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:47,840
multiple projects or simple project can

00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,430
be related to multiple initiatives such

00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,420
as Drupal core they have lots of

00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:55,160
initiatives going on and what this would

00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:57,140
allow you to do is actually pull out

00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,650
these projects and pull out issues and

00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,410
then

00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:02,870
whereas displays to show here is the

00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:04,640
actual work around this initiative here

00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,950
are the issues which have currently work

00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,350
here are the issues which are priority

00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:11,030
and she should be worked on next because

00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:13,970
right now the only thing you could do is

00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:16,160
like use issue text and then it's a list

00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:19,010
of issues which doesn't really help you

00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:22,580
much to communicate this type of thing

00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:25,190
around your initiative so those are some

00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:28,310
examples of new generic and group

00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:30,440
content types now our second

00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:32,690
recommendation was to structure all

00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:34,970
content on the site around user activity

00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:42,290
and again we'll switch and Courtney will

00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:44,450
talk more abundance great so looking at

00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:47,450
this we wanted to organize the content

00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:51,110
on drupal.org and de sections around

00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:53,870
high level user tasks so combining a

00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:57,680
list of the major areas of user activity

00:25:53,870 --> 00:26:00,230
that we've mentioned earlier and the

00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,390
current drupal.org site map in various

00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:05,270
other parts of the site that exists now

00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:07,730
that gives us the following potential

00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:11,660
sections so each section will have a

00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:13,970
purpose and an audience defined so each

00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:16,880
section has a primary owner or maybe

00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:19,760
multiple owners and a series of roles

00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,500
for the users whether they can create

00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,560
and edit content within that section

00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:26,360
sometimes it will be that all users can

00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:29,570
create and edit content within that

00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:33,830
section so these sections will make up

00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:36,170
the top level of drupal org the site map

00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:39,440
itself they'll obviously have

00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:42,590
subsections below them and a hierarchy

00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:45,230
within that but we're anticipating this

00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:47,870
would accommodate all the content and

00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:49,610
the activity happening so essentially

00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:51,770
every piece of content on the site will

00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:54,020
live in one of these sections the only

00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:56,570
thing that's not shown here are things

00:26:54,020 --> 00:27:00,980
like terms of service privacy policy

00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:04,070
you're like standard footer links so

00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:06,680
I'll talk through a couple of these just

00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:10,440
to give you a sense of what's inside so

00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:12,809
this first one why Drupal

00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,490
um is a good starting place for those

00:27:12,809 --> 00:27:16,970
who are trying to figure out if Drupal

00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:20,070
is right for them as the title implies

00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:22,019
so this will house those technical

00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:24,840
marketing materials and don't have a

00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:27,389
really great home right now high quality

00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,690
case studies will live there the

00:27:27,389 --> 00:27:33,500
official Drupal blog will be in there

00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:38,370
right now there's not a good place for

00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:40,500
drupal.org marketing content there's one

00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:43,200
place where there is but it's using book

00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:47,250
pages so it's not necessarily beautiful

00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:49,970
or engaging and if there's any place to

00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:52,860
be beautiful engaging it's in why Drupal

00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:54,240
so the vision of this is for it to be

00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:58,740
more well-crafted than it currently is

00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:01,259
right now another example is news and

00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:04,019
events so there's a huge need right now

00:28:01,259 --> 00:28:06,990
on drupal org to have a central place

00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:09,029
for happenings a single place where

00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:12,269
people can go to understand what the

00:28:09,029 --> 00:28:14,940
latest is so the goal of this section is

00:28:12,269 --> 00:28:18,450
to have that place and have that unified

00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:20,970
voice so right now news on different

00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:23,789
topics may be in many different places

00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:27,029
and if you don't know about that place

00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:29,429
you might miss the latest news so this

00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:31,740
section will have an aggregate of news

00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:33,990
content all over the site so if there's

00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:36,559
a blog on why Drupal or a blog about

00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:39,960
governance or a blog on community pages

00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:43,309
it'll aggregate up here so it's that

00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:46,799
place you know you can always count on

00:28:43,309 --> 00:28:49,590
one other example is community so it is

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:52,320
exactly what it sounds like it's a

00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:54,059
central place for people to find and

00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,509
talk to others within the Drupal

00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:58,919
community so the list of all the users

00:28:57,509 --> 00:29:02,279
will be there the list of organizations

00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:06,360
will be there it's important to note

00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:09,419
that within community this will include

00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:12,809
local and user groups which are

00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:15,120
currently over on groups drupal org so

00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:19,980
this is a central place for conversation

00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:23,620
and community okay one more example is

00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:25,420
contribute so this highlights the ways

00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:28,420
easily someone can contribute should be

00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:32,010
an easy starting place initiatives that

00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:35,500
Tatiana just spoke about will live here

00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:38,860
currently parts of this are living in

00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:40,960
the getting involved guide and so the

00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,540
idea here is taking that content and

00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,940
displaying in it in a much more engaging

00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:47,680
way right this is a call to action we

00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,870
want people to figure out how to

00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:54,220
contribute easily and to get excited

00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:56,410
about that and also it should be easy

00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:58,870
for people with different skill levels

00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:01,600
to know how it's appropriate for them to

00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:03,670
contribute or what's the best way so

00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,929
I'll handle hand it back to Tatiana to

00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:12,610
talk about how this may be implemented

00:30:06,929 --> 00:30:15,340
ok so behind the scenes this might sound

00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:18,010
scary to some people but those sections

00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:22,630
actually could be our gang groups and

00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:25,330
this will enable all those structure and

00:30:22,630 --> 00:30:27,670
permissions around the content it's

00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:29,980
worth noting that they will not look

00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:32,620
exactly like groups on go to the Drupal

00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:35,559
the door right now sometime be scared

00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:37,990
add in most cases for end users they

00:30:35,559 --> 00:30:39,760
won't even realize that some part of the

00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:42,040
site is actually a group unless you want

00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:43,750
them to and we want like the display we

00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:47,530
join button and make people join the

00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:50,290
group building these sections as groups

00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:52,530
actually gives us a lot of kind of

00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:55,600
exciting possibilities first of all

00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:57,580
obviously we will be able to create

00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:59,320
various different types of content

00:30:57,580 --> 00:31:01,600
inside of a group versus like right now

00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:05,080
if you use book hierarchy you can only

00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,850
use book pages inside of it building

00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:09,040
permission system will actually enable

00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:11,200
the concept of maintainer so each

00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,179
section would have a maintainer or

00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,580
maintain errs and a set of user roles

00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:17,740
for different types of users users who

00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:19,420
can create content or edit content

00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:22,420
inside of the group and this doesn't

00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:25,000
mean one will lock everything out if you

00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:26,830
want you know for documentation we

00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,780
wanted to be open any user should be

00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:31,620
able to edit it really and do it are

00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:34,420
using organic groups as easily but

00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:36,130
another advantage is that once you have

00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:38,500
main dinners we actually can have

00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:40,510
notifications when someone changed

00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:42,010
something in your section you will

00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:43,750
actually know about it and you can go

00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:48,220
and check it out and may be corrected or

00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:53,500
if needed which is kind of helpful and

00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:56,830
another first ability is that it will be

00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:59,560
actually easy to add single page of

00:31:56,830 --> 00:32:01,030
content into different sections right

00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:04,570
now it's very hard to do the book

00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:07,570
hierarchy kind of very tricky but here

00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:10,150
for example if you have official Drupal

00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:13,330
block in my google section which is

00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:16,360
about look new Drupal 8 came out and so

00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:18,220
cool you only need to create this piece

00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:20,530
of content in this one section and will

00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:22,720
automatically take it and display the

00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:26,110
news and events for example in that our

00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,720
central place of all news this type of

00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:31,840
thing kind of easy to do the groups at

00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:36,280
least much easier easier and then the

00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:38,620
current are set up so obviously all of

00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:41,620
those things we talked about today is a

00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:43,360
huge change for the site it's a lot of

00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:46,030
work and it can be just down in two

00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:49,480
weeks just flip a switch and it's ready

00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:51,100
so we can do it now have stepped in

00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,750
which can actually do it but it will

00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:55,960
take some time and we'll have to do it

00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:58,870
step by step so what are some of our

00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,490
next steps first of all everything we

00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:04,300
talked about today is already published

00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:06,640
on drupal.org this URL here is the main

00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:08,530
top level meta issue and all of these

00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,300
things we talked about today our child

00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:12,760
you should spill over it so if you want

00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:14,470
to read about this some more and maybe

00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,270
comment and give us your feedback you

00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:18,700
can go to child issues of this one and

00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:20,890
do it so for the next few weeks will be

00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,450
just kind of collecting feedback and

00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:25,540
seeing all the community members are

00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:28,000
even think about this whole idea our

00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:31,059
next step would be to create next set of

00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,640
issues are kind of more detail it an

00:33:31,059 --> 00:33:35,590
issue per section or any super new

00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:38,500
content types so we could discuss things

00:33:35,590 --> 00:33:40,810
like so what actual fields will have

00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:42,850
this will this new content i have about

00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:46,200
actual content would be inside this

00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:48,110
section and the next step would be to

00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,059
select the section

00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:52,820
actually start building it and testing

00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:56,390
to see you know if if our ideas will

00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:58,429
actually work for people most likely

00:33:56,390 --> 00:34:00,530
we'll start with contribute section

00:33:58,429 --> 00:34:02,750
because initiatives are something people

00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:05,080
really wanted to have a long time to be

00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:07,610
able to manage the work we do

00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:10,310
potentially could also do something a

00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:13,669
little bit easier such as why drupal and

00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:15,379
i only say easier because the that

00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:16,940
section won't have you know projects and

00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:19,159
fancy get tools it'll be mostly

00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:20,419
marketing content which needs to be

00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:23,389
pretty but not too complicated

00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:26,780
technically so there's the possibility

00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:29,300
where we haven't made a selection yet so

00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:33,050
let us know any feedback where they

00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:34,550
think we should start now if anyone

00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:37,730
still remembers in the beginning of this

00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:40,490
session the content strategy was step

00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:42,770
two of this larger project of rain event

00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:44,869
in Drupal the door so for that bigger

00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:49,159
project our next step in this visual

00:34:44,869 --> 00:34:51,109
design system and rfp for it will be out

00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:53,990
in the next two to three weeks probably

00:34:51,109 --> 00:34:56,540
so should make sure to watch the

00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:59,119
association blog or twitter account it

00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:01,760
will be announced once it's out if you

00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:04,000
know like really great design agencies

00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,650
agencies which you want to help us

00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:10,330
redesigned website please let them know

00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:14,780
about this thing and suggest them to

00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:17,240
apply for it now i want to take a quick

00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:20,840
moment and just give thanks to a few

00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:22,640
people who kind of help us alone and on

00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:25,280
this journey which is already about one

00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:27,140
year going first of all this our Drupal

00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,480
deter content working group members who

00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:31,730
all of them here today which is kind of

00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:35,060
Awesome there is George there is Jeff

00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:37,670
and there's Roy over here they were real

00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:39,440
real real big help especially writing

00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:41,750
those rfps and kind of doing strategic

00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,740
plan out of how we can actually do this

00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:47,510
whole big thing of course our stuff

00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:49,220
people specially mark on team none of

00:35:47,510 --> 00:35:52,010
them is here now but they were really

00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:53,960
really helping us especially analyst who

00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:55,730
spent hours taking notes during user

00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,970
research interviews which was like a lot

00:35:55,730 --> 00:36:00,990
of daipenmon

00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:02,670
kind of what fun and also I want to say

00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:04,290
thanks to all other working groups and

00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:06,869
staff members and community members who

00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:09,900
already saw parts of this in different

00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:13,849
forms and gave us early feedback that

00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:16,200
was really helpful the half next is just

00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:20,940
various links and resources for both

00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:31,950
want to know more about this lastly

00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:41,940
thank you now we will not answer some

00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:43,650
questions maybe if you're having ok so

00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:47,730
the governance plan we ever did some

00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:50,099
work on it and essentially have a huge

00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:51,630
list of problems we need to fix which is

00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:53,550
kind of not exciting but you need to

00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:57,869
make this more clear and that more clear

00:36:53,550 --> 00:37:00,510
a little bit later we came up with this

00:36:57,869 --> 00:37:02,160
idea for some sections so essentially

00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:04,560
our new governance plan is that

00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:06,330
governance will be built around section

00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,930
of the site which makes it kind of

00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:12,810
easier but we didn't really do any work

00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:14,400
around this because this needs to be

00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:15,930
discussed that particular community

00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,609
members who will be using on maintaining

00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:19,950
specific sections so we didn't want to

00:37:17,609 --> 00:37:21,780
make any decisions for them but the idea

00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:24,599
is that the governance will be able to

00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:30,260
base not run content types like right

00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:30,260
now but around sections on the side

00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:44,180
we also have a mic there all right well

00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:46,550
first of all thank you it was actually

00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:48,530
yeah I really like it it's a really nice

00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:50,120
proposal it seems to be much more kind

00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:53,480
of contained information architecture

00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:56,240
which is really nice yeah we have a lot

00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:58,820
of problems around that I'm wondering

00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:03,020
kind of the ideas around kind of how you

00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:04,970
intend to kind of test or yeah validate

00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:07,010
basically what you're creating here

00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:09,110
actually aligns with what users are

00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:11,660
thinking in terms of getting to the

00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:14,060
content that they're looking for because

00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:16,070
if I see the plans right now you have

00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:18,680
kind of know that the proposed new

00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:20,810
structure but usually when you're

00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:22,790
thinking about task success you know the

00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:26,030
actual navigation and then the structure

00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:28,220
they kind of go hand in hand so how do

00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:30,200
you expect to you kind of validate that

00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:32,120
people get to the content that they're

00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:35,060
looking for and that there's still room

00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:43,340
to change the sections in case that

00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:45,080
doesn't align well I really want to get

00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:47,480
to the point where with the actual user

00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:49,850
testing well buildings thanks so

00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:53,210
building quick prototypes and showing

00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:54,710
them to users and scene if that's

00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:56,120
actually working or not and some of the

00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:58,430
things you and I talked about yesterday

00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:01,100
we can actually write write down some of

00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:03,770
the ideal scenarios of people doing

00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:05,300
specific thing and get into specific

00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:07,550
information and then essentially like

00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:11,150
measuring before and after it is it

00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:13,730
faster or is it not really helping much

00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:16,430
I think we also can do some you know

00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:19,880
just quantitative stuff look at numbers

00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:22,070
of having google analytics and see for

00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,290
example how do people go inside of the

00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:26,350
site right now a lot of them just land

00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:29,240
on the one page and they don't even go

00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:31,180
on like other pages deeper they don't

00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,380
explore so if that will get better

00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,990
obviously we're doing something great r

00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:38,900
if bounce rates will be smaller but in a

00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:40,880
good thing I also feel like our user

00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,450
research probably won't be last one it's

00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,820
not like once done and

00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:48,210
forget about it will repeat it after

00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:50,760
some time and I hope we'll hear that

00:39:48,210 --> 00:39:52,380
people can actually find things and the

00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,200
things we hear will be different from

00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:58,470
what we heard before so that's kind of

00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,510
how the answers doing yeah the only

00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:03,599
thing that I would add is that before we

00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:06,810
begin we were very thorough at reviewing

00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:08,609
the personas that are built on a lot of

00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:11,730
really great interviews that were done

00:40:08,609 --> 00:40:13,829
and so a lot of questions came out of

00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:16,920
that characteristics of the different

00:40:13,829 --> 00:40:19,710
user types and so along the way it was

00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:21,540
helpful to have that in hand and check

00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:23,910
in with the personas to make sure it

00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:26,180
still felt right so when I was talking

00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:28,290
through the new proposed sections

00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:30,720
Tatiana actually has a whole nother

00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:32,910
slide deck that talks about each of

00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,880
those sections and who exactly it

00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:39,150
addresses so we're trying to be diligent

00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:41,550
about remembering not only the existing

00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:45,900
audiences but the new audiences that

00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:47,640
we're trying to draw and get engaged so

00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:56,280
I think it helps to continue to do that

00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:57,540
as well sure good question yeah along

00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,550
those lines I think one of the things

00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:01,560
that we haven't had a chance on the

00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:03,540
content working group to really dig in

00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:06,260
too much yet but is sort of on the

00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:09,420
agenda I believe we still have an

00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:12,839
optimal workshop account that we can use

00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:14,460
for like large-scale user testing of

00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:17,400
things like you know here's and here's a

00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:21,060
tree of items where would you look to

00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:23,430
find X and just do very simple like you

00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:27,240
know quantitative tests of a sample

00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:29,010
group of 200 do users when given for

00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,329
different pieces of information that

00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:32,670
people come and we'll look for I'm

00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:34,680
drupal.org how many of them were able to

00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:35,700
find it without taking wrong paths down

00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,109
that you know there's a couple of those

00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:40,500
tools that we do have at our disposal

00:41:37,109 --> 00:41:42,270
but I think as a couple of the you know

00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,490
next steps in actually fleshing out the

00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:46,740
hierarch you get to thee we know where

00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:48,390
things would be now let's test them in

00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:49,940
bulk you know I think I think that's a

00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:51,930
couple of the things that are sort of a

00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,099
little bit down the line but we

00:41:51,930 --> 00:41:55,819
definitely want to make sure some of

00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:55,819
that stuff happens to

00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:03,540
so I'm increasingly convinced that Jeff

00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,940
and I are actually the same person

00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:12,360
because I was just about to mention tree

00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:15,030
testing so aside from that one of the

00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:16,800
things that I ended up taking on at the

00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:19,440
extended Sprint's was that getting

00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:24,540
involved guide and the community section

00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:27,330
which is sad a little bit and makes me

00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:29,010
cry and so one of the things I think I'm

00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:33,150
hearing is that we want to essentially

00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:35,850
split the getting involved guide by sort

00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:37,590
of task and essentially take some of

00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:39,150
that content and move it into community

00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:42,480
and some of it and to contribute does

00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:47,100
that am I correct in that am i okay

00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:49,050
right I just want to make sure okay yes

00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:51,090
we want the mood and want to definitely

00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:54,900
display it in a better way so it's not

00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:57,120
just giant list of book pages which I am

00:42:54,900 --> 00:43:00,030
not convinced anyone actually read that

00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:01,830
stuff or if there was any person who

00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:03,840
actually read like all of its that like

00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:07,830
page by page I don't think those people

00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:10,350
exist yeah well I mean I actually did

00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:14,520
that but not because I wanted to just to

00:43:10,350 --> 00:43:18,540
see what's there there's also a huge

00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:22,260
opportunity in prioritizing the content

00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:24,630
butter so right now it's just so much so

00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:27,060
like you said you read through it but

00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:29,370
because you had to and so if we're

00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:31,650
trying to attract newcomers we have to

00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:33,450
remember that we need to pull up and

00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:35,940
highlight the key things they need to

00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:37,470
know first off and hope that they're

00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:40,490
dedicated enough to even get through

00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:40,490
those top three ones

00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:54,650
oh I just want to say real quick how

00:43:52,549 --> 00:43:56,869
much work Tatiana has put into this

00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:59,900
project she didn't put herself on the

00:43:56,869 --> 00:44:02,029
slides but she's been a huge huge

00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:04,760
linchpin to the entire project over its

00:44:02,029 --> 00:44:18,319
entire lifespan so everybody who loves

00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:20,420
drupal.org okay if normal questions

00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:22,599
thank you so much I hope it was

00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:22,599
