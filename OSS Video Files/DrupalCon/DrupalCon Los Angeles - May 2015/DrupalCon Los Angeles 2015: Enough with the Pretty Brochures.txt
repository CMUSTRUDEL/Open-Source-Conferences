Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Enough with the Pretty Brochures
Publication date: 2015-05-12

	GUSMURRAY
Today, few Brands have a technology problem, rather they have an underlying business problem. However, as an industry we’ve been guilty of too often drawing on our own ‘digital prowess’ and (at best) guessing users’ digital behaviour, in other words - ignoring the data.

Today, that’s not good enough and the excuses are few and far between. Especially when the cost of processing is down, tools are accessible to nearly everyone, and we all have the ability to measure everything. So what’s holding us back?

Enough with the guess work, let’s try harder and use what’s already there and what we already have in front of us - data. Let’s nix the tech terms and start focusing on driving business value.

In this presentation, Propeople’s Chief Strategy & Insights Officer Gus Murray will cover how digital insights and personalisation are changing the way organizations can use their corporate website.

Topics covered in this session:

How personalisation is changing the way B2B/B2C communicate with their customers,

Content as your customer's first purchase,

Using social to better inform your audience understanding, and

The marketing technology stack.


Join this session if you are working with digital marketing, business development or you want to add value to the conversation, not just noise.

Gus has extensive public speaking experience, and has been recognized for his presentations at industry events. This includes being names Social Media Week Copenhagen's speaker of the year in 2013.

	00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:07,350
so today's presentation to be a little

00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:08,760
bit about basically the art of

00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,840
data-driven marketing so I'm going to

00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,150
talk to you guys about and this is a

00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,340
little different i know from the typical

00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:16,289
sessions here at rubicon it's my first

00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,699
time so i apologize for being a rookie

00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:19,890
at this but i'll do my best and

00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:20,939
basically try and help you guys

00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:24,630
understand a little bit about our

00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,910
approach in data-driven marketing Who am

00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:29,400
I I'm originally my name is Gus mari i'm

00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:30,869
originally from australia i'm quite a

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,960
long way from home as you can see i

00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:36,120
actually live in copenhagen denmark

00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,809
that's where I work and basically work

00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,640
with effort w but also going to tell you

00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:43,590
i basically focus on digital strategy

00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,899
and in my spare time I like to do

00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:47,129
ultramar thongs and for those who don't

00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,789
know what an ultramarathon is it's

00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:53,160
basically races around 250 kilometres in

00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:57,629
far out regions of the planet in

00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:59,789
Mongolian desert sand jordanian outback

00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:02,100
essentially and originally I'm actually

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,480
from a small country town from mortgage

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,400
it's called basically in the middle of

00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,159
the outback so I grew up on a farm so

00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,010
I'm a very very long way from basically

00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,880
my farming roots and also from a

00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,880
actually birthplace

00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,369
so without further do any of you guys I

00:01:16,829 --> 00:01:23,280
am I work with effort w for anyone that

00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:26,009
missed the basically the dry ski note or

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,799
missed the huge blue stand in the middle

00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:30,270
of the actual session where f @w which

00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,039
is the culmination of pro people and

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:35,850
think reaction and a few other agencies

00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:36,990
the same time essentially I won't bore

00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,850
you guys with all the stuff we did but

00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,399
essentially what we do is and focus on

00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,130
strategy websites mobile social media

00:01:41,399 --> 00:01:45,780
and optimization and what we work with

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,280
them especially what I work with is the

00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,429
digital transformation of some of the

00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,959
clients we actually work with all right

00:01:50,429 --> 00:01:53,399
so to the interesting part what I want

00:01:51,959 --> 00:01:55,500
to talk to you guys today about is is

00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,420
the shift from basically creating

00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,880
business cards to actually creating

00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,369
business tools and this is some of the I

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,679
think this is a very passionate area for

00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,509
me about how we actually change the way

00:02:04,679 --> 00:02:09,390
that websites work and what they do for

00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,489
our users and the end users basically i

00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,950
think our industry has been guilty of

00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:15,000
making very pretty brochures online but

00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,470
a lot of them aren't delivering business

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,910
results and that's one of the things

00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,480
that I'm really passionate about and I

00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:22,560
hope to share with you guys today

00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,030
firstly though I want to talk a little

00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,190
bit story about something I read in

00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:31,380
Wired magazine so two companies one is

00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,389
planet labs and one is NASA you're

00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,430
probably familiar with NASA I'm guessing

00:02:33,389 --> 00:02:38,700
planet labs for those either I'm

00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,410
familiar is basically a bay area based

00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,180
startup they started around two thousand

00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,829
twelve and they create basically

00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,170
microsatellites which they call doves

00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:47,370
and these satellites are really

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,540
interesting and their approach is

00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:53,400
especially interesting for example NASA

00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:55,349
as you guys all know they launch massive

00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,120
satellites into basically out of space

00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:59,910
and they do this on a you know a

00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,319
scheduler probably once every 10 to 15

00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:04,620
years especially in the global image

00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:07,049
ring market and these are huge

00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,910
satellites their massive in both their

00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:10,230
scale the scope of the project and the

00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:13,410
number of people and resources they

00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,239
commit to actually building these on the

00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,500
other hand planet labs I don't know if

00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:18,480
you can see in the background photo

00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,340
there they create these microsatellites

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,690
which are basically the size of shoe box

00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:26,410
and they started in 2012 and since 2012

00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,840
actually actually launched seven

00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:31,540
t different satellites into the actual

00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,120
space so their approach is extremely

00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,590
different and the way this came about is

00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,450
they asked a simple question what if you

00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,610
were to put up a simple in experts in

00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,500
expensive low flying craft instead of a

00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,640
big expensive one because what they

00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,900
worked out is that a satellite

00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,420
essentially is made up of the same

00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,650
components of a smartphone so the same

00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:49,690
basically things that you have in your

00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,540
iPhone or your Android which is an

00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:54,610
accelerometer the CPU some storage a

00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,710
camera and basically some sort of

00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:59,560
interface they can update so they

00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:01,030
instead of going the usual route which I

00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,470
think we can all relate to in terms of

00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,660
building websites and as something is

00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,860
the requirement driven waterfall

00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,810
approach where you start with the

00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,430
objective and you water fall all the way

00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,050
down and eventually come out with a

00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,270
pretty website you know three or four

00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,740
years or in what we talked about in now

00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,750
drew bleats case it's taken four years

00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,540
of development to build this you know

00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,100
dribble eat mostly release so and this

00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:24,120
is some of the challenge that I see

00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:26,320
faced with our industry and this is why

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,700
can't probably see it in the background

00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,520
out but it's picture of the Mars rover

00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,980
the satellite and the way that the NASA

00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,300
approaches things is very likely to work

00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:37,810
but that's how you get a 2 megapixel

00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:40,000
camera into the Mars rover and that's a

00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:42,370
you know a multi-billion dollar project

00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,130
which has technology which is basically

00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:47,530
outdated by several years now and that

00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:49,480
some of the challenge we face versus the

00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,550
guys at planet labs which have a much

00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,960
more iterative approach to actually how

00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,720
they design and build there's

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,790
essentially satellites and they released

00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:59,290
recently their whole aim is to have a

00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,930
hundred and seven hundred and fifty

00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,730
satellites launched into space of which

00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,280
they'll basically have it essentially a

00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,590
daily scanning or imagery of the entire

00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,450
planet which is completely different

00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:12,550
from the Nasr approach which takes

00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:14,650
around two weeks for you to actually

00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:16,900
book the satellite readjust the

00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:18,790
coordinates basically have the inventory

00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:20,320
taken and then you wait another two

00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,600
weeks to have anything else done whereas

00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,350
this is on a daily essentially 16 hour

00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,510
timeframe so enough about and this is

00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,640
where I think the core of what I really

00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:32,680
think is the shift in way we're sort of

00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,510
building and approaching our business

00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,500
problems or our clients problems in

00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:39,110
terms of building new and

00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:41,210
more agile development and these guys in

00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,950
planet labs they called agile aerospace

00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:45,050
which is basically the design-build test

00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:48,080
repeat sort of methodology following on

00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,840
from the lean so I'm going to talk a

00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,610
little bit about data-driven marketing

00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:56,420
if you have questions at all please feel

00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:58,070
free to ask not afraid of kidding me so

00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,810
what is data-driven marketing so this is

00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:02,180
a term that I think we've heard a lot of

00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:04,790
lately it's one of the you know big buzz

00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,560
words as follow along from big data and

00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,120
everything else but this is essentially

00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,130
I think one of the things that we can

00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,110
really harness into how we actually

00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:15,440
develop products and solutions for our

00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:17,390
customers going forward we've seen a lot

00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,980
of sort of things change and last a

00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,600
couple of years I mean I'm not going to

00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,980
bore you guys most of you know this the

00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,520
cost of processing storage has

00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:27,290
dramatically reduced tool costs way more

00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,450
inexpensive now than they ever have been

00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:31,790
before we have the ability to actually

00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:33,560
measure stuff that previously in our

00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:35,630
industry we haven't been very good at or

00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:37,100
we haven't measured at all so we have

00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,220
these different themes that now create

00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,630
this opportunity for us to actually make

00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,250
basically products and services that our

00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,570
clients can actually use in a way

00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,210
different way than they traditionally

00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:49,160
have and this is my whole thing I think

00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,840
about moving from the business card

00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,760
approach to the business tool approach

00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,560
like how do we create actually business

00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:57,800
tools online rather than just pretty

00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,390
brochures I think this sums it up pretty

00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,800
nicely we must move from a numbers

00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,870
keeping score two numbers driving

00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,030
actions we've all been very good at

00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,590
looking at essentially a nice scoreboard

00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,990
where we get a monthly report of what

00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:10,370
the traffic is to our website some of

00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,020
the basic click-through rates and things

00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,880
like that but essentially it's just

00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,100
vanity metrics it doesn't do anything

00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,930
for us apart from make certain people in

00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,520
the marketing department actually look

00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,380
good because our you know vanity metrics

00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,600
are all going up that's essentially all

00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:24,740
it can do what we want to do is actually

00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,600
dig deeper than that and actually

00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:30,650
understand how can we use this data to

00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:32,390
create actionable insight and part of

00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:34,580
this we've seen plenty of times before I

00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,110
mean for those of you that know facebook

00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:38,210
i'm pretty sure everyone's familiar with

00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,120
facebook ads for example you have the

00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:43,030
ability to go into

00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,470
they go from a demographic to social

00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:47,290
graphic to psychographic information

00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:49,570
where we can dig down to know different

00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:51,460
interests what people education levels

00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,570
their relationship status all these

00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:53,610
different things that we haven't

00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:55,870
actually been able to do before

00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:58,360
typically the approach on a website is

00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:59,530
that one-size-fits-all approach doesn't

00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,750
matter who you are where you came from

00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:03,760
what you do will give you the same front

00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,320
page or a basically variation of a

00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,669
couple of landing pages and that's

00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,389
essentially all you'll get faced with

00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:11,320
and essentially you know if you look at

00:08:09,389 --> 00:08:14,250
there's hundreds of examples out there

00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:16,660
basically you know where you have

00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,729
individuals which aren't dramatically

00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:21,639
different from there actually

00:08:18,729 --> 00:08:23,350
demographic sort of stereotype and as I

00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:25,210
think one of the key things how do we

00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,340
actually improve delivery and improve

00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,930
conversion that's one of the key things

00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,720
I think we have those thing this

00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:34,469
industry so one of the ways we look at

00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,700
conversion is with this formula

00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:38,680
essentially conversion of we see it

00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,510
makes up all is made up by one

00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,880
motivation to actually purchase or

00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:44,589
download or you know generate a lead or

00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,940
something like that we have the value

00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:48,670
proposition so what is the value

00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,830
proposition i get is it you know the

00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:53,589
quality of the content is the speed the

00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:55,839
efficiency the product offering and then

00:08:53,589 --> 00:08:58,209
we add basically the incentive less the

00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,920
friction so the incentive might be you

00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:02,080
know reduced cost it could be a sale

00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,910
anything like that and the friction is

00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,620
basically the jumps or the the hoops you

00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,420
make me jump through essentially you

00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,010
know do I have to fill in a form do I

00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,520
have to use a negated piece of content

00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:14,709
do I have to use no paypal versus my

00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:17,320
preferred MasterCard things like those

00:09:14,709 --> 00:09:19,870
things and then minus essentially

00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:22,240
anxiety anxiety can be in the form of

00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,430
okay are you going to steal my data are

00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,200
you going to you know is my credit card

00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:28,240
information safe and secure with you

00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,860
guys so those different elements is

00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,640
basically what we see is making up the

00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:35,080
conversion so how do we handle that I

00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,459
think what you prefer or what your

00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,230
designer prefers doesn't matter if it's

00:09:36,459 --> 00:09:40,060
not getting your conversions this is the

00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,860
key thing at what it comes down to we

00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,720
see a lot of this in the agency client

00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,459
relationship where you know our lead

00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,110
design on the projects like I like

00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:48,190
really like the color red or the pixel

00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:50,050
over here and the client on the other

00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,270
sides like well I wanted in blue over

00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:52,560
here and basically it comes down to this

00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,090
but

00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,610
louder or who's paying the biggest bill

00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:59,640
essentially so and that's not really a

00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,020
great point of you know departure what

00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,580
we want to do is say okay what does the

00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,260
user care about what does the user

00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,060
actually want what matters to the user

00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,040
and we've seen a lot of examples I mean

00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,600
google has been you know famous for

00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,410
doing this on their front page and how

00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,240
they are limited a lot of stuff and what

00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:16,920
we can see now is our clients are taking

00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,570
on different form they're essentially

00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:20,610
becoming this sort of dr. Jekyll mr.

00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:22,770
Hyde sort of element where we have you

00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:26,610
know one part artist which is about the

00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:28,860
content the assets the social media sort

00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,839
of aspect and then the other part their

00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,910
part scientist which is you know about

00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,279
the performance tactics the operations

00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,630
the analytics now that's what they're

00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,210
looking at all the time and we have to

00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,500
play to these sort of elements so it's

00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:46,649
making sure that we sort of kicked both

00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:48,839
sides of the client happy I think we

00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:50,369
who does everyone know scandinavian

00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,170
airlines what does that mean I'm not no

00:10:50,369 --> 00:10:53,999
skimming over those so scandinavian

00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:55,680
airlines is a regional airline based out

00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:58,319
of basically scandinavia so this is our

00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,999
major carrier these are the guys I love

00:10:58,319 --> 00:11:02,279
to hate I love using these guys in

00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:04,949
essentially examples because essentially

00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:07,139
their view of me is I think pretty

00:11:04,949 --> 00:11:09,569
typical of the way a lot of companies

00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:13,379
deal with their clients so this is I'm

00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:15,629
one of their I'm a fairly frequent flyer

00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:17,759
for SAS or it's going over their lives

00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:19,319
so they know me relatively well I have

00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,679
certain destinations I fly to on a

00:11:19,319 --> 00:11:24,540
regular basis there's certain seating

00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:26,639
arraignment arrangements I have certain

00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:29,850
types of flights I take and certain

00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,800
times a day everything else but to them

00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,319
when they send out information based on

00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,399
my you know behavior and everything else

00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:38,309
they've collected it looks something

00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:40,230
like this so I've got a basically first

00:11:38,309 --> 00:11:42,749
of all and offered to a castle I've got

00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,790
a nice coffee machines and cutlery then

00:11:42,749 --> 00:11:47,009
I go down to you know of watches and

00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,480
pots and pans and wines and candles and

00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:50,160
women's jewelry because that's what I'm

00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,199
probably interested in now it keeps

00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,689
going to dressing gowns what else do we

00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:56,399
have like bed linen everything else so

00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:58,470
their approach is basically if we throw

00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,850
everything at this single person then

00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:01,559
maybe they'll click on something and

00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,420
then in the hope that you know they'll

00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:05,370
actually buy one of those things which

00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,620
is not a great result or approach

00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,939
because now as you can imagine when I

00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,170
get an email from scandinavian airlines

00:12:08,939 --> 00:12:13,110
what do you think I'm going to do with

00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:14,999
it delete it like I'm not going to spend

00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:16,350
you know 20 minutes reading through all

00:12:14,999 --> 00:12:20,459
their offers to me because I don't have

00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:21,689
the time of day then I've also been to

00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:23,189
Tokyo once before but then they're

00:12:21,689 --> 00:12:25,350
actually offering another trip to Tokyo

00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:26,910
again so no understanding my travel

00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:29,279
behavior and things like that is not

00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:31,319
really that world unbeliever and then

00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,399
they change language from Danish back to

00:12:31,319 --> 00:12:33,749
english because they've worked out i'm

00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,220
not actually Danish and I actually speak

00:12:33,749 --> 00:12:37,379
English and now they're telling me about

00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,089
how I can go to the New York so their

00:12:37,379 --> 00:12:42,269
communication style and the way they

00:12:39,089 --> 00:12:45,209
have personalized is no extremely broken

00:12:42,269 --> 00:12:47,009
they have so many so many data or so

00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:49,649
much data around my behavior in my

00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:51,089
activity with actually scandinavian

00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:53,220
airlines but they haven't used any of it

00:12:51,089 --> 00:12:54,870
basically they've both the only thing

00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,660
that personalized is my name at the top

00:12:54,870 --> 00:13:02,170
and

00:12:55,660 --> 00:13:03,610
membership number on the other hand I'm

00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:06,430
guessing you guys all know about Amazon

00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,350
so Amazon are really really good at this

00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,400
they've been doing this for a long time

00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,920
and they're one of the best in the

00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,810
industry i wouldn't pay too much

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,790
attention to this i'm really fun at

00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:18,600
parties parties contrary to popular

00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:20,950
belief about my choice in books but

00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:23,170
they're really good at understanding my

00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:25,240
behavior my purchases what i would like

00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,740
to buy other things that you know other

00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,780
people that are bought similar books to

00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,190
me have so they really have a different

00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,290
approach to this is very very

00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,520
personalized and the results speak for

00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:38,440
themselves there it's been extremely

00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:40,180
successful so for me it's looking at the

00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,590
journey not the destination like we have

00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,840
to stop thinking about okay how do we

00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:45,850
sell sell sell more about how do we

00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,950
actually push people or actually get

00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,900
people to go along the journey instead

00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:51,850
of this whole lock in mentality how do

00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,560
we get people to lock on because of the

00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:57,040
value we provide and the personalization

00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,750
we provide and this I think is done

00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,820
through now we have to change our

00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,620
perspective of you know the dot-com

00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:05,080
isn't the only place that people are

00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:06,580
actually using these days like we have a

00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:09,070
huge amount of different touch points

00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:11,740
that we as consumers interact with on a

00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:13,750
daily basis so as a brand and a client

00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:16,270
we have to understand this sort of

00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:18,310
network effect and take advantage of it

00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:19,720
and use this to actually inform us on

00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:23,830
how to actually better engage with our

00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:26,500
clients or customers I think this is an

00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:29,980
example by rand fishkin from SEO mo so

00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:32,170
he's made the very you know to dumb down

00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:34,540
version of how we put see the web you

00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:36,850
know me make content humans click then

00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,380
we buy or then we get money basically

00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:41,640
this is the way we've traditionally seen

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:43,870
sort of essentially content and websites

00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,150
where an actual fact it looks something

00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:48,130
like this like you know me make content

00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:50,020
humans click you know if em like they

00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:51,910
remember maybe them see more content i

00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,680
make visit again me build trust

00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:56,470
relationship with humans when they need

00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:59,440
me product them come back like this is

00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:01,360
more about how it actually works so try

00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,520
saying this very fastest is good tongue

00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,930
twister but this is more how the actual

00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,520
web works june i mean we don't go to

00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:08,290
websites and then just see it once and

00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,560
then buy the product or service that the

00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:11,140
cell

00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,940
it's often a longer journey that we see

00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:14,470
as more interactions it's building that

00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:17,620
relationship that we need to talk about

00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:19,240
all the time and this is the whole

00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,880
element that you know as I said before

00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,470
we often have one spot where people come

00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,120
into our website and they see the front

00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,650
page and doesn't matter what stage of

00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,800
the customer decision journey they're in

00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:31,330
they see the same information whereas

00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,620
what we're trying to do now is look at

00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:35,020
how do we actually break up this

00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,940
customer decision journey and deliver

00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:39,910
small pieces of information that match

00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:41,560
where these guys are in that stage so if

00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:43,150
they're in the considerations phase it's

00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,770
going to be very very different from

00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,810
someone that's in the actual in a

00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:48,400
purchase phase they don't need to get to

00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,260
know your brand anymore they know who

00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,940
you are you know they have established

00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,200
that relationship now they're interested

00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,790
in actually going through a head and

00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:59,800
purchasing the actual product or service

00:15:54,790 --> 00:16:01,750
I think this says it you know you need

00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,610
to understand who these people are in

00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:06,070
the business world and where they are in

00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:07,480
a buying process if they're very early

00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,390
you don't want to serve the messages of

00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,640
content low in the funnel so this is a

00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:14,589
key part of basically understanding okay

00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,600
where are people in the actual customer

00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:18,490
decision journey how can we target them

00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,350
and what type of informational needs do

00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:24,730
they have at those different sections in

00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:26,230
their journey so this comes down to

00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:29,310
actually what is the strategy what is

00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:32,620
the action plant you're going to go with

00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:34,620
here's a good example from you guys

00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:37,180
should be familiar with this one NFL so

00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,220
comparing this to the scandinavian

00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:40,990
airlines example these guys have done a

00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:43,300
much better job at understanding just a

00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:45,370
small fraction of what I like I mean

00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,570
they understand my team they understand

00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,180
my name and they know it's my birthday

00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:52,630
so straightaway they've actually you

00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,980
know made a win or a small win based on

00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:55,870
very very small piece of information

00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:59,020
that they can essentially get in the

00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:01,990
public domain so this is a much easier

00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:03,820
like sort of an personalized approach so

00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:06,040
my communication relationship with the

00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:08,819
NFL is going to be way different than it

00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:12,699
will be with Scandinavian Airlines

00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:14,980
another great example this is from one

00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:17,110
of your nordstrom one of the big

00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:19,319
retailers here has anyone seen this

00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:21,360
example

00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,579
basically what nods from do is they

00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:27,449
basically put this small plastic tag on

00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:30,000
their most pinned product in the women's

00:17:27,449 --> 00:17:31,740
basically shoe section so it's a really

00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,750
clever way of understanding okay the

00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:36,600
offline world and the online world are

00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:38,850
heavily integrated so this is a great

00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,549
way for you know women in the market for

00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:43,019
purchasing you know red stilettos to

00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:45,120
understand that there's some sort of

00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:47,009
social proof attached to the purchase of

00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,480
those shoes so if they purchase those

00:17:47,009 --> 00:17:50,580
shoes there's a certain degree of safety

00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,289
but they know that when they go home and

00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,639
show off to their girlfriends they'll be

00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:57,360
like oh go that's the great pair of

00:17:53,639 --> 00:18:00,090
shoes i also like those ones so we have

00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,830
to connect these two worlds because we

00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:03,480
know that a lot of actually transactions

00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,340
actually happening in the offline world

00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,039
so how do we actually bridge this gap

00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:10,169
between you know the offline and what's

00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:12,179
happening online and actually help

00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:14,490
consumers understand that and connect

00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:19,230
you know our social activity and our

00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:23,100
base live com activity another great one

00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:24,539
is well this is an example of say where

00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:27,120
you can actually integrate some of the

00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:29,610
different elements of essentially no

00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,649
great features like Facebook into

00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:33,269
websites Facebook of just launching

00:18:31,649 --> 00:18:35,460
their messenger app mostly the

00:18:33,269 --> 00:18:36,779
businesses so this allows businesses to

00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,090
actually integrate the facebook

00:18:36,779 --> 00:18:40,230
Messenger directly into the website so

00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,750
you can actually have a dialogue with

00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:44,100
customers straight away in their actual

00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:46,470
facebook app so you're not actually

00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,629
forcing them to go outside come back to

00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:51,149
your website find the help section find

00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:53,610
the contact us section it's basically

00:18:51,149 --> 00:18:58,200
within their native social environment

00:18:53,610 --> 00:19:00,659
of facebook win the messenger another

00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,120
great example is KLM these guys are

00:19:00,659 --> 00:19:05,970
great at basically you know the way they

00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,590
approach social and digital for those

00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:08,730
that haven't traveled with KLM or seen

00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,049
their social channels the really

00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:12,330
interesting thing is the cover photo

00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:13,980
right at the top I don't know if you can

00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:15,929
read it but it basically is the number

00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,059
of minutes that they'll take to

00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:21,690
essentially respond in terms of customer

00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:23,429
service and that update they update that

00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,710
cover photo on Facebook and Twitter

00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:27,090
every five minutes based on the actual

00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,970
availability of their customer service

00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:30,669
agents so they're actually integrating

00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:33,159
and

00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:35,769
in the social world to their actually

00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:38,230
customer service platform online and

00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:39,820
actually integrating that in such a way

00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:41,830
because they know their uses so well

00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:43,509
that okay if you have a flight issue or

00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:45,970
anything like that on you know when

00:19:43,509 --> 00:19:47,409
you're stuck in Amsterdam or whatever

00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,940
you go to the Facebook page or the

00:19:47,409 --> 00:19:51,190
Twitter page to say you know where is my

00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,389
bag or where's my flight and straight

00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,269
away you know that ok they're going to

00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:56,619
respond to me within five minutes so

00:19:55,269 --> 00:20:00,820
it's a really simple way of integrating

00:19:56,619 --> 00:20:02,739
and actually connecting those two the

00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:06,190
other like and I think these guys are

00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:07,330
really good in terms of no one's been

00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:09,039
too much number there the way they

00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:11,169
approach their social and integrate this

00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,179
is extremely interesting even from a

00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:15,580
commerce perspective I think last year

00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:18,970
they generated about 52 million euros

00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:20,519
through their social channels and I

00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:23,470
think this is the opportunity that as

00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:26,259
essentially marketeers and helping

00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:28,389
clients understand is understanding what

00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:30,429
we can actually do on social and driving

00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:32,980
that back to actually the main platform

00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:35,590
how can we use this information on our

00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,879
main platform here they asked the simple

00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,259
question you know do you like the

00:20:36,879 --> 00:20:40,840
physical boarding past or do you like

00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:42,970
the digital boarding pass by

00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,739
understanding the users and which uses

00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:46,509
of respondent in which way can help them

00:20:44,739 --> 00:20:50,259
serve their customers better when they

00:20:46,509 --> 00:20:51,820
go to the website look at what you can

00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:53,350
actually get for example you have the

00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,470
email interaction you have website

00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:57,789
activity you have purchase history and

00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,710
then you have the people information as

00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:01,929
well mostly all this information is

00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:03,570
available in the public domain where you

00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:05,559
can actually customize and tailor

00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:06,999
essentially the experience that these

00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:09,639
customers are having on the website

00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:11,080
based on this information alone so

00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:12,879
through their email campaign where do

00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,960
they go what do they click on how do we

00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:17,700
actually tailor that and use that

00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:17,700
information to better serve these guys

00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:25,580
and we've all seen this I mean it still

00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:27,580
amazes me in 2015 that you know a lot of

00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,930
companies aren't using social is logging

00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:32,300
essentially being Scandinavian Airlines

00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:33,650
who I really love talking about they

00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:36,230
still don't do this they don't use

00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:37,970
essentially social plugins to actually

00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,040
help complete forms or anything like

00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:41,630
that and that's just one aspect of it

00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,520
the information you can gather by

00:21:41,630 --> 00:21:45,650
actually doing this is extremely

00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,330
interesting you probably can't see it on

00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:49,250
the forum here but essentially what

00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:51,320
they're asking for on both linkedin and

00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:53,510
facebook is you know access to your

00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,550
connections access to your you know

00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:58,250
especially in linkedin your professional

00:21:55,550 --> 00:22:00,110
connections they can also tell that okay

00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:01,850
if someone blogs in with linkedin on

00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:04,310
their website they're most likely a

00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:05,900
business traveler if you log in with

00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:08,120
facebook you're most likely a leisure

00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:10,400
traveler so those two experiences are

00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,200
very different based on what you login

00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,630
with essentially what platform you login

00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,980
with then they can customize the

00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,750
basically products and services they

00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:19,700
offer you based on that login

00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:21,890
credentials and then when you connect

00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,750
the other accounts they can create that

00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:26,000
sort of single customer view of the

00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:29,650
actual customer which creates a much

00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,240
more rich and dynamic experience and

00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:33,080
this basically helps you know and this

00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,150
is one of the things we talked about

00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:36,590
with strategy framework so now what

00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:39,350
assets do you have what are the goals

00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:41,810
what is the hypothesis how do we test it

00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:43,490
and then how do we learn and repeat how

00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:45,380
do we actually make sure that what we're

00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:47,480
actually looking for we can actually

00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:49,160
test in a way that actually isn't going

00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:51,230
to take us four years and a huge

00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:53,300
multi-billion dollar you know process

00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:57,890
that we can do this on a regular lean

00:22:53,300 --> 00:23:00,140
and sort of agile methodology so this

00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:02,390
comes down to the objectives targets and

00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,700
kpi's

00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:06,830
does anyone know i'm guessing everyone

00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,420
who hasn't been hiding under a rock for

00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:12,080
the last couple of years knows sigh and

00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:13,790
the Gangnam style basically song what

00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,620
many of you may not know is that

00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:18,290
actually sigh actually broke youtube

00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:20,990
before sighs actually Gangnam style hit

00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:22,460
the number of views that you could have

00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:24,890
on YouTube was only in the hundreds of

00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,740
millions but so I actually broke that

00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:29,260
and created two billion actually views

00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,330
and it's still counting and going up

00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:34,130
which helps based in meant that YouTube

00:23:32,330 --> 00:23:37,070
had to you know we've basically

00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:38,630
calibrate the whole view to counter the

00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:41,030
challenge we see with a lot of clients

00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:42,700
is that when we talk about essentially

00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:45,260
you know setting objectives and targets

00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:47,840
everyone is focused on the total views

00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,280
they focus on my case I got two billion

00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,190
so therefore I should be able to get at

00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:54,470
least 100 million but that's the wrong

00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:56,210
approach because what we want to look at

00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:59,690
is okay what is the rate of change

00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:01,190
rather than the total number so how can

00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:02,810
we actually look at this and say okay

00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:05,240
what affected the change and

00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:07,340
unfortunately I wasn't working with psy

00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,750
and his son but if we look at the steep

00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,070
growth curve like what were the

00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,740
contributing factors that actually

00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:14,330
helped make that you know go viral

00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:15,890
essentially rather than worrying about

00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:17,600
the total number which is essentially

00:24:15,890 --> 00:24:19,100
meaningless and we're never going to

00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,560
actually hit it how do we actually

00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:23,300
understand what is the rate of change

00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,160
affecting the growth and how can we

00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:30,050
target that and how can we just hone in

00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:32,920
on that the key thing here is not to

00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:35,480
decide what to do but what to do first

00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,250
what we try and do is look at okay how

00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,960
do we create a data frame work because

00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:40,850
as you guys know there's a massive

00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,650
amount of data out there at the moment

00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:44,360
so how do we actually make sense that

00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:46,130
and how do we actually use the data to

00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:49,460
create a framework that helps us make

00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:51,830
decisions more intelligently so we use

00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:53,210
what we call the core methodology so

00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:55,790
this is about the customer experience

00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:57,380
the opportunity the revenue and the

00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:59,390
expenditure so these are the four things

00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:03,020
that we go through to actually determine

00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:04,700
how we use the different data sets so

00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:06,650
customer experience you can see here is

00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:08,630
basically the different elements or the

00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:11,300
potential to actually you know

00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:13,780
positively impact on the actual customer

00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,780
experience

00:25:14,269 --> 00:25:19,740
where the opportunity is the amount of

00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:20,940
users are affected basically so we can

00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,889
actually start going through and

00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:26,909
actually eliminating different options

00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:29,129
based on this and then the potential for

00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:32,549
basically generating essentially revenue

00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:34,590
what is the impact going to be and then

00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:37,409
the expenditure in terms of time I'm

00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:39,809
essentially cost so what is it going to

00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:41,490
cost if we have to completely do an uri

00:25:39,809 --> 00:25:43,830
platform then it's going to be a long

00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:45,869
time and going to have a huge cost but

00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,279
have reacted to a small a be test or a

00:25:45,869 --> 00:25:52,889
split test that has different

00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:55,470
implications and different costs then i

00:25:52,889 --> 00:25:58,950
think the next thing we've seen which is

00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:00,779
i think still really badly done in our

00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,399
industry is implementation of analytics

00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:03,659
that actually measure stuff i think

00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:05,460
we've seen too long that actually people

00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:07,320
are just inserting the google code or

00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,730
the google script and then go igo it's

00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,139
in there we don't have to worry about

00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:13,820
like how do we actually implement this

00:26:10,139 --> 00:26:16,289
stuff to actually make sense for example

00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:18,119
one of the ways that we approach some of

00:26:16,289 --> 00:26:19,830
the problems is through these three

00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:21,779
tools these are basically for those that

00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:23,549
you don't know them relatively cheap and

00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:25,830
free in the case of like Google

00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:27,539
Analytics so what we do with Google

00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:29,909
Analytics is to identify the problem

00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:32,279
sections of a website so we go through

00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:34,169
it may be no sections that have high

00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:36,480
bounce rates it may be sections that we

00:26:34,169 --> 00:26:38,610
can see the user is not either scrolling

00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,289
past the fold maybe where there's

00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:41,580
challenges in terms of downloading we

00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:44,639
can look at different those the

00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:46,259
parameters here then we use qualify a

00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:50,190
roux which is basically a behavioral

00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:52,200
based pop-up questionnaire so what we

00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:54,509
can do is based on the user behavior we

00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,639
ask them different questions so to

00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:59,190
identify okay why didn't you purchase

00:26:56,639 --> 00:27:02,249
why didn't you go back and add that to

00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:04,919
your cart what stopped you from buying

00:27:02,249 --> 00:27:06,840
reading whatever it is so that gives us

00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:10,769
another level information and then we

00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:12,929
use optimizely to test the hypothesis so

00:27:10,769 --> 00:27:14,549
those three tools individually aren't

00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:16,139
that interesting but when you combine

00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:18,480
them together become extremely powerful

00:27:16,139 --> 00:27:20,879
as a way of understanding how the user

00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,100
is using your those these digital assets

00:27:20,879 --> 00:27:24,269
and how you can actually a change and

00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:28,289
adapt them to get

00:27:24,269 --> 00:27:29,789
performance out of them and then it

00:27:28,289 --> 00:27:32,369
comes down to the basically optimizing

00:27:29,789 --> 00:27:34,529
so using sort of a lean methodology of

00:27:32,369 --> 00:27:35,940
build measure learn so how do we

00:27:34,529 --> 00:27:38,339
actually you know putting building

00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,570
something putting it out there putting a

00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:41,279
measurement framework around it so

00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,570
understanding what to measure and then

00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,999
learning from it and then going through

00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:46,889
that process again and not making this a

00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:49,320
huge cumbersome thing but actually doing

00:27:46,889 --> 00:27:51,450
something small the number of times I've

00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,070
worked with clients where you know we've

00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:54,089
had agencies that have come in and said

00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:56,489
okay we're going to redo the whole

00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:58,440
platform we're going to know launch date

00:27:56,489 --> 00:28:01,289
and we have that very hard fixed time

00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,299
then they switch the new places to the

00:28:01,289 --> 00:28:05,309
website on and the new one crashes the

00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:07,349
old one breaks down and they have a huge

00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:09,329
drama what we want to see now is

00:28:07,349 --> 00:28:11,579
actually where we actually designate the

00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:13,259
new website to a certain percentage of

00:28:11,579 --> 00:28:15,239
the traffic I mean facebook has been

00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:18,239
doing this for years they test new foot

00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:19,559
new features on their users in different

00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:22,139
markets that are representative of

00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:23,879
larger markets and we're still not doing

00:28:22,139 --> 00:28:25,979
this in most of the way we approach

00:28:23,879 --> 00:28:28,169
basically development and the launching

00:28:25,979 --> 00:28:29,729
of new websites I think this is a huge

00:28:28,169 --> 00:28:31,229
opportunity for us to actually use the

00:28:29,729 --> 00:28:33,509
data to learn and become more

00:28:31,229 --> 00:28:34,979
intelligent about how the users are

00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:36,719
behaving what they're doing what they're

00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:38,549
not doing and then incorporating that

00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:40,440
into the design and so we don't have a

00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:41,940
fully-fledged you know one hundred

00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,109
percent working website but we actually

00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:48,389
have something we can build and learn

00:28:43,109 --> 00:28:50,789
actually design on top of and this is

00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:52,079
just one of the ways that when this is

00:28:50,789 --> 00:28:53,700
just the way that we approach if you

00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:55,769
know through defining the strategy and

00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,259
then basically executing on the back of

00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:59,969
it so understanding defining problem

00:28:58,259 --> 00:29:01,919
creating the vision of the plan then

00:28:59,969 --> 00:29:03,479
exploring using the build measure learn

00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,609
framework to actually iterate on the

00:29:03,479 --> 00:29:08,639
back of it and then basically create the

00:29:05,609 --> 00:29:10,379
solution there's hundreds out there's

00:29:08,639 --> 00:29:12,059
don't say this is the best one but it's

00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:13,559
just having that basically process of

00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:15,389
going through and helping people

00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:16,679
understand okay it doesn't have to be a

00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:18,059
hundred percent finished when you

00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:19,529
actually deliver on it we can actually

00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:21,269
deliver something that actually is

00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:22,679
eighty percent finished and then iterate

00:29:21,269 --> 00:29:24,329
on the back of it as long as the core

00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:25,979
components are there we can then start

00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:30,599
learning and understanding what we

00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:32,729
conducted use right so enough with all

00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:34,500
the theory are going to use some cases

00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:36,750
now

00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,670
so one of the things that you know what

00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:40,320
drives earned media traditional or

00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:41,940
social this is often a common by

00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,460
challenge we see okay how do we actually

00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:46,980
generate like traffic or views or shares

00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:48,960
or downloads or purchases is it by our

00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:53,760
earned basically approach or are owned

00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:56,010
or social one platform Kiva which is a

00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,630
micro financing platform one of the

00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:59,430
things they did was basically do an

00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,900
analysis of the key understanding where

00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,790
all their traffic was coming and what

00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:05,250
traffic was actually doing on this site

00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:07,680
in terms of generating sales and repeat

00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:09,240
sales so you can see traditional own

00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,560
media who was generating around nine

00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,290
hundred new sales around four hundred

00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:17,340
repeat sales versus a blog post was

00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:19,140
around 90 new sales 63 repeat cells then

00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:22,560
the helican community forum post which

00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:24,120
was 99 you and 48 repeat sales so based

00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:26,160
on this this was basically a monthly

00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:28,020
different element it was pretty obvious

00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,940
that traditional earn media was

00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:32,010
generating the majority of their actual

00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:35,970
sales it was the one that was driving

00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:37,800
the business but what they didn't what

00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:39,710
they discovered by actually digging into

00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,120
the data was that actually what was

00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:44,820
appeared to be true on the surface was

00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,590
actually not true in reality so what we

00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,440
looked at was the blog post had a huge

00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:51,210
influence on traditional media coverage

00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:53,310
so most you know journalists had there's

00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:56,760
none in here in the mode like a

00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:57,990
relatively time poor and so they you

00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,490
know they don't have the time to go out

00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,290
and develop all these new stories so if

00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,670
you can actually give them content that

00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:05,100
is interesting to their readers they'll

00:31:02,670 --> 00:31:06,720
use it spit it out and change a little

00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,360
bit and push it out into their audience

00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,430
so by using some of the blog posts they

00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:13,650
could actually generate more articles

00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:15,990
based on that what was driving the blog

00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:17,640
post was the community posts which

00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:20,250
basically were the key drivers for

00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,020
developing the blogs so actually the

00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:24,150
thing that drove the most sales was

00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:26,400
actually the community forum and the

00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:28,170
community forums as we see them some of

00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,910
the first things to get killed in new

00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:31,260
web projects because we don't see the

00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:33,300
value in them they create a lot of noise

00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,740
but we don't see the actual value and

00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,270
actually you know generating on the back

00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,850
of especially for a lot of brands and

00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:40,830
commercially so here by just digging

00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:43,230
down into the data it was very apparent

00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:44,620
that by supporting the forum it would

00:31:43,230 --> 00:31:46,180
drive more blog posts and

00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,710
for on media and that helped them

00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:53,230
understand okay how do we actually

00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:55,980
generate more sales so it's one of the

00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:58,270
biggest predictors of human behavior

00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:06,070
anyone I want to stab at the answer to

00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:09,010
that one what's that past behavior yeah

00:32:06,070 --> 00:32:10,480
somewhat that's true but whether I mean

00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,250
in California you guys are blessed by

00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:15,270
having like amazing sunny weather

00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:17,920
basically all the time in Scandinavia we

00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:20,559
sunny weather is a scarcity rather than

00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,970
a you know something we don't take for

00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,520
granted because there's not much of it

00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:29,260
so it has huge impacts on our humor have

00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:31,300
you I mean and I think it's sort of true

00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:32,470
probably more of the East Coast than the

00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:35,020
west coast where you guys have some all

00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:37,440
the time but one of the things that we

00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:40,750
looked at is how can companies more

00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,340
easily and more intelligently take

00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:44,160
advantage of this publicly available

00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,750
information now we had the whole

00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:48,309
Snowmageddon happening on the East Coast

00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:50,500
this year and last year I think they had

00:32:48,309 --> 00:32:52,660
free time so how can companies i mean

00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,190
you know for all the females in the

00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:57,340
audience what happens when the humidity

00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:59,470
level in the air goes up what happens to

00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:01,630
your hair it basically messes with your

00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:03,160
head so there's a lot of opportunities

00:33:01,630 --> 00:33:04,480
where companies now can actually take

00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,120
advantage of this publicly available

00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:09,640
information used it on their website and

00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,370
actually promote different elements to

00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:14,470
the target audience basically live while

00:33:12,370 --> 00:33:16,630
the weather is actually happening we saw

00:33:14,470 --> 00:33:18,429
it in basically in on the east coast

00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:20,140
during the snowmageddon there was a

00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:22,210
brand that was actually taking advantage

00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:23,980
of essentially this information by

00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:25,630
offering winter jackets they have a

00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:27,730
special sale on winter jackets every

00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:29,620
time basically there's snow reached a

00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:31,750
certain amount of you know noise on

00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,880
Twitter and those different social

00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:36,010
platforms then they use their website to

00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,200
actually deliver on this so by

00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:40,690
integrating what's Happ see happening on

00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,190
the social platforms back into your calm

00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:46,150
and using publicly available information

00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:47,710
from you know the weather Bureau's like

00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:49,720
and using this in more intelligent ways

00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:53,220
than just having standardized approach

00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,220
to actually how we deliver content

00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:59,080
for altering behavior we've seen this a

00:33:56,169 --> 00:34:00,880
lot in the whole gamification and some

00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,460
of the best guys are doing this so

00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:05,559
basically the you know the VIP or the

00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,000
actual loyalty programs this has been

00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:09,490
happening for a long time you know we've

00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:11,530
moved from the loyalty program where you

00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:13,629
had like physical stamp at the coffee

00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:15,909
stall to the actual more you know

00:34:13,629 --> 00:34:17,889
digital one where someone like JetBlue

00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:21,159
is actually using this as a way of

00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:22,659
basically upselling different seats they

00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:24,909
know that have these seats available in

00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:26,139
the plains by you actually rewarding

00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:28,270
their users with these different

00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:29,679
elements to actually you know use their

00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:32,679
points and upgrade them they also

00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,720
collect information about their users so

00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:36,429
by them using their points it gives away

00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:38,649
certain information about what they do

00:34:36,429 --> 00:34:40,899
their preferences their number of pets

00:34:38,649 --> 00:34:43,149
you know how they like to actually sit

00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:45,550
or travel and that information they can

00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:47,260
then use and then research those people

00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:50,460
based on different marketing techniques

00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:50,460
and we sleep presenting that information

00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:57,490
Sephora are also really really good at

00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:00,130
this so Sephora have different baseline

00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:01,330
levels of loyalty program I'm not sure

00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:04,210
how ever many of you guys are members

00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:06,130
but what they do is basically they give

00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:08,050
away free products as part of their

00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:10,570
membership so they give away on their

00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:12,550
website free samples or free actual

00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:14,440
products the interesting part is that

00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:16,210
they allow the members to actually pick

00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:19,119
which products they would like to take

00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:21,130
home for free the really interesting

00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:23,200
part about that is that that gives them

00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:25,630
an indication of okay if they're

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,550
choosing the lip gloss or the facial

00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,930
moisturizer or whatever it is they can

00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:30,880
then use that information to better

00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:32,590
target those users when they next come

00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,000
back to their store they know what

00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:35,859
offers to send them they know what

00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,869
products that they like within our

00:35:35,859 --> 00:35:39,820
brands they have preference towards so

00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:42,790
they can completely Taylor and customize

00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:44,290
they're basically web experience so it's

00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:45,850
changing the way they're actually doing

00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:49,359
the business by simply giving away a

00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:51,460
small no item on their web store so for

00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:53,350
the cost of you know lip gloss they're

00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:55,390
getting data but you know they have to

00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:57,400
do focus groups and a lot of testing on

00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:58,230
basically for free essentially for

00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:00,990
nothing

00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:02,670
so it's a very very simple way that

00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:04,920
brands have the ability to actually tap

00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:07,500
into this and just by activating these

00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,150
simple data points can completely

00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,130
customize and personalize the experience

00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:13,230
that these users having on their website

00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:15,090
and by doing this they're locking in

00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,680
that loyalty they're becoming way more

00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:18,030
loyal than they have before and they're

00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:23,700
building that relationship with their

00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:25,170
users so how do you get to how do you

00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:27,660
get people to share a brand that most

00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:30,480
users prefer to keep secret so how many

00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:34,530
of you guys actually work in b2b

00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:37,619
businesses just a quick show of hands so

00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:39,570
in b2b I've worked with a lot of you

00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:41,340
know shipping and oil companies and

00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:44,520
places like that which have extremely

00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:46,890
uninteresting and unsexy mostly content

00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:48,330
or you know areas of business but what

00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:50,790
they don't realize is they're sitting on

00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:52,619
usually gold in terms of the data that

00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:57,480
they can actually create which is really

00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:59,609
interesting for the users so for those

00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,109
of you that don't know either pornhub or

00:36:59,609 --> 00:37:04,740
fifty shades of grey I won't go into the

00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:08,130
details but fifty shades of grey pornhub

00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:09,030
is really interesting product several

00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:11,369
reasons I won't go into those details

00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:13,109
but what they have a challenge with is

00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:15,240
that no one wants to talk about porn in

00:37:13,109 --> 00:37:17,820
the public media space no one you know

00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:20,190
they're not going to put you know New

00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:22,770
York Times isn't going to allow pornhub

00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:24,540
to advertise on their platform so what

00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:27,720
they figured out is that actually if we

00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:29,430
translate data into infographics and

00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:31,320
make it shareable then people we

00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:34,800
willingly share the base of the brand

00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:36,230
all over the web so what they did I

00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,590
don't know how many of you guys know

00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:42,810
pornhub to have this basically part of

00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:45,900
the website called analytics it's punk

00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:49,200
pornhub com / analytics don't ask me why

00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:51,060
I know this but I'm into this so but

00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,270
what they have is they basically created

00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:55,770
these essentially infographics about the

00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:57,869
behavior of people during the Super Bowl

00:37:55,770 --> 00:38:02,310
and also of great arm basically when

00:37:57,869 --> 00:38:03,720
they released the movie so in terms of

00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:05,700
the Super Bowl you can see the different

00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,619
usage so i'm not sure if you read but

00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,430
the united states is the blue line so

00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,950
obviously when the Super Bowl is run

00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:14,800
most of the men and women for that

00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:16,990
matter were preoccupied with the actual

00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,550
football going on and let's occupy with

00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:20,260
the porn going on but obviously when the

00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:22,630
football game finished back went the

00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:24,339
essentially porn viewing habits and you

00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,660
can see that Canada is in the middle so

00:38:24,339 --> 00:38:27,430
obviously they care a little bit about

00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:29,260
the NFL but they're still strongly

00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:31,329
influenced by their poem whereas in

00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,559
Europe there was a very minimal dip so

00:38:31,329 --> 00:38:33,940
there's a few people to care but most

00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:36,160
people went about watching their porn

00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:38,140
still so understanding these different

00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,910
things and this infographic was

00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:42,819
published basically in all the major

00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:44,589
media sources like Mashable TechCrunch

00:38:42,819 --> 00:38:46,720
like some of the great you know media

00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:48,819
publishing place our pages on the web

00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,099
we're pushing this out and in the top

00:38:48,819 --> 00:38:53,559
right hand corner you had youporn and

00:38:51,099 --> 00:38:56,500
the pornhub basically they'll basically

00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:58,599
promoting their brand through data and I

00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:01,210
think this is a I'm not suggesting that

00:38:58,599 --> 00:39:03,250
we go out and make gum pornographic you

00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:05,470
know if it records but the case is still

00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:07,900
you know interesting if you have a b2b

00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:09,700
company you have massive you know

00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:11,079
datasets sitting underneath you that you

00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:13,180
can actually take advantage of and

00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:14,980
utilize and push into the public space

00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,740
to take advantage and increase the

00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:19,390
exposure of your brand and a lot of this

00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,859
is basically sitting in the user

00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:23,079
behavior and activity on your own

00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:25,030
website right now and that information

00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:26,410
and data is basically being wasted or

00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:29,319
you know sitting in a database somewhere

00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:32,200
not being utilized and same with the

00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:34,960
movie like this is in terms of BDS lvu

00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,609
searches and the difference between male

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,890
and female so you can see the light

00:39:36,609 --> 00:39:42,309
purple one is female searches so that's

00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:43,599
the pre-launch of the movie versus post

00:39:42,309 --> 00:39:46,630
launch the movie so you can see the

00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:48,700
increase in female searches of BDSM w

00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:51,490
they actually skyrocketed after the

00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:53,109
actual movie launch so this is an easy

00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:59,079
way to actually you know get that

00:39:53,109 --> 00:40:00,730
content out into the web another one is

00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:03,160
actually how do we actually understand

00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:06,640
user behavior offline we've seen a lot

00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:07,960
of like you know the use of attribution

00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,760
modeling we have all these different

00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,839
other tools that we have for online but

00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,700
we know that the majority of

00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:16,390
transactions and actually goods are

00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:18,370
actually being purchased offline there's

00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:20,200
a lot of things in terms of we've seen

00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:22,480
loyalty cards which are just ran through

00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:25,840
but also ibeacon does ever know I beacon

00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,000
or heard of ibeacon technology roughly

00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:31,120
so ibeacon technology is basically these

00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,830
small physical installations you put on

00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,440
the wall they are very small they have

00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:38,140
sort of rfid tags inside or sorry I'm

00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,970
late bluetooth tags inside them and

00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:41,800
every time you walk past with the mobile

00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:43,450
phone that has an app that is connected

00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,100
to them a message can pop up and

00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:47,200
actually engage with the person so

00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:49,300
whether it tells you about a special

00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,710
deal with a store or there's different

00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:54,900
elements it can actually promote to you

00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:57,580
but it's a push-based sort of technology

00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:01,320
I'll show you example of something

00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:01,320
that's happened in Finland recently

00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,680
ee commerce is killing brick-and-mortar

00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:25,750
realty investors spawned a disagrees if

00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:28,360
East stores are winning because of their

00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:30,610
efficient use of data why not take their

00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:34,450
best practices and use them in the real

00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:36,700
world introducing physical cookie this

00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:40,360
simple keychain begins the new era of

00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:43,420
oil tea programs no apps no cards and

00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:46,000
absolutely no sign ups simply put it in

00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:48,910
your pocket and you're good to go it

00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,950
works just like cookies online when the

00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:52,930
person carrying it enters the shopping

00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:56,020
center the system begins gathering

00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:58,630
behavioral data learns from it and then

00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:01,600
shows targeted offers and messages in

00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:03,730
other words it makes the retail space

00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:06,040
react to the customers shopping habits

00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:07,990
and interests responda was the first in

00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:10,150
the world to launch this system at one

00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:13,690
of Helsinki's busiest shopping centers

00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:17,470
city center and branded it as the VIP

00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:20,320
key loyalty program over 14,000 people

00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:22,560
were given these VIP keys and instantly

00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:25,120
they became part of a loyalty program

00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:27,040
while conventional loyalty programs

00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,890
recognize their members only at the

00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:33,190
cashier we do that the second our loyal

00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:35,680
customer walks in the door with physical

00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:37,810
cookie spana created an entirely new way

00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:40,150
to combine real-time marketing and a

00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:44,640
loyalty program making the shopping

00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:44,640
experience smarter than ever before

00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:04,300
so I think this is a really interesting

00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:06,369
approach I mean this is used in a retail

00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,270
or a mall environment but you think

00:43:06,369 --> 00:43:09,280
about this from an educational

00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:11,140
perspective you think about this from a

00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:12,940
whole different way of user sets in

00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:14,650
terms of companies and different aspects

00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:16,569
there's a whole way we can actually

00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:18,430
start integrating this technology into

00:43:16,569 --> 00:43:20,589
the way we actually serve essentially

00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:22,569
clients and customers and users through

00:43:20,589 --> 00:43:25,680
these different technology points I mean

00:43:22,569 --> 00:43:28,420
this is just the sort of the beginning

00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,980
lastly obtained in this case you can't

00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:31,599
see the image but what we're selling to

00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:33,490
do now I mean we're working with clients

00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:35,650
now we're actually based on the data

00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:37,810
that we're doing or receiving from the

00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:40,180
users is determining how we actually

00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:42,400
develop like the site what I was talking

00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:44,890
about before about you know working with

00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,680
data and actually launching sites we

00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:48,819
have a client called mouse climb and

00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,349
they have focused on two different

00:43:48,819 --> 00:43:52,750
markets one is the United averett

00:43:50,349 --> 00:43:54,940
Emirates and the other one is UK so

00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:57,880
we're actually creating a website which

00:43:54,940 --> 00:44:00,010
is completely unbuilt basically it's a

00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:02,380
small percentage of the real build and

00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:04,750
we keep developing that on based on what

00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:06,339
the user experience is on that actually

00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:07,869
first few landing pages and we're

00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:09,490
building out the website based on the

00:44:07,869 --> 00:44:11,290
data that we're getting in from those

00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:13,030
users and this is only a small

00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:14,740
percentage of their global operations

00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:17,200
obviously so it's not their main kaam

00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:19,390
but it's a sub-segment of that calm

00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,250
which is based on IP address and based

00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:23,589
on these different rules and behaviors

00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:25,180
so this is just a small indication of

00:44:23,589 --> 00:44:27,369
what we're starting to do with this data

00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:29,560
to actually help us decide okay how do

00:44:27,369 --> 00:44:31,750
we develop who do we develop for and

00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:33,910
what type of information can we put into

00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:37,300
our site experience to create that

00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:39,310
personalized experience I'll leave you

00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:41,920
with this quote by basically amazon so

00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:43,359
this is delivered chicago amazon doesn't

00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,740
have to know it's snowing but they know

00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:47,410
your neighbor just bought a shovel and 8

00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:50,940
pounds of salt so with that I'd like to

00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:50,940
say thank you any questions

00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,969
yep

00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:19,130
but I would say the first of all with if

00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:21,740
you use something like LinkedIn

00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:23,150
obviously you can complete a depends on

00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:26,450
how you want to use it but if you're

00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:28,580
using it to complete a form or a log

00:45:26,450 --> 00:45:33,140
into to get access to a special area you

00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:36,380
can then ask the user to what you like

00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:37,430
complete they're essentially profile so

00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:38,870
once they've logged in with the

00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:40,280
something like LinkedIn you can then go

00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:41,870
and say okay we've got this piece of the

00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,130
information is this correct is this how

00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:44,780
we should communicate with you and then

00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:47,300
you can validate the actual email

00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:49,280
address if you need to but often I mean

00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:51,380
it's not so much the email is

00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:52,820
interesting obviously with linkedin but

00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,290
a lot of the other information is the

00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:55,910
more interesting part like who they

00:45:54,290 --> 00:45:58,400
connected to what does that job title

00:45:55,910 --> 00:46:00,350
where are they working those different

00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,840
elements to sort of help target them

00:46:00,350 --> 00:46:04,940
because the email communication is just

00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:08,680
one aspect but the other information is

00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:08,680
I would say much more valuable

00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:51,120
it's great question i mean and i think

00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:53,430
there's there's no real good answer i

00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,630
mean i have a lot of data on okay you

00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,830
know that and that's a little bit about

00:46:54,630 --> 00:46:57,930
that friction i was talking about

00:46:55,830 --> 00:47:00,230
earlier like that frictional okay i

00:46:57,930 --> 00:47:02,580
really want to log in using my social

00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:04,230
accounts and i know i'm going to give up

00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:05,790
some information what am i how they

00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:08,310
going to use that and i think the best

00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:09,930
way is to test it I mean you can log in

00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:11,820
with your you know social accounts you

00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:13,620
can also log in with your email or

00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:15,690
something like that and also just test

00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:17,280
that friction and then do a split test

00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:18,630
where you say okay let's you know push

00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,160
fifty percent of the users will use

00:47:18,630 --> 00:47:22,740
social login the other fifty percent

00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,810
will actually let them log in for free

00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:27,390
or without giving up information and

00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:29,910
that way you can actually test and a lot

00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:32,520
of the the data I've seen depends on the

00:47:29,910 --> 00:47:34,170
value proposition you give the users so

00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:36,360
obviously if it's a sight you don't know

00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:38,850
you have no idea about what they do or

00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:40,470
can't trust them then the friction will

00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:41,850
be much higher than a site you do know

00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:44,220
because you know the value proposition

00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:46,380
will be much higher because you know if

00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:49,740
they use something like our discuss for

00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:51,570
example the commenting software or

00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,950
plugging then you you're familiar with

00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:55,170
that so your friction will be loved much

00:47:52,950 --> 00:47:58,320
less than some other but I think the

00:47:55,170 --> 00:48:00,540
best way is to test it because you and I

00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,310
could guess for a long time but I think

00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,810
it's the coming down to actually testing

00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:06,560
it out and see what works and the split

00:48:03,810 --> 00:48:06,560
testing miles away

00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:43,320
I think there's a so the question is you

00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,690
know if you don't have the resources of

00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:47,010
someone like Amazon for example how do

00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:49,380
you actually do some sort of email

00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:52,400
personalization and I think the the easy

00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:55,170
part is you know just by simply doing

00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,210
small-scale sort of steps basically the

00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:58,950
NFL one is a classic example so that

00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:01,500
individual is logged in with either

00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:03,599
Facebook or some sort of social network

00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:05,900
they've completed their basic profile

00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:08,700
they've given away like their birthday

00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:10,890
the team preference and that's pretty

00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:12,210
much it and their first name and they've

00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:15,180
been able to personalize based on that

00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:17,520
so even if you have nothing else than

00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:21,150
just understanding the analytics behind

00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,619
okay when we push a email to our people

00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:25,140
that are on our Facebook you know

00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:27,599
community we can see they behavior like

00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:29,580
this they typically click on the first

00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:32,700
link or they click on articles related

00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:34,740
to XYZ and then they have this behavior

00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:36,390
on site and then we can use that

00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:38,790
information to better target them

00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:40,520
through our email campaign and there's

00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:42,570
other I mean there's a lot of cheap

00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,609
effective sort of marketing automation

00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:48,000
tools out there that can help with that

00:49:44,609 --> 00:49:50,550
as well but very simply you know even

00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,200
something like MailChimp has effective

00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:54,420
ways of dealing with this information

00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:57,450
but just little things like okay what

00:49:54,420 --> 00:50:00,230
did they click on what titles worked in

00:49:57,450 --> 00:50:03,000
the email like what information do they

00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:04,470
sort of go to on the website what

00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,570
behavior to they have just using that

00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:09,770
alone you can get a lot of let alone if

00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:09,770
you have their first name and birthday

00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:14,839
any other questions yeah

00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:56,559
so one of the image I showed before with

00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:58,710
the data-driven rapid development that

00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:01,240
client what we're doing is basically

00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:03,190
we're building a new site for them and

00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:04,750
we're going through the process of

00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:06,670
exactly that how do we actually

00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:09,130
incorporate that sort of build measure

00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:10,569
learn into the building process and what

00:51:09,130 --> 00:51:13,240
we've talked to them about is actually

00:51:10,569 --> 00:51:15,369
instead of the starting with the end

00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:17,319
goal of this very pretty website that

00:51:15,369 --> 00:51:19,180
our design team came up with you know at

00:51:17,319 --> 00:51:21,819
the beginning of the project sold it in

00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:23,410
we said okay what are the ambitions like

00:51:21,819 --> 00:51:25,540
where do we want to like what's the key

00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:27,579
thing for you guys so as a b2b it's

00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:29,770
about lead generation so that's our

00:51:27,579 --> 00:51:33,190
endgame and then what we're doing is

00:51:29,770 --> 00:51:34,930
basically we're having a team of

00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:37,720
basically design and developers working

00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:40,540
on this sprint like four week for week

00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:42,250
so the cycle of bhosle agile scrum and

00:51:40,540 --> 00:51:45,040
then going through and actually

00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:47,440
designing specific elements based on

00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,760
what the data is showing us so if people

00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:51,339
are going into a certain part of the

00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,960
website we then say okay eighty percent

00:51:51,339 --> 00:51:54,760
of all people going into the help

00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,990
section for example ok that's the next

00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:57,990
part we need to build out

00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:09,820
yeah a lot so it's not as and of course

00:52:08,109 --> 00:52:12,849
it's not as easy as it sounds it also

00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:14,320
takes organizational they change in

00:52:12,849 --> 00:52:16,720
terms of how do you approach because I

00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:19,180
think a lot of the lot of us in the

00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,800
agency world very much waterfall trivum

00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:23,170
legis like I go design then it goes to

00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:25,510
specifications then it goes to the you

00:52:23,170 --> 00:52:28,450
know down the sort of step and then a

00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:30,670
year later six months after do delivery

00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:32,349
date and million over budget we have

00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:33,820
your product and I think what we're

00:52:32,349 --> 00:52:35,619
saying to do now is okay how do we

00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:37,420
actually do this in a faster way that

00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:39,640
the customer and getting their attention

00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:41,109
away from the pixels and focusing more

00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:43,630
on okay what is it they were trying to

00:52:41,109 --> 00:52:46,240
achieve what is the the numbers of it so

00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:48,609
rather than say okay they stop focusing

00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:50,470
on the weather it's blue enough for its

00:52:48,609 --> 00:52:52,420
the light Pantone or whatever it is

00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:54,250
getting them to focus on okay what is

00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:57,280
that we're trying to achieve in terms of

00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:59,320
lead generation or filling the cart or

00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:02,619
whatever it is and then using that but

00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:04,119
it is a massive change in terms of the

00:53:02,619 --> 00:53:05,560
organization how you think about these

00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:07,260
projects and getting people to actually

00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:10,180
develop and design on the back of that

00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:11,560
because that also changes the way you

00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:14,640
think about this whole waterfall

00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:14,640
approach bicycle

00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:39,770
I think it's I mean I don't know if i

00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:42,290
can give you suggest i think what we try

00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:44,359
and do is basically have the the team

00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:46,460
involved at the beginning like we try

00:53:44,359 --> 00:53:48,290
and include the design someone from the

00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:49,430
tech basically side of it designed at

00:53:48,290 --> 00:53:51,020
the beginning so that they haven't

00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:52,849
understand if this is what the client is

00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:55,160
after because typically i think it's

00:53:52,849 --> 00:53:56,240
like you know took the organization you

00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:58,310
have the account management all the

00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:01,010
sales go make the sale they come back

00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:02,869
they briefed the design team it goes

00:54:01,010 --> 00:54:04,280
down the system whereas what we're

00:54:02,869 --> 00:54:06,020
trying to do is say okay these guys all

00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:07,550
need to be at the beginning so they

00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:09,140
understand what the client is focused on

00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:10,640
what the challenges and then they can

00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:13,460
basically go into their different area

00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:15,050
and start using that knowledge to sort

00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:16,490
of inform them and then we have the

00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:18,080
analysts which are providing the data

00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:20,000
say okay this is what the numbers are

00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:22,310
saying we can see that you know people

00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,750
aren't engaging with this button that

00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:25,910
you created or the menu structure

00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:27,890
doesn't work we have to rethink how that

00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:29,930
information is prioritized or whatever

00:54:27,890 --> 00:54:31,640
it is so I think a lot of it is just

00:54:29,930 --> 00:54:34,849
having that transparency in them

00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:36,470
involved again I think that's ands also

00:54:34,849 --> 00:54:39,020
changing the way we sell projects as

00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:40,339
well rather than making that huge sale

00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:41,690
it's sort of saying okay how do we

00:54:40,339 --> 00:54:44,150
actually go in with a different approach

00:54:41,690 --> 00:54:48,650
and sell an iterative basis rather than

00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:51,040
the one-size-fits-all approach any other

00:54:48,650 --> 00:54:51,040
questions

00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:17,059
so we work with Audubon which is the

00:55:13,789 --> 00:55:19,109
Lagonda bird basically society so

00:55:17,059 --> 00:55:21,450
classic example of working with

00:55:19,109 --> 00:55:24,390
donations as our conversion point rather

00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:26,430
than lead generation or whatever so we

00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:29,579
use the same approach exactly but our

00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:31,170
end goal is in this case donations so

00:55:29,579 --> 00:55:33,839
how can we actually build that donation

00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:35,549
ship element so there it's basically

00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:37,950
just understanding okay what type of

00:55:35,549 --> 00:55:40,349
users typically donate to the most what

00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:41,910
information do they look at before how

00:55:40,349 --> 00:55:44,579
do we take them through that user

00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:46,470
journey basically and where do we target

00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:49,049
the specific information at what stage

00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:50,940
and that's I think that part of that

00:55:49,049 --> 00:55:52,589
personalization is it through the email

00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:54,720
marketing it through the social channels

00:55:52,589 --> 00:55:56,760
it's through there that owned assets on

00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:58,859
comm and things like that and then using

00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:01,109
those together to basically help drive

00:55:58,859 --> 00:56:04,319
them through that basically funnel so

00:56:01,109 --> 00:56:07,279
that's sort of the red light version of

00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,279
it but we

00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,270
exactly so it's just understanding how

00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:15,809
what do these guys look for on the web

00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:17,430
what sites do they you know go to what

00:56:15,809 --> 00:56:19,710
are they engaging with on our social

00:56:17,430 --> 00:56:21,510
channels on Pinterest on you know some

00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:22,920
of the more visual platforms and then

00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:25,349
how do we use that information to inform

00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:27,539
the way we design and develop content on

00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:29,670
our site and then we can use that

00:56:27,539 --> 00:56:32,069
information to serve that to them rather

00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:34,470
than say okay you know as a new customer

00:56:32,069 --> 00:56:36,839
coming in to the website every single

00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:39,150
time actually we know you're a big donor

00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:40,680
so what information do we give you and

00:56:39,150 --> 00:56:43,200
what how do we personalize that

00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,910
treatment to use a large doughnut versus

00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,440
someone that's never heard of us and

00:56:44,910 --> 00:56:49,309
come through some sort of campaign that

00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,309
we're running concurrently

00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:09,510
I think yeah so

00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:22,320
yeah so the first two weeks would be the

00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:24,570
design process and in the last two weeks

00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:27,240
of the development process basically but

00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:29,400
it depends a little bit undersized of a

00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:30,870
project basically but that's typically

00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,670
the way we've broken it down first two

00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:34,170
weeks during the design iterations and

00:57:32,670 --> 00:57:38,820
second two weeks doing the eh the

00:57:34,170 --> 00:57:40,380
implementation side of it yeah that's

00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:42,690
yeah I would say the testing and

00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:44,940
learning is the is goes underneath

00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:46,560
because the data we set up the data

00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:48,180
framework or the measurement framework

00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:50,370
before we actually go through this

00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:52,290
process so all the different elements we

00:57:50,370 --> 00:57:54,180
want to test are built into our

00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:55,470
measurement framework and then the

00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:58,020
learning is basically on the back of

00:57:55,470 --> 00:57:59,370
every sprint we have a review system

00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:01,530
where we actually go through the data

00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:04,530
identify okay what worked what didn't

00:58:01,530 --> 00:58:06,900
what are the what is the new behavior

00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:08,370
teaching us and then we adapt and go

00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:11,730
through that going to the next phase

00:58:08,370 --> 00:58:13,950
essentially from that so the data

00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:15,480
parties or the measure part goes

00:58:13,950 --> 00:58:17,280
underneath everything that's constantly

00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:19,980
sort of running through our analytics

00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:22,560
sell different analytics platforms and

00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:24,540
then the measure and learn or the sorry

00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:27,420
the build and learn is in those

00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:30,530
basically weekly chunks essentially and

00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:33,450
then the learning is essentially a

00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:34,950
there's the formal learning where we go

00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:36,540
through review the different elements go

00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:37,770
through the data and understand it and

00:58:36,540 --> 00:58:39,360
then there's informal learning where

00:58:37,770 --> 00:58:41,160
it's constantly being tested so the

00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:43,050
analysts and the actual guy's committing

00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:44,670
the tests actually understanding they

00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:46,830
actually use behavior so they can then

00:58:44,670 --> 00:58:48,450
go and inform the designers and help

00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:50,340
them understand okay what how do we

00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:55,050
change different things and test it that

00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:57,840
way that's a very vague level but yeah

00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:59,910
it's very I mean the the biggest

00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:01,410
challenge we have is the client usually

00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:02,820
like work with client getting them to

00:59:01,410 --> 00:59:05,340
buy into the process and then getting

00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:07,170
them involved in that process as well so

00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:09,240
a lot of it if we depends if the project

00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:11,400
is a very short deadline then we

00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:13,490
obviously have to change the way we work

00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:16,290
based on that deadline whereas if it's a

00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:20,630
12 month timeframe it allows us extra

00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:20,630
room to commit to different elements of

00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:28,309
any other questions

00:59:31,050 --> 00:59:34,910
