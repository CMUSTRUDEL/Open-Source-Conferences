Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Selling Agile
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	Agile is not a new thing, everybody and their mom has heard about agile projects. Most people also know about the business benefits of agile. Agile practises are spreading like wildfire in the corporate world, companies are discovering considerable business benefits from agile adoption. At the same time too many Drupal companies are making excuses for why waterfall or fake agile is the way to go simply because they have failed to sell or adopt agile.

Wunderkraut was born agile. We've never done anything else and we do exclusively agile projects. At the same time most of our new customers are not all that familiar with agile. Selling agile for non-agile customers is an art form that very few people master. After doing it for living for longer than Wunderkraut has existed I'm ready to make the bold claim of being an expert on the topic.

My goal for this session
To help Drupal vendors move to agile, for real this time. As the CEO of Wunderkraut and a director for the Drupal Association I do my best to help Drupal grow. Personally I see improving the business of all Drupal vendors as a very good way to do this.

What will you get from attending
You'll hear some of the not-so-well guarded business secrets of the largest Drupal services provider in Europe. Just don't expect to get a silver bullet from this session, this stuff is really hard. The session will however provide you with a starting point and a direction for becoming really efficient on selling agile.

I'll I'll change it and that's where we

00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,510
start so this is four or five years ago

00:00:06,029 --> 00:00:11,580
or so before before I talk talking any

00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:12,929
more about this and other stories I have

00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,210
for today I would like to know who we

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:17,850
have in the room because this is sort of

00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,380
a flexible presentation I'm going to be

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,350
changing some of the content based on

00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,529
who do we have in here so a couple of

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,900
quick show of hand questions how many of

00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:32,099
you are working for a vendor working for

00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:34,140
triple customers that would be most of

00:00:32,099 --> 00:00:37,620
you excellent how many of you are

00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:43,890
working on the customer side very few

00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:46,440
okay what about in-house team okay to be

00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,180
expected I guess so how many of you

00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:54,000
would consider yourself being completely

00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:56,010
new to agile okay how many of you have

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,789
some experience but not completely at

00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,770
all most of you okay great avid about

00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:03,719
who can say it's like everything you do

00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,799
in your organization is always done by

00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:11,520
using at oh okay quite a nice spread I

00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:15,330
do the same same talk in in Drupal con

00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,909
Amsterdam and basically the room looked

00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:20,600
pretty similar in there as well um so

00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,340
I'm expecting quite a few questions

00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,659
usually from from vendor vendor site

00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,020
there's a lot of different questions

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,820
unlike you know how's how's this and

00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,650
that working so i'm doing the questions

00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,420
a bit differently from most essence we

00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:36,240
are going to be using twitter for this

00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,790
and I have my colleague Steve here who's

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,170
going to moderate them for us so I'm

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,659
going to actually take these questions

00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,430
in the middle of the session as well so

00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,790
we're just using hashtag selling at all

00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,979
so this will help us to do pick the most

00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:53,450
interesting questions that are specific

00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:56,009
for for these topics and so on and so I

00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:59,850
have to jump out a fun presentation for

00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:02,210
one second I'll be right back you back

00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,210
with you

00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:17,580
just that I'm missing your your

00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:21,750
questions and stuff here Oh fine oh just

00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:24,239
manage without them so historic today is

00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:26,250
really in three different pots first of

00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:27,989
all I'm going to talk a bit about like

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:29,940
you know everybody really loves agile

00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:31,800
and and it's great i'm going to talk

00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,970
about why it is so difficult to sell

00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:37,950
what what's the deal behind it

00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:40,590
afterwards i'm going to talk about like

00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:42,900
most specific details on how to sell a

00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:46,230
large island i have i have like real

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,060
stories like how to do it a number of

00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,640
different examples on how to how to

00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,290
actually go about and sell it and I'm

00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,180
gonna wrap it up by talking a bit about

00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,769
what if the customer still comes back

00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,410
and tells you like no no but I need to

00:02:55,769 --> 00:03:01,830
have fixed everything so I I do have

00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:04,800
three different approaches here it's not

00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:07,519
only me talking today I've been working

00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,110
and selling agile for more than 10 years

00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,820
but I've been also being on the other

00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,970
side of the table I've been also buying

00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,530
projects back in a day and I've been

00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:21,390
talking to a number of different people

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:24,030
about the same challenges so this time I

00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:25,560
didn't bring anyone live here for

00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,709
interviews but I did to record a number

00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:31,650
of different videos so for example this

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:34,079
guy here he is fair to turbulent he's a

00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,299
professional web buyer so the only thing

00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,890
he does for customer he goes goes to a

00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,920
customer helps them to find a vendor

00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:44,880
helps them to go through an RFP process

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,650
and so on and so on so once the question

00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,329
I asked from him is like how to how

00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,220
should vendors actually sell agile

00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:53,070
because this is all he does day in and

00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:56,640
day out so this interview was done in

00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:58,890
our office in Helsinki so ignore the

00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,540
office dog that you know jumps into the

00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,220
video every now and then we have quite a

00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,390
few of his dachshund this stuff happens

00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,390
when you try recording stuff

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,790
right so this is really the core of what

00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,650
I'm going to talk about today as well

00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:08,390
it's really like you don't want to sell

00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:10,970
agile you're gonna sell the actual

00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:15,230
benefits of agile this is this is where

00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:17,090
we'll be getting it so I'm I do attend

00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:19,430
quite a few ads all conferences every

00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:21,680
year and and I talk about the same

00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:24,170
topics with with different people in

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,940
agile conferences as well and usually

00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:28,400
when I ask them like do you have any

00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:30,710
problems in selling agile they say like

00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,720
no not really because you know everybody

00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:34,700
wants after these days we used to have

00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,910
problems with this but that's no longer

00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:40,750
the case this is not exactly true in in

00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:44,030
the triple universe unfortunately but

00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:46,520
everybody's still kind of wants a job so

00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:49,070
let me start by am assuring you that

00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,740
actual is really simple but it's not

00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:55,670
easy like we did we did the agile

00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:57,950
training yesterday in here for four plus

00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:00,650
room full of people you can actually did

00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:03,110
something like scrum in a day the basic

00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,240
principles you can even learn in half an

00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,450
hour hour it is it is really really

00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:10,730
simple but it's quite difficult to

00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:13,250
actually switch to a job because it's a

00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:15,560
change of a mindset it's it's not so

00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:17,570
much about like you know what you what

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,090
you actually do it more about how do you

00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:22,970
approach on your projects and how does

00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:26,930
your your organization think so that's

00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:28,340
why it's definitely not easy so the

00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,190
starting point of course is like

00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:34,040
everybody everybody loves agile on its

00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:36,590
own but if you ask them like well what

00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:39,680
what what do you mean by agile what it

00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:42,350
is it's very very misunderstood on what

00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,820
I'd chalice is actually all about it's a

00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:47,030
bit easier to explain what it's not

00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:49,640
about so agile is definitely not about

00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:51,890
implementation it doesn't have anything

00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,830
to do with with implementing software on

00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:57,260
its own you can use it for that yes but

00:06:54,830 --> 00:07:00,080
it's not really all about that it's not

00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:02,450
about doing Sprint's or stand ups or

00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,040
having burn down charts or any of that

00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:06,770
it's it's not

00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,630
that it's not even pure time and

00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,120
materials always it's like you can do

00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,490
agile with the fixed budget that's fine

00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,140
that's perfectly okay you just can't do

00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,970
fixed everything if you want to do a job

00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,560
and also a child is not going to be

00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:20,660
magic it's not going to magically fix

00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,880
all of your problems it's just going to

00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,230
make them more visible it's going to

00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,570
give you some tools from how to fix

00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:28,580
those problems but just you know going

00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:31,670
agile that's not going to fix your

00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:35,660
problems on its own so let me go a bit

00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:40,010
deeper on these so I take it quite a few

00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:43,010
of you who hasn't seen this nobody dares

00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:46,340
to raise their hand so this is the agile

00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:48,170
manifesto faster this is from 2001 a

00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,930
bunch of people getting together on

00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:53,020
putting down some values on on how to do

00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:57,110
proper software development because lots

00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:59,270
of their projects tend to fail I went to

00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,160
I went to university and studied

00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:03,940
computer science is back in the 90s and

00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,380
I can remember we were taught like

00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,930
something like eighty ninety percent of

00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,850
software projects fail I thought okay

00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,260
thank you very nice studying here and

00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:15,260
you know learning that everything that I

00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:17,150
do is very likely to say and this used

00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,340
to be the case and it still is you can

00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:22,120
always read from papers on all of these

00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:25,280
like massive IT projects that go wrong

00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,560
but there are ways of you know making

00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,420
that risk smaller it's not going to

00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,630
guarantee success but there are ways of

00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,040
doing that that's what this is all about

00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:35,540
it's all about like let's focus on

00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:38,180
individuals and interactions over

00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:40,419
processes and tools and so on I'm not

00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:43,040
going to go into all of the details here

00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:45,440
these are the core principles behind

00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,630
agile though and they sort of craic

00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,390
don't think you know all of it makes

00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:53,000
sense it's perfectly sensible to respond

00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:56,480
to change over following a plan but

00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,150
that's there's always the body and a

00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:02,000
brilliant individual created this this

00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:04,820
is a manifesto for hof as agile software

00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,390
development and this is what we see and

00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:12,170
this is what most companies call a job

00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:15,290
unfortunately so so this is like what it

00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:17,089
says down there items on the left found

00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,670
nice in theory but you

00:09:17,089 --> 00:09:22,339
us being an enterprise company we can't

00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:25,009
let go on the things on the right so

00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:26,569
it's going to be like individuals and

00:09:25,009 --> 00:09:29,629
interactions over processes and tools

00:09:26,569 --> 00:09:32,120
and we have mandatory process and tools

00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:36,290
on controlling those individuals blah

00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:38,329
blah blah and this is what happens so

00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,699
this is where you go wrong because if

00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:43,339
you really want to do the sort of take

00:09:40,699 --> 00:09:45,829
the leap and go agile it's also all

00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:49,160
about letting go of some of these things

00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:51,199
if you just try to get like best of

00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,269
waterfall and agile and do everything

00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:56,149
you're not going to get benefits from

00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:58,699
from either one of these so this is this

00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:01,999
is what I call fake agile usually of

00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:04,059
fragile some cases as well but it's

00:10:01,999 --> 00:10:07,129
completely faking it's just you know

00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:09,350
having your your waterfall or process

00:10:07,129 --> 00:10:10,790
and putting Sprint's on top of it it's

00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,009
not going to do it's not going to make

00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:15,079
the process a job you may get some

00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:17,449
benefit from the sprints but you're not

00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:21,370
actually getting the core benefits both

00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:24,949
of the ads are pros so why this happens

00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:28,579
my analysis on this looks like the

00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:31,370
smallest for agile there's two primary

00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:33,920
things one of them is trust one of them

00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:37,839
is communication so obviously up and

00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,699
right is more of both in this diagram so

00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,769
if you have a lot of trust and you have

00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:45,379
perfect communication what do you have

00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:47,209
you have an in-house team the trust is

00:10:45,379 --> 00:10:49,189
implicit because everybody works for the

00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:52,029
same company everybody is in same room

00:10:49,189 --> 00:10:55,970
so you have very rich communications

00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:59,209
what's the the other like extreme that

00:10:55,970 --> 00:11:01,699
would be like external vendor a new one

00:10:59,209 --> 00:11:04,759
and off short one where you mostly

00:11:01,699 --> 00:11:06,679
communicate by emails by you know people

00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:08,269
having interesting accents and different

00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:09,860
cultures and all in all the

00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:12,709
communication may not be all that great

00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:15,019
and in between of course you have vendor

00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:17,899
that is co-located where communication

00:11:15,019 --> 00:11:20,120
works but the trust is implicit in up

00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:22,429
there it's it's you know if you have to

00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,959
build the trust or of course you can

00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:25,549
have this stability in-house team where

00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:30,319
you have the communication problems but

00:11:25,549 --> 00:11:31,070
the trust is there so what it looks like

00:11:30,319 --> 00:11:33,260
the training

00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:36,830
agile is really built for for the

00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:39,650
in-house teams scrum for example it's

00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:41,630
meant for product development done by

00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:46,160
in-house deeds everybody sitting in the

00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:49,460
same room that's what it's for it can be

00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:52,030
used for everything else as well but if

00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:54,140
you have a vendor working in-house

00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:55,850
co-located vendor you're going to have

00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,680
problems with these lovely people at

00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,620
procurement department and legal

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:03,050
departments my two favorite departments

00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:07,670
in any enterprise company always so so

00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:09,620
nice to work with and flexible so so

00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,930
that's that's what you'll have and

00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:14,690
that's what causing you some problems if

00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:16,760
you have an distributed team regardless

00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:18,200
of where they are you have communication

00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,480
and knowledge management problems with

00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,400
agile you don't have to documentation

00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,740
and you don't have the combs in place so

00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:27,740
you end up having some problems with

00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:30,050
that and if you start agile with having

00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:32,030
an officer in vendor you that's going to

00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:34,010
be very challenging I'm not going to say

00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:36,440
it's impossible but I'm just going to

00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:38,810
say you are definitely picking the most

00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:43,250
challenging way of starting your like

00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:45,890
agile journey and I know because we we

00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:48,980
have 170 people doing to pull all over

00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:51,890
Europe so we have our fair share of this

00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,480
debate teams not off short everybody can

00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:55,100
fly and meet the customer within like

00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,190
one or two hours the flights are cheap

00:12:55,100 --> 00:13:01,850
and so but still we do do a fair bit of

00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:03,590
distributed so we've seen this a lot so

00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:07,040
of course you know our way of fixing

00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:09,770
this is making Airlines like us lots bye

00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,810
bye enough flying on site and spending

00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:13,520
time with the customer but the trust

00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:17,060
trust issue is much more difficult to

00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:19,850
solve so so if there's no trust there's

00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:21,590
not going to be any proper agile because

00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:23,240
in place of trust you start putting in

00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:26,180
contracts and the contract start

00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:30,160
defining everything and yeah I'll get

00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:34,510
back to that in some of my examples so

00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,510
do we have any any questions so far

00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:41,270
yet we have a couple questions in a

00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:44,420
couple of points let's take one for now

00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:46,040
grab Tindy has tweeted and says do you

00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:48,260
find there is a minimum scale for a

00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,990
successful agile project and does the

00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:52,880
approach change depending on scale for

00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:55,660
example working in thematic Sprint's

00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,970
versus deployable horizontal slices

00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:01,400
that's an excellent question yes you can

00:13:58,970 --> 00:14:03,320
use that well for all sizes but you

00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:06,740
can't use for example scrum for all

00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:10,240
sizes in the end if you look at scrum a

00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:13,970
sprint is a waterfall that's what it is

00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,860
and if you do only one sprint it's kind

00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:17,810
of fake to call it agile it's like come

00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:20,300
on this is chrome it's late no no it's a

00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:23,120
waterfall project really but you can use

00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,650
like lean methods you can use Kanban you

00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,620
can use others like that for smaller

00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:30,050
projects when you scale up there's

00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:33,110
there's no definite upper limit limit

00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:35,180
for using something like strong but that

00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:37,460
said if a project is big enough you

00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:40,150
wanna start splitting it into multiple

00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:42,350
teams and then you have all the

00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:44,450
difficulties that that you get with with

00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:49,310
managing multiple teams but that's a bit

00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:50,780
of scope for today and that's that's

00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:54,830
okay for now but if you want more

00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:59,660
questions tweet hash selling agile thank

00:14:54,830 --> 00:15:02,450
you Steve alright so moving on moving on

00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:05,570
how to actually sell this stuff um I do

00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:09,560
this a lot and and I fail a lot in this

00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:13,400
I succeed quite a bit as well but so

00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:17,060
let's let's get back to do our story for

00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:20,510
for a while so what did we do with with

00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:22,670
this vendor sorry this customer we we

00:15:20,510 --> 00:15:26,330
sort of we started working with them and

00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:28,040
said like okay you know let's put a lot

00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:30,830
more support in place than you usually

00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:33,350
have and let's think about for a while

00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:35,930
you are saying you always fail a bit

00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:38,420
vendors let's think about an example

00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:40,790
from from your normal daily life all of

00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:43,250
us I'm sure have a friend who's was less

00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:45,950
successful in relationships I think

00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:49,130
everybody has one so what do they often

00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:49,730
say they say that all men or women are

00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,220
so hard

00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:54,500
you know I just can't make it work all

00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,329
of them are so bad so what's the one

00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,750
single thing that doesn't change in all

00:15:56,329 --> 00:16:01,760
of your relationships well yeah yourself

00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:04,760
look it look at look at the mirror

00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,620
that's what I told the customer all of

00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:09,380
your vendors always failing with all the

00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,720
other customers no you know they are

00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,130
still in business they do succeed so why

00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:16,839
do you think they are always failing

00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:21,079
with you well that's got them thinking

00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:23,060
they were a bit more willing to to get

00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:27,260
in some extra overheads and some extra

00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:29,720
support after that so basically getting

00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:33,199
a customer to realize what the problem

00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,519
is all about is is a good stuff so have

00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,029
a look let's have a look at the benefits

00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:41,480
them these are four key benefits of a

00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:44,690
job the red line being a child black

00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,760
line being waterfall or design first any

00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,290
other methodology where you do your

00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,540
design first and implement in

00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:52,310
implementation later and so I just

00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:55,010
typically call them design first all of

00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:56,300
these mythologies so of course in agile

00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:58,430
you have visit quite a bit more

00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,199
visibility because traditionally you

00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:01,699
when you start you have perfect

00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:03,199
visibility you think you know what

00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:04,429
you're doing because your plans after

00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:07,040
effect on you have perfect visibility

00:17:04,429 --> 00:17:08,510
right then it goes to black hole where

00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:10,120
you don't know anything and something

00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:14,299
may or may not come out at the other end

00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:16,339
in agile same thing happens but all the

00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:19,220
time so you select your plan you

00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:21,860
implement you deploy something so

00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:24,470
visibility is much better adaptability

00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:27,169
in agile we can change stuff all the

00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:30,230
time so the project must know that it's

00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:32,000
adaptable to change during you know in

00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:35,660
the environment or in the organization

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,450
or what have you business value nancial

00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:41,150
we worked the highest value items first

00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:44,360
so we deliver the maximum value right

00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:46,429
away in in traditional we do everything

00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:48,200
in one big band modest we may have

00:17:46,429 --> 00:17:50,320
multiple releases but we still we need

00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,820
to do everything before we can release

00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,190
to the business value generation if you

00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:58,610
stop the project in the middle it looks

00:17:55,190 --> 00:18:00,590
very different risk wise risk is sort of

00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:02,720
a mirror image of the business value

00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:03,290
because when we start delivering value

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,140
to risk

00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:08,990
goes down simple as that so these are

00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:10,580
sort of tip four key elements but I'm

00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:15,350
going to go a bit deeper with some case

00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:17,120
examples so i think because more than

00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:19,730
half of the room is is vendors i think

00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:22,310
you've seen most of these with your

00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:25,340
customers at some point so first one is

00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:27,680
the famous fixed scope like yeah sure of

00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:29,420
course all of the customer's always say

00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:31,940
of course we can do agilent the problem

00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:33,980
that's fine but you know i need to have

00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:35,900
a fixed budget and fix co one fixed

00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,110
timeline a fixed everything after that

00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:41,720
we can do our job yeah not a problem

00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:44,890
well let's have a look at this let's

00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,060
compare for a while so first of all

00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:49,760
where do before because if we have a

00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,500
fixed scope where most customers think

00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:55,820
they are protecting their own backsides

00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:58,250
by by having a fixed cope in a fixed bit

00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:00,950
that the vendor really focuses on

00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:03,260
unchecking all of the boxes there are

00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:06,320
some requirements and these requirements

00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,330
need need to be met and if you meet them

00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,660
really quickly and cheaply you are

00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:13,280
making a massive profit if you'll take a

00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,550
while with them you are not really

00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,830
making any profit so it really is all

00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:22,580
about checking the boxes with minimum

00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:25,970
effort with with fixed bit at all on the

00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:28,250
other hand it is climbing materials so

00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:30,560
your incentive is to create as much

00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:33,980
value as you can for the customer with

00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:36,200
the time you spent you focus on the

00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:38,780
results and you can also focus on the

00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:42,980
total cost of ownership instead of one

00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:45,110
of cost of a project scope well fixed

00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:48,050
bit is fixed changes are going to be

00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:50,120
expensive there's change management in

00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:52,790
place and and customer will pay for all

00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,470
of these changes on the other hand an

00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:57,050
agile of course you know it's built for

00:19:54,470 --> 00:20:00,620
being flexible and and you know it's

00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:02,360
built for change and we have a question

00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:04,430
different I was just going to wish my

00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,740
room but now you ask yes and three

00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:08,840
lindsey are specifically in this area

00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,910
how can you marry agile with a fixed

00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:13,220
price traditional request for tender so

00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:16,220
if the customer is demanding the fixed

00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:19,340
how can you marry agile to that request

00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:20,900
given it's in their best interests yes

00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,940
you can do it actually quite easily as

00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,190
long as the customer can be flexible on

00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:28,130
the scope fixed price price is perfectly

00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:30,409
fine so what you can do is you can do

00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:32,659
very high level promises and we are

00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:34,340
going to deliver this and this business

00:20:32,659 --> 00:20:36,080
call we are going to meet with this

00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,980
project you know we are going to do what

00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:42,260
we can the actual specific scope itself

00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:45,620
that needs to be flexible so what we do

00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:48,470
often due to meet the requirements of

00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,659
legal and procurement dislike the punter

00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:52,940
tax recess like this is the initial

00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:55,730
backlog for the project this is the

00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:57,620
scope that makes legal people happy they

00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,630
all smiling at this point then it says

00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:01,549
and the steering group of the of the

00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,870
project may change this at any point and

00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:05,049
you know it's it's going to keep on

00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:07,340
changing and the steering group is like

00:21:05,049 --> 00:21:09,200
participants from from the customer and

00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:11,510
vendor and as long as they are creating

00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,570
and do whatever we did so basically you

00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:16,130
have all of this ideally you wouldn't

00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:17,840
even have it in a contract but in real

00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:20,330
world when you work with enterprise

00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:22,370
level customers you kind of have to put

00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:25,549
it in there you just live in a loophole

00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:27,799
to be able to change it that's the

00:21:25,549 --> 00:21:30,679
easiest way I've I've figured out how to

00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:34,280
do it that usually works because

00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:36,590
typically in my experience if you have a

00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:39,620
customer who has an idea and knows what

00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:41,929
they are doing it's the actual sales

00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:44,900
game is like you and customer against

00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:47,419
the procurement unfortunately because

00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,860
the procurement is just saying like no

00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:50,679
no we can't do this because we were

00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,000
trained it trying to do it differently

00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:54,470
it is unfortunate than I think

00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,679
procurement needs to change but that's

00:21:54,470 --> 00:22:03,440
not the topic for today so was there

00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:07,700
something else ok great so the risk in

00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,320
fixed bit risk is largely hidden so so

00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,970
what what the customer is trying to do

00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,039
in a fixed bit you are trying to move

00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:15,049
the risk to the vendor by having

00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,080
contracts and sanctions and what have

00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:20,809
you and and that's like you can try to

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,780
do it but it's not very easy and often

00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:25,110
you can't even do it I Nigel it's much

00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:27,780
more transparent

00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,820
and parties actually share the risk it's

00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:32,640
transparent on how the risk is shared

00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:36,090
who has what part of the risk and sold

00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:39,690
it's it's quite quite different let me

00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:43,590
do an example let's say I'm a customer

00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:46,860
who who I need to transfer 20 bags of

00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:48,960
rice every day I need to transfer them

00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,370
say like five kilometres 45 miles

00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,460
doesn't make a lot of difference for

00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:55,770
this example and I need to be able to

00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:59,040
transfer them say in an hour and you

00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:01,440
know so i define these requirements I

00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:03,000
have all of these check boxes that you

00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,400
know you have to meet these and these

00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,679
and these requirements and I'll make up

00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,299
10 more just you know to be on the safe

00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,429
side and then I think ok I've covered

00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:14,309
all of the requirements so now i'm going

00:23:11,429 --> 00:23:16,350
to send out an RFP and i'm just going to

00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:19,440
basically pick the cheapest because you

00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:21,240
know ok i'm completely safe I my

00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,820
requirements are going to be my my

00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:27,299
safety net right this is what happens in

00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:29,660
IT projects all the time so what do I

00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:32,970
get as a costume what's the expectation

00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:34,590
I'm gonna get a lorry or something like

00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:38,669
that right that that's my expectation

00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:40,290
well this is what comes up it's the

00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:43,559
cheapest possible thing that does the

00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:45,809
trick you're gonna hate to use it it's

00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:47,669
going to break down every other day you

00:23:45,809 --> 00:23:49,380
can't actually get the Box delivered

00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:52,590
because it breaks down and you have a

00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:56,070
lot of downtime but it checks all the

00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:58,200
boxes so you can't blame the vendor so

00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:01,530
all of these traditional requirements

00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,809
you have in our of peace they are very

00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:06,900
very good at covering the back side of

00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:09,360
the bender not great at covering the

00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:11,929
back side of the of the customer so

00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,940
actually the traditional approach of

00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:17,400
especially for IT project it completely

00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:19,740
turns on its head it turns on its head

00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,750
it's it's like it's not good for the

00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:24,090
customer especially if you look at like

00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:26,280
very large IT companies they are very

00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,720
good at playing this game as well so the

00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,700
customer is never going to be happy and

00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,669
they're going to be very profitable in

00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,890
this project and in almost all cases the

00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:37,080
vendor has more competence in playing

00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:42,480
this game than the customer does

00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:44,280
so also there's this this is a real

00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,040
picture it it's from construction

00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:49,260
industry I think so the big job there

00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,380
it's called called the change order and

00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:55,830
the small thing is is a original

00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:57,270
contract and and it's it's kind of funny

00:24:55,830 --> 00:25:00,600
because that's the way it is in real

00:24:57,270 --> 00:25:03,030
life for for IT companies the change

00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:05,310
orders in traditional fixed everything

00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:07,860
contracts those are the most profitable

00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:09,270
part so they're very good at change

00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,250
management because that's where they

00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,780
make their money and this is when the

00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:15,510
projects are millions and millions this

00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:17,490
is this is where it's headed not many

00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:19,800
customers understand it and they still

00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:21,810
try to protect themselves so as a vendor

00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,940
it it's up to you to try to explain to

00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:26,400
the customers like look you are not

00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:29,550
really protecting yourself and even if

00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,230
you try it it becomes a game and it's a

00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:35,580
game that is very difficult to actually

00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:38,640
win for you so in this case if he is

00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:40,860
agile will be creating more value will

00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,600
be managing the risk better and we can

00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,280
we can have a lower total cost of

00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:46,500
ownership because we can focus on that

00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:49,230
instead of focusing on just checking the

00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:51,330
boxes at that point good point to

00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:52,890
introduce question from anand who says

00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:55,290
isn't fixed build a better alternative

00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:57,720
to time and materials for some projects

00:25:55,290 --> 00:26:00,780
with uncertain scope therefore the

00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:03,180
vendors absorb the delivery risks well

00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:06,600
this comes down to like if it's an

00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:07,890
uncertain scope actually I'll table for

00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:10,440
a minute I'll get back to this because I

00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:14,430
do have an example on Andres so I'll get

00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:16,740
back to this in a second right so the

00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:18,780
second quite typical case it's not

00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,580
having a product owner product owner is

00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:22,560
the person who's who's sort of the

00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:28,950
project manager and a customer site the

00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:30,300
business owner of the project so let's

00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:32,460
say you have a customer who has just

00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:34,530
documentation and mock ups and so on and

00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,570
they just they throw them out basically

00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:38,490
I said you go do it we've done our part

00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:41,430
so you know we are going to go out on a

00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:43,350
holiday or whatever in Europe they would

00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,850
go on holiday in America you know they

00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:46,710
go and work on other projects of course

00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,290
but the same same concept applies of

00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:51,670
course

00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:55,570
so we have our vacations so still you

00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:59,110
know we've seen this so what we do in

00:26:55,570 --> 00:27:01,590
all the projects with Wonder is we

00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:04,930
really recreate like one team where

00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:08,230
instead of just having the digital and

00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:10,150
project competence we have we combine

00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:12,610
that with with the business competence

00:27:10,150 --> 00:27:15,610
of customer so first of all when this

00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:17,440
team together works on these things if

00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:20,080
they take a come up with new ideas and

00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,450
they can improve on the original you

00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,460
know idea is quite a bit so so the end

00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:27,940
result is much better it's like having a

00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:29,320
in-house digital team for customer so

00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,970
this is the first thing it's it's

00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:34,450
actually the end result is likely to be

00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:37,240
better then the planning when we do it

00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:40,060
just in time this is how how it looks

00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,520
traditionally right we plan and analyze

00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:44,470
and design and you know then we let the

00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,630
code monkeys loose at some point and you

00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:50,200
know take or encoded and it's tested and

00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:52,000
released right so we don't really save

00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:54,970
on any of these steps when we are doing

00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:57,040
a job it doesn't mean no planning we

00:27:54,970 --> 00:28:00,190
still do all the same steps we need to

00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:03,490
do a bit of initial design first but we

00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:06,640
do it in different different phases so

00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:08,380
we do the design just in time so if

00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,840
somebody said tells you that you're

00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:12,430
going to be saving time or design when

00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,350
you do agile they don't know what

00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:16,270
they're talking about it's actually

00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:19,030
quite the opposite humane spending a bit

00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:21,010
more time on design but you're not

00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,630
wasting time on doing design for stuff

00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:26,230
which may not and end up being

00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:28,480
implemented at all so let's see if

00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:31,120
there's a let's imagine for a while that

00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:33,160
there was a project where both budget

00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,710
runs out or prime runs out this

00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:38,500
naturally never happens but if there

00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:41,230
were such a project and you run out of

00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,660
time in here what's going to happen with

00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:46,780
your your traditional no product or an

00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:50,710
approach you have something that is like

00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:53,560
mostly coded not tested at all and not

00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:57,710
ready for release and not release

00:28:53,560 --> 00:29:00,529
definitely with agile we did like

00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:02,149
the most valuable things first so the

00:29:00,529 --> 00:29:04,460
fifty percent if the percent of the

00:29:02,149 --> 00:29:09,260
project is actually already released or

00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:11,360
ready to release rest of it not done we

00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,770
can decide to continue on and do it or

00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,200
if you really have to wrap the project

00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:17,360
up at this point that's what we do we

00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,960
still we got most of the valuable stuff

00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:22,760
out of the way so this is this is where

00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,230
we need the product owner we really need

00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,179
the product order to make the decisions

00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:29,960
on what what what are the most important

00:29:26,179 --> 00:29:32,240
part of this project so this this

00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:35,779
actually leads into lower interest quite

00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,429
a bit it also leads into having better

00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:39,649
quality out of the project because we

00:29:37,429 --> 00:29:41,510
put our money where where it makes the

00:29:39,649 --> 00:29:43,789
biggest difference instead of just

00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:45,679
trying to check all the boxes in a

00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:51,309
project and in the end it also leads

00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:55,100
often for saving money so third case I'm

00:29:51,309 --> 00:29:57,169
delayed feedback in the project quite

00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:59,510
often if we try to do a big band watch

00:29:57,169 --> 00:30:02,120
big bang launched which is which is like

00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:04,039
a typical way of launching design first

00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,960
project so basically you go in a dark

00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:08,630
room and then you come out with

00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,360
something and Tara that's you know there

00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:13,370
we go we have big and launch it now

00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:15,260
typically we do testing quite late in a

00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:18,260
project typically we don't allow real

00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:21,919
users or beta users in the product quite

00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:25,250
quite early and this has some

00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:28,700
thing pretty negative effects first of

00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:30,559
this being let's let's think about the

00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:33,770
line in the middle being the optimal

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:36,140
version of what we want to launch going

00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:39,080
up means doing too much spending too

00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:40,940
much time on details for example going

00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:44,750
down means not having good enough

00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:47,059
version of a feature for example well in

00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:48,980
time if we only get the customer

00:30:47,059 --> 00:30:51,740
feedback or or the end user feedback

00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:54,190
once we may actually deviate quite a bit

00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:56,570
from what's optimal before we know it

00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:58,669
whereas in agile where we launched off

00:30:56,570 --> 00:31:00,679
an unloader alley we get feedback all

00:30:58,669 --> 00:31:03,049
the time so we actually we end up going

00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:06,169
back and forth it's it's still not going

00:31:03,049 --> 00:31:08,270
to be optimal all the time but we will

00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:10,429
not end up deviating during the entire

00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:11,240
project and only after after building

00:31:10,429 --> 00:31:12,890
something that look

00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:16,340
perfect launching it it's like oh it

00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:18,020
doesn't work and this is this is very

00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:20,570
very important because the actual you

00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:22,370
can you can get stuff out early you can

00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:24,710
get feedback on it you can improve it

00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:29,330
you can make sure it's really great for

00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:34,160
your users investment wise it also makes

00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:36,620
much more sense so if if we for a while

00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:40,520
if we assume we are playing a lottery

00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:42,260
bit with three balls and and there's two

00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:46,340
ways of playing this the first way is

00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:49,520
the traditional way where a ticket costs

00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:52,280
three euros you paid you we know you

00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:55,520
don't win that's the way it goes the

00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:58,340
second way of paying is just buying one

00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,020
number for one euro and only after you

00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:03,110
know if it's a winning number investing

00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:05,660
to the next number and so on and if you

00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:08,600
do the math on this what the average

00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:11,030
investment is over over a lifespan of a

00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:13,220
company or five or ten years or doing

00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:15,320
like thousand projects what do you think

00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:17,990
that the average investment on a

00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,880
successful project is going to be it

00:32:17,990 --> 00:32:21,340
feels like this is sort of like in real

00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,559
project doesn't make a big difference

00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:27,740
but if you want to go and Google like

00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:29,960
real options theory for example which is

00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:31,700
like a theory on how to do how to take

00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,160
like options in your real business

00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:35,929
development this is exactly what it

00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:38,210
enables when you do agile you can do

00:32:35,929 --> 00:32:39,800
smaller chunks of work when you know if

00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:42,260
they work or not then you can do

00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,820
additional investment so your your

00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:46,390
investment decisions are going to be

00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:49,760
done with the latest responsible moment

00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:52,520
so this makes a massive difference for

00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,309
many organizations yet not enough

00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,840
organizations do this but again as

00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:58,940
vendors we can tell them like try to

00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:01,340
explain them why it's a good idea why

00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:05,780
should they invest just in time not not

00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:08,330
everything up front so basically this

00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:10,970
leads us to into having some real

00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:14,179
options on business development learning

00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:19,750
much faster and much more cost effective

00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:21,920
solutions if you have a question we do

00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:24,410
David Steven

00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:29,240
says if customers not happy with output

00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:30,650
with fixed beard and fixed scope how to

00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:34,880
get more budget when it could won't

00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:37,220
guarantee better output sorry with

00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,870
flexible scope yes yeah that makes more

00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:42,020
sense customer not happy with output

00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:43,400
with fixed bid and flexible scope how

00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:47,570
can you get more budget when it won't

00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:49,870
guarantee better output you want what

00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:53,000
what happens with if you want to do

00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:54,740
proper agile which is mostly diamond

00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,140
materials it doesn't have to be pure

00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:58,910
diamond material but it's mostly what

00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:01,550
you have to guarantee for the customer

00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:03,020
is an option of kicking you out so

00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:04,640
basically if you start working your

00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:08,090
contract says like if you are not happy

00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,980
for what what we produce like the result

00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:14,150
for your spends money you get you can

00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:15,710
kick us out so it goes two ways the

00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:17,780
customer has to trust you but you have

00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:20,840
to cross the customer so in all of our

00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:23,090
contracts we say like you can fire us at

00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:26,060
any point if you're not happy what you

00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:28,550
get and when we do project steering we

00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:31,520
make it really visible this is what you

00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:34,340
got this is the money you paid are you

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,780
happy on it and in most projects at some

00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:37,570
point the customer is not going to be

00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,530
happy because we do stuff like

00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:42,290
integrations which is completely not

00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:43,730
visible and it's like well we don't

00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:47,390
really have anything to show when you

00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:49,700
just spent like 50000 euros but that's

00:34:47,390 --> 00:34:51,320
sort of a temporary thing in in

00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,780
technical projects and you can explain

00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,700
yourself out of that situation so it's

00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:57,500
not a massive problem but if you

00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:59,240
continue doing it and not delivering

00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:01,640
value I think you deserve to get fired

00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:03,200
at that point fair enough you know

00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:11,600
customer trusted you and you were not

00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:14,360
delivering so out you go right so then

00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:16,040
the famous design first and now I'm

00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:19,010
talking a bit more like visual design

00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:21,860
first and such things but this also

00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:25,330
applies for for legal for some companies

00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:27,620
because some companies say that our

00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:29,360
industry for example has so much

00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:31,340
regulation that everything has to be

00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:34,490
approved by legal before we build

00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:35,660
anything and and then I talk talk to

00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:37,010
people like new your

00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:39,619
stock exchange which say they do

00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:42,380
exclusively agile and that is on they

00:35:39,619 --> 00:35:45,589
don't design anything upfront I think

00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:48,500
the industry is pretty regulated that's

00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:50,750
just my guess so so it's really only an

00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:53,510
excuse and you know being used to one

00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:56,510
way of working you you don't have to do

00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:58,910
like visual designs or legal texts

00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:00,740
upfront you can actually build them into

00:35:58,910 --> 00:36:03,530
the agile process it just requires

00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:05,599
different way you think so let's let's

00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:08,720
see if we do the sign first oh and by

00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:11,020
the way we do the same thing when when

00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,789
companies approached us and asked like

00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:17,990
as part of your proposal would you like

00:36:13,789 --> 00:36:20,450
to do like visual mock-ups no because

00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:24,230
this is what the project looks like and

00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:27,530
this is any project so down we have time

00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:29,510
and left hand side we have knowledge so

00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:31,400
in the beginning of the project any

00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:34,670
project the team has minimum knowledge

00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:37,730
of the project right pretty common sense

00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:39,109
at the end of it we have maximum amount

00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:42,140
of knowledge so that's where where the

00:36:39,109 --> 00:36:43,789
hindsight is a beautiful thing so when

00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:48,589
do we do all of the most important

00:36:43,789 --> 00:36:51,349
decisions in a project if we have all

00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:54,289
the requirements in an rfp we do them

00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:56,329
with the minimum knowledge right so we

00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:59,930
always tell the customers for example

00:36:56,329 --> 00:37:01,069
when talking about like visuals that we

00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:02,770
don't want to do any of this with

00:37:01,069 --> 00:37:05,690
minimal knowledge we too have a at

00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:08,270
design process in place for very good

00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:09,950
reason and our own designers absolutely

00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:11,900
love it because they get to do design

00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:13,730
decisions with knowing much much more

00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:17,390
about the topic and the project and the

00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:19,369
end user so sort of when you show this

00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:21,230
to customers this is kind of like okay

00:37:19,369 --> 00:37:22,760
it is what it is of course you can't

00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:24,619
make all the decisions at the end

00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,779
because the project is over at that

00:37:24,619 --> 00:37:28,460
point but you can postponed all of all

00:37:26,779 --> 00:37:31,220
of the key decisions to the latest

00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:32,839
responsible moment of course responsible

00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,460
is the key word here because if you if

00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:37,819
you just postpone all the decisions all

00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:41,740
the time it's worse than 10 not deciding

00:37:37,819 --> 00:37:43,910
at all triple specific thing with Drupal

00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:45,680
features are cheap and details are

00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:48,230
expensive because you know in the end

00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:49,400
what do we do as a scruple jobs we take

00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:51,380
a fully functional

00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,390
product and we spent the project in

00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:55,190
trying to break it now we're pretty good

00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:58,040
at we typically we managed to break

00:37:55,190 --> 00:38:00,380
triple pretty well as well so when when

00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:03,710
you spend most of your time in details

00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:07,160
in projects does it make any sense to

00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:09,140
fix all of those up front in worst case

00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,940
having a designer who has no idea how to

00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:13,010
pull works designing something and then

00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:15,410
we just spend a lot of time trying to

00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:17,480
code it to look like somebody who has no

00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:20,180
idea how to pull works tuple has like

00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:21,380
existing user interfaces you know if we

00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,000
want to save a lot of money for the

00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:25,300
customer we have to consider this user

00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,380
interface is a bit while doing design

00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,850
this there's something called product

00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:31,190
printable that this has nothing to do

00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:32,990
with technology it's from economics that

00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:34,880
states that about eighty percent of

00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:37,700
value you get for twenty percent of time

00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,730
this applies for any project for triple

00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:43,100
projects i would say ninety-five percent

00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:44,720
of the value you get for five percent of

00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:47,450
the time and rest of it you're tweaking

00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:50,210
on the details so when you are tweaking

00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:52,040
on the let's say visual details you are

00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:54,950
actually tweaking them on customer money

00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:57,680
it's it's not the designers money and

00:38:54,950 --> 00:39:00,080
it's if there's an external design

00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:02,390
agency it's not certain about the design

00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:04,280
agencies money because the design agency

00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:06,950
wants to win aboard the customer wants

00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:08,480
to do business so so basically it's up

00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:10,400
to the product owner to decide and how

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,820
much tweaking we do with with any

00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:18,350
details and this very much is true the

00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:20,300
last like fifty percent or more almost

00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:22,370
all of us is something that only sort of

00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:26,120
the in-house team even notice is any

00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:27,980
difference so that's why for example we

00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,690
have our own prototype driven process

00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:31,850
where where we can offer multiple

00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:34,640
options unlike we know this is what we

00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:37,610
are trying to do and we could do this in

00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,650
in like an hour with an existing triple

00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:41,720
feature it's not exactly what you asked

00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:43,610
for but it's kind of the same thing or

00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:46,070
we can spend a week doing exactly what

00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:49,430
you asked it's your money you decide

00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:51,560
it's not our decision it's yours and

00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:56,780
quite often customers they pick the

00:39:51,560 --> 00:40:00,140
cheaper way not always so we end up with

00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:02,360
improved product risk lower and and also

00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,960
we generate with new ideas when we don't

00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:08,000
do

00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:12,080
designs up front right so now we get

00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:14,630
back to the risk question this is quite

00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:16,940
typical from from customers to say like

00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:18,589
we expect you to carry the project risk

00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,970
because you know we have a contract in

00:40:18,589 --> 00:40:21,680
place that are going to transport the

00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:24,140
risk for you and we have a lot of

00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:27,589
uncertainty in this project so we want

00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:29,990
you to carry the risk for us really how

00:40:27,589 --> 00:40:31,849
realistic is that if you have a look at

00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:34,609
like can you even transfer that business

00:40:31,849 --> 00:40:37,670
risk like if you are late to the market

00:40:34,609 --> 00:40:39,859
you lose a lot of revenues if it does

00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:41,599
damage to your brand because everything

00:40:39,859 --> 00:40:43,730
crashes because you know somebody

00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,220
schemed on the quality or you know

00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:47,900
number of other things you can have some

00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:50,450
closest saying you have to pay some

00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:52,460
money back for these but they are

00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:55,849
probably not going to compensate you for

00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:57,770
it or if they will that insurance is

00:40:55,849 --> 00:41:00,530
going to be really really expensive for

00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:02,420
you or in a worst case you may be

00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:04,640
dealing with the vendor who has no idea

00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:06,859
on how to do their business and I don't

00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,960
know which one is more scary is it most

00:41:06,859 --> 00:41:10,820
carried to know that this like transfer

00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,410
of risk is not going to happen or

00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:15,890
knowing that you have a vendor who's in

00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:18,710
component so I don't think you can

00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:21,410
actually do it also the traditional way

00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:24,980
of doing a procurement is sort of like

00:41:21,410 --> 00:41:27,770
win-lose it's based on procurement being

00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:30,619
a game and and in a game you have

00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:32,990
winners and losers how often in real

00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:35,690
life too you see like win-lose

00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:39,349
relationships working for for longer run

00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:41,060
they may work initially for you but on

00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:42,560
long around the person who's losing in

00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:46,010
this relationship is looking to get out

00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:48,740
and if if a customer is just looking for

00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:50,750
a vendor to lose in a relationship yeah

00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:53,359
you know the vendor may do it to get a

00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:55,640
reference or you know to fix cash flow

00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:57,020
for a minute or whatever but the vendor

00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,230
is not going to be there for a longer

00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:02,750
run unless they can fix the relationship

00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:04,160
so instead of trying to win it would be

00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:06,670
much much better to try to look for

00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:08,750
relationship which is like equal and

00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:12,890
actually you know works for both parties

00:42:08,750 --> 00:42:15,740
as well so that's that's sort of the big

00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,460
difference and we fortunately be seen

00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,050
more and more calm

00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,820
beneath these days like large companies

00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:21,380
looking to find like really healthy

00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:23,570
relationships where it's really

00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:26,270
transparent on like what do we get out

00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:28,339
of it we are transparent about our

00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:30,410
margins and everything and explain like

00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:32,540
what what makes a difference for all

00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:34,550
margins how can you help us to do better

00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:36,140
business so we can also you know help

00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:39,230
you to do better business so

00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:43,520
transparency is the best policy one

00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:45,410
practical example on this pricing what

00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:47,359
you can do for example you can do target

00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:49,040
pricing for contract like look this is

00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:51,470
this is the price we are aiming for and

00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:54,530
then we have the maximum price for a

00:42:51,470 --> 00:42:56,660
contract if we manage to deliver under

00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:58,940
the target price we get a 20-percent

00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:01,580
bonus on what's remaining customer gets

00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:03,440
really big discount but this discount is

00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:05,960
only happening because the customer

00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:08,990
product owner was not on setting

00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,720
priorities and enabled us to do work

00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:15,290
quickly and not get hung up on all the

00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:17,900
details on the other hand if we go over

00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:20,180
the maximum budget we give say forty

00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,790
percent discount on everything that is

00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:24,410
done over the maximum price something

00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:27,080
like forty percent fifty percent is

00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:29,390
typically in our industry that's where

00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:32,240
where we are no longer making any money

00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:34,400
so this is really really bad for us to

00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:36,560
end up in this situation but it's not

00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:38,780
for free for the customer it needs to

00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:40,670
hurt both parties if this happens

00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:44,540
because they also has to be an incentive

00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:46,490
on getting out of this situation so if

00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:48,859
you want to have a look at like how to

00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:51,680
build this sort of situations just

00:43:48,859 --> 00:43:53,660
google for like ads our contract models

00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:56,180
there are quite a few good models on how

00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:58,490
to do fair contracts that work well for

00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:01,400
both customer and and the vendor this is

00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:04,070
just just one example really a question

00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,930
him from Grant Hindi he says are you

00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:07,760
willing to give up quality standards if

00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:10,450
a customer is unwilling to pay for

00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:14,290
details following initial development

00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:17,570
its customer money it's not our money so

00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:19,700
the most common way of running into this

00:44:17,570 --> 00:44:22,130
is a developer saying like no we have to

00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:24,890
do with the Drupal way and the triple

00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:27,690
way maybe instead of 10 minutes we spent

00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:29,700
two weeks or something unfortunately

00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:31,319
and in these cases it's not the

00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:33,480
developers money it's the customers

00:44:31,319 --> 00:44:35,280
money so we explained to the customer

00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:37,380
this is going to come back and it's

00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:39,210
going to bite you in the behind because

00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,940
you know when you are maintaining this

00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:44,280
it's more expensive but look you know as

00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:45,990
long as the customer understands it

00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,849
maybe in some cases the customer doesn't

00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:50,040
care all that much like okay lifespan of

00:44:47,849 --> 00:44:51,599
this thing is going to be a year it's

00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:55,980
not worth investing and doing it the

00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:57,390
right way so yeah if if the customer

00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:59,550
demands it and if the customer

00:44:57,390 --> 00:45:05,960
understands that the decision they are

00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:08,190
making it's their money it's ours right

00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:11,040
so I'm not going to talk a lot about

00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:12,720
this but there's um there's something we

00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,819
can learn from construction industry

00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,560
believe it or not it's not the most

00:45:14,819 --> 00:45:19,319
dynamic industry you can think of so

00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:24,060
this is terminal five in heat row in

00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:28,200
London and they build it built a new

00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:30,839
terminal a few years ago for about 34

00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:33,180
billion pounds so you know a very large

00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:36,359
amount of money for for building project

00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:39,810
and they knew that most projects on this

00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:42,210
scale end up going horribly wrong like

00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:44,819
just completely over budget and behind

00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:46,800
schedule and everything so what they did

00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:49,800
for this is they research all of the

00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,470
mega projects of this size in UK during

00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,060
the past 10 years and they figure it out

00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:56,400
like you know what are the common things

00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:57,900
and how to do this differently and they

00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:00,359
came up with a completely different

00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:03,210
model of of not trying to pass of all

00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:05,069
the risk to the Bender's but actually

00:46:03,210 --> 00:46:08,190
having a model where we split the risk

00:46:05,069 --> 00:46:10,500
and sort of much much more like healthy

00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:12,000
relationship kind of a contract and it

00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:14,700
just turns out you know they managed to

00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,950
do it right on budget and on time and so

00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:18,390
on there are still some problems with it

00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:21,210
and if you go and do some research

00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:22,890
online on this song critique on it but

00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:25,020
it's actually a good read to go online

00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:27,060
and check the terminal five contract

00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:28,800
model and what was behind it because as

00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:30,420
an industry like we could actually

00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,940
really learn something from from

00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:34,890
construction industry which I put on to

00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:39,720
have imagined before i run into to this

00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:40,839
case live and learn so in this case we

00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,359
can get most

00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:44,979
stable relationships first of all

00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:47,460
something that lasts a long time good

00:46:44,979 --> 00:46:49,989
for both parties risk management and

00:46:47,460 --> 00:46:51,849
also better quality of life for

00:46:49,989 --> 00:46:54,190
everybody well it's like a good fair

00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:56,200
relationship everybody enjoys their

00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:58,479
working life a bit more nobody likes

00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:01,450
being in an abusive relationship not

00:46:58,479 --> 00:47:02,890
even at work so that that's if you want

00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:06,930
to retain off your employees that

00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:11,009
becomes a pretty important thing so I

00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:13,719
spoke also to change schools who say

00:47:11,009 --> 00:47:16,749
sort of director for the product

00:47:13,719 --> 00:47:19,150
implementations and and big on agile in

00:47:16,749 --> 00:47:21,940
an NBC Universal so he sort of

00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:24,400
introduced agile to to NBC Universal so

00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:26,469
I asked him what what does he actually

00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:28,450
asked for like when he's looking for a

00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:30,609
trial vendors and how does the RFP

00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:32,229
process code so that as a vendor you

00:47:30,609 --> 00:47:54,969
have better idea on what the customer is

00:47:32,229 --> 00:48:01,200
thinking so let's hear some type of

00:47:54,969 --> 00:48:01,200
relationship to share so

00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:51,700
and I couldn't agree more with we change

00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:53,650
on this this is what your hear over and

00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:55,840
over again you need to trust your own

00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:57,430
process in order to sell it if you have

00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,410
an agile process and you're fully don't

00:48:57,430 --> 00:49:01,330
trust it you're not going to be able to

00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:02,800
sell it I understand it's a chicken and

00:49:01,330 --> 00:49:05,460
egg kind of situation if you are moving

00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:08,410
to agile but you have to start molding

00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:10,330
on exactly that point Chris Rooney has

00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:12,850
questioned he says I job requires high

00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:14,980
trust from the client on budget timeline

00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:19,000
and goals so how can you create that

00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:21,760
trust with brand new clients if if a

00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,800
customer is brand new to agile you have

00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,420
to start more that's the only thing you

00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:27,940
can go with you and you can you need to

00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:31,120
show them small wins initially you have

00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:34,000
to take a bit of risk yourself and and I

00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:36,970
wouldn't if you as a company or new to

00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:38,860
agile I wouldn't go and sell agile the

00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:40,540
customers who are new to agile unless

00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:43,060
it's an existing customer with existing

00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:45,300
trust relationship in place I would

00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:48,550
rather sell adult the customers who are

00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:50,860
used to doing agile and I would also be

00:49:48,550 --> 00:49:53,020
pretty honest about like you don't have

00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:55,270
lots of agile experience yet but if you

00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:57,040
can sell your team otherwise and if they

00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:59,500
are experienced in agile it may be

00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:03,310
beneficial relationship still for for

00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:05,620
both of you so same thing and ask also

00:50:03,310 --> 00:50:08,460
from from from there to about this so

00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:08,460
let's see what he says

00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:13,900
oh sorry

00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,560
Oh

00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:31,320
right alright so do we have any any

00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:35,610
other questions at this point though one

00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:38,520
from anand again says is there a case to

00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:41,460
split the product management and project

00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:46,470
management roles in the vendors team on

00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:49,200
the two contradictory that may be a

00:51:46,470 --> 00:51:52,410
slightly off scope for this system but

00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:56,220
um I probably wouldn't I would try to

00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:58,470
keep at one thing but that said if you

00:51:56,220 --> 00:52:01,020
have a product portfolio that is being

00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:03,180
run with agile then you need to have

00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:05,820
like agile portfolio management and all

00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:07,560
that but we can talk about that that

00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:13,350
afterwards I guess because that's quite

00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:16,200
detailed all right so what if you know

00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:17,790
after all of this the customer is still

00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,920
saying like you know we want to have

00:52:17,790 --> 00:52:23,250
fixed everything and let me do an

00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:25,670
example of this like about one and a

00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:28,620
half years ago a year ago we we had a

00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:30,840
large global media company approaching

00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:33,330
us with an RFP that was a completely

00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:35,220
fixed everything RFP so they were saying

00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:36,360
like okay you know we would like to work

00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:38,580
with you guys we've heard nice things

00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:42,690
about you but you know this is this

00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:45,300
approach so we sent them a a short reply

00:52:42,690 --> 00:52:47,310
and saying no thanks we explained them

00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:50,040
what's wrong what's likely to go wrong

00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:52,170
with with their approach and say that

00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:54,540
they basically told them in like four or

00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:56,940
five pages that these are the problems

00:52:54,540 --> 00:53:02,070
you will have with the approach you've

00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:05,010
you've taken so just told them no we got

00:53:02,070 --> 00:53:07,260
a reply in a day they were quite Swift

00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:12,930
the reply was like thank you you have

00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:15,150
been shortlisted okay fair enough so so

00:53:12,930 --> 00:53:17,130
it just happened that we explained what

00:53:15,150 --> 00:53:20,160
had happened with all of the previous

00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:22,640
project or quite a few of them and they

00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:24,810
were willing to listen so we caught in

00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:27,030
we spoke with

00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:30,480
we explain the problem to approach and

00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:31,830
all that and and they you know said like

00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,220
okay fine let's start working together

00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:37,650
and let's let's do a different project

00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:39,960
we we've done now a couple of large

00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:43,050
projects for them and they've been just

00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:45,950
fine actually the product owner on the

00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:50,310
customer end who who took the risk and

00:53:45,950 --> 00:53:52,800
chose us and worked with us got a big

00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:54,870
massive promotion also afterwards after

00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:56,910
the first project so it went pretty well

00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:58,980
so now we have a very good cheerleader

00:53:56,910 --> 00:54:01,920
in this organization saying like no no

00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:04,770
all of this should go agile so you can

00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:07,020
take a few different approaches first of

00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:09,930
all if you get a fixed everything more

00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:13,350
of P you can just say no walk away it's

00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:16,110
cheap it's easy its quick to do you know

00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:18,420
know how I'm done but of course you know

00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:20,640
you don't you don't learn much and the

00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:22,170
customer doesn't learn anything then you

00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,110
can do the second thing that we do

00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:27,300
usually we say no we also explained them

00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:29,250
why we don't do it we explain them

00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,810
what's probably going to go wrong we try

00:54:29,250 --> 00:54:33,950
to be brief so we're not going to send

00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:37,200
them books or anything but explain

00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:39,030
sometimes it goes wrong and the customer

00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,310
just says like okay no no we need to do

00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:42,960
it our way sometimes what I just

00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:45,630
explained happens customer comes back

00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:47,400
and says like okay let's talk we've seen

00:54:45,630 --> 00:54:51,420
these problems you are describing so

00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:53,520
what's your solution to this and then

00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,020
you can do the desperate thing and say

00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,730
like okay well i'm just going to offer a

00:54:55,020 --> 00:55:01,500
fixed called contract and try to do

00:54:56,730 --> 00:55:03,870
agile within it that's nasty you can try

00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:05,910
to do it but then then sort of you are

00:55:03,870 --> 00:55:08,520
trying to give all of the nice things to

00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:11,280
the customer and at the same time take

00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:14,400
all the risk to yourself and that's not

00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:16,080
very healthy long-term business I know

00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:19,860
you can do it and I know you can succeed

00:55:16,080 --> 00:55:23,400
in it but I personally I wouldn't we've

00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:25,020
we've sort of built a company around ad

00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,520
cell from day one and we've never done

00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:28,440
anything else than I'd tell so for us

00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:30,840
it's quite easy to say that just decline

00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,490
everything that is not agile but you

00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:33,810
know having run about 20 years of

00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:35,760
different professional services

00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:37,349
companies I understand it's challenging

00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,239
if if you can't you know

00:55:37,349 --> 00:55:41,789
pay your salary it's going to be a bit

00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:43,890
of a challenge to decline and say no but

00:55:41,789 --> 00:55:46,229
if you want to you know end up on a more

00:55:43,890 --> 00:55:49,049
healthy profitable business more happy

00:55:46,229 --> 00:55:51,569
employees on longer and I would decline

00:55:49,049 --> 00:55:53,999
this one way or the other this is also

00:55:51,569 --> 00:55:56,309
one of my motivations of talking about

00:55:53,999 --> 00:55:58,410
this topic quite often especially in the

00:55:56,309 --> 00:56:01,529
Drupal community I think this would be

00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:03,390
best for for everybody if all of the

00:56:01,529 --> 00:56:06,479
really good shops would start saying no

00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:08,579
to fix everything proposals would be

00:56:06,479 --> 00:56:11,039
great for the customers they would need

00:56:08,579 --> 00:56:12,779
to move to agile sooner they would only

00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:15,089
have two really crappy shops you know

00:56:12,779 --> 00:56:17,190
tuen fixed everything and failing badly

00:56:15,089 --> 00:56:18,839
with that would be great with soft as

00:56:17,190 --> 00:56:21,359
well because you know more and more

00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:24,269
shops would be able to move to fully

00:56:21,359 --> 00:56:25,859
agile ways of doing business so I think

00:56:24,269 --> 00:56:27,390
this would be really good for for

00:56:25,859 --> 00:56:29,579
everybody and I know more and more

00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:33,869
companies do this as well it's a

00:56:29,579 --> 00:56:36,180
perfectly valid valid approach right so

00:56:33,869 --> 00:56:38,779
getting back to but getting back to the

00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:41,609
original story what actually happened um

00:56:38,779 --> 00:56:43,559
that went pretty much like like you

00:56:41,609 --> 00:56:44,759
could expect we we told the customer

00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:47,640
that we are going to add a lot of

00:56:44,759 --> 00:56:50,819
additional support for for their teams

00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:52,140
and there's a lot of extra overhead for

00:56:50,819 --> 00:56:54,089
this so we actually had a couple of

00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:56,969
agile coach a spare and all sorts of

00:56:54,089 --> 00:56:59,579
things they really really tried hard to

00:56:56,969 --> 00:57:01,999
struggle against going to add sell they

00:56:59,579 --> 00:57:04,319
still tried to run around in circles

00:57:01,999 --> 00:57:06,900
basically when you know when their media

00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:09,089
sales solve something they try to just

00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:11,940
put it you know as the first thing and

00:57:09,089 --> 00:57:14,999
do a new project and and do really like

00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:16,739
unhealthy practices around all sorts of

00:57:14,999 --> 00:57:19,499
things and just design everything

00:57:16,739 --> 00:57:22,920
upfront still so we helped them

00:57:19,499 --> 00:57:24,630
internally say no a lot and and in the

00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:26,789
end what happened is like they started

00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:29,339
succeeding in their projects after after

00:57:26,789 --> 00:57:31,049
about six months after a year they

00:57:29,339 --> 00:57:33,749
started succeeding with other vendors as

00:57:31,049 --> 00:57:36,660
well now it's been four or five years we

00:57:33,749 --> 00:57:39,359
work with them a lot they are one of our

00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:41,069
largest customers today and almost all

00:57:39,359 --> 00:57:43,769
of their digital projects these days are

00:57:41,069 --> 00:57:46,069
successful so it was only a shift of

00:57:43,769 --> 00:57:48,700
mind set on how they how they actually

00:57:46,069 --> 00:57:50,619
you know go about and

00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:53,410
procure projects and how they create

00:57:50,619 --> 00:57:56,500
their their vendors in all this but it

00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:58,930
really took years I took a lot of work

00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:01,270
and most of the credit of courses is to

00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:02,890
them I only take the credit on on

00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:05,020
helping them to get on the right path

00:58:02,890 --> 00:58:07,270
and you know rest of it then was with

00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:09,940
all them so that's where the credit

00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:11,980
should go so that's really all I have

00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:14,260
and I think I'm almost about time as

00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:17,250
well so if we have a last question we

00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:19,420
can we can still take that one and

00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:21,910
there's no more on twitter at the moment

00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:23,140
but if anyone wants to tweet or step up

00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:25,540
the mic i think we've got time for one

00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:31,210
question before the deadline we have 30

00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:33,369
seconds so any any last questions nope

00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:36,460
we can continue on twitter thank you

00:58:33,369 --> 00:58:42,760
everybody or you can come off towards

00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:44,619
here oh and please remember to evaluate

00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:48,030
the session I always forgot about this

00:58:44,619 --> 00:58:48,030
bottom thank you

00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:44,290
