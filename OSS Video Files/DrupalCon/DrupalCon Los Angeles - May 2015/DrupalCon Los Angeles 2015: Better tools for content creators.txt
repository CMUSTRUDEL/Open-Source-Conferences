Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Better tools for content creators
Publication date: 2015-05-13
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	â€‹You may have heard of the Paragraphs module. It allows content creators to place "widgets" of varying kinds on a page in the order they decide. It opens up a lot of possbilities as editors are in the driving seat when it comes to deciding how the page is to constructed. Editors are no longer held hostage to the content layout decisions of site builders which have been solidified in Panelizer or Display Suite layouts. In this presentation site builders will find out how to provide tools to editors to make their Drupal sites come alive.

alright just sort this out hi there

00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:09,450
everyone how is it going great to see

00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:13,679
you all here my name is Marie Woodman

00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:16,680
and the talk today is better tools for

00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,189
content creators paragraphs parallax

00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,020
scrolling and friends first off I'd like

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:24,779
to say it's a great privilege to be able

00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:26,849
to speak to you today it at drupalcon

00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:31,740
and thanks for coming along I know

00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:37,020
there's a lot of sorry the mic the mic

00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:39,660
okay can the people up the back here yes

00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,780
okay sorry about that welcome everyone

00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,129
to our better tools for content creators

00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:47,160
okay so what are we going to see today

00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:49,110
well first off we're going to have a

00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,180
very quick look at the paragraphs module

00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:53,879
and then we're going to go through a

00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,760
bunch of contrib modules that I've been

00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,829
working on with my team and we're

00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,949
basically going to see a suite of tools

00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,500
that augment the paragraphs module which

00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:06,450
allows you to do some cool things

00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:09,299
including you know doing sort of effects

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,000
such as parallax scrolling and another

00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:16,409
number of other sort of JavaScript

00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,040
libraries and things like that I must

00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:22,140
say that the work i'm going to show you

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,229
today is not just my effort it's the

00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,240
result of a lot of hard work put

00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:29,759
together by the team of people i work

00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,729
with as well so that includes Ivan Chloe

00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,680
Delhi ball radium and Peter the eight

00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,229
sort of caen contrib modules we're going

00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,860
to see as a result of a lot of their

00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:42,329
hard work and inspiration as well but as

00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,159
you can see we've put a lot of effort

00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:46,619
into this we we caught the paragraphs

00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,110
bug probably about six months ago or

00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,939
maybe a little bit more and as we

00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,799
started using it we started liking it

00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,619
more and more and basically you know

00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,960
decided to put a number of sort of

00:01:55,619 --> 00:02:01,979
resources into it yet just to see how

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,540
far we could actually take the model as

00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:05,960
we go through the presentation today

00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,599
we're going to have a look at a

00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:12,450
demonstration site that we've built so

00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,740
we built this site basically to show off

00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,600
the contrary modules

00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,430
that we've done but also to you know

00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,790
obviously to show you guys what's

00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:24,840
possible with paragraphs so I'll just

00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:27,900
jump across to that now so this is the

00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:30,780
the the demo site that will be having a

00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,630
look at and I encourage you all just to

00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:36,900
take a look at it in your own sort of

00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:39,930
free time just having a quick look at

00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,430
the home page here we can see that what

00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,740
we have here is sort of like a chump

00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,170
doubt design where you can see you know

00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:49,080
you have these different sections that

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:51,500
are on the homepage and each one of

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,660
these has been implemented as a

00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,430
paragraph so yeah basically the suite of

00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:59,210
tools we've done sort of allows you to

00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:02,070
put together these kinds of designs

00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:03,930
possibly the best way to to give you

00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,030
sort of an immediate understanding of

00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,580
how paragraphs work is just to jump into

00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,070
the the Edit screen here and we can just

00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,700
have a little look at what's going on

00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:16,530
behind the scenes we can see the you

00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,260
know the trusty old sort of body field

00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:21,810
there but then coming down we can see we

00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:26,610
have some other fields for various

00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:29,910
paragraph types so for example here we

00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:31,500
have you know a paragraph here called a

00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,650
Content paragraph type that's a

00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:36,960
paragraph bundle and we have a number of

00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:40,830
different fields where you can configure

00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:44,280
the actual sort of content or data that

00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:46,410
is going into that individual bundle on

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:49,050
this particular site we've implemented a

00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:51,750
number of different bundles I'll just

00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:54,480
come down here so you can see the

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:57,900
different bundles that we've got going

00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,330
here so you know we have our carousels a

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,080
Content paragraph galleries content

00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:06,300
lists that kind of thing so you know one

00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,220
of the sort of benefits of the paragraph

00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,890
module is it's very easy for editors

00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:13,820
just to come along and you know click

00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:16,380
that they you know want to create a

00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:19,320
paragraph and then you know that

00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:22,260
paragraph will open up and then they can

00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,410
edit the details in that paragraph and

00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,360
then save that out so i won't go into

00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,540
that in too much more detail but you

00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,520
know

00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,850
we'll be seeing lots more sort of demos

00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:40,770
of how the paragraphs module actually

00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:42,150
works okay so I actually haven't had

00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,880
anything to do with the actual creation

00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,440
of the the paragraphs module but all the

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,090
other sort of modules will see after

00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:51,360
this point is stuff that we've been

00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:53,700
working on how is how can we best

00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,250
describe what the paragraphs module is I

00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:59,430
think you know possibly that the name of

00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:01,290
it is a little bit misleading basically

00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:05,040
you might want to think of it as like

00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:07,530
chunks of information or possibly

00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,930
widgets or whatever other phrase you

00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:12,540
want to come along come up with but

00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:15,840
basically it allows content creators to

00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,910
place widgets of varying kinds onto the

00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,800
page and they are able to decide the

00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,470
order in which they want those widgets

00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,870
to appear and the really good thing is

00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:27,210
it actually all occurs in the node edit

00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:30,300
form there's no need for them to sort of

00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:32,610
jump out into sort of some panels kind

00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,250
of configuration screen it all happens

00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:37,050
on the node edit form and this is one of

00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:40,230
the main advantages because it gives

00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,760
editors you know a single interface by

00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:48,990
through which they can add their own

00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:51,690
content okay I'm about to take you guys

00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,370
through a number of scenarios a number

00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:55,890
of conversations that we've had with

00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:57,990
clients along the way and you know going

00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:00,750
through some of the requests that they

00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:04,230
have had for us to deliver features for

00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:06,510
them these three designs you see on the

00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:08,100
screen here a pretty typical of you know

00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:11,040
the designs you see on the web these

00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:14,820
days you have designs that go edge to

00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:16,950
edge you have really sort of luscious

00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:19,110
rich looking graphics in the background

00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:21,240
and those graphics also go edge to edge

00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:23,040
and of course you know you have all this

00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:26,190
stuff that's actually been entered by

00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:28,920
content creators it's not some thema

00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:31,290
sort of working in the background sort

00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:34,050
of targeting different elements with CSS

00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:39,030
this is stuff that content creators have

00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:40,830
to do so you can probably see that you

00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,720
know the typical sort of

00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,460
drupal website that may come to your

00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,190
mind is something whether you know you

00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,870
have this sort of content region sort of

00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:51,300
stuck in the middle of the page in its

00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:53,040
own container with sort of blank space

00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,590
on the side and you know there's no

00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:57,240
ability to for editors to control what's

00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,280
going on the site it's all sort of stuck

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,290
in the middle so these kinds of designs

00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,940
really do sort of throw up a challenge

00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:07,650
for you know sort of typical patterns

00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:12,060
you might see on a drupal website okay

00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:14,490
so the first question we were asked you

00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:16,590
know by a client was how can they

00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:19,560
control the ordering and positioning of

00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:21,540
widgets I mean as as we know when we're

00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:23,880
as site builders when we're building out

00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:26,490
of sight we will generally use something

00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:28,560
such as context or panels to place you

00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:31,290
know blocks or other widgets on the page

00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,060
this is a decision that the site builder

00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:35,370
is actually making or the information

00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,620
architect they know what they want to

00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:39,240
achieve they lay it out and then they

00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,000
capture it in features and then it's

00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:44,070
locked away it's not really possible for

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,700
you know content creators to come in and

00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:49,680
easily you know move things around sure

00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,320
you have the the block system which they

00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,000
could probably play with as well you

00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:57,060
know you do have sort of you know panel

00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,460
Iser and in place editing interfaces but

00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,670
nothing that's really happening on the

00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:05,400
the node edit form so paragraphs offers

00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:08,820
a way sort of out of this sort of

00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:12,150
scenario so we just have a quick look

00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:14,010
here at the demo site so I'm calling

00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:18,540
this a normal page what we're looking at

00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:20,520
here we have the sort of a body field

00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:22,560
but we also have a few paragraphs on

00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,870
this page so down the bottom here and

00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,060
gray it's like I'm a classic content

00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:29,370
paragraph that's just a simple paragraph

00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,140
we've put on the page we've also got a

00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:35,580
few different paragraphs over here on

00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:37,890
the on the right hand side so if we just

00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:41,760
go and have a look at the the Edit

00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:43,350
screen here and we'll just have a look

00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,530
at how these paragraphs have been

00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:48,660
implemented they're pretty simple pretty

00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:50,160
simple paragraphs what I've actually

00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:52,170
done with these paragraphs is sort of

00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,040
grouped out the fields it kind of keeps

00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:55,199
things a little bit

00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,899
it sort of simpler for the user

00:08:55,199 --> 00:09:00,089
interface and and keeps things compact

00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:02,790
but we can see that we have you know a

00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:04,980
number of different sort of paragraphs

00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:07,170
here and you know the editor can can

00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,440
just sort of click and move them around

00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:12,060
and change the order as they like so

00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,399
that's that's quite a handy thing for

00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,440
editors to be able to control the

00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,209
positioning of things and so often

00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:20,370
editors do want to just you know place

00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:28,769
things on a page and have them appear as

00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:31,740
they desire okay so another thing the

00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:33,480
editors that a client was asking was

00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,490
these how do we do these edge to edge

00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,339
designs they wanted to be able to

00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:40,079
control the layout from you know the

00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:42,209
full left-hand side of the screen all

00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,009
the way across the right-hand side they

00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:48,870
didn't want their content to be you know

00:09:44,009 --> 00:09:51,810
stuck in the middle so we we solve this

00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:55,470
problem by sort of working on a module

00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:58,680
that we've called edging and edgy allows

00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:02,730
you to basically have different layouts

00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:06,089
that work in harmony when you drop a

00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:08,339
paragraph in so we've just seen a normal

00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:11,190
design with like left and right columns

00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:13,589
here we have what we call an edge to

00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,000
edge design or an edgy design it's

00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:17,459
probably a little bit hard to see

00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,230
unfortunately on the screen here but

00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:23,279
that that grey box you see at the bottom

00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:26,300
is an edge to edge design so what we

00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:29,220
have is we have a panel Iser layout here

00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:32,100
with whether design has been saved says

00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:34,440
this is edgy we could have another sort

00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:36,029
of panels layout where the content is in

00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,160
the middle and the beauty of this sort

00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:40,170
of edgy module that we've built is that

00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,810
that context is understood by the

00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:45,540
paragraph and the paragraph then sort of

00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:49,829
gets its own container and sort of

00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:51,870
understands sort of what context it's in

00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:53,880
so that makes it possible just to drop

00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:56,279
paragraphs in on different kinds of

00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,569
layouts and you the site builder or

00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:00,829
theme it you don't have to worry about

00:10:57,569 --> 00:11:03,480
it it's all been sort of handled for you

00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:05,430
so yeah there we go the the contrary

00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,140
module edgy there just basically allows

00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,360
paragraph

00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,100
to handle their their own container and

00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,730
basically center themselves on the page

00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:16,010
if it's an edge to edge design there's a

00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:17,360
few sort of dependencies in here you've

00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:19,130
got to sort of juggle a few things to

00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,860
get this working but basically if you

00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:24,440
have a look at the the the edgy module

00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:28,070
you'll see that there's a panel layout

00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:31,160
called edgy Boxton acetal style plugin

00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:34,550
as well as some tweaks in pre-process

00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,490
page and some stuff in page temple fit

00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:38,690
if you get all that stuff sorted

00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:40,310
basically all these edgy designs that

00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:45,950
we're going to be seeing now are just

00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:48,290
going to work naturally for you okay so

00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:50,600
the next question is you know how can i

00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,700
change the background colors it was it

00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,740
was fined for the the editors to be able

00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:57,260
to drop the paragraphs in but they also

00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:01,070
then wanted to start controlling the the

00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:03,380
backgrounds on these various paragraphs

00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:06,380
that they were dropping in so you know

00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:08,480
as every good sort of site builder would

00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:13,970
naturally conclude that's probably time

00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:16,130
to drop a class onto onto the the

00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:18,080
paragraph and this functionality didn't

00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:20,390
exist in the paragraphs module out of

00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:22,580
the box so we've just you know put

00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:26,150
basically put a simple sort of class

00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:28,880
that can wrap on to the the div so here

00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:31,940
we see a couple of edgy paragraphs with

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:36,260
sort of classes so the blue one is a

00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:39,290
primary lighter class and the the the

00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:43,160
second paragraph there is is a secondary

00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:46,550
lighter class just having a little look

00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,750
see how we've implemented that so we

00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:51,110
come down we have a look at the

00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:53,030
paragraph in this particular case this

00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,250
stuff is sort of all in the the settings

00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:58,850
thing but we can see we've we've done a

00:12:55,250 --> 00:13:00,980
form alter here and we've just basically

00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:03,800
got a number of classes that we can drop

00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:05,810
on so yeah there's a pretty simple

00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:07,610
functionality but kind of pretty crucial

00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:11,500
and it does allow you to do you know a

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,500
whole lot of you know special things

00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:18,560
okay so if you want to check that one

00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:21,200
out that's the classy paragraphs module

00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:25,660
that will allow you to put glasses on to

00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:28,339
your paragraphs how does that work it's

00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:31,269
it's done with a hook where you

00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:36,560
basically define a list of options it's

00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:38,360
pretty common Drupal pattern so at the

00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,640
moment this module is just doing it

00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,279
through code although we are currently

00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:45,230
looking at providing a UI and allowing

00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,930
you to put different classes on on

00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:51,260
different paragraph types I think that

00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:53,510
will make it a lot more handy but yeah

00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:58,760
this is certainly enough to get you

00:13:53,510 --> 00:14:01,250
started now okay how can I get

00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:04,100
kick-started one of the beauties of

00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:06,769
paragraphs is that they are pluggable

00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:09,200
entities right it's a pluggable sort of

00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:13,190
system that we have once you define that

00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:15,290
field on an on a content type and you're

00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,959
pulling in those paragraphs you can put

00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,990
any kind of paragraph type you like in

00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:22,160
there and this makes it very very easy

00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:25,190
just to you know implement new

00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,160
functionality and to expose that to your

00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:30,860
users so as a way to demonstrate this

00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,990
we've just released a sort of little

00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:35,180
group of modules called paragraphs pack

00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:37,130
that basically you know shows off a few

00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:39,949
of the the things that you can do with

00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:42,260
paragraphs really easily out of the box

00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:44,120
and you know as Drupal site builders

00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:46,100
this stuff is is fairly trivial it's

00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,350
it's basically you know creating a

00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,110
paragraph type and you know just

00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:54,079
basically defining the default sort of

00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:56,240
view mode for it and rendering that out

00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,820
but but nonetheless this is a you know a

00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,490
great way just to show off the kinds of

00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:03,760
things that you can do just hang on a

00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,760
tick

00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:17,369
okay so here's paragraphs pack this is a

00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:20,459
very very simple paragraph this one it's

00:15:17,369 --> 00:15:22,290
the the content paragraph we've kind of

00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:25,619
tricked this out and kind of put a few

00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:29,369
grids into the ckeditor just to sort of

00:15:25,619 --> 00:15:31,739
make it a bit more sort of have a bit

00:15:29,369 --> 00:15:33,779
more utility for the the editors but

00:15:31,739 --> 00:15:36,600
yeah that's a very simple content

00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:38,489
paragraph here's another very simple

00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:42,600
content paragraph using the grids with

00:15:38,489 --> 00:15:46,350
some video this is an interesting one a

00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,299
content list so often when when dealing

00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:50,879
with clients they will say hey I just

00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:53,160
want to put a list of things on the page

00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,019
you know there's no necessarily sort of

00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,559
strong data model that's attached to

00:15:55,019 --> 00:16:00,449
this stuff it's not really a see also or

00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:02,759
or you know a more info or a related

00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:04,559
kind of semantic link it's just like I

00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:06,660
just want to put a few items on the page

00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,489
and have them look good and this is a

00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,879
perfect use case for something such as

00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:15,360
the content list and here we have the

00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:18,149
situation where an editor can just go in

00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,220
and pick out a few different sort of

00:16:18,149 --> 00:16:22,139
entities in this case nodes with an

00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:26,730
entity reference and put them on the

00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:28,980
page the actual paragraph itself allows

00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:31,589
the editor to pick the View mode and

00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:34,589
that will just render out so so long as

00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:37,170
you have the view modes done for each

00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:39,059
one of your content types you know

00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:40,829
you're going to be right all the editor

00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:42,389
has to do is just bang bang bang pick

00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:43,769
the knows that they want and they're

00:16:42,389 --> 00:16:46,589
going to display in a really beautiful

00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:48,569
way and you know once you have this

00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:50,669
basic pattern down you can really open

00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:56,040
up a lot of sort of sort of

00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:59,639
opportunities for editors yeah the

00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:01,439
juicebox gallery this is a really nice

00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,079
gallery that works sort of out of the

00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:06,179
box it's fairly sort of design agnostic

00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:09,120
it works in in most themes so we just

00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:10,829
thought we had done we'd sort of put

00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:14,549
that one in there just to show you you

00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:20,370
know what you can do with it okay so

00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:20,959
that's that's basically the paragraphs

00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:24,260
pack

00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:28,039
and you can check that out there at the

00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:31,940
the paragraphs pack sort of project just

00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:33,590
grab a drink so much talking hey us us

00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:43,549
developers don't usually talk this much

00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:45,320
right okay so when we when we were

00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:48,230
building our paragraphs pack we really

00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:50,059
wanted to be developer friendly so we

00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:52,669
haven't implemented any of this stuff as

00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:54,890
as features so basically when you turn

00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:57,559
these modules on the fields are created

00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:59,750
programmatically and the paragraph

00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:02,450
bundle is just there for you to use and

00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:04,520
you're free to go in and you know edit

00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:07,610
up the you know change the config as you

00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:09,529
like and capture that and features so we

00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:15,260
really wanted to make that as easy as

00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:17,600
possible for you okay this is a cool one

00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:21,049
right the rest of this stuff to this

00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,600
point has been it's been nice but maybe

00:18:21,049 --> 00:18:27,169
not amazing but this is one aspect that

00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:30,260
I'm pretty stoked about how can I filter

00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:32,450
and display items we all know views

00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:34,730
views I don't think any of us would

00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:36,649
argue against is it's probably one of

00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,020
the reasons for Drupal being so

00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:41,690
successful it you know opens up the

00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:47,330
power of you know doing sequel queries

00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:50,090
for site builders but that power is not

00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:52,940
really available to content creators or

00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:56,000
two editors you know if an editor wants

00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:59,049
to get sort of hold of that power maybe

00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,990
they could use you know one of those

00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:05,480
sort of views pains that sort of exposes

00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:07,370
the view where they can you know maybe

00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,770
type in a node ID or something like that

00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:11,690
to filter it but apart from that is

00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:14,600
pretty difficult to expose the power

00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:16,970
reviews to editors so let's think about

00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:19,700
that for a while how can we solve that

00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:21,230
problem with paragraphs well we've seen

00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,870
that paragraphs our field a ball and

00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:25,909
that they can collect information why

00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:28,190
don't we take that paragraph and that

00:19:25,909 --> 00:19:31,010
information that we've collected and tie

00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:33,590
that into a view and then allow editors

00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,799
to basically define what content they're

00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,619
going

00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:40,549
pull back it's pretty powerful this as

00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:44,749
an idea so I'll just just show you a

00:19:40,549 --> 00:19:47,899
quick demo for the cryptically named

00:19:44,749 --> 00:19:51,980
views filter object okay so here we have

00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:56,629
our demo site again and we've got three

00:19:51,980 --> 00:20:00,379
nodes so these are three recent demo

00:19:56,629 --> 00:20:01,879
nodes with a tile display and please

00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:04,009
excuse me for the thank you that just

00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:05,809
doesn't have an image but what we're

00:20:04,009 --> 00:20:08,720
seeing here this is the output of a view

00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:11,809
and this view is it has been filtered by

00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,999
three we want three items coming back we

00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:16,970
want to have demo nodes that's a content

00:20:13,999 --> 00:20:18,980
type and we want to use a special

00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:21,289
display on that view called it's tile

00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,419
display and we have those three results

00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:24,919
coming back and this has been done with

00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:28,009
what I've called our filter paragraph

00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:29,960
but you're free to make any old sort of

00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:31,820
paragraph you like so long as you can

00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:35,919
sort of define the bridge between it and

00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:39,019
views this next paragraph we see is

00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,940
6recent landing pages with stack display

00:20:39,019 --> 00:20:43,429
so we've just got another view mode

00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:46,220
called stack a view with a display

00:20:43,429 --> 00:20:49,629
called stack display and this time we

00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:52,249
want six items back for landing pages

00:20:49,629 --> 00:20:55,369
what we are seeing here is the exact

00:20:52,249 --> 00:20:57,049
same paragraph using the exact same view

00:20:55,369 --> 00:21:03,279
but just collecting different

00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:06,830
information from the editor so we just

00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:10,340
go at it and we'll just have a little

00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:14,480
look it's not really too spectacular the

00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:16,519
edit form here but you can have a look

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:21,919
so this is the node filter this is the

00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:24,350
first one and we can just see here very

00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,899
simple you know the editor comes in they

00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:29,749
select that the demo the type of node

00:21:26,899 --> 00:21:32,210
they want they select the count and

00:21:29,749 --> 00:21:36,320
they'd espect the you know select the

00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:38,869
display behind the scenes there's of

00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:43,039
course an array that is basically

00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:45,859
mapping this paragraph into the view and

00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:47,030
as a site builder if you define that you

00:21:45,859 --> 00:21:49,390
will enable sort of

00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:52,220
stuff just to work magically for editors

00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:55,190
we've we've implemented this kind of

00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:58,760
thing for two clients a media company

00:21:55,190 --> 00:22:00,920
that uses its really heavily and and

00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:03,470
another sort of content site where they

00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:06,320
wanted editors wanted the ability to to

00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:09,890
get different results sets back and they

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:11,900
absolutely loved it and you know this is

00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:14,570
I think a really a massively powerful

00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:16,720
thing that you can do with paragraphs so

00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:19,040
you know one of the clients we've been

00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:22,370
talking to they've got all these crazy

00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:26,450
designs they've got a solar index search

00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:28,010
api in the view and the the information

00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,490
we collect we can collect you know

00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:33,200
queries tags categories you know

00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:35,840
different sort of layouts and all that

00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,000
stuff collect all that get this amazing

00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,640
result set back put it on the page boom

00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,770
so imagine you know content editor

00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,980
writing an article on oh here is an

00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:48,140
article on category accent tag why they

00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:50,900
write their article and here's a you

00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:53,240
know delayed latest 10 items for that

00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:55,070
you know so it's a way for editors to

00:22:53,240 --> 00:23:03,680
really augment the content that they're

00:22:55,070 --> 00:23:06,290
putting on the page so so yes the views

00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,510
filter objects are still a sandbox I've

00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:09,800
still got to get that up as a contrib

00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:12,350
probably needs a little bit more

00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:18,950
documentation but basically the codes

00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:21,470
there and ready to go okay finally we

00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:24,220
get to the the title of the talk right

00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:27,290
can it do parallax or custom backgrounds

00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:29,180
it didn't take us very long to realize

00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:31,250
that once we had this edgy stuff all

00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:33,920
sorted out that we could start doing

00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:35,600
some really cool things with that it's

00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,120
not just putting classes on and you know

00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,390
maybe doing changing the color by class

00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:43,460
but actually we could get dudes parallax

00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:45,530
effects we could do different image

00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:48,500
backgrounds we could choose custom

00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:50,750
colors we could even put video behind it

00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:53,300
right so there's a lot of stuff that you

00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:58,810
can do once you sort of have got these

00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:58,810
edgy sort of paragraphs working so

00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:12,289
yes show you oh man I just always gotta

00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:14,480
control click ctrl click ok alright so

00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:16,850
the entity background module this is the

00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,740
one that does the magic here so I'm just

00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:20,539
going to scroll through here and we can

00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:23,559
just sort of see a little bit of

00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:25,880
parallax action so here we have a

00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:29,030
paragraph this is just an ordinary old

00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:31,789
content paragraph and we've put an image

00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:33,260
on the background of parallax image it's

00:24:31,789 --> 00:24:36,280
a little bit subtle but you can see that

00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:39,409
bicycle is moving at a different speed

00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:41,360
we've got another backgrounds that we've

00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:44,840
implemented just color I know that's

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,929
fairly run-of-the-mill but as very handy

00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:50,450
in some circumstances and we've also got

00:24:47,929 --> 00:24:53,390
an image background happening there as

00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:55,490
well so basically we've come up with a

00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:59,690
pluggable system to put different

00:24:55,490 --> 00:25:05,630
backgrounds on two paragraphs we'll have

00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:07,700
a look at the interface this has been

00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:10,490
implemented by sort of see tools plugins

00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:13,159
and there the the config is actually

00:25:10,490 --> 00:25:16,250
stored on a on a field collection so

00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:19,370
there's a little bit of magic going on

00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:22,549
in the background here just have a look

00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:24,409
at the settings and you can see here

00:25:22,549 --> 00:25:28,309
we've got that this background section

00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:31,130
and we've decided to use a parallax

00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:33,919
background here we could have used image

00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:36,409
or color so it's just a media field

00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:40,100
we've uploaded the image and that's

00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:43,220
basically the way that one works as you

00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:45,409
can probably guess with with the

00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:48,260
background image it's a very similar

00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:50,179
case we've got an image and we've

00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:55,159
uploaded the image with a media field

00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:59,150
and where did that color one go there's

00:25:55,159 --> 00:26:01,220
the color one yep similar thing with

00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:03,590
color so I mean this is a pluggable

00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,640
system if you can invent different sort

00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:10,030
of backgrounds that you want to

00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,030
implement go go ahead so

00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:19,169
ah man that's what I didn't want to

00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:21,510
happen okay what happened to that

00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:24,169
control click oh sorry about this guy's

00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:26,669
so yeah when we were implementing this

00:26:24,169 --> 00:26:30,960
this we didn't want to actually go away

00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:34,350
and sort of build a parallax sort of

00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,390
paragraph we did want to do it in a in a

00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:38,580
pluggable way and that's the beauty of

00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:40,559
this entity background is that you can

00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,929
put any one of these backgrounds on any

00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,820
paragraph that you've defined so it is a

00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:48,510
very flexible way to to basically

00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:50,639
augment the standard paragraph how does

00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:53,730
it work well I just said it was a CTools

00:26:50,639 --> 00:26:55,919
plugin basically yeah you just sort of

00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:58,559
define your plug-in and that plug-in

00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:02,130
receives a selector which is a CSS

00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:03,750
selector and the field collection and as

00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:05,940
I said before the field collection is

00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:08,940
actually containing that background

00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:10,980
configuration in order to get this

00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,990
selective working we had to but we've

00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:14,669
got another little module called I think

00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:17,490
it's like paragraphs ID or something

00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:19,590
like that which injects you know a class

00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:23,580
on to the paragraph just so we can

00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:25,710
target that in the CSS so basically

00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:27,630
these are seat or plugins all they

00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:29,970
really know about is the selector and

00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:31,590
the configuration they're not writing

00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:33,570
any content back onto the page they're

00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:40,080
really just setting JavaScript and CSS

00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:42,539
and targeting in on that selector okay

00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,840
next question can I alter the behavior

00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:48,210
of paragraphs now to be fair no client

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,389
ever really said that it was said

00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:54,200
between me and ivan and i standing

00:27:51,389 --> 00:27:56,190
standing around the whiteboard sort of

00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,100
shooting the breeze on this kind of

00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:00,630
stuff but yeah basically we realize okay

00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:03,000
we've got the paragraphs now let's do

00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:05,100
some you know some you know interesting

00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,139
things and get these paragraphs to do

00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,940
some stuff so basically we just sort of

00:28:07,139 --> 00:28:10,950
took a cruise around the web and try to

00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,010
find some cool JavaScript libraries to

00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:18,750
you know to do some interesting things

00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:20,610
so here we have entity behaviors and

00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:23,730
this is where like the the scroller

00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:25,680
stuff comes in so before I start

00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:28,200
scrolling on this page I'll just say the

00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,540
scroller module is a JavaScript library

00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,180
that takes the position the scroll

00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:35,910
position of a page and basically sort of

00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:38,910
maps that into you know attributes that

00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:41,220
are applied to elements and then then

00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:43,680
sort of various effects take place

00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:48,030
according to the scroll position of the

00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:51,360
page so here we just scrolling down the

00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:52,440
page we have a few paragraphs here you

00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:57,330
can see we're just doing a few simple

00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:59,490
effects doing changing the colors making

00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:02,790
the images appear mucking around with

00:28:59,490 --> 00:29:05,190
sort of alpha channels if I just go

00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:06,990
slowly on this one and see get a nice

00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:09,870
little effect there with an image fading

00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:12,480
in over the other there there is a

00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:14,640
little bit of sort of sort of trickery

00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,170
not trickery but you know there's a few

00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,840
things you've got to do to get this to

00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:21,510
work but basically what we're doing here

00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,520
is opening up you know a lot of

00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:28,500
possibility for editors to be able to

00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:31,020
tell their story in a simple way we've

00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:33,450
got another behavior here height that's

00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:36,390
pretty boring but basically you can set

00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:40,470
the height to four different paragraphs

00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:43,080
for presentational means so yeah there's

00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:46,200
a lot of power that's sort of opened up

00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:48,660
here I can have a look at the the Edit

00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:51,420
interface for this it's very similar to

00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:57,780
the the background one that we've we've

00:29:51,420 --> 00:30:00,300
already seen so we'll come down so let's

00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:02,010
go into the settings for this one this

00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,300
is a pretty hardcore right you'd have to

00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:05,820
you have to really know what you're

00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:07,590
doing if you're using the scroller thing

00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:11,060
but basically you're setting different

00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:14,880
sort of data attributes on the on the

00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:16,710
the paragraph give there and then those

00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:20,220
sort of transitions are taking place

00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:21,420
according to the scroll position so it's

00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,850
probably a whole stack of other stuff

00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:26,130
you can do with these entity behaviors

00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:28,710
as well it's really up to your

00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:34,020
imagination and really what the client

00:30:28,710 --> 00:30:35,790
wants oh yeah so there's a project for

00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,930
that one as well the entity behaviors

00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:39,660
module

00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:42,540
and it works in a very similar way a

00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:46,650
CTools plug-in that takes a selector and

00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:51,360
the the field collection as well to to

00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:54,630
configure it ok how can I provide

00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,850
navigation between paragraphs once once

00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:59,090
we're in this sort of this world of you

00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:01,590
know having these edgy paragraphs and

00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:03,360
you kind of start thinking well this is

00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:06,180
pretty good model for doing single page

00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,370
websites you know like we could possibly

00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:10,550
you know open up a whole sort of world

00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:13,170
of possibilities here where you know

00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:15,420
editor's content creators can just come

00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:17,910
along and add paragraphs as they like

00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:21,180
how are we going to handle the the

00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:22,680
navigation for these guys so you know we

00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:25,560
decided just to make a simple little

00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:30,030
module that will basically create a

00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:33,060
block for the for each each paragraph

00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:35,880
item that's on the page and you know

00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:39,930
this kind of replicates a little bit the

00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:41,040
you know the normal sort of menu or menu

00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:43,110
block kind of thing that you would

00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:46,500
typically do this is basically the way

00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:50,040
you could do it with paragraphs this

00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:52,710
page doesn't actually have a menu want

00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:56,100
it but i'll just show you this

00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:57,810
particular demo page here this is very

00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,790
subtle this this one here but you can

00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:04,950
see over on the right-hand side we've

00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:08,400
got you know sort of the menu this is a

00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:09,930
very simple sort of list element the

00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,030
design for this is basically ripped off

00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:14,580
the apple website we just wanted to sort

00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:16,380
of you know show something similar to

00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:18,140
those lines so the note there's another

00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,460
javascript library called scroll ups

00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:23,220
that's operating in conjunction with

00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:25,230
this just to do this kind of navigation

00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,800
of course you are free to put your own

00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:32,340
CSS into this stuff to get this stuff

00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:33,870
working the way you like but yeah you

00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,520
could also put this block up the top of

00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:38,550
the page as well and have a more

00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:41,550
familiar sort of menu bar kind of thing

00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:43,440
working as well so yeah that's basically

00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:45,960
another little tool we can do there to

00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,059
build out single page websites if you so

00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:53,499
desire

00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:56,950
and that particular module it's still in

00:32:53,499 --> 00:32:59,080
sandbox Radames working on that but yet

00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:02,440
that one's working pretty well at the

00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:04,929
moment okay bringing it all together

00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:08,350
let's let's have a look at this kind of

00:33:04,929 --> 00:33:10,090
stuff and and just a couple of the demo

00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:12,519
pages that we've done just to give you

00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:17,080
guys an idea of some of the stories

00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:20,619
you're able to tell with this toolkit so

00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:22,570
here we are on the demos page this is a

00:33:20,619 --> 00:33:26,169
sort of a demo page put together by

00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:32,200
Chloe just once again it's got the

00:33:26,169 --> 00:33:34,059
carousel there the edgy design with with

00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:37,179
basically that the grids in the WYSIWYG

00:33:34,059 --> 00:33:39,490
and you know just a few other sort of

00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:42,789
content paragraphs here it's a fairly

00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:44,950
simple kind of approach but you know

00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:47,679
this really tells you know I think a

00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:49,059
nice story in a pleasant way you can see

00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,220
this this content is actually like

00:33:49,059 --> 00:33:53,470
chunked out content and if anyone went

00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:55,869
to Jeff Eaton's talk today you probably

00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:57,700
would have heard Jeff talking about the

00:33:55,869 --> 00:34:00,519
narrative and the body field and the

00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:03,429
narrative that exists inside it in and I

00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:05,470
do agree with him paragraphs do kind of

00:34:03,429 --> 00:34:08,200
break up that narrative a little bit but

00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:10,510
if if your content is kind of chun

00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,879
cabool in this kind of way it certainly

00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:17,109
is you know a good way to tell that

00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:19,450
particular story we'll just have a look

00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:21,639
at another demo we've done this one's

00:34:19,450 --> 00:34:24,099
been put together by Peter Peter

00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:27,069
actually went away and did all the

00:34:24,099 --> 00:34:29,319
cooking the photography and put this

00:34:27,069 --> 00:34:32,200
sort of page together so he went above

00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:35,079
and beyond for this one so here we can

00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:39,099
see you know backgrounds edgy sort of

00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:40,419
background stuff there got a little bit

00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:41,859
of parallax thing that I laughed the

00:34:40,419 --> 00:34:44,349
first time I saw that I thought that was

00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:47,099
that was quite sweet all these

00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:51,220
interfaces there this just delighting me

00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:53,950
we got yes just just another sort of

00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:55,690
content one here a little bit of kind of

00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:58,540
scroll or action there look like the

00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:59,850
before and afters that might be you know

00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,160
I'm

00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:04,490
on the screen terribly well but yeah

00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:07,350
that's that's quite a sweet effect and

00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:09,990
you know just a little bit more stuff

00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:12,750
and parallax with a like a negative

00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:14,310
image on there so you know I was really

00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,960
surprised when I saw that I thought yeah

00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:18,450
that's a pretty cool page you know and

00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:20,490
you know that was put together just by

00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,200
you know coming up with a few ideas an

00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:24,660
editor that you what they were doing and

00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,910
just putting it on so you know there was

00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:28,980
no theme are involved in building this

00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:31,020
page the site builder and theme had done

00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,700
the work upfront and then the editor

00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:38,520
just comes along and and drops this

00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:40,380
stuff into them into the page and have a

00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,510
look at the last one this is just a

00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:45,240
little bit going over the top but just

00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:48,060
showing some some crazy sort of scroller

00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:52,710
effects that you can do just mucking

00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:56,310
around with alpha channels doing sort of

00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:58,080
some rudimentary animation there he eats

00:35:56,310 --> 00:36:00,810
all our precious blocks just doing a bit

00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,460
of sort of text sizes there and stuff

00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:04,770
you know so you can play around with

00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,970
that stuff as you like so you know you

00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:07,740
probably don't want to go overboard on

00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:14,160
that but there's just some of the the

00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:15,840
possibilities you've got there so yeah

00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,580
just before I move on from that slide I

00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,680
would really like to emphasize that what

00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,630
we're giving editors here is the ability

00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,060
to tell stories that's that's primarily

00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:25,740
what I wanted to do when we were you

00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:28,440
know setting out with this stuff like I

00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:31,350
really wanted content creators you know

00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,000
artists marketers these kinds of people

00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:35,280
to be able to get a Drupal page and just

00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:37,410
do some cool stuff with it putting up

00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:39,450
you know images and graphics and you

00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:42,980
know really trying to tell a rich story

00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:46,170
to communicate to the to their audience

00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:49,050
all right time for a few reflections

00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:52,530
I've still got still got a bit of time

00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:53,910
to talk about this kind of stuff oh ok

00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:56,070
how can I best tell the story well I

00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:57,870
just spoke about that but I think when

00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:59,280
when we started out on this journey we

00:36:57,870 --> 00:37:01,350
were really trying to solve some

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,910
technical problems on how to achieve you

00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:04,890
know some layouts for various clients

00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:06,360
and you know what we've ended up with is

00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:10,080
it you know a bunch of modules that are

00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:12,510
working together really nicely 22 you

00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,590
know allow editors to tell their story

00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:16,500
to give

00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:19,530
the more freedom and more creativity so

00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:21,780
I think you know Drupal is great at sort

00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:24,270
of data modeling with you know fields

00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:26,700
and entities but a lot of the time you

00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:28,860
know that's that data model is defined

00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:30,630
by an information architect or the site

00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:32,910
builder what we're trying to do here

00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:35,130
with paragraphs is to give editors a few

00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:38,040
tools for them to sort of break out of

00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:40,170
that those confines and to basically put

00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:42,030
stuff on the page as they like where

00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:46,950
they like and hopefully do that in an

00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:49,140
interesting way now of course I do sound

00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:51,620
like a paragraph fanboy I think I'm kind

00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,310
of known for it wherever I go people say

00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:56,070
paragraphs that's all they want to talk

00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:58,080
to to me about but there are some

00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:01,440
downsides and it is worth mentioning

00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:03,870
them this presentation that you're

00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:05,940
seeing today is actually all done as a

00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:09,180
single page website in Drupal with

00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:11,250
paragraphs I kind of wanted to do the

00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:13,800
presentation this way just to basically

00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:16,920
push the envelope and see how far I

00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:19,170
could take it I think the the outcome

00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,300
has been is good you know it looks good

00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:23,640
on screen however I think it's fair to

00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:26,370
say that I did run into a few issues

00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,950
with dealing with paragraphs and I'll

00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:31,110
just go through a couple of those

00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:33,240
firstly the node edit performance can

00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:35,880
suffer when you have a lot of paragraphs

00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:39,270
on a page so for example this particular

00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:42,060
presentation has 30 paragraphs every

00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:45,210
time you add a new paragraph drupal will

00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:47,490
basically do an AJAX call off into

00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:49,950
drupal and that form will be built out

00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:53,190
again these forms are very complex

00:38:49,950 --> 00:38:55,350
things and it takes a lot of CPU to to

00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:58,110
build that form and then to send it back

00:38:55,350 --> 00:39:00,840
to Drupal so basically your server is

00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:02,970
getting hammered at least as far as I

00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,950
can see when these big forms are being

00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:06,810
sent back and I think I've seen people

00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:09,390
you know in issue cues with feel

00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:11,580
collection have similar problems and i

00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:13,440
think it's it's something that's you

00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:15,000
know paragraphs will run into as well so

00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,610
i think if you're dealing with you know

00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:19,980
five six seven paragraphs on a page it's

00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:22,230
not really going to hurt you but if you

00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:24,000
are dealing with a large number then you

00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:26,640
know it's probably not the best thing in

00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,010
the world secondly when

00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,900
that big chunk of data comes back I

00:39:29,010 --> 00:39:33,420
think the client gets hammered as well

00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:36,060
i'm not sure if it was just you know the

00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:38,400
amount of memory or the Dom being

00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:40,770
manipulated or maybe it was all the ck

00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:42,960
editors on the page but basically yeah

00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:44,820
drupal has the the client has a bit of a

00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,380
tough time rendering out these massive

00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:51,840
forms as well also in terms of the

00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,940
editing experience you can see when I've

00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:55,950
been building these sort of paragraph

00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:57,630
bundles out i've been using the field

00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:59,940
group to group them and make them a

00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:02,040
little bit more compact if you don't use

00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:04,470
that kind of approach you will get kind

00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,900
of you know quite big forms going down

00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:09,420
the page that can be difficult to

00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,890
understand where you are or difficult to

00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:12,690
drag around so that's a little

00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:15,420
concession I've had to make to try to

00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:17,100
get that user interface looking sort of

00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,930
nicer but you know at the end of the day

00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,730
I think it's working quite well you can

00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:23,670
still sort of see nicely where you are

00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:25,230
and move those things around there is no

00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:27,180
preview when you're doing this stuff

00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:28,620
there's no sort of graphical sort of

00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:30,570
concept of what you're doing when you're

00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:32,670
dropping this stuff on the page so I

00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:35,690
think you know that panels in place

00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:39,600
editor has a much better experience in

00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:41,400
sort of that kind of realm and finally I

00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,590
do want to say panels is much more

00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:46,770
powerful I think a lot of the stuff

00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:48,540
we're doing here is we're kind of taking

00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:51,780
paragraphs and trying to trick it up to

00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:54,090
do some cool stuff and we have but if

00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:56,670
you go into the panel's world you have

00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:58,730
an insanely you know much larger amount

00:40:56,670 --> 00:41:03,270
of sort of flexibility and power

00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:05,310
available to you now the Pat the panel's

00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:07,280
world I think that's great you know for

00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:09,990
site builders at least that's the way I

00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,210
see it and I think if I was going to

00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:14,460
build this presentation again I probably

00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:17,490
would do it as just one massive panels

00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:19,400
page because you know I'm a site builder

00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:22,200
and I can understand that kind of stuff

00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,030
nonetheless I think that paragraphs

00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:26,210
really does you know have a very

00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:29,400
important place for giving editors that

00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:31,740
flexibility and that power so i would i

00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,050
would just argue that you know different

00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:35,880
different audiences different approaches

00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:38,550
and i think that the paragraphs approach

00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:39,960
is still worthwhile but if you want some

00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:41,460
superpowerful interface

00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:46,170
it's then you know that the panel's

00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:47,960
world would still be preferable Jeff

00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:50,550
eaten gave a really really good

00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,920
presentation this morning and hopefully

00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:55,800
you guys caught it's definitely in the

00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:58,980
the same realm as as what I've been

00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,660
talking about today just been talking

00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,400
about this thing this kind of stuff for

00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:05,040
a number of years you may be aware of

00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,280
like the blobs versus chunks sort of

00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:10,230
conversations that have been going on

00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,960
and Jeff made of a few remarks about

00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:16,170
paragraphs saying that you know they can

00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,580
be good in certain use cases but not so

00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:20,250
great where you want to have that

00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:22,849
narrative going down the body field and

00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:25,800
you know I do agree with him with that

00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:27,540
but I think that yeah paragraphs do

00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,570
perform really well when you're wanting

00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:32,280
to add either chunks of information or

00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:34,500
maybe just you know adding stuff to the

00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,300
bottom of the body field such as you

00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:39,690
know a query or a gallery or or

00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:41,310
something like that as as we've seen so

00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:46,320
yeah I think paragraphs does that still

00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:48,180
have a role to play in this world what

00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,330
I've shown you today has been largely

00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:52,770
presentational it's really been a sort

00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:55,230
of a presentation where I haven't really

00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:58,230
sort of spoken about fields or sort of

00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:59,670
semantic stuff so much and I don't want

00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:01,890
you to think that I'm kind of dissing

00:42:59,670 --> 00:43:04,380
sort of traditional data modeling with

00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:07,290
Drupal that's why I came to Drupal with

00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:09,540
cck and I love sort of fields and that

00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:11,160
structure that you can build so as site

00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:13,080
builders and information architects of

00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:15,780
course i encourage you to steal model

00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:18,410
your data as best you can but just think

00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:20,609
about using paragraphs to augment that

00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:23,280
structures so that you give some power

00:43:20,609 --> 00:43:24,450
back to the editors so you can kind of

00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:26,700
see it as a little bit of a power

00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:28,980
struggle you know you have you know site

00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:30,960
builders defining structure but the

00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:33,960
editors want to do sort of crazy things

00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:37,530
this is a way to allow editors to do

00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:39,450
those crazy things yes so the point here

00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:41,190
content creators have the freedom to

00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:43,109
augment the structures of the

00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:45,270
information architect and I think that's

00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:47,970
a really important point and it does

00:43:45,270 --> 00:43:49,859
give the the client often the power that

00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:52,230
they're looking for also with our

00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:53,520
distributions you know these are famous

00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:55,740
for crystallizing

00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,900
you know data structures em features and

00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:59,990
if you try to you know change anything

00:43:57,900 --> 00:44:02,280
you're going to be getting overrides

00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:04,440
introducing paragraphs into that kind of

00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:07,140
world is a way to really you know sort

00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:09,180
of free up that distro to do some cool

00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:10,770
things in a pluggable way but without

00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:14,810
breaking that sort of underlying

00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:14,810
structure that you've got going on there

00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:20,790
what we've seen today is also a

00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:23,100
combination of approaches so I've shown

00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:24,900
you paragraphs but you've also seen some

00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:27,870
tricked-out WYSIWYG fields where we've

00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:29,340
had the grids we've also had some little

00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:32,130
counters and so you know some other

00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:35,130
special effects that was yet basically

00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:37,290
stuff going on in the in the WYSIWYG so

00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:39,030
it's not just paragraphs that's doing

00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:41,010
this stuff it's it's just sort of you

00:44:39,030 --> 00:44:42,980
know the ckeditor with different sort of

00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:47,130
plugins doing some cool stuff as well I

00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:49,320
would also like to mention atoms and

00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:51,060
unschooled I don't really have that much

00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:54,570
experience or the zero experience with

00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:57,600
it but i can see that allowing people to

00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:59,820
embed entities into the WYSIWYG with

00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,470
something like scold is going to be you

00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:04,020
know a pattern that is going to be very

00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:05,940
powerful in the future and i really see

00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:08,670
kind of paragraphs and scold sort of

00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:10,740
setting you know pretty much the same

00:45:08,670 --> 00:45:13,230
thing feel double entities with

00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:15,300
structure ones living in the WYSIWYG

00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:17,940
ones living outside the WYSIWYG you know

00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:23,310
so i can see these two ideas working in

00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:25,560
in conjunction a lot in the future all

00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:27,750
right well that's um that's pretty much

00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:30,300
the the end of it before I finish up

00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:33,330
though I would say that this

00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:36,200
presentation is available on the web it

00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:39,090
is a Drupal website made with paragraphs

00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:41,340
and I would also encourage you you know

00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:44,250
after the presentation today just to to

00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:46,650
check out this the session I'm rate it

00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:48,060
and leave some comments and some

00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:50,940
feedback for me that would be really

00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:54,240
appreciated and finally there is a buff

00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:56,040
on this stuff on Thursday so if you guys

00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,120
want to you know come along and chat

00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:58,740
about it and talk about the

00:45:57,120 --> 00:46:00,900
possibilities and maybe find out a

00:45:58,740 --> 00:46:02,280
little bit more about what's going on in

00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:04,860
the back end or if you've got a few

00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:07,350
suggestions you know I'd love to to see

00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:09,600
you there and yeah this is a YouTube

00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:12,690
video background that's being

00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:24,420
implemented on on paragraph okay

00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:26,460
everyone thank you very much so this

00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:28,500
sexy little counter you can see when I

00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:32,390
was building this page out a month or so

00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:34,470
it's been counting down all that time so

00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:37,530
it's really been stressing me out

00:46:34,470 --> 00:46:39,450
actually I've over I've only got 12

00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:43,050
minutes to go and you've got 12 minutes

00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:44,700
to ask some questions so please step up

00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:51,390
to the mic there if you'd like to ask

00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:53,490
any questions I add a comment more than

00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:55,050
a question but just like in the most

00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:56,820
recent version of paragraphs I know it

00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:58,680
lets you actually collapse the paragraph

00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:59,880
items which I think will solve some of

00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:03,960
the problems that you are trying to

00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:05,790
solve with the sections within it and it

00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:08,340
actually it gives you a view mode that

00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:10,500
you can define for what the item will

00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:12,330
look like when it's collapsed which is

00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:14,010
pretty cool yeah yeah that's cool yeah i

00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:15,630
knew that was sort of going on but yeah

00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:19,560
i didn't know that that had actually

00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:22,140
landed she's two questions one was about

00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:24,030
a load time do you guys do anything with

00:47:22,140 --> 00:47:27,540
lazy loading or kind of dynamic loading

00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:30,600
with any of the content no but basically

00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:33,540
that stuff is yeah just built you know

00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:34,920
in yeah on the server and served out so

00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:37,080
I mean you probably could add lazy

00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:39,150
loading for the images if you liked but

00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:41,580
yeah we haven't done anything with the

00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:44,280
paragraphs what one of the ideas I've

00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:47,580
kind of been flirting with is is having

00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:50,310
a lazy loaded paragraph that does work

00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:52,230
off state that is stored in the client

00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:54,000
you know so I have been trying to think

00:47:52,230 --> 00:47:56,040
of ways to do personalization or

00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:57,870
something like that based on sort of

00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:00,150
cookie information or something like

00:47:57,870 --> 00:48:02,220
that I've kind of been thinking about it

00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:04,110
but I haven't really come up with a you

00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,940
know a way to do do that but I think

00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:08,400
that could really open up a lot of

00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:10,290
possibilities and the other question is

00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,840
that mobile is how does this stuff react

00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:14,430
on different sized screens yeah so all

00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:17,670
of the stuff you've seen here you know

00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:19,470
is responsive you know it does work on

00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:21,510
mobile stuff but that's that's really

00:48:19,470 --> 00:48:23,010
comes down to totally that the theming

00:48:21,510 --> 00:48:25,020
layer and how you've implemented your

00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:27,059
grids and your theme so you know if

00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:28,559
you've got that stuff sorted with your

00:48:27,059 --> 00:48:30,990
theme and your view modes then you're

00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:33,900
sweet but yeah it doesn't really come

00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:38,819
into the paragraph stuff itself thank

00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:41,280
you cool hi there all right I have a

00:48:38,819 --> 00:48:44,520
question about the Edit interface for

00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:47,309
paragraphs I spent a lot of time about a

00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:50,700
year ago experimenting with paragraphs

00:48:47,309 --> 00:48:52,470
got it all set up and I ran into some of

00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:56,160
the same exact stuff that you described

00:48:52,470 --> 00:49:00,420
in terms of the drawbacks and one of the

00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:03,410
main ones was that once you started

00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:07,140
adding some number of paragraphs the

00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:10,290
edit form page is like you know so tall

00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:13,410
for scrolling purposes and when you want

00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:15,150
to add more paragraphs very often I mean

00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:17,010
depending on how you've got nesting set

00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:18,990
up or whatnot maybe they're showing up

00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:21,150
where you want them to maybe they're not

00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:25,230
you've got the drag-and-drop interface

00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:29,069
and that gets kind of squirrelly so I'm

00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:31,140
curious to know if you've worked on any

00:49:29,069 --> 00:49:33,140
solutions with that been experimenting

00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:35,040
you know you see stuff out there like

00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:36,569
Squarespace or whatever you can just

00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,069
hover over something and click and it

00:49:36,569 --> 00:49:39,540
goes exactly where you want to and I

00:49:38,069 --> 00:49:42,030
thought what if you could do something

00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:43,740
like that with paragraphs and a little

00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:45,240
menu pops up and it's the paragraph that

00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:47,460
you want to add or I know there's all

00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:49,559
kinds of things that one could do so

00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:53,099
have you spent any time working on

00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:55,079
anything like that no we haven't so I

00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:56,970
mean as you've seen we we try to do the

00:49:55,079 --> 00:50:00,270
the field group thing just to keep it

00:49:56,970 --> 00:50:02,609
compact and a former question of their

00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:05,670
met did mention that it's now possible

00:50:02,609 --> 00:50:08,579
to collapse paragraphs and to have a to

00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:10,920
have a view mode showing a preview so I

00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:13,470
mean yeah work was obviously been done

00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:16,020
to to help out with that but I do agree

00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:18,450
if you've got a page with 30 paragraphs

00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:21,030
on it it is unwieldy and it's difficult

00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:22,890
right so you know I think so long as the

00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:26,069
content editors are not going too crazy

00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:28,049
with it it will you know remain hat you

00:50:26,069 --> 00:50:30,240
can handle it but yeah you don't want to

00:50:28,049 --> 00:50:32,980
push it too far I don't think

00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:37,060
good work on all the sub modules man

00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:39,850
looking great man thanks man hey there

00:50:37,060 --> 00:50:41,290
how would you do like api's and things

00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:44,020
with paragraphs would you just put it

00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:45,790
out as a separate item or somehow

00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:48,820
attached to the body field or have you

00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:51,040
have you come across at how our

00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:53,590
paragraphs yet isn't that it can act

00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:55,420
like as the body field for like a

00:50:53,590 --> 00:50:59,860
restful api output or something like

00:50:55,420 --> 00:51:01,750
that or even on an xml feed ah way I

00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:03,880
haven't I haven't looked at any of that

00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:06,310
but you know obviously it's an entity

00:51:03,880 --> 00:51:07,810
you know it's it's honor on a field so

00:51:06,310 --> 00:51:09,220
there is that kind of nested data

00:51:07,810 --> 00:51:11,290
structure there that you would have to

00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:13,390
traverse down if you're going to output

00:51:11,290 --> 00:51:15,280
that stuff so okay so you just have to

00:51:13,390 --> 00:51:18,550
handle it goes as a separate field from

00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:20,380
body yes that's right yeah you got your

00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:23,860
body theory and this is like a separate

00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:28,390
sort of field so oh yeah thanks cool

00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:30,010
mate hi just really appreciate this

00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:31,480
module we actually just develop

00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:33,880
something very similar to this we didn't

00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:36,520
find this control or we develop this so

00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:38,970
this is very exciting interested to know

00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:42,100
if you've integrated entity queue or

00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:43,570
node q into this well I mean

00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,490
interestingly enough i don't think you

00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:47,530
we didn't really feel the need for that

00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:49,450
because if you're using entity reference

00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:52,210
you know on unlimited you can basically

00:51:49,450 --> 00:51:56,100
drag those up and down so that that is

00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:58,750
an effect kind of queuing stuff in a way

00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:01,420
the thing with paragraphs though is it

00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:03,610
is attached to the node like the state

00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:05,890
that you it's like content that belongs

00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:09,730
to that note it's not really content

00:52:05,890 --> 00:52:11,710
that's reusable across different nodes I

00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:13,420
mean you could probably implement and we

00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:16,510
have done this so pulling in beans and

00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:17,920
stuff like that but it really is belongs

00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:20,410
to the node so you're not really getting

00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:23,620
that reuse a node q of course you could

00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:25,030
reuse across the site but yeah if I was

00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:27,280
doing it I would just be hard baking it

00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:29,830
in as a tea reference unlimited on the

00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:32,650
the paragraph yeah our use case was if

00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:34,660
we wanted to have one list that we

00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:37,060
wanted to reuse and be maintained from

00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:38,710
one area that's where that benefit would

00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:40,870
come but yeah that makes sense yeah

00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:42,520
that's right and you know for some of

00:52:40,870 --> 00:52:43,360
those things we could go let's go away

00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,860
and implement that

00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,330
there you go on man this is I'm just

00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:47,980
re-implementing black panels or

00:52:46,330 --> 00:52:50,380
something like that you just you kind of

00:52:47,980 --> 00:52:51,970
you kind of gotta raise a red flag at

00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:53,500
that that kind of thing but yeah I mean

00:52:51,970 --> 00:52:54,910
if you really wanted to do that of

00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:59,440
course you could kind of build that if

00:52:54,910 --> 00:53:03,130
you wanted to yeah hey there thank you

00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:06,310
for the presentation just a one comment

00:53:03,130 --> 00:53:09,790
yeah because colleagues of mine they

00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:12,220
they did a similar approach like it

00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:15,310
works like you would expect from the

00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:19,210
paragraph thing but they build it with

00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:22,270
just the really most used or a lot of

00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:25,720
most use Drupal modules like entity

00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:29,200
reference and and view modes and cuss

00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:32,380
and custom entities and they achieve

00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:34,690
that the same functionality and the nice

00:53:32,380 --> 00:53:36,610
thing about it you know it's not better

00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:39,910
or anything but it might think nice

00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:43,390
thing about it is it's almost Drupal 8

00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:47,440
ready because those entity reference and

00:53:43,390 --> 00:53:51,240
view modes and entities come all on

00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:54,820
board with Drupal and they just had some

00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:57,070
tiny modules to show The View mode

00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:59,620
selection on the only entity reference

00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:02,920
field they call the thing fancy and

00:53:59,620 --> 00:54:05,470
there's a fancy kickstart distribution

00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:08,830
if you want to try it out on simply test

00:54:05,470 --> 00:54:13,360
me or so it's it's kind of nice and it

00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:17,230
opens up for more you know builder

00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:19,510
experience to to that you know because

00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:23,170
it's just plugging together some modules

00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:24,910
and so you have more possibilities if

00:54:23,170 --> 00:54:27,850
you want to do some custom stuff there

00:54:24,910 --> 00:54:29,860
okay so that was the fancy distribution

00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:32,050
yeah fancy kickstart defensive kick

00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:33,850
solution and their stuff fancy something

00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:36,340
but you know you'll find it on

00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:38,050
drupal.org yeah I but I don't really

00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:40,480
think that's an issue for paragraphs

00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:42,040
it's an entity with fields I that should

00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:44,080
upgrade pretty well you know the

00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:45,700
paragraphs module is being prepared for

00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:49,660
Drupal 8 so I don't think you should

00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:52,620
have too many troubles there yeah I was

00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:56,650
wondering if you have any experience or

00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:58,420
with using vuze like it is there

00:54:56,650 --> 00:55:00,640
is it pretty straightforward that you

00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:02,170
can like say filter based on a field

00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,799
that's on a paragraph I could imagine

00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:08,230
that being challenged yeah well so that

00:55:05,799 --> 00:55:10,000
that was that views filter object module

00:55:08,230 --> 00:55:11,950
that I was I was showing you that's kind

00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,839
of the way we've we've tied at infinitum

00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:17,099
I'm the other way around so that you

00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:21,670
wanted to create a view that was

00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:23,559
filtering nodes that based on a node

00:55:21,670 --> 00:55:25,869
that had a paragraph with a certain

00:55:23,559 --> 00:55:27,670
field value yeah right I've never

00:55:25,869 --> 00:55:30,099
actually done that and I would say yeah

00:55:27,670 --> 00:55:32,049
this is a weaker as much weaker data

00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:33,970
model obviously you want to have the

00:55:32,049 --> 00:55:36,849
field on the node that's kind of much

00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:39,400
more reliable than searching through a

00:55:36,849 --> 00:55:41,440
list of paragraphs looking for a certain

00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,660
bundle and then trying to get get that

00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:45,880
value out so yeah if you if you want to

00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:47,440
do queries like that it's probably not

00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:54,819
so great there's a guy over here says

00:55:47,440 --> 00:56:00,010
you can do it you yes yep yeah yeah I'm

00:55:54,819 --> 00:56:02,200
so I'm sure you can't do it but it's and

00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:04,740
in it I was just imagining that since

00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:07,690
each of the paragraphs are different

00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:11,079
entities essentially that it might be

00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:12,609
complicated to get the SQL to match up

00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:16,690
correctly but I guess someone figured it

00:56:12,609 --> 00:56:21,099
out so that's cool cool all right anyone

00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:22,359
else three minutes all right thank you

00:56:21,099 --> 00:56:25,440
so much everyone it's been an absolute

00:56:22,359 --> 00:56:25,440
pleasure thank you

00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:40,700
alright

00:57:07,949 --> 00:57:12,279
so Mike Morris came over to Sydney and

00:57:10,569 --> 00:57:14,349
we we had a chat to hear and we had a

00:57:12,279 --> 00:57:16,569
good yeah we had a beer with him have

00:57:14,349 --> 00:57:18,130
been out and how did we had a buck had a

00:57:16,569 --> 00:57:20,229
barbecue with a few of the other phase

00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:23,019
two guys that was about a year ago but

00:57:20,229 --> 00:57:23,979
yeah yeah we never did any work for you

00:57:23,019 --> 00:57:26,199
but we're kind of talking to Mike about

00:57:23,979 --> 00:57:28,209
a little bit but they never did but uh

00:57:26,199 --> 00:57:30,869
yeah I'll definitely come by and have a

00:57:28,209 --> 00:57:30,869
chat yeah yeah

00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:15,820
already filled in whatever the filter is

00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:19,510
say like you know build another that is

00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:20,890
a little bit sometimes that's what

00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:23,590
effectively the same communities copy

00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:26,470
that yeah my room is that we you know

00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:28,390
well it place because it rather this was

00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:30,970
let's see it's recipes you're saying

00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:35,050
good you know three recipes in this

00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:37,090
paragraph so but she was somebody who's

00:58:35,050 --> 00:58:41,950
managing that they may say oh well

00:58:37,090 --> 00:58:43,720
there's there's this that show but right

00:58:41,950 --> 00:58:51,220
now they'd have to go into a separate

00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:52,960
part of the break with him the paragraph

00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:57,480
thing for that block to just have a fun

00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:57,480
and that's what that

00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:18,270
but you can actually create yeah yeah

00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:20,670
