Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: The Wonderful World of (Web) Typography
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	Typography is the foundation of any website. We are increasingly aware of typography all around us. We avoid or spend less time on sites with hard-to-read text. We have favorite fonts (and will passionately defend them)! No matter your role on a project, having a better understanding of typography will help you to communicate with clarity.

There are more ways than ever to implement custom, beautiful typography on your websites (and beyond). But a new plethora of options can make the selection process even more difficult. This session will teach you the foundations of typography, help you navigate this sea of typographic possibilities, and understand why good type should be your primary focus. We'll also explore ways that typography affects your user experience on the web and beyond.

No past knowledge or experience with typography required.

In this session we'll discuss:

the basics of typography (anatomy, classification, and a morsel of history)
choosing a typeface and how to license it
typography for mobile/responsive
all of the "-ilities": readability/legibility/accessibility/usability
what all of those font file formats actually mean (TTF/OTF/WOFF/etc.)
how type impacts the UX of video games and other interactive media
I've presented talks on "Wireframing Smarter" at the following events: - DrupalCon Austin 2014: https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/wireframing-smarter.html - BADcamp 2014: http://www.slideshare.net/garretvoorhees/wireframing-smarter-badcamp-2014 - BADcamp 2013: http://www.slideshare.net/garretvoorhees/wireframing-smarter-badcamp-2013 I co-presented a talk on "Modern Web Typography in Drupal" with Ken Woodworth and Scott Reynen from Aten Design Group at BADcamp 2011: http://2011.badcamp.net/program/sessions/modern-web-typography-drupal

	00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:07,589
welcome to the wonderful world of

00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:10,349
typography my name is Garrett Voorhees

00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:13,049
and i'm the senior designer and ux

00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:15,900
strategist at chapter 3 we're over in

00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:19,140
San Francisco and we we do our best to

00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:22,350
build good looking websites that read

00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:25,350
well function well etc and I have a lot

00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,150
of stuff to cover for you today all of

00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,400
my slides will be online I've got a link

00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,289
for you so you can snag the PDF at the

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:35,309
end if you're worried about furiously

00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:37,200
scribbling your notes and I'll say kind

00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:39,510
of a lot of what I'm covering today

00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,940
might be things that you already know if

00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,410
you have a background design or

00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,809
typography but I can pretty much

00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:49,770
guarantee they're at least a few things

00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:52,230
you have not seen before and we'll dive

00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:56,789
right in so I think it's important to

00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:59,520
kind of set a baseline like what is

00:00:56,789 --> 00:01:01,739
typography so it's basically any

00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:05,150
arrangement of letter forms but this

00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:08,189
takes the form of books magazines

00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:10,619
packaging wayfinding signage street

00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:13,260
signs that tiny text at the end of a

00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,049
prescription drug commercial but at its

00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:18,810
core it's it's utilitarian type exists

00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:21,509
to communicate a message to you and that

00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:26,159
method of communication can be there

00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:27,540
very simple or very complex and I feel

00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,270
obligated to give you this warning

00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,520
because once you start to go down the

00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,619
typographic rabbit hole your brain will

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,350
forever be changed I like to kind of

00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:39,390
think of it as a chronic disease so

00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,700
everywhere I go I cannot help but

00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:43,500
analyze and pick apart you know oh

00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,689
what's that typeface Oh interesting that

00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,290
they use this with that you will never

00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:52,320
be able to dine at a restaurant without

00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:54,000
deeply scrutinizing their menu so this

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,490
is your last chance you can still like

00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,570
take the blue pill walk out the back

00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:03,210
door yeah so these are a couple shots

00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,909
that I snapped when I was flying through

00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:08,910
SFO just a few days ago to just kind of

00:02:05,909 --> 00:02:11,670
illustrate the ubiquitous nature of

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,610
typography in our world so you see it on

00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:15,930
things like this wayfinding signage

00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:18,540
here we've got a whole bunch of

00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:22,020
different stuff going on various signs a

00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,190
defibrillator restroom a deli and

00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,480
they're all kind of treated differently

00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,760
they're kind of commanding your

00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,930
attention in different ways and these

00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,630
are things that we don't necessarily

00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,030
stop and think about you know we're just

00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:35,340
kind of digesting this information very

00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:39,150
quickly and we keep moving but at some

00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:41,250
point some human intentionally you know

00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:43,560
laid out this stuff and it was designed

00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:47,160
and somebody designed the typeface that

00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:51,030
it is set in you see it on packaging

00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,739
here you know the type is especially

00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,720
designed to kind of grab your eye and

00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:58,940
communicate a certain tone or certain

00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,590
feeling magazines all those medicines

00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,959
this one was kind of interesting to me

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,000
that you have you know this bold

00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,930
statement in all caps in this very

00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,610
traditional serif style so all of that

00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:15,630
kind of communicates different things to

00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:18,150
us so here's a little exercise test for

00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:19,680
you this is going to pan across and just

00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,260
try to kind of keep tracking your head

00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,260
of all of the different typographic

00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,060
styles and treatments that are jammed

00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,670
into this space and this is Times Square

00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:33,239
in New York of course so there are lots

00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:35,640
of signs for Broadway shows restaurants

00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,160
a little bit of street signage if you

00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,920
look really closely see maybe some text

00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:43,739
on people's t-shirts and this is maybe

00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,350
you know the extreme example where every

00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,720
possible surface is covered with some

00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:54,019
sort of messaging much of which is

00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:59,010
typographic so did you count them all

00:03:54,019 --> 00:04:01,680
and designer Nicholas Damien's kind of

00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:03,840
asked this question about Tokyo like

00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,209
what would the streets of Tokyo look

00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,420
like without all of these Logan logos

00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:11,340
and slogans company names etc so he did

00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,590
kind of this interesting series of

00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,540
images where he just photoshopped them

00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:19,440
out and you've probably seen similar

00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:23,160
examples but it's kind of a good

00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,370
reminder of how prevalent all of this

00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,290
stuff is

00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:28,780
so we're going to travel back in time a

00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:32,530
little bit to about a hundred thirteen

00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:34,750
ad in Rome and this is a picture of the

00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:36,880
trajan column which still stands today

00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,370
and you might be familiar with the

00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,770
typeface trajan which is directly based

00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:44,830
on these letter forms and these are

00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:47,620
basically the inspiration for our Roman

00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:50,710
capitals or our uppercase alphabet that

00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:56,229
we see today it's also since been

00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:59,560
reappropriation in the last like 25

00:04:56,229 --> 00:05:01,870
years it just kind of goes on and on and

00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:10,990
sometimes they might tweak the letter

00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:13,030
forms a little bit but if we go a couple

00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,430
centuries later you can start to see how

00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:18,070
handwriting influenced early printing

00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,289
which directly influences the the

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:23,320
typography that we see today so this is

00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:26,260
a Latin Bible handwritten in Belgium in

00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:28,450
1407 and so you know before the

00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,550
invention of the printing press all of

00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:33,389
these books had to be written by hand by

00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:36,460
monks you know tiny dim candle lit rooms

00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:41,139
and it would take them maybe a year to

00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:42,370
write out a complete Bible and this is

00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:45,220
in what we would call like a black

00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:48,910
leather style which has also since been

00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:51,550
reappropriation by everybody from Nazi

00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:54,270
Germany on their propaganda posters you

00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:57,039
see it in kind of classic heavy metal

00:05:54,270 --> 00:06:03,490
hip hop has has used this a lot very

00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:05,650
commonly every newspaper Corona so this

00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:08,590
this typographic style with roots and

00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:10,900
handwriting that dates back a tons of

00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:16,900
centuries is still something that we see

00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:20,530
every day and so a few years later after

00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:25,030
that the Bible that we showed here is a

00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:26,800
page from the Gutenberg Bible 1455 and

00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,960
this is the the first kind of

00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,550
significant work that was printed with

00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,370
movable type meaning that each

00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:35,650
individual letter was a separate piece

00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:38,230
of metal and they got arranged in very

00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:40,930
careful rose and they would typically

00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,910
kind of an entire page at a time print

00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:45,010
off those pages and then reclaim all the

00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:47,320
letters rearrange them do the next page

00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:50,290
and you can imagine that's an extremely

00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:53,890
laborious process but what I want to

00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:57,220
point out here is the this early metal

00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:59,110
type is very very closely imitating the

00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,810
black letter handwriting that we just

00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,190
looked at so at first you know when we

00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,140
were making printed books the thought

00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:07,390
was well we should just emulate exactly

00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:11,170
what we had before and you can see how

00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:13,150
over time it starts to to evolve a

00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:16,510
little bit so a few decades later in

00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:18,910
Italy you start to see books based on

00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:21,280
other calligraphic hands this is cut by

00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:23,920
Nicholas Jensen so if you've heard of

00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,010
the typeface Jensen that is directly

00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:30,070
based on his work and this is from 1474

00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:33,640
and you can see that you know rather

00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:36,640
than the very heavy black letter kind of

00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:38,710
almost all caps appearance the lowercase

00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:41,380
letters are very similar to what we

00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:44,980
would expect to see today from serif

00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:46,960
typography a few centuries later i'm

00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,260
skipping over a lot so you know you can

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,300
go back and fill in the rest yourselves

00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:54,640
we're in the 1800's the Industrial

00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,190
Revolution has enabled mass production

00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,380
and along with mass production you need

00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:01,530
to advertise all those things and so

00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:05,500
advertising created kind of this

00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:07,390
catalyst for experimental typography and

00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:10,690
at this point everything was not

00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:12,010
necessarily metal wood cut type was kind

00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,010
of more than norm for something like

00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:17,110
this and you can see that there's this

00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:19,990
huge diversity of styles this is

00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:23,260
actually a wanted poster for John Wilkes

00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:26,470
Booth who shot Abraham Lincoln and this

00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,970
is from 1865 so as we scroll down again

00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,130
try to count like the number of

00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:32,680
different styles that are present here

00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:34,930
it gets pretty crazy you know if you

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,479
were to see a poster like this today you

00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:43,300
would think whoa like back off don't use

00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:45,670
so many fonts and so things like like

00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:47,870
our sans serif typography didn't really

00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,960
emerge until this era and we'll get in

00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:52,670
a little more and if you've never

00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,910
experienced or witnessed the the magic

00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:59,930
of letterpress this is kind of the the

00:08:55,910 --> 00:09:02,060
process you have cases of type with

00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:04,400
little compartments for each individual

00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:07,250
letter and that's actually where we get

00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,680
the name for upper and lower case the

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:12,620
capital letters would be arranged in the

00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,750
upper case and the lowercase letters

00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,640
would be in the lower case so you have

00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:20,180
to pull out each individual letter and

00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,950
arrange them one line at a time and to

00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:24,770
set the space between the letters you

00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:25,790
insert literal pieces of lead and you

00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:28,100
know the thickness of the lead

00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:31,550
determines how far apart those lines are

00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:33,890
spaced so today that line spacing is

00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:36,260
also known as letting which literally

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:40,310
refers to the pieces of lead that were

00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:41,800
placed in between those lines so then

00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:45,140
you kind of have your whole lock up

00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:48,380
after you have your lines composed you

00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:50,029
lay it in here ink the the metal and run

00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,250
a piece of paper through and it

00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:53,779
transfers the ink beautifully the other

00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:56,000
thing I didn't point out is you have to

00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:58,430
do it all backwards all of the words

00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,220
have to be set backwards so that when it

00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:06,529
prints it reverses and creates a regular

00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:09,140
image somewhere between letterpress and

00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:11,510
kind of like typewriters and computers

00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,670
and digital type were things like this

00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:17,000
line of type machine this is from the

00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:19,730
early 1900's where you would be typing

00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,130
on a typewriter like keyboard doing one

00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:24,380
line at a time and the machine would do

00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:26,510
kind of the work for you of pulling the

00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,040
letters that you need so it would kind

00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:30,470
of arrange the line you can pull that

00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:34,160
off and like set it up type out your

00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:36,410
next line and so this is still laborious

00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,529
you know compared to today's standards

00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:44,810
where you can pop open any word

00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:47,839
processing application but still hugely

00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:53,660
faster than having to pick it all out by

00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:57,680
hand so it along with all of this I

00:10:53,660 --> 00:11:00,610
think it's important to remember the the

00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,610
importance of handwriting

00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,410
and what's been interesting to me is

00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:08,870
instagram has become kind of this new

00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:11,410
platform as a great place for lettering

00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:14,990
artists calligraphers etc to kind of

00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:18,100
keep this spirit alive so this is work

00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:22,220
from seb lester and it's not loading

00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:24,230
there it goes so you can look him up on

00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,540
Instagram and he will do you know the

00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:28,459
little 15 second time lapses of him

00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:30,440
writing out all of these words and

00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:32,120
beautiful different hands so here's a

00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:36,339
black leather style again he's adding a

00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,750
lot of flourishes embellishment to it

00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:41,360
but again this kind of centuries-old

00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:45,500
practice is still very much alive today

00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:49,100
kind of in different forms here's a nice

00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:51,320
one he makes it look just perfectly

00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,300
effortless but I can guarantee you you

00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,279
know there's a lot of subtlety going on

00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,519
in the the amount of pressure and

00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:04,910
release required to create those fine

00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:07,760
letter forms so you're probably familiar

00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:10,670
with serif and sans serif as kind of our

00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:12,440
major classifications I think it's

00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,060
important to kind of have a general

00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,880
understanding of what those sub

00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:19,670
classifications look like and this more

00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,820
or less goes chronologically so you have

00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:25,220
old style which emerged in kind of the

00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:28,279
mid-1400s around printing press era and

00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:30,170
this is like that jansen text that we

00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:36,110
looked at this happens to be a typeface

00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:38,510
called sub own and this looks pretty

00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:40,610
normal it's fairly low contrast and what

00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,200
I mean by that is the the thinnest part

00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,560
of the letter form and the thickest part

00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:48,949
of the letter form are not too far apart

00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:52,430
if we go again a couple centuries later

00:12:48,949 --> 00:12:53,870
mid 1700s we have transitional type so

00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:55,760
at this point we've been doing this for

00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:58,430
a while we have finer tools people are

00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,769
more experienced and so you have higher

00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:03,050
contrast so again the thinnest parts of

00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:04,279
the letter forms are thinner and the

00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:07,610
thicker parts are probably about the

00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:09,560
same but if you can imagine you know you

00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:11,810
have to carve this metal type at the

00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,160
actual size so if you have you know nine

00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:15,329
point

00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,519
lower case letters you have to be

00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:22,369
carving all of those details very

00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:25,799
precisely and the even more extreme

00:13:22,369 --> 00:13:28,859
progression here is modern style late

00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:32,069
1700s and this is very high contrast the

00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:34,829
seraphs tend to be extremely flat and

00:13:32,069 --> 00:13:37,999
this is still used a lot for high

00:13:34,829 --> 00:13:41,009
fashion perfume ads etc it kind of has

00:13:37,999 --> 00:13:44,209
some connotation of being a little

00:13:41,009 --> 00:13:47,779
fancier and then the Egyptian or slab

00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:50,249
styles were the kind of exotic weird

00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:53,100
stuff that was happening in the the mid

00:13:50,249 --> 00:13:55,679
1800s these tend to be really chunky

00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,419
rectangular seraphs and they were called

00:13:55,679 --> 00:14:00,179
Egyptian because that was like the most

00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:02,399
exotic thing you could conceive of you

00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:06,209
know back in the 1800's this far away

00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,859
mystical land of Egypt and then in the

00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:10,169
the San serif realm again here we're

00:14:07,859 --> 00:14:13,230
starting at kind of the mid 1800s and

00:14:10,169 --> 00:14:17,059
going forward we started with grotesque

00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:20,189
which is not not to mean hideous but

00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:22,559
these often originated in that that same

00:14:20,189 --> 00:14:25,350
era they were kind of all caps initially

00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:27,569
before we were still figuring out what

00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,610
sans-serif lowercase letters look like

00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:33,600
which seems like a strange thing they

00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:35,489
seem so obvious to us now neo grotesque

00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,779
is just kind of an evolution of that

00:14:35,489 --> 00:14:42,259
came out in around the 1950s so this was

00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:46,079
Swiss modern design kind of pushing

00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:50,119
refinement of those letter forms into

00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,119
you know the ultimate Helvetica here

00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:57,689
geometrics also emerged in kind of the

00:14:54,059 --> 00:15:00,299
around the 1930s 1920s especially in the

00:14:57,689 --> 00:15:03,119
Bauhaus movement in Germany and the idea

00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:05,429
was that the kind of beauty of geometric

00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:07,350
forms you know should should be

00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:09,959
translated into our letter forms and

00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:11,879
this is nothing new but they kind of

00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:14,869
formalized it in a lot of ways so here's

00:15:11,879 --> 00:15:17,879
the lovely future and then humanists

00:15:14,869 --> 00:15:20,309
sans serifs also emerged around that

00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:22,739
early 1900s and these are based more on

00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:25,319
kind of early calligraphic forms but

00:15:22,739 --> 00:15:27,120
just a little bit simplified so here

00:15:25,319 --> 00:15:28,980
this gives you a pretty good overview

00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,610
and I think this shows you that

00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,420
progression of contrast from old-style

00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:35,730
transitional and then modern that

00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,560
contrast gets higher and higher and then

00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,940
when you get two slabs they kind of go a

00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,040
little wacky you can see how they're

00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:45,450
they're more similar to the San syrups

00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:47,130
and a lot of ways and it's also

00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:49,080
important to know just some basic

00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:51,900
anatomy will breeze through this a lot

00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:54,150
of this is very common sense and a lot

00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:56,670
of the anatomy of letter forms is based

00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:58,890
on kind of human anatomy we like to

00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:02,370
project ourselves onto to everything we

00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:06,890
possibly can so the the vertical part of

00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:11,430
a letter is the stem curves are bowls

00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:14,520
any kind of contained center space is a

00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:18,630
counter if it reaches something like on

00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:21,420
a lowercase R as well that's an arm you

00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:23,310
already know about the serif and when

00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,790
you have the ends of letter forms like

00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:28,770
you know the end of a C on either side

00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:31,500
those are the terminals and then even

00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:39,420
though this is not truly enclosed we

00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:42,720
also refer to these as a counter so the

00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:45,750
the line that your text rests on is your

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:49,040
baseline and the height of the capital

00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:54,000
letters is appropriately your cap height

00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:58,350
you have a senders and descenders syrups

00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,180
again and then the line that's kind of

00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:04,260
the height of your lower case letters is

00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:06,179
your mean line and then that literal

00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:09,689
height that distance which is typically

00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:13,829
the height of an lowercase X is called

00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:16,110
your ex aight very straightforward but

00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:18,000
it's it's good to have a general

00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:20,339
knowledge of some of this terminology if

00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:24,600
you if you're conversing with other

00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:26,839
fellow type chronic type sufferers like

00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,839
myself

00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:32,779
the other word that gets thrown around

00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:34,879
all the time is font everybody loves the

00:17:32,779 --> 00:17:37,279
word font admittedly it's much easier to

00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:39,109
say than type face and I've stopped

00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:43,489
correcting people because I feel like a

00:17:39,109 --> 00:17:46,009
jerk but the typeface is actually kind

00:17:43,489 --> 00:17:48,369
of the the artistic concept of that

00:17:46,009 --> 00:17:52,700
whole family so if you're referring to

00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:55,070
Helvetica as a concept as a design that

00:17:52,700 --> 00:18:00,259
is the typeface and then all of those

00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:02,090
styles that make up the family are the

00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:06,139
family and then the the individual style

00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:10,039
is actually the font so do do with that

00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:11,509
what do what you will but you know it

00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:13,519
doesn't help that it's called you know

00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:15,830
that it's the font menu in a lot of

00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:19,249
applications and it just kind of

00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:21,769
perpetuates itself you might have

00:18:19,249 --> 00:18:25,509
wondered 12 point what does that

00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:28,759
actually mean so to measure point size

00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:30,649
it's the distance from your descenders

00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:33,619
the bottom of your descenders to the top

00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:35,749
of your ace enders so if you say you

00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:37,970
know if you have your your traditional

00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:39,649
school assignment set in 12-point text

00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:41,570
you probably know there are ways you can

00:18:39,649 --> 00:18:44,149
game the system a little bit by choosing

00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:47,840
a different typeface that is optically

00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:49,850
larger or smaller so in this case all of

00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,190
these words are set at the same point

00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:54,649
size but they have different X Heights

00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:59,289
which creates you know very huge

00:18:54,649 --> 00:18:59,289
differences in their optical largeness

00:19:01,389 --> 00:19:06,470
and as we were talking about letting or

00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:08,869
line spacing is simply the the distance

00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:13,159
from one baseline to the next base line

00:19:08,869 --> 00:19:15,590
and if you're thinking in CSS terms this

00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:18,320
is line height and I don't know why you

00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:21,230
know we can't find a standardized term

00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,970
for this but that's okay so if you put

00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:28,519
it all together you've got your point

00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:29,929
size and then you're letting and in in

00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:32,269
at least the print world I don't hear

00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:34,580
this so much anymore you would refer to

00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:39,529
this as 12 on 15 or you can express it

00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:40,260
as 12 / 15 so that that's really like

00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:42,840
skimming

00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,880
surface but if you are looking to kind

00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,070
of dive a little bit deeper these are a

00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:49,440
few books that I would wholeheartedly

00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:52,470
recommend to anybody they're all very

00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,940
approachable in fact the laws of

00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:59,040
simplicity is not so much about

00:19:53,940 --> 00:20:01,350
typography as it is theories of design

00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:03,480
that are very relevant to everybody and

00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:05,370
the bottom right the elements of

00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,080
typographic style is really more of a

00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,490
reference book so if you think that

00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,070
you're going to be working with type

00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,630
more especially in a print capacity

00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:15,210
that's a really good book to have just

00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:17,280
sitting on your shelf handy if you're

00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:19,560
looking to just kind of go a little bit

00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,870
deeper I think the bottom left two

00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:24,390
options stop stealing sheep and thinking

00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,710
with type are probably the ones you

00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:30,090
would want to pick up first I'm sure

00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:31,740
your local library has a copy so you

00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:33,800
guys are experts now so we're gonna

00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:36,960
we're going to quiz you in a minute but

00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:39,570
you've probably heard some nasty rumors

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,240
about Ariel over the years how it's a

00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:43,800
blatant ripoff of helvetica and the the

00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,170
two second story is that Microsoft

00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:49,440
wanted Helvetica but didn't want to pay

00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:52,380
for it so they commissioned some folks

00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,720
to to basically copy the design keep the

00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:56,640
widths of all the letters identical so

00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,930
that if you were to swap them out you

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,090
know it's not going to change your page

00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:02,190
length and stuff but change the design

00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:04,890
just enough so that you know they could

00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:08,100
avoid a lawsuit so I'm going to teach

00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:10,320
you some of the secrets so you can spot

00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:14,040
the difference in the wild this is a

00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,450
great party trick people love it the

00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:19,440
biggest difference you'll notice is

00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:21,360
Helvetica tends to terminate parallel to

00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,610
the baseline whenever possible and this

00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,520
speaks to kind of that Swiss modern

00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:28,650
design whereas on Ariel a lot of the

00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,720
terminals will be angled a little bit

00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:33,390
and it can be subtle depending on the

00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,770
printed size but you see this throughout

00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:37,260
the entire design they're very

00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:40,890
consistent so the same thing on the

00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:43,370
lowercase R it's just a little bit of an

00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,370
angle to it

00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:49,620
the tea is a better give away you can

00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:52,500
see that the top terminal has a pretty

00:21:49,620 --> 00:22:02,610
dramatic angle and the bottom one does

00:21:52,500 --> 00:22:05,190
too same thing on the s and the cap bar

00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:07,380
is interesting the capital are in aerial

00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:10,110
is one of my least favorite characters

00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:12,720
ever it's a it's like they took this

00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:14,700
beautiful strong kind of bold form from

00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,060
Helvetica and just turned it into like a

00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:20,820
limp noodle so this one is a dead

00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:24,930
giveaway if you see that bold are then

00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:27,060
you know it's Helvetica same thing on

00:22:24,930 --> 00:22:30,630
the G Helvetica has this kind of strong

00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:36,000
spur at the bottom whereas Ariel they

00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:37,680
just kind of rounded it off and the Q is

00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,340
another interesting one l vatika once

00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:45,050
again bold strong straight line Ariel

00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:45,050
has like a little bit of a wave to it

00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:53,040
but sometimes it's a little more subtle

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:55,740
like at a glance you might not be able

00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:57,530
to tell the difference here and in fact

00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:00,810
if you draw some lines you can see that

00:22:57,530 --> 00:23:03,120
Helvetica is just a little bit lower or

00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:05,580
wasted like they they basically shifted

00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,790
some of those points up a bit in the

00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:11,550
aerial design so in context it's almost

00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:13,680
impossible to really tell so I'm going

00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:16,380
to test you guys just shout it out

00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:20,550
anybody which one is Helvetica top or

00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:28,580
bottom top no question that a is a dead

00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:28,580
giveaway top or bottom top top or bottom

00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:38,250
topper bah yep how about this one I

00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:47,200
honestly I don't think i could tell you

00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:49,630
these are some shapes that are like all

00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,550
really really identical it's actually

00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:59,710
the top in this case but you had like a

00:23:51,550 --> 00:24:03,250
50-50 shot so congratulations so last I

00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:06,220
heard I don't have a source for this but

00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:08,830
there are over 300,000 and the number

00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:11,440
changes constantly over 300,000

00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:14,830
different typefaces available in our

00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,920
world today which is kind of a lot so

00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:20,320
how do you figure out like what what the

00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,760
hell to choose this is basically the

00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,230
face that I make for a couple hours

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,470
while I'm like going through this

00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:28,390
process but there are kind of a number

00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:30,580
of basic questions that i can ask myself

00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:33,190
and the the context of you know what i'm

00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:35,590
working on can often help me kind of

00:24:33,190 --> 00:24:37,540
narrow things down so one of the big

00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,920
questions and i like if you just saw

00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:42,360
this slide out of context you might

00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:42,360
think you're at a different conference

00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:49,720
so you might think like do i need a

00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:51,730
large family am i going to be using this

00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,310
only for headlines do i need this to

00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:55,930
serve as my body copy and you know for

00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:57,910
subheads and sidebars and this and that

00:24:55,930 --> 00:25:01,330
so I want bold weights and light weights

00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:04,540
and all that stuff will it be used for

00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:06,100
print that would kind of decide what

00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:08,800
sort of Licensing approach I would take

00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,810
if if I knew that I wanted a design that

00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,210
could complement both the website and

00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:15,430
print materials I wouldn't necessarily

00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:16,810
choose something from google fonts for

00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,340
example although some of them may

00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:21,910
perform decently in print they're not

00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:24,430
necessarily designed for it how will it

00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:26,910
display cross-platform if you're dealing

00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:29,890
with you know your user base is

00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:32,140
primarily on Windows you want to make

00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:34,000
sure that your text is going to be

00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,460
pretty well optimized for it a lot of

00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,920
times it'll end up unnecessarily crunchy

00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:41,140
and it can look look bad and we've dealt

00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,940
with this many times with clients where

00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,580
we launch the site we think it all looks

00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,740
great and then they come

00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,120
back to us saying like it looks terrible

00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:51,299
on our computers you know you've got to

00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:53,580
fix this does it convey the right tone

00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:55,080
so as we talked about a little bit you

00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:57,029
know every typeface kind of has a

00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,529
different personality and the way that

00:25:57,029 --> 00:26:01,289
you're using it can influence it a lot

00:25:58,529 --> 00:26:03,630
but a lot of times you can kind of look

00:26:01,289 --> 00:26:05,870
at something and just feel it in your

00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:08,279
gut you know whether it's it's

00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:11,429
appropriate for that client in that

00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:13,590
project again what sort of content would

00:26:11,429 --> 00:26:15,840
it be used for so if it's going to be a

00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:18,510
lot of long-form text you don't want

00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,090
something with a really tiny x height or

00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:24,389
like high contrast letter forms for

00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:26,130
example what style of numerals if you're

00:26:24,389 --> 00:26:29,940
going to be using it for like tabular

00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:31,889
data you probably don't want old-style

00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:34,860
numerals which we'll talk about a little

00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:36,269
later but they look more like lowercase

00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,159
letters where they're kind of variable

00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:41,100
heights and widths and that can be

00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,860
tricky when you need tables of data to

00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:45,690
be aligning with each other and do I

00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,090
need to support non-latin characters if

00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,789
you need you know Cyrillic support or

00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:52,889
Asian language support that can be a

00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:54,630
real challenge so one of the the

00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:57,059
benefits of Ariel is that it's on

00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:59,760
basically every computer and it has an

00:26:57,059 --> 00:27:02,490
insanely huge character set which

00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,289
includes Chinese and Japanese and all of

00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:08,100
these other languages so that's

00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:09,659
definitely a consideration and the other

00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,389
thing I'd like to do is start setting

00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:14,880
the word to like to feel it out so this

00:27:12,389 --> 00:27:17,220
this is kind of a silly nonsensical word

00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,850
that's often used to evaluate a typeface

00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:22,710
but it kind of has enough variation and

00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:25,380
like enough representation from the

00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:30,419
alphabet that it can be useful to just

00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:33,120
start to get a feel for it more commonly

00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:35,250
you probably set it in like a pan Graham

00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:38,820
so here's the classic quick brown fox

00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:41,070
jumps over the lazy dog but all these

00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:43,409
are our phrases that include every

00:27:41,070 --> 00:27:46,440
letter of our alphabet so that you can

00:27:43,409 --> 00:27:48,450
kind of see how it's all behaving i will

00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:50,519
say wikipedia used to have an awesome

00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,289
article that collected like all of these

00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:55,080
pan grams and they took it down not too

00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:57,690
long ago but this lovely person at Klag

00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:03,570
netcom has preserved them

00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:08,519
for us which is handy I think this might

00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:16,019
be my favorite one yeah and you can you

00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:18,559
could make your own too why not so again

00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:22,289
type has a strong effect on our

00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:27,000
perception this is a menu from Denny's

00:28:22,289 --> 00:28:28,919
the famous restaurant chain and you can

00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,590
see they're using kind of friendly San

00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:35,610
serif typography lots of color and lots

00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:38,490
of photography so if you were you went

00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:40,620
to you know whatever country somewhere

00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:42,720
in the world and you sat down and their

00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:44,730
menu looked like this you would have a

00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,740
certain expectation for kind of what the

00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:49,049
food is going to be like what your

00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:50,639
overall experience will be you know it

00:28:49,049 --> 00:28:51,870
might be comforting that you you see the

00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:54,539
pictures you kind of know what you're

00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:57,389
going to get and then imagine if you you

00:28:54,539 --> 00:29:00,059
walk into a Denny's and their menu looks

00:28:57,389 --> 00:29:01,529
like this you'd think you're on like

00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:03,779
candid camera or something like

00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:06,919
somebody's messing with you and this is

00:29:03,779 --> 00:29:08,789
communicating a wildly different tone

00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:10,529
you know these things don't even have

00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:12,929
dollar signs next to them like it's

00:29:10,529 --> 00:29:15,629
obviously pretty fancy there's even like

00:29:12,929 --> 00:29:17,250
today's date at the top of the menu but

00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:19,799
these things all kind of clue us in on

00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:22,529
the the experience or whoever designed

00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:26,000
this menu is trying to you know convey a

00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:26,000
certain feeling for you

00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:34,210
so you know which one would you prefer

00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:37,090
to dine at and it probably depends on

00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:38,980
your mood where you are how much cash is

00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:42,340
in your wallet you know there are a lot

00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:45,070
of factors when I'm working with clients

00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:47,740
this kind of translates to a mood

00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:49,600
boarding process so what I often do and

00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:52,650
these are examples from a client we

00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:55,420
worked with I will take some basic

00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:58,590
elements header Styles a little bit of

00:29:55,420 --> 00:30:01,780
body text maybe a couple UI elements and

00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:03,700
create a pretty simple lock up here so

00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:06,040
this gives me an overview of like the

00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:08,230
tone and then i'll i'll kind of iterate

00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:10,930
and do a couple variations using

00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:13,570
different typeface combinations and this

00:30:10,930 --> 00:30:15,430
is a good way to kind of get your

00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:17,920
clients involved and getting some

00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:19,600
reactions so they were able to look at

00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,140
this and you know they naturally kind of

00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:24,580
gravitate towards one option or another

00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:26,140
and sometimes it's a combination of

00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,120
options that ends up kind of going

00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:30,340
forward but the important thing here is

00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:34,000
that you're not investing a lot of time

00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:35,110
in in like designing it at this point

00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
you're thinking about you know the

00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:39,460
overall tone and kind of the system that

00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:43,920
you'll be creating so here you can see

00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:43,920
you know these three header styles

00:30:49,779 --> 00:30:55,330
and I will say that the second two are

00:30:52,629 --> 00:30:57,489
really really similar and the reason i

00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:59,320
included Gotham and proxima nova was to

00:30:57,489 --> 00:31:00,879
kind of start talking to them about font

00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:03,249
licensing because they're available

00:31:00,879 --> 00:31:06,309
through different services and we'll

00:31:03,249 --> 00:31:07,960
we'll get into that or so what happens

00:31:06,309 --> 00:31:10,359
if you you're browsing the web and you

00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:13,450
see you know some beautiful typeface in

00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:15,279
the wild if you're savvy you can kind of

00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:17,200
inspect element and like pick apart the

00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:20,019
CSS a little bit and try to find the

00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,359
family name but I recently discovered

00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:24,639
this tool which is super handy font face

00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:27,009
ninja they have a chrome safari and

00:31:24,639 --> 00:31:30,129
bookmarklet chrome and safari extensions

00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:32,349
and you can basically hover over any

00:31:30,129 --> 00:31:34,779
text on any site and it will tell you

00:31:32,349 --> 00:31:37,690
what the family is what size it set at

00:31:34,779 --> 00:31:40,960
the letting etc and if you click on that

00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:42,369
text it then gives you a little space at

00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,070
the top of the window where you can type

00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:49,210
in a few words in that typeface and kind

00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:52,089
of test it out which is really handy and

00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:54,219
also most web font providers will offer

00:31:52,089 --> 00:31:57,669
you some way to kind of test things out

00:31:54,219 --> 00:32:00,489
you can type a few words hello drupalcon

00:31:57,669 --> 00:32:02,379
and you know this this can give you a

00:32:00,489 --> 00:32:04,299
decent sense of it but a lot of times

00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:08,169
you really have to like get your hands

00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:11,889
on it to figure out whether it's going

00:32:08,169 --> 00:32:14,139
to work for you or when you see type in

00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:17,049
the wild and by the wild I mean not on

00:32:14,139 --> 00:32:18,609
the web and you can't identify it this

00:32:17,049 --> 00:32:21,099
is also a great site if you're not

00:32:18,609 --> 00:32:22,809
familiar you can upload a photo of your

00:32:21,099 --> 00:32:24,940
text you should probably crop it down to

00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:30,460
like a couple words and it does its best

00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:32,379
to approximate you know what typeface it

00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:34,839
is or similar typefaces that you might

00:32:32,379 --> 00:32:37,210
want to consider but if you do want to

00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:39,580
just try things out online this is

00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:42,849
another good option everything on Google

00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:44,259
Fonts is available on here for free and

00:32:42,849 --> 00:32:46,899
they have some paid models that include

00:32:44,259 --> 00:32:50,649
libraries from other font foundries but

00:32:46,899 --> 00:32:52,089
this gives you kind of some basic page

00:32:50,649 --> 00:32:53,559
elements that you can then modify you

00:32:52,089 --> 00:32:57,549
can change like the background color

00:32:53,559 --> 00:33:00,849
size spacing all that kind of basic CSS

00:32:57,549 --> 00:33:02,980
parameters and it's a good way to to

00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:05,650
feel like how that the text will

00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:09,280
function in more of like a long-form

00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:11,620
context also if if you have like a

00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,660
Creative Cloud subscription and use type

00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:16,210
kit you can access type kits full

00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:18,490
library in Photoshop but if you're not

00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:27,010
using Photoshop like I happen to use

00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:29,290
sketch it doesn't really help so if

00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:30,940
you've ever tried to license fonts for

00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:33,130
print or the web it can be a little bit

00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:36,070
of a nightmare it used to be a lot worse

00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:39,250
when certain font formats were only mac

00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:42,309
or pc compatibl so we're past kind of a

00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:43,540
lot of those bumps in the road but these

00:33:42,309 --> 00:33:45,850
days we get to deal with you know

00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:48,250
different browsers and supporting all of

00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:50,890
them I'm going to breeze through a

00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:54,580
little more history for you here prior

00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:56,020
to digital type type was was more or

00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:59,640
less a physical thing it was you know

00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:03,809
pieces of metal or wood or what have you

00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:07,870
and postscript which came out in 1984

00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:10,750
like a long time ago it was developed by

00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:13,379
Adobe and basically expresses these

00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:16,119
letter forms as mathematical equations

00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:18,669
so their outlines rather than being kind

00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:21,070
of a physical filled thing so they use

00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:23,139
Bezier curves which you're still we

00:34:21,070 --> 00:34:25,179
still see today in an illustrator and

00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:27,940
Photoshop and you know anytime you see a

00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:30,399
pen tool and this worked great like

00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:33,399
people went crazy for it PostScript was

00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,929
embedded in you know every printer Adobe

00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:39,310
was making a ton of money off of this

00:34:34,929 --> 00:34:41,169
and around 91 or a little before Apple

00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:45,190
started developing their own kind of

00:34:41,169 --> 00:34:46,810
competitor called truetype so this is

00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:50,020
the same concept they used a slightly

00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:51,850
different Bezier curve style but they're

00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:53,919
basically the same thing although not

00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:59,109
compatible with each other and this came

00:34:53,919 --> 00:35:01,960
out in 91 along with mac OS 7 but if you

00:34:59,109 --> 00:35:04,930
haven't seen kind of the way that Bezier

00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:08,770
curves are typically built these are the

00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:11,830
handles on that Helvetica s so you can

00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:14,560
see that each each point and there are

00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:16,390
relatively few points for the kind of

00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,190
complex curve that's created here

00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:20,609
as handles that are pulled out the

00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:23,200
distance that those handles travel

00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:26,619
indicates kind of the intensity of the

00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,299
curve so if you open up you know

00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:30,579
whatever text in Illustrator create

00:35:28,299 --> 00:35:34,690
outlines from it and kind of pick apart

00:35:30,579 --> 00:35:36,250
those individual nodes on the the letter

00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:38,440
form you can see that you know there's a

00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:40,839
lot of really beautiful detail that goes

00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:43,690
into crafting these letter forms there's

00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:49,380
a some nice kind of mathematical cool

00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:52,809
stuff to look at the kind of contrast to

00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:54,730
postscript and true type we're also

00:35:52,809 --> 00:35:56,950
bitmap fonts which are still around

00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:58,750
today but you don't see them as much so

00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:01,299
these are a few system fonts from the

00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:03,130
original mac OS and the tricky part

00:36:01,299 --> 00:36:06,220
about bitmaps is that each individual

00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:09,190
size has to be created by hand so you

00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:12,940
know a given size is basically a certain

00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:14,650
arrangement of pixels so consequently

00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:18,069
you know you wouldn't have every size

00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:20,619
from 0 to 100 there's typically a

00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:23,200
smaller subset and if you ever played

00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:25,839
you know any number of video games you

00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,940
see bitmap texts all over the place so

00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:31,660
this is kind of like super nintendo era

00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:33,910
stuff but you know it looks pretty good

00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:38,349
it's not it doesn't have the same kind

00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:42,759
of smooth aesthetic that vector outlines

00:36:38,349 --> 00:36:44,559
do and then opentype was kind of the the

00:36:42,759 --> 00:36:47,740
bringing together of true type and

00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:52,569
postscript around 97 microsoft and adobe

00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:54,940
worked on this and opentype can house

00:36:52,569 --> 00:36:57,220
either post script or truetype outlines

00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:58,809
but the real value is that it brought

00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:01,059
along all of these typographic features

00:36:58,809 --> 00:37:05,170
that we're just starting to be able to

00:37:01,059 --> 00:37:08,769
leverage in our CSS so the the big one

00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:11,650
is like ligatures for example the FFL in

00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:13,450
waffle is like a little bit wonky if you

00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:15,940
were hand writing this in you know in

00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:17,380
calligraphy you would probably have

00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:19,900
those letters kind of touching or

00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:22,990
interacting a little bit better so in

00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:25,539
opentype you're able to automatically

00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:28,300
substitute in custom-designed glyphs so

00:37:25,539 --> 00:37:32,290
in this case you know there's a specific

00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:34,810
glyph that is FFL as like one big shape

00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:37,240
and whenever it sees that combination of

00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:41,020
letters it just swap sit in and you have

00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:43,720
more typographic goodness zap fino is a

00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:46,000
great example of of a lot of these

00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:48,160
features because it has like five

00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:50,650
different versions of you know this

00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:53,230
lowercase K and as you're typing it will

00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:55,390
dynamically substitute different

00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:58,420
alternates for those letter forms so you

00:37:55,390 --> 00:38:00,580
can kind of see it in action here and

00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:03,520
watch how you know as I continue to type

00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:08,320
it does some pretty dramatic switches so

00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:11,880
that like f th is I believe it's not

00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,880
necessarily a special glyph in this case

00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:22,600
but some cool stuff and then I mentioned

00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:25,660
numerals before this also allows you to

00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:27,940
include tabular or lining numerals which

00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:29,890
are kind of those cap height ones that

00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:31,480
you might be used to seeing and also

00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,250
have old-style numerals which you might

00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:38,050
want to use for you know something a

00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:40,900
little fancier and you can kind of

00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:43,960
dynamically switch between the two again

00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:45,490
like in CSS today you can kind of call

00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:49,750
for these things but it's not a hundred

00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:53,230
percent supported across browsers and

00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:55,020
speaking of if you've had to implement

00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:57,520
any web fonts and care about

00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:59,590
cross-browser compatibility you might

00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,450
have looked at something like this which

00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:04,510
can be a little bit of a headache but we

00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:07,150
will break it down for you you can see

00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:10,180
this is calling actually like six

00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:12,520
different font files just you know you

00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:14,820
want to use your your whatever typeface

00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:18,550
and you have to call like six font files

00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:23,020
it's kind of silly but you have a ot

00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:25,680
woof TTFN and SVG and this is kind of

00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:30,730
the the two-second break down for you

00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:32,470
whath is the future truetype is the past

00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:36,040
but it still is well supported so you

00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:42,160
should still use it SVG and eot are kind

00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:43,839
of out the door for text SVG originally

00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,990
was the only way you could load custom

00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:50,380
fonts on like iPhones but this was you

00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:52,660
know iphone 1 and 2 era and that's no

00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:54,339
longer the case and embedded opentype

00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:56,710
was kind of a failed attempt by

00:39:54,339 --> 00:40:00,039
Microsoft to make their own web font

00:39:56,710 --> 00:40:02,319
format they even submitted it to the w3c

00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:04,089
and it got rejected and so that's still

00:40:02,319 --> 00:40:07,390
supported but only an internet explorer

00:40:04,089 --> 00:40:11,380
and these days Internet Explorer support

00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:16,450
swath and true type so those those are

00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:20,079
kind of the way to go related the joys

00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:22,510
of Licensing this is a conversation you

00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,270
should have with your clients sooner

00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:27,670
than later whenever possible it's good

00:40:25,270 --> 00:40:29,559
to kind of understand how much your

00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:32,440
client is willing to spend on custom

00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:34,799
typography and it's also important to

00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,420
kind of make the case that you know

00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:41,079
investing a little bit can go a long way

00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:44,200
as we have seen so these are kind of the

00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:46,779
two major buckets that you typically see

00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:48,910
font web fonts offered in you have

00:40:46,779 --> 00:40:51,190
subscription services where you pay you

00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:52,630
know X dollars a month it ends up

00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:54,819
costing fifty to one hundred twenty

00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:58,450
dollars a year which for your average

00:40:54,819 --> 00:41:00,339
client is like a drop in the bucket they

00:40:58,450 --> 00:41:03,400
often have monthly pageview limits

00:41:00,339 --> 00:41:05,200
meaning you know you once you serve up a

00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,750
certain number of pages they might cut

00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:10,569
you off or you have to upgrade your plan

00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:12,609
but usually those start at like 250,000

00:41:10,569 --> 00:41:14,920
page views and go up so if you're

00:41:12,609 --> 00:41:17,010
working with a client that has more than

00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:20,920
than those page views they're probably

00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:22,779
expecting to pay for this anyway the

00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,480
convenience and flexibility here is that

00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:27,670
rather than committing to you know at

00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:30,369
one particular family or a couple styles

00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:33,760
you have access to their full library of

00:41:30,369 --> 00:41:35,799
typefaces which is often huge so type

00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,230
kit is probably the most common example

00:41:35,799 --> 00:41:41,890
of this they have you know thousands of

00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:43,359
typefaces in their collection and often

00:41:41,890 --> 00:41:44,710
the fonts are also hosted on their

00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:47,579
servers which can be a good or bad thing

00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:51,400
depending on how much control you want

00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:53,770
the pay's you go option by contrast is

00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,609
typically purchased like per individual

00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:58,509
style

00:41:54,609 --> 00:42:01,059
or you know bundles for a given family

00:41:58,509 --> 00:42:03,069
and you're basically buying a license

00:42:01,059 --> 00:42:07,059
for a certain number of page views this

00:42:03,069 --> 00:42:08,589
usually starts again at 250,000 and goes

00:42:07,059 --> 00:42:10,539
up from there they require you to

00:42:08,589 --> 00:42:11,769
usually put a tracking code on your site

00:42:10,539 --> 00:42:14,349
so they can keep track of those

00:42:11,769 --> 00:42:16,539
pageviews but you can often host those

00:42:14,349 --> 00:42:18,849
fonts yourself so this is a good option

00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:20,230
when you know exactly what you want

00:42:18,849 --> 00:42:22,359
you're working with a client that has

00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:25,239
you know a particular brand style guide

00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:27,700
and you know that you can feel pretty

00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:31,660
safe you know just sticking to a smaller

00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:33,089
subset and I don't want to spend a lot

00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:37,539
of time on this but these are a few of

00:42:33,089 --> 00:42:41,380
the typefaces that I give my seal of

00:42:37,539 --> 00:42:43,089
approval to I suppose they're the ones

00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:45,369
that I've worked with before perform

00:42:43,089 --> 00:42:48,039
well some of the highlights I guess you

00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:49,960
could say but all of these services have

00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:51,549
such huge offerings that you know it's

00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:54,069
really worth exploring a little more

00:42:51,549 --> 00:42:57,009
these can be a good starting point so

00:42:54,069 --> 00:42:59,920
Typekit has some good ones Hepler encode

00:42:57,009 --> 00:43:01,920
their cloud typography service has some

00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:05,410
really high-quality ones including

00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:09,279
Gotham which you see all over the place

00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:12,369
and even google fonts has some really

00:43:09,279 --> 00:43:14,230
reliable solid options I tend to lean

00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:17,410
towards some of these sans serifs a

00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:20,440
little bit more the cool thing too is in

00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:22,269
the case of source sans pro and fear of

00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:25,269
sans they've put the source code on

00:43:22,269 --> 00:43:28,690
github and everything that's on google

00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:30,670
fonts is published under the SI l open

00:43:28,690 --> 00:43:32,710
font license which means you can freely

00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:35,170
you know manipulate them redistribute

00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:38,499
them etc include them in your software

00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:40,989
on all that stuff so that open font

00:43:38,499 --> 00:43:42,730
license is also something that you can

00:43:40,989 --> 00:43:45,539
use yourself if you are ever in the

00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:48,190
position to publish your own typeface

00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:50,470
it's a great way to get other people

00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:51,670
involved in your project you can you

00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:55,420
know put it out there and let other

00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:58,210
people expand the family add new weights

00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:59,799
at support for other languages you know

00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:02,559
it could be included in open source

00:43:59,799 --> 00:44:06,440
operating systems it's a good tool to

00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:10,140
just educate students about type design

00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:12,900
get some feedback contribute to the

00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:16,230
growing body of font sources 300,000 and

00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:19,200
Counting and so if you've ever tried to

00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:20,990
dig into google fonts it can be a little

00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,880
bit tricky to find like the good stuff

00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:27,920
so recently there's this project called

00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:30,750
100 days of fonts calm and every day

00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,210
this guy put together a small kind of

00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:36,930
typographic little treatment that uses

00:44:33,210 --> 00:44:39,000
maybe 22 24 google fonts and he tells

00:44:36,930 --> 00:44:41,490
you exactly what they are and it's a

00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,650
good kind of showcase of the the variety

00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:45,720
that is available on there totally for

00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:46,950
free so I think this is a good place to

00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,170
go if you're looking for some

00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:50,670
inspiration you know maybe you see this

00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:53,030
and you're like oh that that tone is

00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:55,440
perfect for this project I'm working on

00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:58,290
and they're pretty varied they've done a

00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:00,750
nice job and its ongoing I think they're

00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:06,300
only around day 30 or something out of

00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:08,940
100 the League of moveable type is

00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:11,220
another cool crew that publish all of

00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:13,800
their fonts under the open font license

00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:16,500
as well you've probably seen a lot of

00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:19,230
their work a lot of these are also on

00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:21,420
google fonts but they've basically over

00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:23,369
the last couple years they've put it

00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:27,859
together some some really nice designs

00:45:23,369 --> 00:45:27,859
and again they're all available for free

00:45:33,549 --> 00:45:40,010
so related to type and especially kind

00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,059
of in this web context are what I like

00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:46,730
to call the Ilah DS which include

00:45:43,059 --> 00:45:50,809
legibility readability usability and

00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:53,660
accessibility and type is a critical

00:45:50,809 --> 00:45:55,180
part of all of these things will go into

00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:57,769
kind of like a high-level overview

00:45:55,180 --> 00:46:00,589
although each of these could easily be

00:45:57,769 --> 00:46:03,559
their own you know week-long seminar and

00:46:00,589 --> 00:46:05,930
you just skim the surface but basically

00:46:03,559 --> 00:46:09,529
legibility is how easily you can

00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:12,230
actually discern letter forms so the

00:46:09,529 --> 00:46:15,500
difference between Helvetica or a superb

00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:18,740
ornate script face you know it's going

00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:21,319
to create different legibility so my

00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:24,230
favorite examples of intentional

00:46:21,319 --> 00:46:28,069
illegibility are these wonderful black

00:46:24,230 --> 00:46:30,140
metal logos so if you know this band no

00:46:28,069 --> 00:46:32,750
cheating but can anybody tell me what

00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:41,930
what this says you're going to venture a

00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:43,579
guess very good yeah so if you spend a

00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:45,230
few minutes you can kind of like pick

00:46:43,579 --> 00:46:46,549
this apart and figure out where

00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:50,000
everything is sometimes the letters are

00:46:46,549 --> 00:46:53,779
rotated but these are like extreme cases

00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:59,079
of you know stylized illegibility this

00:46:53,779 --> 00:46:59,079
one's a little bit easier any guesses

00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:06,980
borken aghar so you can see the the Bo

00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:08,539
are you can kind of see the K and like

00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:12,019
once you see the word you can sort of

00:47:08,539 --> 00:47:16,420
pick it apart but the this one's

00:47:12,019 --> 00:47:16,420
probably the easiest any thoughts

00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,160
Darkthrone

00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:25,080
so it's interesting how once once you

00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:28,770
know what the word is it's sort of like

00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:31,530
emerges and our very own Casey white

00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:35,430
from Chapter three put together one for

00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:37,260
the chapter three you can expect to see

00:47:35,430 --> 00:47:44,160
these on our t-shirts next year at

00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:46,800
drupalcon but looking at more reasonable

00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,780
words there's even a huge difference in

00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,150
legibility between you know this array

00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:53,940
that you see here so if you were to ask

00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:56,790
me I'd say those two are probably the

00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:58,830
most legible in this set the left column

00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:02,640
is all sans-serif the right column is

00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:04,560
all serif and particularly that bottom

00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:06,480
left sans-serif has kind of these little

00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:08,460
curves at the bottom of the l's which

00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,410
helps you to visually differentiate them

00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:14,100
from other letter forms that have you

00:48:10,410 --> 00:48:16,290
know straight strokes like that and up

00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:19,590
at the top you have Georgia and just has

00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:22,230
like a pretty large x height not not

00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:26,490
very high contrast the spacing is

00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:28,680
relatively even so then what then is is

00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:33,000
readability besides a cat reading

00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:35,400
Tolstoy this is how easily you can read

00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:37,890
a given piece of text so this basically

00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:40,230
requires legibility and then builds up

00:48:37,890 --> 00:48:42,630
from it it's like adding the maximum

00:48:40,230 --> 00:48:44,700
comfort whereas you know you might be

00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:47,100
able to to make out a word and it could

00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:51,300
be legible but it won't be readable

00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:54,480
until you've kind of optimized a few

00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:57,210
parameters so if you look at like these

00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,010
two pieces of text pretty clearly the

00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:01,500
bottom one is going to be easier to read

00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:03,330
on the top you know the letting is

00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:06,450
really tight the line length is really

00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:09,600
long it's set smaller and on the bottom

00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:12,500
you know it's this is a biased example

00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:14,340
but the other big factor is the literal

00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:18,900
contrast I don't even know if you can

00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:20,670
read this can you even read this so that

00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:23,250
the key factors for readability are

00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:26,220
again things like text size the letting

00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:29,610
and the line spacing the line length the

00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:31,470
contrast the alignment which is

00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:32,970
something we don't often think about but

00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:34,740
you know we read left to look to right

00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:37,500
so left aligned text

00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:39,180
with like a ragged right edge is more

00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:41,340
comfortable for us to read than if you

00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:43,650
have right align text and your eye has

00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:46,080
to scan to kind of figure out where the

00:49:43,650 --> 00:49:47,700
beginning of the next line is and a

00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:49,800
little bit separate from typography is

00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:53,130
the literal vocabulary or the syntax

00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:55,740
that you use can also impact readability

00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:57,720
you think of this as like the the

00:49:55,740 --> 00:50:02,780
reading level of a given piece of text

00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:02,780
and then this is maybe my favorite slide

00:50:03,080 --> 00:50:11,070
usability is is basically how how easy

00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:12,810
it is to use something so this is you

00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:15,300
know everything around you in the

00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:17,730
physical space and on computers and

00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:20,220
usability again as a topic for a whole

00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:22,890
other talk so this is the the high level

00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:27,720
but you know microwaves computers car

00:50:22,890 --> 00:50:31,080
stereos books doors watches both dumb

00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:34,680
and smart watches and this is one of my

00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:37,590
my favorite examples so here's a case

00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:40,410
where the usability of this kind of

00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:43,170
parking garage machine was improved by

00:50:40,410 --> 00:50:44,700
some of its users apparently the

00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:47,250
original interface was confusing enough

00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:49,500
that somebody had to add all these

00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:51,750
little signs to kind of make clear what

00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:54,859
all of these things mean I think there's

00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:54,859
a lot that we can learn from this

00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:02,280
accessibility if you can't quite make it

00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:05,220
out this is a person on the the London

00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:08,100
tube reading his smartphone with a

00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:12,410
magnifying glass in addition to his pair

00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:14,910
of glasses that he's already wearing and

00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:17,490
in the context of typography I'm

00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:19,859
thinking I'm talking mostly about text

00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:22,020
contrast here but the great Tim

00:51:19,859 --> 00:51:25,950
berners-lee inventor of the World Wide

00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:29,100
Web believed from the beginning that you

00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:30,420
know it's it's essential that the web is

00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:35,130
something that can be accessed by

00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:37,109
anybody regardless of disability and

00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:40,380
again text contrast is my primary

00:51:37,109 --> 00:51:42,690
concern here so you can see that the the

00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:45,030
text block on the right has higher

00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:47,240
contrast than on the left and there are

00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:50,060
standards for this so

00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:51,920
at the bottom web a morgue has a nice

00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:56,210
contrast checker there are a million of

00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:57,530
these out there and it's a good method

00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:59,119
you should test you know what your

00:51:57,530 --> 00:52:01,930
background color is in your foreground

00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:05,150
color and that will give you a ratio and

00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:07,280
you want to target four and a half to

00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:10,010
one for small text three two one for

00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:13,090
large text there's also a stricter

00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:15,470
triple-a rating that you can shoot for

00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:18,260
but I think it's really important to

00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:20,030
remember that you can't control the

00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:22,250
viewing conditions of your end user so

00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:24,380
you might set something that looks you

00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:26,570
know super beautiful it's really subtle

00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:28,820
and elegant and it looks great on your

00:52:26,570 --> 00:52:31,220
screen at your desk you know indoors

00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:32,840
under controlled lighting but what about

00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:35,060
somebody viewing that site on their

00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:37,220
phone in direct sunlight or somebody

00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:40,190
who's monitor is you know old and the

00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:41,630
brightness is all wonky you you have no

00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:43,850
control over those things so keeping

00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:49,220
these ratios in mind is is really

00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:54,109
valuable and important and again social

00:52:49,220 --> 00:52:56,720
inclusion good accessibility includes

00:52:54,109 --> 00:52:58,580
other other things like making sure your

00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:01,460
pages can be easily read read by a

00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:03,619
screen reader including alt text for

00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:05,800
your images just being generally mindful

00:53:03,619 --> 00:53:08,390
of your page wait so you're not

00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:10,510
demanding that somebody sucks down 30

00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:17,869
megabytes of junk to load your home page

00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:20,780
that sort of thing so for type on the

00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:23,000
web I want to talk about just some minor

00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:25,490
trends you might have noticed that

00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:28,850
there's kind of this trend of large very

00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:32,300
generous body text for articles on sites

00:53:28,850 --> 00:53:34,880
like medium or a list apart and you know

00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:36,950
this is no coincidence as we have kind

00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:42,140
of a better tools to create custom

00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:46,490
typography designers will be optimizing

00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:50,540
kind of content for readability and so

00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:53,300
this speaks directly to it text size is

00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:55,640
not again the only factor this was an

00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:57,980
article on resident advisor and what I

00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:00,140
thought was interesting once I went down

00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:01,160
to the comments section there were two

00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:03,559
people that specific

00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:05,599
Lee called out the letting this guy's

00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:07,609
like yeah you seriously need to increase

00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:10,400
the letting on the body copy hurts

00:54:07,609 --> 00:54:11,839
my eyes could you increase the you know

00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,880
the line height on the paragraphs it's a

00:54:11,839 --> 00:54:17,240
bit hard to read so these are instances

00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:20,240
where these users were consciously aware

00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:21,650
of these things but more often it's it's

00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:23,630
a subconscious thing you just kind of

00:54:21,650 --> 00:54:25,670
feel it or it's like uncomfortable you

00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:27,410
don't want to finish the article and you

00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:30,170
know when it's done right it can feel

00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:35,390
effortless and that's what we want to

00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:37,069
target so similar to the Tokyo examples

00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:38,960
that I showed you guys earlier I thought

00:54:37,069 --> 00:54:40,400
it'd be kind of interesting to strip out

00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,160
all the text from a few websites and

00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:45,319
just see how those perform because text

00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:48,200
is really the core of how we communicate

00:54:45,319 --> 00:54:50,390
there are lots of sites that are

00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:53,510
dedicated to visual or oral

00:54:50,390 --> 00:54:58,849
communication but text is still at the

00:54:53,510 --> 00:55:00,530
core so here's just a few fun ones you

00:54:58,849 --> 00:55:08,829
know the core structure is kind of there

00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:08,829
but we are completely reliant on text

00:55:09,819 --> 00:55:17,299
there's our drupalcon hashtag from a few

00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:19,339
days ago so Twitter becomes just like

00:55:17,299 --> 00:55:23,779
totally useless except for a couple

00:55:19,339 --> 00:55:25,130
photos of somebody's food and even

00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:29,210
YouTube where you think you know that

00:55:25,130 --> 00:55:33,160
the content is all video you kind of

00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:33,160
need you know those titles and things

00:55:34,029 --> 00:55:40,220
and then I want to kind of close with a

00:55:36,589 --> 00:55:43,010
side note how all of these issues are

00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:45,079
also very relevant to the world of

00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:48,799
gaming and I see a lot of parallels

00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:50,839
between you know the higher quality

00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:55,130
typography on the web and higher quite

00:55:50,839 --> 00:55:57,230
tough put that higher quality typography

00:55:55,130 --> 00:56:01,369
in gaming so I've been talking for an

00:55:57,230 --> 00:56:03,650
hour so basically higher resolution

00:56:01,369 --> 00:56:06,200
screens enable higher quality typography

00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:08,510
think about you know the jump from a pre

00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:11,809
Retina screen to your retina screen on

00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:14,200
your iphone everything looks so much

00:56:11,809 --> 00:56:16,570
nicer so over the years

00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,490
you know we have this general trend of

00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:22,349
an increase in resolution just like with

00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:25,270
computers or any other technology and

00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:26,680
you can see that the the full screen is

00:56:25,270 --> 00:56:29,950
basically the resolution that we're at

00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:35,710
now so we're like magnitudes finer than

00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:37,740
we were decades ago and 4k is kind of

00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:42,460
like the next evolution that's coming

00:56:37,740 --> 00:56:45,190
who knows when and that's 3840 x 2160

00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:48,820
which is going to be awesome when it

00:56:45,190 --> 00:56:50,680
happens so if you think about like this

00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:55,210
is kind of what what typography looked

00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:58,750
like in games circa 96 bitmap text it is

00:56:55,210 --> 00:57:01,000
legible moderately readable but you know

00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:05,260
you're not reading like books on there

00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:06,990
and then here's an example from just

00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:09,670
last fall this is Assassin's Creed unity

00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:11,800
we now have embedded fonts they're being

00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:13,329
rendered you know smoothly they're

00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,670
designed in a way that you can read them

00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:17,589
comfortably from your screen even though

00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:20,230
they're they're relatively small by

00:57:17,589 --> 00:57:22,630
comparison you can see how huge that is

00:57:20,230 --> 00:57:25,990
but you were probably playing it on you

00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:28,660
know like a 14 inch TV here we're on you

00:57:25,990 --> 00:57:31,900
know hdtvs sitting 10 feet away from

00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:33,790
your your screen on the couch this was

00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:35,260
another interesting one from game called

00:57:33,790 --> 00:57:39,099
blood-borne that came out a few months

00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:41,650
ago and this is the loading screen this

00:57:39,099 --> 00:57:45,069
text was like very readable comfortable

00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:48,790
from from your couch but it's not all

00:57:45,069 --> 00:57:51,220
good here is Dragon Age Inquisition and

00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:53,920
they're loading screens have this all

00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:56,380
caps text with a drop shadow against

00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:58,140
like a graphical background and you know

00:57:56,380 --> 00:58:02,170
anybody could tell you that this is not

00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:04,329
comfortable to read there's some some

00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:07,329
missed opportunities here same thing

00:58:04,329 --> 00:58:08,920
elsewhere in the game sometimes the text

00:58:07,329 --> 00:58:11,619
is constrained to kind of these narrow

00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:13,450
boxes the line length gets cramped so

00:58:11,619 --> 00:58:15,220
the thing to keep in mind is that you

00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:17,740
know these issues are pretty Universal

00:58:15,220 --> 00:58:23,260
they're not just on the web or just in

00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:27,750
print or just on our phones and then

00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:31,960
finally typography has has gotten

00:58:27,750 --> 00:58:34,960
even better in kind of these immersive

00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:37,030
worlds grand theft auto 5 has a ton of

00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:39,369
examples of in-game signage that has

00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:42,820
been very carefully designed so all of

00:58:39,369 --> 00:58:45,790
these flyers and signs and you know

00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:48,130
fictional brands for things are pretty

00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:50,680
well realized and look surprisingly good

00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:53,260
there's even kind of a functional metro

00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:57,760
map and like this whole system diagram

00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:59,170
doubt in in this virtual world so what

00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,500
what's important to remember is

00:58:59,170 --> 00:59:03,820
basically that type is all around you

00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:08,170
and if you don't stop and look around

00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:10,440
once in a while you could miss it thank

00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:10,440
you guys

00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:23,760
so all my slides are online here

00:59:19,619 --> 00:59:27,809
tinyurl.com / drupalcon type it's a

00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:29,220
fairly hefty like 38 megabyte PDF but I

00:59:27,809 --> 00:59:31,829
didn't want to sacrifice image quality

00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:34,730
too much but that has everything in here

00:59:31,829 --> 00:59:39,869

little bit over so i'll just take

00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:48,809
