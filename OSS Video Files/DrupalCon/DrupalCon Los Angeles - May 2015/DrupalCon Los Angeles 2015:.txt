she's approached he's been around since

00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:25,290
really the beginning of the Association

00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,750

00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:30,990

00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,130
bit so uh Megan let's get started ok

00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,049
thanks well that was quite the

00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,479
introduction never been called the

00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:08,250
master before but I'll take it so why

00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,220
don't we just dive into this

00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:13,410
presentation and hopefully everyone's

00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,170
seen it if you are not able to see it

00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,660
just

00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:21,069
put a note in the question section and

00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:24,920
we'll just fix anything as we go along

00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:28,250
all right so everyone is sponsoring for

00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,780
slightly different reasons and what I've

00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:32,660
found over the years is there's three

00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:35,480
main reasons why people sponsor one is

00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,010
to for business reasons obviously you're

00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,120
looking for leads you want to do

00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,540
business development with other

00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:45,290
companies so we'll talk some about how

00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:48,140
to really use drupalcon for that purpose

00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,900
other people there to recruit talent

00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,720
we're going to have thousands of

00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,910
developers and site builders as well as

00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,580
other job functions at drupalcon it's a

00:02:55,910 --> 00:03:01,519
great chance to highlight your company

00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:04,160
culture and your jobs and interface with

00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,510
people that are possibly looking for a

00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:12,500
position and so the other reason people

00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:14,810
sponsor is to support the community to

00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,760
demonstrate that they're one of the

00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,360
community and a leader in the community

00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,320
as well as a fat leader so they might be

00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,739
sponsoring to highlight some of their

00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,690
modules and trying to get more traction

00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:29,239
with that module within the within the

00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:32,600
community so those are the three reasons

00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:36,019
I see people wanting to sponsor but

00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:38,900
regardless of what you want to get out

00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:41,480
of this drupalcon there's really four

00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:43,130
simple steps to help you achieve your

00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,190
goals and one is you have to be

00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:48,500
proactive you have to really start your

00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:51,350
marketing as you're leading up to

00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:54,530
drupalcon through drupalcon and after

00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:56,540
and I will talk about some steps that

00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,430
you can take you also want to make sure

00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:01,459
you really know what your goal is and

00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:03,590
that it's measurable and that you have a

00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:07,340
really clear crisp message that you are

00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:09,350
pushing out to drupalcon attendees and

00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,350
that your whole company who's attending

00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:14,359
is part of that team and then the last

00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,910
one is you want to look at all your

00:04:14,359 --> 00:04:19,310
channels so not just the team members

00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:20,930
who are going to be going but also what

00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:23,419
do you do with social media and blogs

00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:27,380
and your newsletters and things like

00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:29,420
that so we will kind of break that down

00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,950
bit and see what that looks like for

00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:35,480
each of the different reasons you might

00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:40,790
be sponsoring so as I mentioned you need

00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:42,530
to be proactive and so that means even

00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:46,310
starting now you can start promoting

00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:49,160
your sponsorship we recommend that you

00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:51,680
contact your database and followers on

00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,210
social media really let them know that

00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,010
you're going to be there maybe your

00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:58,970
company's presenting let them know that

00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:01,190
what session got selected tell them to

00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:05,150
check you out at the exhibit hall give

00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:07,700
them your booth number you can even do

00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,380
raffles let them know like maybe you

00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:13,640
want to ruffle up an iPad or whatever is

00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:15,830
cool now you are even welcome to raffle

00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:19,520
off any of your unused drupalcon

00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:21,890
conference passes when you are doing

00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,500
your promotions through social media we

00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:26,150
put in the handles and the hashtags that

00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:30,170
you'll want to use just so that you get

00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:31,820
even more attraction and in reach

00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:33,530
through your social media channels so

00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,560
you'll see that here and these are some

00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:38,990
of the things you can do beforehand

00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:41,420
during the drupalcon you want to think

00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:43,340
about all the people you're sending so

00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:47,570
whether they're going to be working in

00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:49,430
your your booth or they might be

00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:52,970
presenting they might be a developer who

00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:55,100
is going to sessions or going to the

00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:57,500
sprint so this is your this is your team

00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,970
this is your street team so to speak so

00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,680
you really want to give them a uniform

00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,440
so that your brand stands out wherever

00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:05,390
they go and even if their developers we

00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,100
highly recommend that you give everyone

00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:09,530
business cards because everyone's there

00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,900
to network and you can think about

00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:14,660
Brandon your business cards beyond just

00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,070
your you know company logo you can put

00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,630
your message on there so for example if

00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,980
you're recruiting talent you might want

00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:24,320
to have your the jobs URL on there or

00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:26,030
just bullet out the positions that you

00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:27,320
have open and that way even if it's a

00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,930
developer who's talking to someone they

00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,940
can just hand this out to people so

00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:34,510
that's one thing that we recommend is

00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:37,970
just make sure people know you're there

00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:40,250
and before you get on site sit down with

00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:41,060
everyone who's going and let them know

00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:45,770
what you're

00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:48,530
goals are and what the message is and

00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:52,280
give them metrics so for example if it's

00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:53,720
we want to have so many leads coming out

00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,700
of this business you know your team

00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:57,050
should sit down in it and know what that

00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,389
is and what the message is what your

00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:01,430
elevator pitch is and make sure that

00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:04,070
everyone understands that you are to

00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,600
have these kinds of conversations and

00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:07,130
maybe even will go into some more detail

00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,910
about how you can set up meetings

00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:12,710
beforehand with no kind of your target

00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,870
audience and make sure that the

00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:17,030
conversations are we're going to happen

00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:20,380
so that you leave the event with the

00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:23,630
outcome that you you were hoping for

00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:25,940
also during the event you want to really

00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,560
keep your name out there every you know

00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:31,220
it's great opportunity to be blogging

00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,520
some people will do a blog every night

00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:36,860
kind of a recap and get it out into

00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:38,419
social media and then of course you

00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,669
could be doing live tweeting during the

00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:42,169
DRI's note or any important sessions it

00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:44,120
helps you just really keep your brand

00:07:42,169 --> 00:07:46,970
out there and be seen as a thought

00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:49,310
leader and make sure that you are

00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:52,160
participating in all of the ways that

00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:54,350
have this organic networking we have

00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,100
birds of a feather that's a chance to

00:07:54,350 --> 00:08:00,770
come together and top kind of meet

00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,900
people who want to talk about a common

00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:05,240
topic that you get to choose or other

00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:09,080
people choose but you can look for birds

00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:10,880
of a feather meet people of a similar

00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:12,590
interest as you you can go the special

00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,039
events that are happening at night and

00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:17,570
you can find out what the community is

00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:19,220
doing in terms of events by going to the

00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:22,100
event site under the community section

00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:24,020
and will be promoting what all the

00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,789
sponsor parties are and of course we

00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,500
even just have the hallway track it's

00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:29,060
not an official trek but you'll see a

00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,220
lot of people will go to drupalcon and

00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,770
not even go into sessions they just walk

00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,209
around the hallway and network and talk

00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:37,729
and they get a lot of business done

00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:40,070
there so just make sure you have people

00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:42,979
that are available to float around and

00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:45,470
have those organic conversations and

00:08:42,979 --> 00:08:47,180
then of course if you did get a booth as

00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:48,560
part of your sponsor package just make

00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,450
sure whatever your message is it's

00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,089
really clear what you're promoting and

00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,680
have it align with your goals do

00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:55,010
different things to bring people into

00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,590
your

00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:59,780
booth whether it's raffles or collecting

00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:01,910
cards business cards from people or

00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:03,890
whatever you need to do just to capture

00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:06,650
names that you can then follow up with

00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,790
them because afterwards you want to make

00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:09,410
sure you do follow up with all your

00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:11,750
contacts that you're making throughout

00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:14,360
the event and again just reinforce the

00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,070
message and your call to action and we

00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,520
recommend that you get your follow-up

00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:23,600
email out within 48 hours we highly

00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,910
recommend that you write this before you

00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,580
go to drupalcon and you have it ready to

00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:31,520
just push a button and send out to your

00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:33,890
contacts because it is a marathon going

00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:36,620
to a drupalcon and it is exhausting and

00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:39,650
even 48 hours after drupalcon you may

00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:41,870
really not want to do a lot of work so

00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:44,360
we recommend that you plan ahead and and

00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:46,940
line that up so that it's just a push of

00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,980
a button so those are just some high

00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,710
levels of what to do before during and

00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,390
after a drupalcon regardless of what

00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:57,020
you're trying to achieve with your

00:09:53,390 --> 00:10:00,950
sponsorship but let me drill down into

00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:03,640
those three different areas the lead

00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:08,090
generation talent acquisition and

00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:11,510
community and thought leadership so for

00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:13,370
lead generation this is a sponsoring it

00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:17,810
gives you an opportunity to acquire new

00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:21,320
clients what we recommend is you go to

00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:25,430
the URL that I have here it's the

00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:27,740
attendee profile page when a person

00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:31,550
registers for drupalcon they have the

00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:35,330
opportunity to say yes make my attendee

00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:36,800
information public and so this URL takes

00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:41,750
you there so you can see all the people

00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:44,020
who are willing to communicate with you

00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:47,750
you can click on each individual's

00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:51,200
picture and profile and email them

00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:54,250
directly we highly recommend that you're

00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:57,080
very careful and how you use this

00:10:54,250 --> 00:11:00,680
because we have had people in the past

00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:06,410
use web crawlers to get all the profiles

00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:07,550
and their emails and just email them all

00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:10,459
of them and it

00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:14,750
came out the spam and it really was not

00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:16,430
well received and so we recommend that

00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:18,290
you do go through you think about who

00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:20,450
you really want to talk to and you email

00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:23,300
each person directly to the channel that

00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:25,970
they've allowed you to communicate with

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:27,440
them and it's a great opportunity to say

00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,209
who you are and why you want to talk

00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,930
with them and set up a meeting so that

00:11:29,209 --> 00:11:36,529
you can have a more meaningful

00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:38,000
conversation face-to-face so that's one

00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,370
thing that we highly recommend is that

00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,829
you make sure you go into these

00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:44,990
conferences with meeting set up and then

00:11:42,829 --> 00:11:47,089
of course I you might want to think

00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:49,399
about giving your staff some goals so

00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:50,990
give them goals for how many sales

00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:54,290
meetings they should have how many

00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:55,730
conversations they need to have and how

00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:57,680
many business cards they collect you

00:11:55,730 --> 00:12:00,320
know if you don't measure it you can't

00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:01,970
manage it and we just always find the

00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,320
more metrics you put around things that

00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:07,310
the more you come out with a better

00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,350
outcome so there's some suggestions for

00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,540
new clients and other things are you can

00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,459
just find new clients just by being

00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,620
available so you might have some people

00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:17,420
in your sponsor booth but make sure you

00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:19,010
have someone else who can roam around do

00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:20,360
that business development and strike up

00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:24,470
conversations at the birds of a feather

00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:26,510
and the social events we also have VIP

00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:28,880
happy hour on wednesday that you're all

00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:33,589
invited to and so i highly recommend

00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:35,329
that you go to that it's mostly you know

00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:38,990
the sponsors and the supporters that

00:12:35,329 --> 00:12:40,850
it's the drupal shops software companies

00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,339
hosting companies that attend there and

00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:46,360
so that's something that you you

00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:46,360
definitely want to put on your calendar

00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:53,570
so those are some ways to get some new

00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:55,550
clients out of drupalcon but you can

00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:59,630
also use drupalcon as a sales tool to

00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:01,910
reach into your existing pipeline you

00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:03,980
know it you can go back to Los deals

00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,630
even and let them know where you're

00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:08,120
going to be perhaps you want to invite

00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:10,699
them and see if you can resurrect that

00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:15,019
relationship I'm sure you have active

00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:17,520
leads that you're just looking for

00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:19,320
another reason to nurture them and

00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:22,740
and reach out and touch them one more

00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:26,580
time some communications and so we can

00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:28,260
easily help you do that and then also

00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,700
you might have some existing clients

00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,790
that you want to expand the footprint

00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:36,240
within that client and and so drupalcon

00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:38,130
can help with that as well so what we we

00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,850
recommend for all of these categories

00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:45,540
lost deals active leads existing clients

00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:47,940
is to invite them to drupalcon you get

00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:49,470
to really kind of be there Sherpa for

00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,470
drupalcon let them really see that

00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:54,420
you're the expert bring them to your

00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:57,540
employee sessions or other sessions that

00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:59,610
help reinforce your expertise you can

00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,010
host a dinner and invite them to come

00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:04,490
and join you where you can talk to them

00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:07,980
some more about Drupal and your services

00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:10,950
of course well you're on site you can

00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,290
show them around you know it's not just

00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:16,710
the sessions but it's the cutter lounge

00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:18,120
where people are working or the sprints

00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:19,560
there's just so many things that you

00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,580
know depending on their interests you

00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,050
could really find out what their

00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,940
interests are and make sure you walk

00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:26,390
them over to that or even introduce them

00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,920
to some of the Rockstar side over there

00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:30,450
so to reach out to them we would

00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,940
certainly recommend that you send them a

00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:37,980
newsletter promote your presence there

00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:40,440
and blogs and and social media and just

00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,270
really give them a reason to come and

00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,280
talk to you one more time and help move

00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:48,740
them through the pipeline or expand

00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,740
their expand their engagement with you

00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:55,710
so that's

00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,820
how to get some leads from new clients

00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,530
as well as through your existing

00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,970
pipeline but there's another way of

00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,670
generating leads and that's through

00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:06,180
partnerships so many Drupal shops

00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:10,230
especially say that no they have a lot

00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:13,050
of leads but perhaps their their bench

00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:14,790
is not available and they're looking for

00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,980
the right person to pass the lead on or

00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:18,510
maybe there's some down time with their

00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,910
bench and so they're looking to take on

00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:23,640
some special projects or maybe you even

00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:27,630
have a certain expertise and you'd like

00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:30,210
to go to market with someone and kind of

00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,500
capture our special segment so that's

00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:34,230
where we start talking about

00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,700
partnerships and I see a lot of this

00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,890
happening at drupalcon I've even seen

00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,810
partnerships form and turn into mergers

00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,710
we're just pretty exciting we're

00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:44,940
starting to see a little bit more of

00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:48,000
that in the Drupal ecosystem too and so

00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:49,520
this is a great time to you know

00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,900
especially if you're on the show floor

00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:55,800
look around see who else is on the show

00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:58,200
floor and you know when people are in

00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,300
sessions and it's quiet in the exhibit

00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,190
hall go ahead and start talking to each

00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,710
other you know there's probably a lot of

00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:07,590
business that you can trim up just by

00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:09,510
collaborating and again if you know that

00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:10,890
this is a direction you want to go take

00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,120
a look at the sponsor page and the

00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:15,720
companies that are out there check out

00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:18,360
their their profiles and set up some

00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:21,510
meetings in advance so you make sure

00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:23,040
that you have these conversations

00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:25,350
because Drupal cons can be really

00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:29,610
distracting so you don't want to leave a

00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:32,280
drupalcon without you know having these

00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:34,020
conversations take place and again I

00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,760
can't reinforce it enough you want

00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,990
people to work in the booth but you

00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,640
definitely want to make sure there's

00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:42,050
someone who's having these meetings and

00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,050
it's not tied to the booth all the time

00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:46,470
so those are a couple different ways

00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:50,340
that you can take advantage of drupalcon

00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:52,620
for lead generation so talent

00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:56,670
acquisition is a big part of why people

00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:59,220
sponsor and so if you have a booth you

00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:02,010
want to make sure it's really clear that

00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,990
you're hiring so put up a sign make sure

00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,959
that when people come visit you at the

00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,880
booth that you can

00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,189
hand out a flyer that explains what the

00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,429
jobs are right it's very strong call to

00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:13,899
action again you can set up meetings in

00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:17,649
advance go through the attendee profile

00:17:13,899 --> 00:17:19,539
if you see people that match once you're

00:17:17,649 --> 00:17:21,279
looking for in terms of new talent go

00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:22,750
ahead and tell them that you're really

00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,409
interested in having a conversation and

00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:29,470
let them know conversation never hurts

00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:31,779
we also have our new job board called

00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:33,370
Drupal jobs and tim is going to be

00:17:31,779 --> 00:17:35,169
sending you a coupon code so that you

00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:38,380
can post jobs we highly recommend you

00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:39,970
take advantage of this and again make

00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:42,039
sure you have business cards to hand out

00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:44,789
to everyone whether it's your developer

00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:47,230
staff that's going or your sales team

00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:48,429
everyone's part of networking so just

00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,960
make sure you have business cards to

00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:53,289
hand out and your business cards can

00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,909
even promote some of your jobs and

00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:57,210
whatever you deal with your messaging I

00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:59,799
highly recommend that you demonstrate

00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:01,570
why your company is great there's a lot

00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:04,929
of companies to work for in the Drupal

00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:09,190
community so why is your culture the one

00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:11,860
that is so special I highly recommend

00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:14,950
that you really think about that

00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:19,510
captured in pictures captured in a list

00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:22,059
of your benefits you can really use that

00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:26,409
as your messaging in social media and

00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:27,760
blogs you know and it's really important

00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:30,190
to show that you're living your culture

00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:32,020
so if your team is getting together and

00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:33,399
doing a special team dinner or you

00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,380
having fun together take pictures of

00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:37,570
that tweet it out with a call to action

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,919
if I come work for us and do the same

00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:41,169
with blogs and your other different

00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:43,659
channels but that's just really one way

00:18:41,169 --> 00:18:47,919
I see companies separating themselves

00:18:43,659 --> 00:18:49,570
from the pack because like I said Drupal

00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:51,100
talent they can choose to work anywhere

00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:52,630
but there's certain things that are

00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,820
looking for it's not always just salary

00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:57,159
salary is always a thing a lot of them

00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:00,779
were looking for you know flexibility

00:18:57,159 --> 00:19:04,450
that work-life balance opportunities for

00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:06,279
challenges and came to work on special

00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:08,950
new projects and learning and

00:19:06,279 --> 00:19:09,970
professional development so those are

00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:13,799
the kinds of things that you want to

00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:17,190
call out another

00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:20,690
reason people sponsor is to show that

00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:23,309
they are community or thought leader and

00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:25,019
so if you have a booth again just

00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:27,090
highlight that message if you are

00:19:25,019 --> 00:19:28,320
supporting partner we are going to give

00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:30,690
you a sign that you can put on your

00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:32,369
table maybe you want even bake that into

00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:34,019
your messaging a little bit to show that

00:19:32,369 --> 00:19:35,279
you're not just someone who's built a

00:19:34,019 --> 00:19:36,929
business with Drupal but you're getting

00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:38,850
back and all the ways you're giving back

00:19:36,929 --> 00:19:40,980
whether it's been a supporting partner

00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:44,249
contributing to the Drupal 8 accelerate

00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,840
fund of course all of the code that

00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:48,169
you're contributing because code is king

00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:50,639
so make sure you highlight your modules

00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:53,480
at your booths and your social media

00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:56,159
let's just get the word out there and

00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,679
you know you can even attend offs you

00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:01,889
might see that there's a need to really

00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:04,169
talk about certain things about the

00:20:01,889 --> 00:20:07,049
community maybe it's a something about

00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:10,379
being a camp organizer or maybe it is

00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:12,600
about certain functionality that really

00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:14,340
you know you really want the community

00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:16,710
to come around and talk about and you

00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:20,220
can schedule up birds of a feather

00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:22,619
session or Boff as we call it and help

00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,960
lead that conversation really put

00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:26,609
yourself in a position of leadership you

00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,769
can also look to see what birds of a

00:20:26,609 --> 00:20:31,289
feather have been scheduled by others

00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:35,850
and attend and show your leadership by

00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:39,179
adding to the conversation again of

00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:40,859
course you can show your your community

00:20:39,179 --> 00:20:42,239
and thought leadership just by

00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:47,149
highlighting everything through all your

00:20:42,239 --> 00:20:49,470
communication channels and and again

00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:54,269
there's nothing better than showing that

00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:56,070
you really live your values and one way

00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:58,109
to do that is go to the community summit

00:20:56,070 --> 00:21:00,749
on Monday it's a free event if you are a

00:20:58,109 --> 00:21:01,919
community leader go ahead to that you

00:21:00,749 --> 00:21:04,499
can find more information on the event

00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:06,749
site and this is where community leaders

00:21:04,499 --> 00:21:10,259
talk about ways better ways to run camps

00:21:06,749 --> 00:21:12,899
or better ways to promote the sprint and

00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:14,879
into our program so i highly recommend

00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:17,070
that event i asked to say that joint you

00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:19,169
can become a sprint mentor or have your

00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:22,019
staff become sprint mentors Kathy phase

00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:24,539
is looking for people who will work with

00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:26,850
our new community members and show them

00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:27,600
how to get ready for a sprint and show

00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:29,700
them how to

00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:31,289
tribute on Friday I went through that

00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,110
program a little bit and I have to say

00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:36,120
it just accelerated and play

00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:39,360
understanding I have a lot more to do

00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:42,179
but I am eternally grateful for the

00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,429
Sprint mentors who helped me and one of

00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:46,289
them was bluehost and I will never

00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:48,150
forget that it was blue host who reached

00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:51,960
out and helped me it's a great way to

00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:56,190
line your brand with AB like the ethos

00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:58,289
of our community and I just can't

00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,419
encourage you enough to have your staff

00:21:58,289 --> 00:22:02,250
sign up to be a sprint mentor really

00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:04,590
good for your company and then of course

00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:07,289
you can even just have your staff go to

00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:08,549
the Sprint's on Friday they can go as

00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:10,289
sprint mentors and they could just go as

00:22:08,549 --> 00:22:11,789
contributors many of them I'm sure are

00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:13,950
contributing and of course make sure

00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:15,990
they're wearing your t-shirt so that you

00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:18,600
know when they're at the table and

00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:20,610
people are looking at them that they see

00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,080
your brand so these are just a couple

00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:24,360
different ways that you can highlight

00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:29,100
your community and thought leadership if

00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:31,980
that is one of your goals there and so I

00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:34,220
you know it's a simple presentation I

00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,870
just kind of go through some of the real

00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:39,419
probably obvious things but you know

00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:42,270
it's it always good to refresh a how to

00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:44,280
get the most out of your drupalcon to

00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:46,440
really be prepared and and know in

00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:48,480
advance what you want to get out of it

00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:50,880
and break it down and some tact tactics

00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,740
that are measurable and so that's what I

00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,659
did around those three main areas are

00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:57,840
relatively generation talent recruitment

00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:59,880
and thought leadership so I'll just

00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,320
leave you with this one slide that just

00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:06,840
kind of summarizes it for networking 101

00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:08,220
because i don't know maybe you are a

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,450
little introverted i know i can get a

00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,130
little shy and i have to really force

00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,480
myself to get out there sometimes even

00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,909
though that might be shocking to some of

00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,799
you who know who know me and but

00:23:14,909 --> 00:23:18,240
networking is one of the biggest things

00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:21,960
you can do at drupalcon with all those

00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,059
people so networking 101 bring plenty of

00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,679
business cards make sure you have an

00:23:24,059 --> 00:23:27,179
elevator pitch so when you talk to

00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,000
people you know exactly what you want to

00:23:27,179 --> 00:23:32,610
say try not to make it sound too salesy

00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,150
but you know have your have your pitch

00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:37,980
ready and drupalcon can be a bit of a

00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:39,540
family reunion so try to grab try to

00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,309
avoid gravity into people you know and

00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:43,649
start looking around for new people

00:23:41,309 --> 00:23:45,929
and of course sometimes that can be a

00:23:43,649 --> 00:23:48,179
little awkward so there's different

00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:50,580
openers you can use and I'm just really

00:23:48,179 --> 00:23:53,669
blunt and I just say hi I haven't met

00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:55,440
you yet just say it how it is I haven't

00:23:53,669 --> 00:23:57,389
met you yet I want to my name is Megan

00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:02,580
and I would strike up conversations with

00:23:57,389 --> 00:24:03,749
people and you know also if you see

00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,399
people that are de standing by

00:24:03,749 --> 00:24:07,230
themselves I just encourage you to talk

00:24:05,399 --> 00:24:10,080
to them we find that that lone person

00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:11,669
the corner just go say hi I say that for

00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,009
two reasons one it could be your next

00:24:11,669 --> 00:24:15,600
customer and two it's really

00:24:14,009 --> 00:24:17,940
intimidating to go to a drupalcon by

00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,769
yourself so when you walk into there and

00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,119
it feels like this family reunion and

00:24:19,769 --> 00:24:24,240
you've been invited but you don't know

00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:25,860
anyone try to break in so you know it's

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,950
just all so being a nice and faster of

00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:30,809
our community and so again when you're

00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:32,340
talking with people try not to sell

00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:35,700
anything people don't love like the hard

00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:38,100
sale but they they do value

00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,629
relationships so you know when you're

00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,980
talking to them find out more about them

00:24:39,629 --> 00:24:42,899
tell them a bit about yourself in your

00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,639
company and ask them what they're

00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:48,139
looking for why they came to drupalcon

00:24:44,639 --> 00:24:50,309
and they might give you some good hooks

00:24:48,139 --> 00:24:51,570
where you can kind of position yourself

00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:55,200
as you get to know them a little bit

00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:57,119
more and another nice trick is

00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,769
everyone's handing out business cards so

00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:01,110
what's going to make someone hold on to

00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:03,539
yours I usually write something on the

00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:06,059
business card and hand it to them it's a

00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:08,460
little bit more personal and they tend

00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:11,759
to hold onto it and of course hold onto

00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:13,590
all of theirs because they within 48

00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,450
hours after the event you can get all

00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:18,779
their names into a spreadsheet and send

00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:20,070
that email out and and hopefully you'll

00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:25,860
start building a pipeline with all those

00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:27,360
contacts so just to recap to get the

00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,340
most out of your sponsorship be

00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,249
proactive define your goal and your

00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:36,059
message get your whole team that's going

00:25:32,249 --> 00:25:37,980
to push that out they are one of your

00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:40,919
channels use social media youth blogs

00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:44,340
use your newsletter do an email campaign

00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:46,379
to your existing database and make sure

00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,749
whatever you're doing it's you have

00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:50,519
defined metrics so that way you really

00:25:48,749 --> 00:25:52,860
know what success looks like to you and

00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:55,279
you can decide afterwards if you achieve

00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:55,279
those goals

00:25:55,400 --> 00:26:02,280
so those are the that's pretty much the

00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:06,020
presentation and if you have any

00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:15,940
similar to the code i sent you for the

00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:18,160
jubilant ticket itself if you post a job

00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:22,720
the job will be available for 30 days

00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:25,720
but you can post a job all the way up to

00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,840
the con itself and even to the last day

00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:32,620
of the cons so the job will be live

00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:35,380
extending past that 30-day period one

00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:37,510

times rather than doing e-mails back and

00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:09,970

multiple days to get a question answer

00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:14,410
