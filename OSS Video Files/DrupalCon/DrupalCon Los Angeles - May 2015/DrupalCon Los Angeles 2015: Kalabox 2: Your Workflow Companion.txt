Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Kalabox 2: Your Workflow Companion
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	One year ago at DrupalCon Austin we announced plans for a new and exciting version of Kalabox. One successful Kickstarter campaign, numerous partnerships and tons of dev hours later we're excited to release the new version. 

Why should you and your team be on Kalabox? To save time and development headaches spinning up new team members or switching out resources. Quit worrying about buggy development environments that fail you during deployment. Code faster than ever before and use our new ecosystem of apps and plugins to easily add tooling or set up certain kinds of apps. Or write your own! And of course the product is Free, Open Source and works on Linux, MacOSX and WINDOWS.

Kalabox 2 sits inbetween tools like Vagrant and Docker. You can provision infrastructure easily with containers but also write plugins to integrate with external services like Pantheon or to add in additional tooling like Drush or Grunt. All of this can be done on the Kalabox CLI or with the Kalabox UI which provides a nice separation between DevOps people and other developers. 

This session will be focused primarily on developers looking to get their teams up and running using the new version of Kalabox. It will also be for people who want to finally end their bad relationship with MAMP. Specifically we will seek to:

Demo running some apps with different kinds of tools or plugins
The Kalabox CLI 
The Kalabox UI
Building your own apps 
Buidling your own plugins
Moving your existing tools out of things like MAMP or Vagrant into Kalabox2
Solving local dev and reaching DevOps zen

sensible integrated workflow solutions

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,359
for all kinds of apps I think that next

00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,260
question that you probably have is

00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:13,440
something around that so dive a little

00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,490
bit deeper so I was actually doing this

00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,719
presentation the other day putting

00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,760
everything together and I stumbled on

00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,100
this blog post by Jeff yearling who I

00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,900
think works at aquia and he had done a

00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,760
really good job kind of describing what

00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,380
the perfect local development

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:29,490
environment has the features that it has

00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:34,350
and these were the nine ones that I kind

00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:36,030
of extracted from it if you were to put

00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:40,500
MAMP up here you get across some of

00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:43,170
these off possibly maybe not but you

00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,120
know usually one technology has a couple

00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,989
one has another but these are these are

00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,910
the things that you would want to have

00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,070
if you want to have a perfect local

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,440
development environment Calla box to

00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:56,309
that as of the COI which is nearly beta

00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,140
has about this many simple and easy to

00:00:56,309 --> 00:00:59,850
set up as you might imagine are probably

00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:04,680
going to be in the GUI version which we

00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:07,080
hope to release in a in a few months so

00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,820
that's kind of where Calla box to sits

00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,799
as like a local development product as

00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,330
an integrated workflow solution it has

00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,280
kind of all these features right now

00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,340
where it's at and when we're finished

00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,840
we'll have all of them so I think that

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,850
we've taken a huge step to solving the

00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,439
local development problem we're not

00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,860
quite there yet but this is about how

00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,270
far we are now many people here are

00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,119
familiar with version one of the product

00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,590
which was you know kind of a quick proof

00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:33,210
of concept that we developed quite a

00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,009
while ago maybe about a year a year and

00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,420
a half ago kind of put it out there to

00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:38,420
test the waters see what things are like

00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,130
it might be a good way to just kind of

00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:47,310
start there and figure out what version

00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:48,600
2 looks like from there the easiest way

00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,399
to say it is that there's basically

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,220
nothing in common between version 1 and

00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,780
version 2 that'll do doesn't contain a

00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,450
bunch of information so I think I'll

00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,439
expand on that a little bit further so

00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:04,079
if you were to construct a not super

00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:05,549
accurate axis of things which is what

00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,910
I've done here just to give you a

00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,440
picture mostly between you know vagrant

00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:12,989
on the left as I get more of a virtual

00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,360
of vm type tool it does do containers

00:02:12,989 --> 00:02:15,400
but

00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,550
think mostly it's virtual machine stuff

00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,930
and docker on the right symbolizing just

00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,910
like containerization and contain our

00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:25,420
technology in general version one was

00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:27,940
essentially just really light wrapper

00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,380
around vagrant we spun up a virtual

00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,420
machine for you we gave you a bunch of

00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:34,980
tools you got what we gave you and if

00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:37,840
you didn't like it you know tough

00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,250
version 2 is much more the darker side

00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,420
of things which means that we get all

00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,750
the features of doctor and

00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,970
containerization which will go into in a

00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,650
little bit rate or depth so from a

00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:52,000
technology standpoint this is kind of

00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:53,380
how things stack up from user experience

00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,880
standpoint you can also think you could

00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:58,000
you could think about cala box that's

00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:59,709
call box to CLI as just a really super

00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,510
fast highly customizable version of

00:02:59,709 --> 00:03:02,770
vagrant for containers like a lot of the

00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:04,030
things that you do on the command line

00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,959
are going to be very similar to what you

00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,550
do with fay current so just dive a

00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:10,930
little bit deeper this is essentially

00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,600
what the cala box one architecture would

00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:16,000
look like you had to run on mac i was

00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:19,870
the only thing that it worked on it spun

00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,790
up a vagrant vm from puppet server which

00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:24,280
was basically just on a boot to 12 0 for

00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,380
instance with our Kalos stack puppet set

00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:28,540
of manifests on top of it and then you

00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,950
just had one big monolithic server your

00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,660
entire infrastructure was in this one

00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:33,130
machine all of your tooling was also in

00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,769
this one machine by tooling I mean

00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:37,330
things like josh or note or whatever and

00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:40,630
you basically just put all your sights

00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:42,459
on top of that that entire stack so you

00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:45,190
had multiple sites running on one

00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:47,320
machine so each site was its own V host

00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,519
essentially and then we had some nice

00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,110
integration with Pantheon where you

00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,730
could pull a site down and I think it

00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:54,940
was fairly easy to use in the GUI as

00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:57,700
well yeah and then we gave you these

00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,780
things in v1 and again like we this is

00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,930
what we gave you if you didn't like it

00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,830
then you are sol version to this a

00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:05,290
little bit different so this is the

00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:09,730
architecture and version 2 as you can

00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:10,900
see it's a lot more fun fun is good so

00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:14,290
in version 2 you can run it on anything

00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:16,299
Windows Mac Linux although I Linux we've

00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:18,100
only tested it on debian based distro so

00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:21,280
if anyone has fedora or if people are

00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:24,729
still using like slackware give it a

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,229
shot I guess so the architecture now is

00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:26,980
we still have a vm but it's basically

00:04:26,229 --> 00:04:28,930
running

00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:30,460
butta daugher if anyone's familiar with

00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:34,200
that it's just a small lightweight vm

00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:36,460
that's based on tiny core linux and

00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,910
we're running the docker demon inside of

00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,020
it and we can spin up containers and run

00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:43,930
certain kinds of apps on these

00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,910
containers so you could have a backdrop

00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:50,200
app that's running on engine X or an

00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:51,820
Apache PHP PHP app server with like

00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,680
Maria or my sequel you could have

00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:56,430
Express on some other containers you

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,740
could have Drupal running you know on a

00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:02,800
cluster of my sequel servers with Retta

00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:04,570
sand memcache and other fun stuff and

00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,860
then with our plug-in architecture which

00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,060
I'll show you later you can provide all

00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,770
these different connectors to different

00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:12,940
services so you could push and pull from

00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:16,230
Pantheon or to aqua or or github or to

00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:18,070
Jack Jenkins thing and do Jenkins things

00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:19,660
one of the really nice things about

00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:22,420
containerisation is allows us to provide

00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:25,090
this kind of wall of separation between

00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,340
the actual infrastructure that's running

00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:30,760
these apps and tooling that developers

00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:33,010
need so we don't put so if you're if

00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:37,360
you're using Drupal with drush as a lot

00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:38,590
of developers do normally that kind of

00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,180
likes it's like in your infrastructure

00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:42,010
like if you're running mamp it's just

00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,360
kind of like on your Mac if you're if

00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:45,070
you're using something like calla stack

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,090
usually you just put it into your web

00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,620
server and that's like where you're

00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:49,360
Rush's or do you have it installed

00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:51,760
locally and you do the the remote thing

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,190
which is also a good a good model but in

00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,830
this model we don't have any tooling in

00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:59,590
our infrastructure so our engine X cert

00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:01,090
wha PHP app server or any of our other

00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,430
containers that might be hosting or

00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:05,410
running a Drupal app the dress does not

00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:07,900
exist inside that container neither does

00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:09,360
grunt or any other set of any any other

00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,070
setup tooling that you might be using

00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,320
what we actually do is we set up

00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:16,270
containers that Ron just are

00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,010
specifically designed to only run drush

00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:20,080
commands so we have ad rush container

00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:22,150
and every single time you run ad rush

00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,490
command it spins itself up it runs a

00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,250
container it attaches your app onto it

00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,720
it runs the command then destroys itself

00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,330
this might seem somewhat excessive just

00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,340
to run ad rush command but the model is

00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:35,050
actually quite nice because now you can

00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,820
write you can have one drush container

00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:38,380
one drush plugin that can work on any of

00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,300
your apps which is really nice so you

00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,480
have this ultimate portability and you

00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,940
know

00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,260
really lose much in the process it also

00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,430
allows you to do fun things that you can

00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,990
have like four different versions of

00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,650
drush in this container if you want and

00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:52,660
you can kind of tell which one to use

00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:54,520
which is pretty cool so much more

00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:56,560
complicated architecture but it provides

00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:59,500
a lot more feature-rich feature richness

00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,860
much more customization options and

00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:06,040
again more fun so just to go back to

00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:08,650
like hard numbers Calla box v1 which was

00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,540
most Wizards Baker based I took about 15

00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:12,070
minutes to install it and that's

00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:14,800
basically like from I have nothing on my

00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:16,480
computer to I have a Drupal website v2

00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,470
with with containers and some other

00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,450
things were able to cut that down to

00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:21,670
five minutes that's like downloading

00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:23,530
downloading the actual CLI running the

00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:27,850
installation and then spinning up an

00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:29,710
appt to compare kind of performance with

00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,970
v1 and vagrant we were using NFS for

00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,370
file sharing if you know anything about

00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:36,210
NFS and file sharing and Drupal it's not

00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:38,350
exactly the funnest thing in the world

00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:39,940
which and that actually really slows

00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:41,860
down the web server performance quite a

00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,120
bit so we're implementing this thing

00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:45,850
that's peer-to-peer connector called

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,140
sync thing which is really neat and that

00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:50,170
actually gives us almost native

00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,060
performance on our on our server or on

00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,650
our containers so you can actually get

00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,850
like if you're installing panoply like

00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:58,630
the time that it takes to run the batch

00:07:54,850 --> 00:08:00,490
API on v1 with six minutes so let's also

00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:02,710
a good approximation for any vagrant

00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:06,490
stack that's using NFS to just two

00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:10,330
minutes on Kalibak stew which is a

00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:11,860
obviously a great improvement again v1

00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:14,110
was basically one monolithic web server

00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:16,240
with sup in it v2 you can have a

00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:17,410
plethora of containers we have ones that

00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,000
we've written that you can use you can

00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,370
write your own fairly easily which I'll

00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,100
show you and then we gave you these like

00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:25,390
approximately 20 tools and v2 basically

00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,700
you can use as many tools until you run

00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:29,740
out of memory which I wouldn't recommend

00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,510
you try to do but you can do that if you

00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:32,680
want and if you do to that please come

00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,120
and find me and show me that you've done

00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,570
it because I'd be interested to see what

00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:40,150
happens the other fun things are windows

00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,710
support how this whole thing works on

00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:43,479
Windows now so people who are using

00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:44,830
Windows congratulations you now have a

00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:49,120
legitimate development tool that you can

00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:52,700
use and people who are on Linux again we

00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,320
only tested it on debian so far so it

00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,420
one who's using fedora or somewhere some

00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,640
other linux distro be great to see like

00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,050
what it actually does we're more than

00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,250
happy to provide support for it but we'd

00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:03,860
like to have someone who actually uses

00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:05,360
that so one of the fun things about

00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,680
Calvin box too as well as it's not

00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,570
triple specific you can actually run

00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,800
kind of whatever you want in it that's

00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:11,120
another advantage of having containers

00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,800
if you wanted to spin up like a mean

00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,210
stack and run express you could do that

00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,880
if you want to run backdrop you could do

00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:19,640
that larval Jekyll WordPress this other

00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,360
thing called Drupal whatever that is you

00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:25,040
could do that as well and the nice thing

00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,750
too is you can actually you can build

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,550
these into repeatable kind of deployable

00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:30,950
prototypes so we've actually developed

00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:32,360
to that you can use right now and I'll

00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,950
show you them back one for backdrop of

00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,180
one for Drupal when you could easily

00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:39,650
write your own so if you were a

00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,420
development shop that you know ran

00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:43,970
mostly Drupal sites and WordPress sites

00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,950
you can make an appt you know that had

00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:47,120
the containers that you want to run that

00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:48,620
you're used to running if you're

00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,270
currently using like puppet or chef or

00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,700
tangible or something you can easily use

00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:56,020
those those manifests and translate them

00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:58,460
into containers and put them into this

00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:59,810
and we can also you can also add

00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,540
additional function to functionality

00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:03,800
with our plug-in layer which I'll show

00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:05,720
you about as well so if you had a

00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,040
workflow where you for example like pull

00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:09,740
your site's down from Pantheon and then

00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:12,520
push them up to github to do you know

00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:14,870
Travis or something you could write that

00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,370
very small app would be like less than

00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:17,840
three hundred lines of code probably

00:10:16,370 --> 00:10:19,160
you'd have to build the containers and

00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:20,870
then you can deploy that to all your

00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,840
devs and that's what they use which is

00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,160
pretty awesome and for right now when we

00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,450
have the GUI out you can think about how

00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:28,340
powerful that will be where you can have

00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:30,440
your DevOps person go in and do this and

00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:31,940
then the kallah box GUI becomes kind of

00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:33,950
your deployment mechanism for all your

00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:37,880
infrastructure and your tooling and

00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:39,590
whatever so again yeah so one of the

00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,910
really fun things about Calla boxes as

00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:43,520
plug-in system I think this is actually

00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:46,430
what gives it quite a bit of power so

00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:49,460
almost everything in cala box the kallah

00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:52,460
box to CLI is customizable or over

00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,630
rideable or extensible i'll go into that

00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,220
kind of specifics and show you that a

00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,840
little bit later but just give you a

00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:58,120
kind of idea of the breadth of the kinds

00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,840
of things that you can do is there's a

00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:03,890
callow box too is a node.js application

00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,300
so there are lots of events that are

00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:06,170
emitted that you can walk into and tap

00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,029
into

00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:09,620
we give you access to quite a bit of

00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:12,350
utilities to spend containers up and

00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,389
down and do that sort of thing so with

00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,670
this you can add like extra commands to

00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:21,200
the CLI you can add integrations with

00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:22,399
other things and you can do that sort of

00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,260
that sort of stuff you can build these

00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,570
apps that I'm describing we actually

00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:28,070
built the container engine as an

00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:30,680
interface so if you wanted to actually

00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,970
try to do this with rocket or lxc

00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,980
directly you could actually write an

00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:37,790
implementation for that so we just chose

00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:42,139
to do docker because well you already

00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:43,370
know so yeah so here we go so this is

00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:44,959
the container this is the interface that

00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,279
I was just describing we implemented

00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,589
docker you could implement other things

00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:50,240
if you wanted but we just chose dr.

00:11:48,589 --> 00:11:52,130
because it seems somewhat adequate us

00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:56,870
right now although who knows what will

00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:58,250
happen things are moving quickly so

00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:59,329
that's what we're using for right now

00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:00,470
that's the back end of pretty much

00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:02,050
everything it's based on the boot to

00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,519
dock or project if you haven't used it

00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:06,199
we give it a little bit more of a of

00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,300
annum for developers it's kind of not

00:12:06,199 --> 00:12:11,570
super useful for Drupal out of the box

00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:14,570
and all this stuff is open source it's

00:12:11,570 --> 00:12:16,910
on our github which just github.com /

00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,870
Calla box there's like 30 projects

00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:19,910
everything that I'm going to talk to

00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:23,060
talk about right now is on there

00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:25,459
somewhere either as a repo or in

00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,750
documentation we also have api docs and

00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:28,940
also they're fun stuff and it's all

00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:30,290
accessible from there so if you are

00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:33,320
taking notes that is the probably the

00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:36,079
most important thing to write down so

00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,660
what does all of this crazy talk mean it

00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,130
means these five things that if you that

00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:42,290
this technology will save everyone tons

00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:46,339
of time you can finally use the tools

00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:50,649
that you deserve mamp is I mean that's

00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:54,140
really all I have to say so you know

00:12:50,649 --> 00:12:55,940
it's it'd be great to you know use use

00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,290
the news modern tools for our local

00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,839
development just like we do in our

00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:01,220
production speaking of production with

00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,899
Kalibak so you can actually achieve some

00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:04,310
up close to production parody if not

00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:05,930
complete production parody depending on

00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:07,399
how you go about doing it this allows

00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:10,220
you to standardize your team and your

00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,720
tools and your flows and of course it's

00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,490
fun to use the latest and greatest tech

00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,920
and not things that were invented in the

00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:20,060
bronze age of the internet again ma'am

00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,590
so this is my like I guess

00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,610
slide that you're not supposed to see

00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:25,850
that reminds me the things that I'm

00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:27,680
supposed to do so let's bump out of this

00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:31,100
and actually start to do some fun stuff

00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:36,470
and let's check to see how far this

00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:38,090
timer is good cool so that's good that's

00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:40,180
always the boring part of everything so

00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:42,410
let's go in and actually try to do stuff

00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:46,910
can all the people in the back actually

00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:48,950
see this kind of or no can I get a is

00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:53,630
that a is that a power to the people or

00:13:48,950 --> 00:14:05,050
a yes yes or power to the people like

00:13:53,630 --> 00:14:05,050
once twice maybe three times a lady see

00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:16,160
all right is that good okay so uh

00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:17,180
Kalibak is an NPM package so I'm not

00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,530
going to install the whole thing from

00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,950
scratch but you would just do an NPM

00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:24,020
install global Calla box to get it I

00:14:20,950 --> 00:14:27,440
already have it here's some fun commands

00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,490
that we give you again I'm not going to

00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,050
go through all of them these because you

00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,980
can read and you can use this thing so

00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,140
I'm just going to kind of get right to

00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:37,040
it which is creating some some apps that

00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:38,900
we can run these these two apps backdrop

00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,030
and Drupal these are two completely

00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,320
separate projects that exist that you

00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,430
can implicate so this is you can

00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,930
implement kind of your own if you want

00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,860
and I'll show you as we spin these up

00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:48,260
I'll kind of show you what these look

00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:51,170
like so you can get a sense of how easy

00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,430
that that is so yeah just go through

00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,730
again real quick actually like so a lot

00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:56,870
of these commands are you know things

00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,240
that you're used to kind of seeing in

00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:01,400
vagrant space they're very similar so

00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,010
let's just start really simply with a

00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:08,360
que box create and will create a Drupal

00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:11,090
7 app like this actually let's do this

00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,070
first so for any command you can pass in

00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:14,180
flag H to get all the options so this

00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:15,920
gives you a sense of the kind of things

00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:19,060
that you can do with this command when

00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,290
this command is over what you'll have is

00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,290
basically two containers a PHP app

00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:26,690
server container and a web certain in a

00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:27,980
Maria DB server and these are kind of

00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,930
the options that you can that you can

00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,370
get it what version up drush you want to

00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:33,930
use the PHP version you want to use

00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:37,440
with one of gold from a local dollar

00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:38,760
file or not all sorts of fun stuff if

00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,589
you don't pass these things in the

00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:44,400
command line will ask you because it is

00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:49,290
considerate so let's go in and actually

00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:52,380
do one of these fun things create true

00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:53,550
pool and I'm passing in this flag I

00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:57,180
which means just to automatically

00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:59,510
install it after I create it so what

00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:03,300
will this app be called let's call it

00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:04,980
awesome then you get some nice options

00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:07,110
like what major version of Drupal are

00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,390
you trying to build an app for i'm just

00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:11,130
going to do seven and it'll give you

00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:12,990
some nice options like Oh what versions

00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,970
of PHP do you want to use it'll give you

00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:17,100
the default probably best version for

00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:20,279
what you're running so if you put Drupal

00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:21,420
6 in there it would give you 5 3 so you

00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:23,339
can choose that and then again you can

00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:25,680
pick a dress version will use trust 6

00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:27,690
for this example and then just some

00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:36,510
other fun stuff like my get name so I'll

00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:40,200
do something like this and but you

00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:41,310
didn't know that this is email so we can

00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,720
see what's happening right now is we've

00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,970
actually pulled in five different

00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,070
plugins that we use on this app I'll go

00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,810
through those in a little bit and now

00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:51,120
it's just pulling some containers from

00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:52,440
the docker registry I've actually

00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,540
already pulled them so they're just

00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,830
going to come down really quick and when

00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,529
this is over we'll have a bunch of

00:16:55,830 --> 00:17:00,089
containers to run our app which will be

00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:02,820
exciting and as this is going on it will

00:17:00,089 --> 00:17:04,770
only take a few seconds I'll just go in

00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,750
and kind of show you what a nap looks

00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:08,730
like so i created this awesome app this

00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:10,829
is the thing that i just created the

00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:13,319
architecture of the app is i wish i

00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:15,689
could make this side thing larger but

00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:17,670
maybe I can't but this is this is big

00:17:15,689 --> 00:17:19,199
though so that's good so the essence of

00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:23,610
someone app and app is also just a note

00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:25,260
project and it's its main meat well

00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:27,150
actually so it has a good normal package

00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:29,070
Jason these are where you grab where you

00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:31,170
can grab specific plugins i'll go into

00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:33,900
plugins a little bit more in a second

00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:35,610
but the main the main action is in this

00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,559
Kalibak JSON file this is where you can

00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:38,910
tell it all kinds of fun stuff for

00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,380
example it's nate the name that you want

00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:43,020
the plugins that you want to implement

00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,790
again we'll go to the second there's

00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,730
this shares ignore directory I'll can

00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:47,620
get into that

00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:49,600
as well but here's kind of like where

00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:52,270
you get to the real the real awesome

00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,250
awesome sauce so here's where you can

00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:56,919
like specify your drush version your PHP

00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:58,840
version this actually allows you to

00:17:56,919 --> 00:18:00,460
inject press flow settings we do the

00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,020
database part for you but if you want to

00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,429
add like additional configuration and

00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,750
stuff you can do that it also will

00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:06,880
inject backdrop settings if you're using

00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,500
for using backdrop here's again the

00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,600
email stuff that we put in here and

00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:13,510
here's the real fun stuff this is the

00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,010
actual this is the actual manifest file

00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,270
I guess you would call it this is where

00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:19,390
they contain this is the containers that

00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:21,549
we're grabbing and using there's just

00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:23,710
two right now this DV container with the

00:18:21,549 --> 00:18:26,470
has Maria and this PHP app server

00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:27,970
container so you might ask where do

00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:30,160
these things come from which would be a

00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:32,440
great question and I'm here to answer it

00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,570
which is that they come from the docker

00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,270
registry right now we've created our own

00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:39,490
PHP app server we've created our own

00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:42,610
Maria DB server and by default this will

00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:44,620
pull from Calub the actual repo is on

00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:45,910
the docket registry it's Kalibak / PHP

00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,260
app server and then the version of

00:18:45,910 --> 00:18:49,720
cattle box that you're running as the

00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:53,650
tag however these are all over rideable

00:18:49,720 --> 00:19:00,160
so if I wanted to do like you know Bob

00:18:53,650 --> 00:19:02,020
and like my FP is front page 98 by the

00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:06,280
way if I wanted to like load my front

00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:12,490
page 98 web server you know tag stable

00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:14,350
or maybe latest would be more fun e you

00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,760
could do that as well or for example if

00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,140
I wanted to add some addition so this is

00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,820
like a very trivial example I was like

00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,590
what a containerized infrastructure for

00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,750
Drupal would look like if I wanted to go

00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:24,880
in here I could also add solar or Redis

00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:27,100
or whatever and pull those containers

00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,540
down as well so you can kind of put

00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:30,970
whatever you want in there it doesn't

00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:33,549
and sometimes you can put seemingly

00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:35,350
arbitrary things in there in the on our

00:19:33,549 --> 00:19:37,780
github pages of Kalibak SAP examples

00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:39,370
repo and in that repo there's a an

00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,200
example of running a Drupal 7 app with

00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:43,330
the hip hop virtual machine what you

00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,380
haven't done is kind of fun or haven't

00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:46,809
done before is kind of fun I would

00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:48,010
recommend you do it I didn't know how to

00:19:46,809 --> 00:19:50,169
set up the hip hop virtual machine at

00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:51,460
all but I found some guy who did and he

00:19:50,169 --> 00:19:53,200
had a docker container and I just

00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:55,510
literally put his thing in there and

00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,850
made a couple of small tweaks and it

00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,790
just worked so you have access to a lot

00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:00,530
of power with us

00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:03,710
one of the other really fun things about

00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:05,960
this too is if you if you're if you are

00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:08,840
almost one hundred percent perfectly

00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,100
happy with our app server but not one

00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,810
hundred percent perfectly happy with it

00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:15,500
you can actually make small changes to

00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:18,290
it or use your own and actually try it

00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:20,090
out so the docker files for all these

00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:22,970
are actually in the repo for the app

00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:24,620
itself so you I could go in here and say

00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:28,100
yeah you know what i think that i think

00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:30,470
that the kallah box maria DB 070 app you

00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:35,330
know DB server is pretty swell but when

00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:37,550
i really want to do is add you know them

00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:40,370
to it to make it the best app server or

00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:43,820
the best DD server ever you could do

00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:45,650
that if you wanted and then restart your

00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,110
app or rebuild your app with this build

00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:49,250
local flag passed in and instead of

00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:50,750
pulling from the repo it would actually

00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:52,850
jet it which actually build it from this

00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,290
file so you can go in and you can play

00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:56,180
around and do all sorts of other things

00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:58,250
so if you wanted to use cala box only to

00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,570
try out docker containers and multiple

00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,610
and orchestrate them like you could do

00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:03,160
it just for that although i think that

00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:06,140
would be some up missing the point

00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:10,520
however feel free to do whatever you

00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:12,110
want to do of course so that's basically

00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:14,990
the architecture here this is other

00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:16,940
small key here this basically just lets

00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:20,300
our reverse proxy which is hip a chi

00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:22,070
know that this is an app this is a a web

00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:25,640
server and to like redirect things to

00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:26,750
this machine for this app so that's all

00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,740
good and fun again you could add

00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,800
additional containers you can do

00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:34,790
whatever so this is already done so we

00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:38,210
have an app that's been installed and we

00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:40,310
go into we called it awesome so now if

00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:42,290
we just do a que box start this will

00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:44,540
actually spit up all the containers to

00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:46,730
get our app running so there's more so

00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:50,810
it actually will spin up more than just

00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:52,550
the app server and the DB server it'll

00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,680
also spin up all these support services

00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,760
and instantiate sync thing which is the

00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,340
thing that will actually sink your code

00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,320
back and forth there's actually four

00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:03,950
containers that run by default just to

00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,390
power the whole magic of cala box one is

00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,550
apache which functions as a reverse

00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:12,000
proxy so that way you can like actually

00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:14,970
type in you know my awesome app k box

00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,570
and have it be directed to the correct

00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:20,250
container and then there's two other two

00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,570
of the things DNS mass just to handle

00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,790
the actual resolution if you've ever

00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:25,290
tried to do anything like this and

00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:27,300
you've managed tried to manually manage

00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:30,330
etsy hosts that is like tantamount to

00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:32,280
suicide so having some of the DNS mask

00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:34,080
is actually quite nice and then we have

00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,850
two special things sky dns and sky dock

00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,080
which are darker specific containers and

00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,700
those four things are actually

00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,350
completely over rideable too so if you

00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,870
wanted to build your own custom version

00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:45,480
of cala box and have engine X as your

00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:48,570
reverse proxy or just a random container

00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:50,340
that prints out hello world forever you

00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:52,200
could do that I think that second use

00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:55,590
case is probably what a lot of you are

00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:57,330
thinking already on how to use this so

00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:59,580
at this point we have a container we

00:22:57,330 --> 00:23:01,200
have two containers running and we have

00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:04,350
a we have infrastructure that is

00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,840
prepared to receive a payload of Drupal

00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:11,400
awesomeness which we will grab and put

00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:13,560
in there from someplace so I'm going to

00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,390
grab just the Pantheon drop seven repo

00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,920
the reason why I'm doing this is because

00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,390
we have a plug-in for press flow

00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,150
settings in this way we don't have to do

00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:24,630
any settings about PHP management which

00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:26,880
obviously is also nice so what I'm going

00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:27,960
to do right now is run k box again and

00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:31,470
what we're going to see is that we get

00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:34,530
all these other fun things inside of

00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:36,350
this app so we have we have commands

00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:38,430
that are specific address to this app

00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:40,800
plus the other commands that you saw

00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:42,630
before some of the ones sorry I can't

00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,560
actually read this because this thing is

00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:48,750
in the way but so you get extra stuff

00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:50,100
that are provided by these plugins and

00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:54,900
I'll go into the plugins in a little bit

00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:57,480
so things like drush things like get our

00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:00,360
sink other fun things so we're going to

00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,640
use the git plugin really quick so which

00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,920
will be K box get clone I'm going to

00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,850
depth one because we're in conference

00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,960
why I finally want to download the

00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:11,220
entire history of Drupal and we're just

00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,650
going to do this so what's actually

00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,450
happening when this happens is we're

00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:17,460
spinning up a container that's only

00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:19,110
purpose is to run this get command it's

00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:20,490
attaching our app onto it it's actually

00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:23,670
pulling the code down and then

00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:24,840
destroying itself so you actually don't

00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,690
want to so one of the nice things about

00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,860
this is we act

00:24:25,690 --> 00:24:29,019
there's actually nothing that you really

00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,700
need to put on your computer everything

00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:33,220
is just inside of the vm including all

00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,870
your tools that you normally use which

00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,490
actually becomes quite nice because if

00:24:34,870 --> 00:24:39,309
you extend this model to things like

00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:40,570
grunt or node or whatever now you have a

00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:42,220
way to make sure that everyone literally

00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:43,600
is always using the same thing in the

00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:47,139
same environment which is obviously

00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:52,809
going to be awesome for you so we have

00:24:47,139 --> 00:24:54,279
drupal now let's go to I guess awesome

00:24:52,809 --> 00:24:56,559
awesome was the name of the thing

00:24:54,279 --> 00:25:00,399
awesome dot barely gonna read this

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:09,759
awesome k box and here we go here's

00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:11,139
drupal yay drupal um so yeah yeah i mean

00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:14,649
the beauty of drupal should never be

00:25:11,139 --> 00:25:18,700
concealed of course it does a good

00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:20,139
enough job with itself i suppose so yeah

00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,659
let's go through here we're just going

00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:24,460
to install Drupal 7 really quickly you

00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:26,799
can see that this is like fairly snappy

00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:30,850
to do which is which is pretty nice and

00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:32,080
then we can just bounce around and try

00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:36,399
some things out really quick so you can

00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:42,909
see that there's fun things happening so

00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:46,149
let's just call this I awesome site and

00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:50,019
I'll put my email in there and we'll

00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:55,769
make a secure admin username with

00:25:50,019 --> 00:25:59,980
password that is also very secure and I

00:25:55,769 --> 00:26:02,830
think that we're in the US and we don't

00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:07,179
want to receive email and I don't know

00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:09,340
what that is and yeah here's Drupal out

00:26:07,179 --> 00:26:12,490
of the box and you can see that it's

00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:16,480
nice and quick much faster than you

00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:24,029
might expect for something else that is

00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:26,519
local other unspeakable things what's it

00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:28,109
I don't kid begin and end up lots of

00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:32,809
things but that might be one of the

00:26:28,109 --> 00:26:37,649
choices so yeah so let's just go to our

00:26:32,809 --> 00:26:39,809
step Oh Rex we don't need that let's

00:26:37,649 --> 00:26:42,359
just go to our PHP info file real quick

00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:43,859
which is somewhere in here right so

00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:45,029
here's our PHP info file this will just

00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:47,190
tell us some fun things about our

00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:48,690
instance and let's just figure out how

00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:52,529
we can go about maybe changing some of

00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:54,450
these things really quickly for fun so

00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:57,809
as you saw before in our app example we

00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:59,279
have this nice version thing so we could

00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:00,599
switch that out and rebuild the app

00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,509
really quickly and get a different

00:27:00,599 --> 00:27:04,549
version of PHP so if you have

00:27:02,509 --> 00:27:06,989
requirements like that you could do that

00:27:04,549 --> 00:27:08,940
which is pretty fun the PHP app server

00:27:06,989 --> 00:27:10,559
that we have actually contains a bunch

00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:12,089
of versions of PHP inside of it so you

00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,469
can kind of specify whichever version

00:27:12,089 --> 00:27:16,229
you want it'll pick though it'll pick

00:27:13,469 --> 00:27:18,749
the one that you're using the other fun

00:27:16,229 --> 00:27:20,309
thing is we actually have almost all of

00:27:18,749 --> 00:27:22,519
the configuration that's relevant to you

00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:25,499
for your services exposed to the outside

00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:27,509
so in the actual code directory here you

00:27:25,499 --> 00:27:31,619
get things like you're a PC config or

00:27:27,509 --> 00:27:35,279
your php.ini or your wwwcom which is the

00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:36,899
fpm pool and your dress alias and you

00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,179
can go in here and change a bunch of

00:27:36,899 --> 00:27:40,769
these things and rebuild your server and

00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:42,299
get that stuff to take really quickly so

00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:44,820
you don't have to like actually SSH into

00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:46,889
anything and like dick around with them

00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:50,609
or nano or whatever those things are

00:27:46,889 --> 00:27:52,200
that crazy people do and and do that you

00:27:50,609 --> 00:27:53,909
can just change it in like a nice pretty

00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,359
thing like this on your Mac using the

00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:58,799
things that you like to use so let's do

00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:00,570
that really quickly let's say that we

00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:05,309
just like really need a little bit extra

00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:08,070
from our HPC let's go in here and you

00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:10,589
know maybe this is a lot and we don't

00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:13,649
need that much so let's just bump it

00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:15,029
down a little bit and then we really

00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:17,159
think it's important to inject some

00:28:15,029 --> 00:28:20,279
special environmental variables into

00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:23,929
this because we think that that's going

00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:23,929
to make everything better

00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:37,450
alright so we've done this and now we're

00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:40,000
going to do this fancy k box rebuild

00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:43,210
command and again as I was saying before

00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,700
you could actually you could actually

00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:47,530
pass this build local thing in so if you

00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,240
wanted to oh actually sorry we actually

00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:51,130
didn't even switch out this version of

00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:55,540
PHP either so let's let's say we want to

00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:57,520
downgrade because we do so we'll do that

00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:59,200
as well but if you did this rebuild

00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,790
command all these things will take but

00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,450
you could also go in and use that build

00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:07,090
local thing and and do an add your women

00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:08,560
or whatever you want to do so you can

00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:10,330
rebuild in lots of ways so it's really

00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:12,190
easy to change stuff around and it

00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:15,280
happens fairly quickly because we're not

00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:17,440
rebuilding monolithic VMs from puppet

00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:21,430
manifests or whatever people are doing

00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:23,080
these days so yeah well just do a cable

00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:25,120
to rebuild and what it will do is it

00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:26,980
will stop everything and then it will

00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,270
pull it'll destroy all the containers

00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,190
that we're running except for the one

00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:32,170
that has our data in it and then it will

00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:34,630
reskin all them up with all these

00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:36,340
changes in place so when this is done we

00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:40,360
should be able to rego to that info file

00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:42,520
and it will have PHP 5.3 and it will

00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,080
have the different settings and all of

00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:46,810
our stuff and it's going to be nice and

00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,090
awesome and while that's happening I'll

00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:51,310
go in and show you kind of what these

00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:53,620
plugins look like really quick so

00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:55,330
plugins are ways to extend your extend

00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:58,390
Calla box in fact we dog through the

00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:59,980
entire system for the CLI itself so I'll

00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:02,620
just show you a really brief example of

00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:04,390
one you can add them to all of your apps

00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:07,030
really easily so for example we have a

00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:08,890
Drudge plugin we have that same drush

00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:12,940
plugin is what we use for drupal 6

00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:14,200
triple 7 drupal 8 for backdrop we have a

00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,520
git plugin you would theoretically

00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,690
probably want to use that for all of

00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,580
your apps and no matter what you're

00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,560
actually doing whether it's a node

00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:23,560
application or a PHP application or what

00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:25,600
have you and they're very simple so I'll

00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,670
just show you a brief example of the get

00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,260
one do not be intimidated by a lot of

00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:31,090
those files are mostly just like for CI

00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:35,920
and testing the meat is actually just

00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:37,850
this index dot JSP and this docker file

00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:39,740
the docker file basically just defined

00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:41,360
a container and this container

00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,770
essentially run this container

00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,780
essentially functions as a get

00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:46,460
executable itself so even though it is a

00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,630
container and has a service inside of it

00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:51,500
you can kind of think about it just as

00:30:47,630 --> 00:30:54,970
it get executable so that's kind of how

00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:57,559
that works the rest is in this index jsf

00:30:54,970 --> 00:31:00,440
this sort of structure where you get

00:30:57,559 --> 00:31:03,650
this k box object and the k box object

00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:06,260
has a lot of fun stuff in it and all

00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:08,450
that you can find at API Kalibak me

00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:10,490
which is nice you can see the kinds of

00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:13,250
things you'll have access to certain

00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:15,650
config the actual engine itself so you

00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:16,909
can spin containers up and down the

00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:18,530
event to run time so you can actually

00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:23,270
hook into events so if you wanted to

00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:25,130
like say print a Beatles lyric after

00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:27,380
your appt gets spun up because it really

00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:30,049
just guess you're ready to do your stuff

00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:31,490
you can do that and if you do I would

00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:33,350
submit that would suggest you submit

00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:34,640
that as a kallah box plug into the NPM

00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:38,780
registry so other people can get that

00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:40,250
functionality as well yeah so api doc

00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:42,350
Kalibak stop me that you can get that

00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:43,760
through the github repo as well but all

00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:47,120
the things are documented so you can

00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,740
start to write your own fun stuff we'll

00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,520
go back to the get thing but it looks

00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:55,010
like this is done so let's hope we

00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:58,280
actually have to start it also so we'll

00:31:55,010 --> 00:32:00,590
start that and then go back to this this

00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,850
thing so that K box object all the stuff

00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:04,460
that was in that documentation is this

00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:06,770
thing right here this allows you to get

00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:08,390
a bunch of a bunch of stuff so the

00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:10,429
structure is pretty simple there's only

00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:12,140
like 100 lines of code and this is what

00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:14,179
allows us to spin up and run git

00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,919
commands so for 100 lines of code we

00:32:14,179 --> 00:32:17,539
have an appt we have sorry we have a

00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,950
plug-in and a container that can run git

00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:20,419
commands on any of the apps that we want

00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:23,059
to have which is super fun and super

00:32:20,419 --> 00:32:24,500
awesome and it's very easy to do so for

00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:26,120
example when we were looking at that

00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:28,580
list of tasks before the command line

00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,950
print out we had that get a command that

00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,510
we could run this is this is that that

00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:34,100
part right there we have a framework

00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,750
that you can use this task framework we

00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:38,690
can easily add other commands so we

00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:40,340
added this kit command and basically

00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:43,070
just runs this run git command function

00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:44,450
which we define further up here we also

00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:45,890
do some fun things so like here's like

00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:48,230
the events system that we're using

00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:49,580
there's this post install event so when

00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,020
you install this Drupal app it's also

00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,060
saying oh hey like I need

00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:56,210
I need this get container also like it's

00:32:53,060 --> 00:33:00,110
pretty important so grab it and install

00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:01,580
it for me as well so you can you can

00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:03,800
actually get the tools you need on all

00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:06,680
these apps to here's the actual run

00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,840
engine run which is accessible in all

00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:10,100
the plugins so here's the actual magic

00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,600
that we're happening here's the get

00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,210
username and get email that we entered

00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,430
earlier we're sharing our SSH directory

00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:17,930
so we can get our keys we're sharing the

00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:19,970
data container which actually has our

00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:21,500
code and stuff in it so every time this

00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,610
every time this thing runs it's just

00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,740
running a git command in the container

00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:26,630
with all this stuff we need as we showed

00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:31,090
you when we pull down that that Drupal

00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:35,690
code earlier so let's keep going on

00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:37,310
let's see what were we doing oh yeah we

00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:39,950
have this app so we've restarted this

00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:42,320
app and now if we refresh this info page

00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:44,030
we can see that the version has changed

00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:50,090
which is nice we can see that we boosted

00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:53,210
our APC up by 11 add a bookmark what's

00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:56,900
happening there we go yeah so we can see

00:33:53,210 --> 00:34:00,290
the APC went up by one unit of meg or I

00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:04,430
guess two units of meg that's fun and

00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:06,170
our PHP info oh sorry we changed our

00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:10,490
memory limit so we can see that bump got

00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:12,200
bumped down and then we added that

00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:14,030
really awesome environmental variable so

00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:16,330
we can all be on the same page about the

00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:18,679
awesomeness factor which is face-melting

00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:20,179
so it's really easy to go in and like

00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:21,919
change your stuff around we've provided

00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:23,090
same defaults but you can go in and you

00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:24,980
can you can change these things really

00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:27,380
easily it's a lot easier than having to

00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:29,630
reprovision a whole machine you can do

00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:34,399
it in a matter of seconds which is

00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:36,649
obviously helpful so let's let's

00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:38,240
continue on and maybe look at this drush

00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:40,040
example really quickly oh actually this

00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:44,390
so this is this is a very very simple

00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:46,190
example very small amount of code this

00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:48,820
essentially just adds press flow

00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:50,720
settings and backdrop settings

00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:52,730
automatically to all the apps and

00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:53,929
containers that you have so that they

00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:55,490
know that they don't need to use

00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:59,060
settings on PHP so you could use this

00:34:55,490 --> 00:35:02,330
for any of your drupal apps as well the

00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:04,230
dress example looks very similar to the

00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:05,670
get one

00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:07,410
so a little bit longer but not that much

00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:09,900
longer we just define a new task called

00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:12,240
rush and it does this run drush command

00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:15,330
thing with the drudge container itself

00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,070
which looks essentially like this which

00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:18,600
is we actually just copy from the PHP

00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:20,490
app server itself which means that those

00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,990
two things are exactly the same so when

00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:24,000
we change that PHP version and our

00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:26,010
config and I run ad rush command we know

00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,150
it's the same version that Russia's run

00:35:26,010 --> 00:35:28,350
with the same version that our app

00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:30,660
server is running with which is

00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:32,970
obviously helpful and can alleviate pain

00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:34,350
down the road so we're just grabbing the

00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:35,880
app server container and adding drush

00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:37,680
things to it and that's what we're using

00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:40,800
so this actually has four versions of

00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,440
Russian it for major five six seven and

00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:49,350
backed rush which is like a hacky thing

00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:50,730
that sometimes works on backdrop so so

00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:52,230
yeah I'll just show you like running at

00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:53,490
running a so if we're in the app here

00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:56,490
and we just do like a box and rush

00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:58,050
status now we don't have to have drush

00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:01,020
like anywhere on our stuff and it'll

00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:03,300
actually run and give us our our stuff

00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:06,869
as we're running it natively which is

00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:11,130
pretty sweet we can also go in and see

00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:13,530
that we provided a some options as well

00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:15,119
so if you if you really wanted to just

00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:16,650
like try things on different versions

00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,990
like you could do this sort of thing so

00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:24,420
if we just do josh status again and pass

00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:26,160
in drush version equals 5 this should

00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,859
run with josh 5 now instead of drush 6

00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,210
which you can see it is five dot 11 so

00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:31,619
this is kind of the power of having

00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,910
these portable containers you can run

00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:34,680
these different versions of different

00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:37,920
things and they're super portable you

00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:39,359
can put them kind of wherever so lots

00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:43,680
and lots and lots of power in this sort

00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:45,180
of this sort of architecture so you can

00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:47,490
imagine you know if you're if you're a

00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:49,140
drupal shop or an organization that's

00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:50,970
using like vagrant or something else

00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:53,550
like you can really simplify a lot of

00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:56,670
your stuff you can deploy it faster you

00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:59,280
can change things faster and benefit

00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:02,730
quite a bit and of course your your

00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,619
actual development itself will be a lot

00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:08,490
faster as you can see by toes bouncing

00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:10,770
around here quite fast the last thing I

00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:14,670
guess that I can show you that is also

00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:16,100
fun is so inside of this inside of the

00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:17,890
app director you also get this code

00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:20,380
directory which is actually

00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:21,970
your drupal code lives so this is synced

00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:27,820
through really quickly so if I were to

00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:34,930
go in and just edit like where is it

00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:40,630
index on PHP and just say like something

00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:47,290
like this okay so right and maybe

00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:49,450
purchase sublime don't tell anybody you

00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:51,640
know then kick back to our Drupal app we

00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:53,230
should see that that is now the robots

00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:55,060
have taken over so that's just how you

00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:56,500
edit your code so it's actually nice

00:37:55,060 --> 00:38:00,250
about this or you can think about this

00:37:56,500 --> 00:38:02,140
you know into playable terms like now

00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:05,140
you have an entire repo that has not

00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:07,360
only your app configuration in it but

00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:09,370
also your code so you could actually put

00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,780
this in github or somewhere somewhere

00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:13,480
else I don't know bitbucket or whatever

00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:16,210
other people do I don't I think it's

00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,410
just github really I mean but so you

00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,910
could put it online and you can base to

00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:20,560
have all your developers just grab it

00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:23,020
all they have to do is pull it down runk

00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,160
a box install k box start and they have

00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:26,350
their they have their app with all their

00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:27,610
stuff and that's great so you could do

00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:28,930
that as a deployment kind of like

00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:32,530
strategy for right now which i think is

00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:35,770
pretty neat so that's kind of the meat

00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:37,360
of it I think time is starting to

00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:40,000
dwindle a little bit and I think I think

00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:43,480
questions might be nice so I'll just

00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,400
kick back to the prezo oh yeah let's

00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,540
talk about things to come yeah so this

00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:49,600
is basically everything that we have for

00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:52,270
right now I would consider it in almost

00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,650
beta for the CLI these are the things

00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:55,690
that we still have left to do that will

00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:57,640
make this the solution to all the local

00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:58,960
development problems so these are the

00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,420
things we're working on for the next I

00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,220
guess half a year which is to do push

00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:06,460
and pull integration with Pantheon and

00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:08,020
Microsoft Asia and WordPress support for

00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:09,970
people who are using wordpress also

00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:13,360
which maybe some of you and maybe not be

00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:14,560
some of you so one of the big things

00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,820
that we had don't have we haven't done

00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:18,280
yet which i think is going to be a real

00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:20,470
awesome real piece of awesomeness is

00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,200
this idea of pushing and pulling so when

00:39:20,470 --> 00:39:24,310
you create an app you also say oh yeah I

00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,290
want to create this app with all these

00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:27,880
containers and all this fun stuff but i

00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:29,080
also want to get my site from pantheon

00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,850
or i want to get it from aqua or when I

00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,660
get it from some other place and you can

00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:33,520
pass in those

00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,990
options as well and it'll pull the site

00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,250
down and build the whole thing for you

00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:37,809
right now you have to like pull your

00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:40,089
code down and set up your database which

00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:41,470
is kind of a pain so we'll be we'll be

00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:43,210
providing that sort of thing and those

00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:45,099
will all be plugins too so if you're an

00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:46,900
organization who has a weird deployment

00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:48,940
sort of scenario you can pull from

00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:51,369
multiple places and push to multiple

00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,930
places for example of cali Munna we have

00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:55,630
standardizing we use basically Pantheon

00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:57,130
for almost all of our stuff but we push

00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:59,440
a lot of our stuff to get up so we can

00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:01,630
do github flow and use Travis and that

00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:05,109
sort of stuff so at some point will

00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:07,359
create a Calvin Munna app which we all

00:40:05,109 --> 00:40:08,920
use internally akala Munna and that will

00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:10,569
have like all the containers that we use

00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,039
it will have solar on red as the things

00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:13,750
that we're used to having locally and

00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:15,430
then we'll have integration to pull

00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:17,710
sites from Pantheon and push to github

00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:19,420
and that will be the Kalam Luna app and

00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,470
actually speaking of apps i can show you

00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:23,380
what those look like really quickly

00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:25,450
because those are all customized

00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:27,069
customizable as well so I maybe I'll

00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:31,869
just go to github page because my

00:40:27,069 --> 00:40:36,839
sublime seems weird so so when when we

00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:40,029
create this Drupal app see I think it's

00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:42,760
app Drupal or maybe look at the backdrop

00:40:40,029 --> 00:40:45,160
one so this is what enables us to just

00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,500
do a backdrop create or create backdrop

00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:49,750
really quickly it's a small plug in it's

00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,130
a plugin like any other plug-in and it

00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:54,730
basically could just contains metadata

00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:56,410
which is you basically just define

00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:57,910
certain tasks like hey I want to create

00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:59,740
this thing called back this backdrop

00:40:57,910 --> 00:41:01,599
task and I want to like have these via

00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:04,329
options that are available to the user

00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,799
and then eventually and then you

00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:10,619
basically just build a skeleton of the

00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:14,079
app in this apps folder no where is it

00:41:10,619 --> 00:41:15,910
back here so this is what contains the

00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:17,470
actual like the package out Jason and

00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,869
Kalibak saw Jason and the config the

00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:20,920
docker files that we saw in the example

00:41:18,869 --> 00:41:22,720
that's basically all you have to do like

00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,099
i was able after I made the Drupal 7 app

00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:26,500
I was able to make the backdrop one in

00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:29,829
like seven minutes which is pretty nice

00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:31,210
and if you're a you know an org or shop

00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:33,339
that wants to like customize these

00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:35,140
things it's actually quite easy you can

00:41:33,339 --> 00:41:38,740
override all the stuff in the kallah box

00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:41,049
config with with a flat JSON file so all

00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:43,490
you would need to do is go in here this

00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:50,810
is just a list of the config

00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:53,960
actually oops k bucks config less yay so

00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:56,180
here's our config so all you would have

00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,860
to do is actually start this gives me a

00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:01,570
lot of configs I'm inside the app so

00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:04,369
let's bounce out of it let's do this

00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:05,750
there we go so you can actually see up

00:42:04,369 --> 00:42:07,610
here here are the apps that we are

00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:09,020
actually like using that's the github

00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:11,570
project that we're pulling from it's

00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:13,880
actually an from the NPM registry but

00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:16,520
you can make your own you know cowell

00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:20,360
box app you know for kitchens or

00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:22,100
whatever and you could put that on

00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:24,530
github create a node project with it and

00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:26,330
just edit this or override this file

00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:27,920
with like your app and your version and

00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:29,869
it'll pull it down and you can you can

00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,610
spit up your app sites really easily so

00:42:29,869 --> 00:42:34,310
you can see the kind of power that this

00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:35,240
model has so that's just want to show

00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:38,780
you what the apps look like really

00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:39,860
quickly because they're quite simple so

00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,820
yeah let's get back to the roadmap

00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:43,460
really quick and then we'll do some

00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:46,100
questions yeah so the things that we're

00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:47,480
trying to do next our integration with

00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:49,119
pantheon so you can push them pull sites

00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:53,210
to pantheon when you create these apps

00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:55,670
asier wordpress and we're hoping to have

00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:57,470
all that stable version summer 2015 so

00:42:55,670 --> 00:43:00,500
not very far away we're actually very

00:42:57,470 --> 00:43:02,450
close to having that already so that's

00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,369
the exciting thing that's going to be

00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:05,780
like DevOps is n I think for everyone

00:43:04,369 --> 00:43:07,010
who's liked using vagrant currently or

00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:08,690
any command line tool what hands is

00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:11,869
going to be a much better way to do our

00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:13,310
stuff and faster way to do our stuff and

00:43:11,869 --> 00:43:15,200
then the big thing after that is that is

00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:17,030
the actual you I so this will be what

00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,790
we've kind of basically the kallah box

00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:21,380
to version of what the v1 you I was and

00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:23,780
this is where things are really going to

00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:26,240
be very very different this is when a

00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:28,310
DevOps person can write all can use

00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,020
Kalibak stew right you know the kinds of

00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:32,840
apps and tooling and stuff that their

00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:34,670
shop needs and then they can edit that

00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:36,470
config file get all that get all the

00:43:34,670 --> 00:43:39,020
stuff that they need and to pull all

00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:41,300
those tools to all of their people with

00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:42,920
the GUI so they don't really have to do

00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:44,600
anything you can standardize everything

00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,190
really easily and of course you have a

00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:48,410
cross-platform solution that all your

00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:50,030
developers can be on it's not tied to

00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:52,430
anything it's not Drupal specific you

00:43:50,030 --> 00:43:55,220
could do it for whatever so I think this

00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:57,200
is a win for everyone and that will be

00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:58,579
in fall 2015 if

00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,990
you contributed to the Kickstarter last

00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:03,320
year first of all thank you very much

00:43:59,990 --> 00:44:05,060
and second of all like we'll have betas

00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:08,869
of this GUI available for testing before

00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:12,290
this if you're wondering so again just

00:44:08,869 --> 00:44:14,570
to rehash these five things you know

00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:15,800
we're very close to solving this problem

00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:17,839
for people we think it's going to be

00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,160
much much better than mant much better

00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,720
than vagrant much better than anything

00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,099
else that's out there it's going to be

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,780
the thing to use I think it's going to

00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:28,240
be a big deal and if you're interested

00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:30,290
that's right yes now you have the power

00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:33,890
thank you to Andrew malice for finding

00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:35,660
this gift somewhere and if you're

00:44:33,890 --> 00:44:36,890
looking to hear more or this is to

00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:38,930
figure out whether like your

00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:41,359
organization is may be ready to start

00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:43,160
moving over to some of this tech set up

00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,680
a demo with us if you're here at the

00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:47,980
comm we can do it at the con if not we

00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:50,599
can do it some other time in the ether

00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:54,410
with the google hangouts or the other

00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:56,359
things that the crazy kids are doing and

00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:57,550
that's basically it so there's any

00:44:56,359 --> 00:45:00,829
questions I'd love to answer them

00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:02,750
hopefully there are or should be if not

00:45:00,829 --> 00:45:05,990
I will be very disappointed and I will

00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:07,400
you will all be dead to me forever yes

00:45:05,990 --> 00:45:14,089
there's a microphone back there if you

00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:16,099
want to use it so let's say you switch

00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:18,050
the recipe down from five point three to

00:45:16,099 --> 00:45:21,440
five point five min PHP and you've made

00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:23,270
some a PC X and then go down to using up

00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:25,040
cash now so what happens with those

00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:26,690
settings they get discarded or you keep

00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,250
that container right so if you pick

00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:31,220
right it's a good question so if you

00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:32,839
were to if you were to go into so first

00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,190
of all this is root this is fun project

00:45:32,839 --> 00:45:36,530
that we did to actually enable us to

00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:38,540
build this app server which might be

00:45:36,530 --> 00:45:40,400
also just useful for casual devops

00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:42,980
people who are parkour devops people

00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:46,300
which is this PHP Brewer project which

00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:48,619
is also on the Kalibak sigit hub repo

00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:51,230
this is essentially a PHP app server

00:45:48,619 --> 00:45:54,950
factory which lets you build from source

00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:59,079
different versions of PHP sorry I can't

00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:59,079
read this like so small on my computer

00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:03,740
there it is PHP brewers since what we

00:46:02,569 --> 00:46:06,890
use to actually build the app server

00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:08,660
it's really quite nice it's basically a

00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:10,190
doctor into container that spits out PHP

00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:10,670
versions there's good documentation it's

00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:12,800
easy to

00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:15,020
you can build kind of basically whatever

00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,340
versions of PHP you want you can build

00:46:15,020 --> 00:46:17,690
more than one they all kind of sit

00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:20,000
together then you can use those and your

00:46:17,690 --> 00:46:20,990
other containers which is pretty nice so

00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,670
that's what we're doing so the way that

00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:26,630
is set up is if you were to switch from

00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:29,210
53 to 55 we're not using a PC and 55

00:46:26,630 --> 00:46:30,830
raising off cash we don't actually have

00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:32,360
any op we don't have a help cash config

00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:33,470
file right now but you could put one in

00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:35,690
there and have it kind of work the same

00:46:33,470 --> 00:46:38,090
way but by default right now it'll it'll

00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:40,220
just disable PK there's no a PC

00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:42,320
extension for 55 in our app server so it

00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:44,690
just doesn't get loaded up cash gets

00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:55,670
loaded instead of a pc yeah that's a

00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:57,770
good question yeah nice t-shirt so you

00:46:55,670 --> 00:47:00,470
showed how to do like a new drupal

00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:02,420
install from what would you do if you

00:47:00,470 --> 00:47:04,430
had an existing code base in existing

00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:05,960
database that you wanted to just set up

00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:08,810
using this right that's a great question

00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:10,700
so genre black is sitting right there

00:47:08,810 --> 00:47:14,810
wrote this nice quick start guide that's

00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:16,970
on our wiki that shows you how to get to

00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:20,030
how to currently import a site manually

00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:22,570
into Calla box I showed you how to do

00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:25,280
the get part of it that's fairly easy

00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:26,900
but the DB is actually exposed to the

00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,580
outside world and you can actually

00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:29,900
access it with like sequel pro or

00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:33,320
whatever so I would be the way to get DB

00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:35,530
in there but yeah katal box / kao box in

00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:37,400
the wiki there is a quick start guide

00:47:35,530 --> 00:47:39,140
somewhere there's actually quite a quite

00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,890
a nice bottom out of things in here for

00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:44,210
anyone who's interested in learning more

00:47:41,890 --> 00:47:45,470
but yeah there's quick start guide this

00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:47,180
basic will tell you just how to get like

00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:49,340
a for example I got Pantheon site into

00:47:47,180 --> 00:47:51,110
cal box too but this should be

00:47:49,340 --> 00:48:00,020
applicable to many other many other use

00:47:51,110 --> 00:48:02,930
cases as well hi well first of all I

00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:05,510
wanted to say this is so cool you're so

00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:09,020
much ahead of anyone in the field and I

00:48:05,510 --> 00:48:10,640
ran into your session by really just an

00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:13,580
accident because it was named something

00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,710
not related to begin blocker devil else

00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:18,410
I thought it's a boy all I can tell

00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:20,600
Michael think my question is you

00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:22,950
mentioned that this will be

00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:24,839
cross-platform some windows

00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:27,510
back in Linux I'm sure you cover that

00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:29,880
too much so can you elaborate on the

00:48:27,510 --> 00:48:32,910
what is being used for windows and mac

00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:35,760
and specifically around syncing code

00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:38,640
like sync folders sure and the

00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:43,050
performance of the those solutions right

00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:44,640
yeah sure so cross-platform it's a it's

00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:46,800
a note it's a node module so it works

00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,890
kind of just that way from command line

00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:51,630
it should work on Windows and Linux

00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:54,060
we've tested windows 7 and windows 8

00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:55,859
we've tested debian and ubuntu we

00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:56,970
haven't tried fedora yet it seems to

00:48:55,859 --> 00:48:58,500
work pretty consistently on Mac as well

00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,359
so you could you can you can follow the

00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,890
install steps in the wiki for cow box

00:49:00,359 --> 00:49:04,230
the command line of cala box and it

00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:05,790
should just work on all those things of

00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:08,010
course like we develop mostly on matts

00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:09,570
so they're likely are going to be more

00:49:08,010 --> 00:49:10,770
bugs and the other things but we're

00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:14,310
waiting for people to use it and find

00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:16,260
them so we can try to fix them for the

00:49:14,310 --> 00:49:17,940
GUI side of it because this is node we

00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:19,380
can actually build an angular app on top

00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:20,579
of it with node WebKit and we actually

00:49:19,380 --> 00:49:22,680
have a prototype of that that already

00:49:20,579 --> 00:49:24,420
works on Windows and Linux and so the

00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:26,280
GUI will be this node WebKit app it'll

00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:28,230
be a dot app file for your Mac it'll be

00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:31,140
a dot exe on Windows and I'll just be a

00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:33,390
bin on Linux so that will be how those

00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:35,819
things work regarding sync thing which

00:49:33,390 --> 00:49:37,440
is what we're using for the actual file

00:49:35,819 --> 00:49:39,599
sharing we try to implement with NFS

00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,300
first and it was just ridiculously slow

00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:44,490
like depressingly slow we're just like

00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:46,109
we can't use this it's we can't go up

00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:47,700
there in front of people and show them

00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:49,920
this because it's going to it's going to

00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:51,300
be embarrassing that's kind of how slow

00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:52,530
it was so we looked around for a bunch

00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,660
of things we found sync thing it's a

00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:56,069
product that's also still in fairly

00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:59,730
heavy development so there are some

00:49:56,069 --> 00:50:01,859
problems with it and is moving ahead

00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:04,349
pretty quickly but the nice thing about

00:50:01,859 --> 00:50:05,640
it is you're not it's it's syncing it's

00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:07,500
not sharing so you're not mounting any

00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:09,060
folders you don't have to do what NFS

00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:10,349
dutch was just like actually check to

00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:12,300
see if a file has changed every single

00:50:10,349 --> 00:50:13,680
time you do a read which for Drupal and

00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:18,150
I'm out of like a ton amount of small

00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:20,430
files is really slow it actually adjusts

00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:21,869
poles for changes every couple of

00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:24,599
seconds i think it's like two seconds

00:50:21,869 --> 00:50:27,930
two seconds and then we'll sync the file

00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:29,430
over so it's actually it's not so you

00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:30,960
don't get the change as quickly as you

00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:32,099
would with NFS but it's virtually the

00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,990
same unless you're one of those people

00:50:32,099 --> 00:50:37,069
who's just like tab tab tab tab tab in

00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:37,069
which case just like chill out

00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:41,559
but the real nice thing about it is you

00:50:39,849 --> 00:50:43,420
get basically native file system

00:50:41,559 --> 00:50:44,890
performance for your web server so you

00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:46,569
can just develop really really quickly

00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:47,619
so any time that you might lose and

00:50:46,569 --> 00:50:49,240
waiting for the thing to sink you're

00:50:47,619 --> 00:50:51,520
going to make up like almost instantly

00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:53,530
just by not having to wait 45 seconds

00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,960
for your modules page to load or five

00:50:53,530 --> 00:50:58,660
minutes for your like features to differ

00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:01,270
themselves which you know it sucks

00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:04,630
basically so what are using for the

00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:06,700
Duggar hosts so the docker host is butta

00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:08,339
docker so basically what we want Cal box

00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:10,869
installs it will install boot to docker

00:51:08,339 --> 00:51:12,210
which is desperate just tiny core Linux

00:51:10,869 --> 00:51:15,130
with the dock or demon inside of it

00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:16,420
running in virtualbox so that's what the

00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:18,190
actual infrastructure is all your

00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:19,809
containers live inside of there nothing

00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:22,540
is really changed on your computer at

00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:23,920
all and that's what we're using for the

00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:25,299
docker demon so when we run commands

00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,530
we're just we're hitting the docker room

00:51:25,299 --> 00:51:28,540
we're using the dock of remote API

00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:32,349
hitting that stuff and that's how the

00:51:28,540 --> 00:51:37,299
magic happens thank you yep hello hello

00:51:32,349 --> 00:51:42,839
hello indeed um can I make your boot to

00:51:37,299 --> 00:51:45,490
Dutch you use parallels having no idea I

00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:48,339
don't even like I left a shoe up that

00:51:45,490 --> 00:51:50,049
young kid custom and me and the same

00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:52,030
thing in solution you've implemented is

00:51:50,049 --> 00:51:53,920
that easy to reuse elsewhere because

00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:56,500
that sounds cool oh yeah I think so I

00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,430
mean we we actually um I think we

00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,290
brought some what we're probably gonna

00:51:57,430 --> 00:52:01,359
publish we basically just built a REST

00:51:59,290 --> 00:52:02,530
API rapper node wrapper around it at

00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:05,470
some point we might want to just publish

00:52:02,530 --> 00:52:08,020
that for other p.m. do that um it is

00:52:05,470 --> 00:52:13,270
yeah actually I saw you pinging I saw

00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:15,400
you on some of the issue keys yeah yeah

00:52:13,270 --> 00:52:19,420
it actually so NFS I mean is much easier

00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:21,460
to implement it's very simple sync thing

00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:23,530
was basically a giant pain in the ass to

00:52:21,460 --> 00:52:25,510
implement but the benefits I thinking

00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:27,130
made it justified though yeah I mean I

00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:29,319
use it on my computer I never thought of

00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:33,250
using it for development yeah we

00:52:29,319 --> 00:52:35,980
actually we would ping duh the Borg as

00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:39,040
we call him about it he's a guy who like

00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:42,819
runs a project college yeah yeah I'm h

00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:44,349
and and asked him you know hey we're

00:52:42,819 --> 00:52:45,730
using it for this he's just like this

00:52:44,349 --> 00:52:48,630
isn't really the use case that I had in

00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:51,900
mind but I guess it overkill

00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:58,710
right good enough for us NFS so yeah so

00:52:51,900 --> 00:53:01,140
yeah cool thanks I we're actually

00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:03,780
currently using or I just started using

00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:05,610
boxing okay I'm just learning about the

00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:08,280
setup but it looks very similar to this

00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:10,350
I was just wondering if you can sort of

00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,450
compare or you know give me some

00:53:10,350 --> 00:53:14,670
advantages to disadvantage of sure yeah

00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:16,260
i'm not i'm not super familiar with like

00:53:14,670 --> 00:53:18,030
the actual details of boxing but they

00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:19,890
are i think that they try to solve some

00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:20,820
similar things I think there are i mean

00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:25,860
i think the art thing is obviously

00:53:20,820 --> 00:53:27,360
better I don't know to what extent

00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:29,460
they've implemented container tanking

00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,260
box and at all I think they do that to

00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,580
some degree but I'm not 100 sure if

00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:35,430
anyone knows just feel free to just like

00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:36,930
shout out also I'd be interested to see

00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:38,160
like how they handle the sinking and how

00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:39,750
they have their architecture is

00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,770
extensible like ours like I think that

00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:42,420
the fact that we have this plug-in

00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:44,220
system and you can basically add

00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:46,500
whatever functionality you want at any

00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:47,640
time it makes it just a lot different

00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,200
than just a straight up like

00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:51,690
orchestration tool like something like

00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:54,240
fig or or even like docker composed

00:53:51,690 --> 00:53:55,800
promises to be I'm sorry that's not like

00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:57,690
a super great answer but that's I think

00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,890
that's the most the most the most honest

00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:00,840
I can be with you without just lying

00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:05,010
about box and unless you want me to in

00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:08,100
which case i can do that as well hi

00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:11,070
there hey so since is for local

00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:13,200
development version one you have to be

00:54:11,070 --> 00:54:14,970
online order to create a new site on

00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,800
your local machine how does this handle

00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:20,340
if you if you don't have internet oh

00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:21,720
let's get a question um i think i think

00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:22,770
that it should work but i'm not sure we

00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,680
actually have tested have you tested

00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:27,270
this yet no no i'm not i'm not sure to

00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,490
be honest the way that the dns is

00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:31,050
handled it might be you might i think

00:54:29,490 --> 00:54:34,050
that we'd use opendns or a google dns

00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:35,250
server so if that's true then we might

00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:36,480
you might need to be actually be online

00:54:35,250 --> 00:54:38,040
but that's so that we can change

00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,720
Priscilla Queen you spin up a new site

00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:41,940
with version one it has to go and

00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:43,920
download it from the internets right

00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:46,110
does to have to do that as well or you

00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,340
have something so if you're if you're

00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:48,630
just spinning up the containers and

00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:51,900
you've already downloaded the containers

00:54:48,630 --> 00:54:53,010
before I don't think you don't need to

00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,600
have to be connected to the Internet to

00:54:53,010 --> 00:54:56,160
do that because all those all those

00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,690
containers the way the doctor works is

00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:00,240
it basically just like takes these diff

00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:01,650
these dips of images and that kind of

00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,430
piles them on each other so if you have

00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:03,990
all of them

00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:05,520
and it sees that you have all of them

00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:08,099
cash it'll just use what you have

00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:09,480
already so I think that probably should

00:55:08,099 --> 00:55:11,069
work especially if you pass on that like

00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,990
build local flag in which case it'll

00:55:11,069 --> 00:55:15,930
just kind of like do that cool I'm so I

00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:18,210
think that it should yeah hi again hi so

00:55:15,930 --> 00:55:19,770
the question is now that i have is so i

00:55:18,210 --> 00:55:22,500
can see that this is not intended

00:55:19,770 --> 00:55:24,359
towards production so how do we once

00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,400
we're done let's say make an appt my

00:55:24,359 --> 00:55:28,470
teammates are done how do we take up

00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:31,020
this image or kind of like get a puppet

00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:33,390
or chef recipe to put it on bare metal i

00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:35,640
put it on a VPS is there any plans to

00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:37,349
we're doing that yeah sure yeah so this

00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:39,660
is I mean yeah this is purely for local

00:55:37,349 --> 00:55:41,640
only like it would be a very bad to try

00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:44,099
to like put this like to run the Kalibak

00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:46,740
CLI like on line owed somewhere and run

00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:49,859
your machines with it that would be very

00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:52,859
bad so there's look that's a good

00:55:49,859 --> 00:55:55,079
question I've the first part of it is

00:55:52,859 --> 00:55:56,309
the deployment strategy for this is

00:55:55,079 --> 00:55:59,130
going to be what happens when we do

00:55:56,309 --> 00:56:00,210
these push and pull plugins so for

00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:02,130
example like if you consider like a

00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:04,829
Pantheon app for example if the Pantheon

00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:07,079
app would have an a PHP app server Maria

00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:09,540
DB solar and reddest that the containers

00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:10,980
at Pantheon actually uses and those

00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:12,630
would be very close to production but

00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:14,910
they're not going to be the same but

00:56:12,630 --> 00:56:16,440
they're going to be very very close and

00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:18,000
when you go to actually so if you were

00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:19,980
just if you were just making a site and

00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,599
you wanted to deploy it to pantheon you

00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:23,369
just do a que box push put in your

00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:25,680
Pantheon name or whatever and it would

00:56:23,369 --> 00:56:27,000
just create the instance on Pantheon and

00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:29,280
push your stuff up and that's how your

00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,520
thing we get on Pantheon for example for

00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:34,559
something like line owed you could

00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,089
theoretically run if you had if you're

00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,869
using like pop or chef at chef or

00:56:36,089 --> 00:56:39,059
whatever to build out your

00:56:36,869 --> 00:56:41,130
infrastructure and that's

00:56:39,059 --> 00:56:42,329
production-ready stuff you could have

00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:43,650
all that stuff end up in docker

00:56:42,329 --> 00:56:45,270
containers and you could use those

00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:48,059
doctor containers on cala box if you

00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:50,010
wanted in which case the deployment i

00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:52,020
mean you could write your own app that

00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:53,250
did the deployment for you as well but

00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,480
it might just make the most sense to

00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,740
have you can go in that case you

00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,420
actually i guess you could use kyle box

00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:59,520
to deploy your containers and

00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:00,750
orchestrate them both locally and for

00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,410
production like if you follow that the

00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:03,720
containers that you have a

00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:05,010
production-ready but that is not that is

00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,079
not the antenna use case but you could

00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:08,849
you could do that i suppose you just

00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:11,339
have to take your current manifests or

00:57:08,849 --> 00:57:13,049
recipes or whatever and get them to not

00:57:11,339 --> 00:57:14,180
generate vm zip to generate containers

00:57:13,049 --> 00:57:17,620
instead and then just put the

00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:20,120
to this as I as I kind of like showed

00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:29,510
her in porter I'm expecting a heckle at

00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:31,190
some point also yeah yeah we were

00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:37,640
actually looking for fortran developers

00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:39,440
but you know couldn't find any hey any

00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:42,070
other questions I was going to ask if

00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:44,630
you were being bought up by Verizon uh

00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:49,100
I'm not allowed to discuss that in

00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:50,360
public good question though they

00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:55,100
actually answer to that is no for anyone

00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:56,420
that doesn't know that I'm joking I

00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,980
think that yeah we have time for one

00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:59,870
more someone wants to just say something

00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:02,720
silly other than that I think we'll wrap

00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:08,000
up really no one wants to say anything

00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:09,740
silly yeah good question so if you if

00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,640
