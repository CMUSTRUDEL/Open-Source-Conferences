Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Kalabox 2: Your Workflow Companion
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	One year ago at DrupalCon Austin we announced plans for a new and exciting version of Kalabox. One successful Kickstarter campaign, numerous partnerships and tons of dev hours later we're excited to release the new version. 

Why should you and your team be on Kalabox? To save time and development headaches spinning up new team members or switching out resources. Quit worrying about buggy development environments that fail you during deployment. Code faster than ever before and use our new ecosystem of apps and plugins to easily add tooling or set up certain kinds of apps. Or write your own! And of course the product is Free, Open Source and works on Linux, MacOSX and WINDOWS.

Kalabox 2 sits inbetween tools like Vagrant and Docker. You can provision infrastructure easily with containers but also write plugins to integrate with external services like Pantheon or to add in additional tooling like Drush or Grunt. All of this can be done on the Kalabox CLI or with the Kalabox UI which provides a nice separation between DevOps people and other developers. 

This session will be focused primarily on developers looking to get their teams up and running using the new version of Kalabox. It will also be for people who want to finally end their bad relationship with MAMP. Specifically we will seek to:

Demo running some apps with different kinds of tools or plugins
The Kalabox CLI 
The Kalabox UI
Building your own apps 
Buidling your own plugins
Moving your existing tools out of things like MAMP or Vagrant into Kalabox2
Solving local dev and reaching DevOps zen
