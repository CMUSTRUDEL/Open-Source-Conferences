Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: De-mystifying client discovery
Publication date: 2015-05-13
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	It's the very first meeting with your shiny new client. A blank slate, the opening steps of a potentially year-plus long project. This is where it all begins: discovery. Such a simple word for multiple day-long meetings designed to suck all the information possible out of the client before starting to architect the site and getting things ready for development. For me it is easily the best part of any project, yet many developers view this phase of the project as a burden - the yawn-inducing boredom before we get to the real work of coding. It require real technical know-how, but it is also as much art as science.

A lot of devs get thrown into this process with no framework or roadmap of how to manage it. This talk will give them one, covering the following topics

What are the most important architectural questions you need to answer?
Why are architectural questions almost the least important aspects of discovery?
What is your role in the process (both the role they think you're playing and the role you're really playing)?
What can you do to make the transition from discovery to build a success?

is this supposed to start at five is

00:00:01,709 --> 00:00:20,390
that the deal all right oh yes we'll get

00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:25,859
this show on the road so hi welcome to

00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:27,960
drupalcon where are we la thanks for

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,199
coming to my session demystifying client

00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:33,899
discovery my name is Greg Dunlap I can

00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,880
be found as hey rocker on Twitter and

00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:39,180
all of the other places on the internets

00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:42,149
I've been using Drupal for about eight

00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,879
years now i just passed my 8-year drupal

00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,399
versuri on drupal.org for most of that

00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,989
time I've been focused on configuration

00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,570
management and deployment stuff in

00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:53,430
Drupal and drupalcon Chicago dreese

00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,920
asked if I would lead the configuration

00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:58,649
management initiative for Drupal 8 which

00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:01,410
I did for a while and that was pretty

00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,809
exciting I got to travel lots of places

00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:06,689
and do lots of this and other Drupal

00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,950
cons but most recently for the last

00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,290
couple of years I've been working as a

00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,939
low about as an architect and one of the

00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,920
things that I do is an architect at loll

00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:16,610
about is I get involved with clients in

00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,700
the very early stages of their projects

00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:23,040
and I get to go in there and help them

00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,090
determine what kind of a website they

00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,250
want to build and what kind of

00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,689
architecture they need and kind of get

00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,909
to the core of the problems that they're

00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:32,220
trying to solve and figure out how we're

00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:33,689
going to solve them and then we figured

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,540
that out and I get to hand it off to the

00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:38,509
developers who get to do all of the work

00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:42,600
it's a great gig I highly recommend it

00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:44,850
so that's what we're here to talk about

00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,040
today is about that discovery process

00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,380
the process by which you sit down with

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,420
the clients and figure all that out I

00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:53,250
already talked about I work at Lowell

00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,540
about this is our logo we've been around

00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,750
in the Drupal we were the very first

00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,439
ever Drupal agency and we work with a

00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,640
lot of really cool clients like MSNBC

00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:05,300
currently one of my clients that I just

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,000
started working with this space X

00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,770
and we've also been doing a lot of work

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,570
in just the media industry in general

00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:13,520
actually we do a ton of work with we've

00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:15,260
worked with Tesla we've worked with a

00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,960
lot of cool things and launched a lot of

00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,040
cool sites and I'm really happy to work

00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:25,070
it a little about because we're a great

00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:27,740
company so a lil about like I said all

00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:30,080
of our major projects basically begin

00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,600
with an on-site we go to the on-site

00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,610
with the client and we sit down with

00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,380
them and we do what's called discovery

00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:38,660
and for me it's my favorite part of a

00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:41,720
project because this is where real

00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,920
problems get solved ideally all of the

00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,200
big problems should be solved during

00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:50,720
this process before you get to actual

00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:53,920
implementation I would have thought that

00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,670
Morton was over there or something but

00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:59,900
apparently they're really getting down

00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:01,220
next door so um and you know I'm a

00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,750
technology guy but I've also been

00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:05,000
involved in technology for a really long

00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,610
time i'm pushing 25 years building

00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,950
applications my first applications were

00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:11,840
built with paradox for das which is

00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:14,060
which really ages me but somebody

00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,660
laughed and they get it so there's

00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:20,090
somebody as old as me here so and and

00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,310
while i really enjoy technology i've

00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:23,570
also kind of gotten over implementation

00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,370
one of the things i've realized after

00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:26,570
years of doing client projects is that

00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,730
if the stuff that happens at the

00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:30,440
beginning isn't done right and if those

00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:33,980
of the big questions they aren't

00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:36,470
answered then the project is is screwed

00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:38,360
and so i really like to get in there and

00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:41,330
solve those big questions and really dig

00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,920
into what the clients need and one of

00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,239
the reasons that i really that i decided

00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,340
to do this talk is that a lot of

00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,950
technology people like myself get thrown

00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,630
into this process they say okay we've

00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,860
got this big project why don't you go

00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,940
out and meet the client and figure out

00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:57,410
what we're going to do and and after

00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:58,730
years of doing this I've realized that

00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:02,239
there's kind of a way that a lot of

00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:04,010
technologists get into it and go about

00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,510
it and it's a little backwards because

00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:07,580
the process of discovery is a lot

00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:11,239
different than the process of actually

00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:14,030
implementing technology so let's talk

00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:16,460
about that so what's the goal of a

00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:18,080
discovery process so a client comes to

00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:18,889
you and says I've got this website and

00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:22,249
its kind of

00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:24,740
down and it's it's falling apart after a

00:04:22,249 --> 00:04:27,620
few years and there's drug dealers

00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,659
outside and we want to we really need to

00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,639
clean it up we want to spruce it up what

00:04:29,659 --> 00:04:34,930
I want is a gorgeous website i want this

00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:38,629
nice victorian with trees and clouds and

00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:41,719
and i want you to come in and build it

00:04:38,629 --> 00:04:43,699
and what what a lot of people still do

00:04:41,719 --> 00:04:45,199
but which is a mistake is to throw all

00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:48,680
their tools on the table and say all

00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:50,120
right let's get to work because you

00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,120
don't want to do that because you don't

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:55,129
have an idea of like what they want to

00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,870
build and why and that's the really

00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:58,639
important part is you want to know why

00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,039
they want to build things and what they

00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,080
want to do client discovery sets the

00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,900
stage for the implementation and lays

00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,120
down the rules that you need to go

00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,669
through to build the website and around

00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,409
which the website is going to be built

00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:15,110
and you need to gather some essential

00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:18,139
information in order to do that and none

00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:21,400
of it has to do with servers or modules

00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:23,509
or ram what you really need to know is

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,039
what are the current client what are the

00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:26,779
clients current pain points with their

00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,659
system where are things falling apart

00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:31,909
what day to day are they are they having

00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:33,259
trouble executing on what is the thing

00:05:31,909 --> 00:05:36,889
that causes them to scream and throw

00:05:33,259 --> 00:05:38,810
things on a day-to-day basis what are

00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:40,370
their goals out of getting to this this

00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,289
is related but it's different it's like

00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:45,169
what do they want to serve their

00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:47,960
business out of the new site what are

00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:51,289
the things that that they want to build

00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,149
and what are the priorities around that

00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:56,419
because any anybody can get a group of

00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:58,399
people in there and talk about what the

00:05:56,419 --> 00:06:00,919
goals are but they have to be

00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,509
prioritized and this is the biggest

00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:04,069
problem because a lot of times you'll

00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:07,399
get a bunch of stakeholders in a room

00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:08,539
and all of them agree about different

00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:10,639
things that they want to do but none of

00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:11,810
them agree about what's most important

00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,430
because they all think that their own

00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,399
thing is most important right and

00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:18,219
solving priorities is where most of the

00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,719
knife fights on these projects have been

00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:24,020
getting this information out of them is

00:06:20,719 --> 00:06:27,019
is incredibly important to making the

00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:28,699
project building a website or a web

00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:32,330
project or any project without

00:06:28,699 --> 00:06:34,189
priorities is almost impossible and

00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:35,479
when we look at Drupal core this is one

00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:37,879
of the things that we run into on a

00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:39,560
day-to-day basis it's that we have a

00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:41,419
bunch of people who come in and they

00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,060
have a bunch of different ways to solve

00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:46,460
a problem but but the product has never

00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,590
had a clear set of goals or priorities

00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:50,659
lay it out sometimes draciel name an

00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,310
initiative lead or sometimes dreese will

00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:54,650
do this but most of the time it's up to

00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:56,930
us to fight it out and figure out what

00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,490
happens and that decision-making process

00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,259
is really hampered because we can't say

00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,120
well we've got this set of goals and

00:07:00,259 --> 00:07:04,009
priorities and we've got this set of

00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,440
potential solutions so let's figure out

00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:08,750
which one matches the best and we'll go

00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:10,460
with that one it comes down to a lot of

00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,500
philosophy it comes to a lot of

00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,300
potential people saying this is what I

00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:17,030
want to do versus what they want to do

00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,830
or object oriented or blah blah blah and

00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,520
it's like it's like there's no framework

00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:25,159
around which to build and make decisions

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:28,009
so and and just like that in the in a

00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:30,409
client project is very important to get

00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:32,659
that information out of people and that

00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:35,180
is the most important part of any client

00:07:32,659 --> 00:07:38,810
discovery process you can't build

00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:41,240
anything without this information this

00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,710
is a quote from an old boss of mine he

00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,029
said he said when it comes right down to

00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,690
it ninety percent of technical

00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:50,150
consulting is really business consulting

00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:52,580
because a lot of clients they they they

00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:55,219
know they have a solution in mind but

00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:57,680
they don't really know what what it is

00:07:55,219 --> 00:07:59,509
or why it is most client discovery

00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,669
project spend about two-thirds of the

00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:06,020
time collecting all of those pain points

00:08:01,669 --> 00:08:08,870
the the the goals the priorities all of

00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:11,210
that information and a lot of the reason

00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:12,469
that it takes that long that's because

00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:14,569
there's always a lot of conflict and

00:08:12,469 --> 00:08:17,000
disagreement within any group usually

00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:19,909
when they come in to about what they're

00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,800
going to build and why and the process

00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:23,960
of getting it out of them is really the

00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,060
important process of discovery and it's

00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,279
a process that a lot of like developers

00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,839
and technical people really lack or

00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:32,479
don't know what to get around and so

00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:34,279
there's some tools that are that can

00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,990
help in getting that out and there are

00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:38,570
some ways to change your attitude about

00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:41,060
going into it which we can talk about

00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:44,449
here ways to kind of set yourself up for

00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,740
success in the project I think one of

00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:46,190
the biggest things is that you want to

00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,680
go in

00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:53,870
a blank slate an empty notebook as it

00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:56,000
were you you want to go in with as

00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,160
little information as possible when I go

00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,370
into these projects I try and get only

00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,620
the barest information out of people you

00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:06,770
know if they say well you know we've got

00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:09,560
20 sites and we want to migrate them to

00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:11,870
Drupal and five of them are running on

00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,510
WordPress and ten of them are running on

00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,370
joomla and two of them are running on a

00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,440
proprietary system that we don't know

00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:20,510
how to get the information out of that's

00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,070
like that's like enough to get started

00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:24,470
actually I don't want to know much more

00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,390
than that before I go into this project

00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:29,480
because if I start asking questions

00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:31,160
already around that and usually because

00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,450
I'm on the phone with a technical person

00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,160
at this point there'll be technical

00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:37,070
questions I'm already going to start

00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,540
architecting a solution in my mind and I

00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:40,520
don't want to do that until I've

00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,440
collected all of the appropriate

00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,690
information again about goals and

00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:47,270
priorities out of the clients going in

00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:48,980
with a technical solution in mind is one

00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:51,140
of the most common problems that people

00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:55,160
who walk into the solution walk into

00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:58,970
these things have as an example we

00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,980
recently had a client who who all of

00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:02,570
their decisions were driven by their

00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:04,280
marketing department it was just like

00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,530
whenever the marketing department once

00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:08,330
they get and it has to be pixel perfect

00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:10,400
I'm sure nobody in this room knows

00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:12,920
anything about that kind of situation at

00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:15,410
all but um but because of the situation

00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,630
because of the business needs and all of

00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:20,030
the other in stuff that was going around

00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:21,830
at this client this was the way it had

00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:24,230
to be and so what they had done is they

00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,910
had built a panel site and with a bunch

00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,050
of custom panels pains and given the

00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,970
client and given the marketing

00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:31,310
department the opportunity to put shove

00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:33,380
whatever custom HTML into it they wanted

00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,520
that's a solution all right but of

00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:36,890
course the problem that they came up

00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:39,470
with is that then all of that stuff is

00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:41,570
tied into their features and every time

00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,670
the client the marketing people want to

00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,350
change anything the features have to be

00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:47,690
rebuilt and pushed out to the live site

00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:49,280
or even worse if they if the client

00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,980
wants to change things on the live site

00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:53,630
and then all of those features are out

00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,980
of date and the stuff gets wiped out the

00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,810
next time the developers want to push

00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:58,760
that stuff out and so I made a

00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,779
suggestion which was controversial at

00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,029
first

00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:03,769
but which works which was that we could

00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:05,600
write a little custom panels plug-in

00:11:03,769 --> 00:11:08,529
that does nothing but read from a

00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,629
specified HTML file off of the disk and

00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:12,889
we give marketing access to that HTML

00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:14,600
file and they can do whatever the hell

00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:17,839
that they want but it's decoupled from

00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:19,279
their panels and then everybody can they

00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,240
can push their stuff live and we can

00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,300
push our stuff live and everything

00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:25,149
separate from an architectural and

00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:28,160
technical standpoint it's a ridiculous

00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:32,509
solution I mean it's we're talking about

00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:34,579
like 1995 CMS technology at that point

00:11:32,509 --> 00:11:36,199
but on the other hand when you look at

00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:39,230
the when you look at the clients goals

00:11:36,199 --> 00:11:41,449
and their pain points and their

00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:43,790
priorities it was exactly the right

00:11:41,449 --> 00:11:46,730
solution because it's not really up to

00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:48,740
us to judge what the clients goals and

00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:50,269
pain points are there we are here to

00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:54,019
serve them and they're here to tell us

00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:57,019
what they need and so from that

00:11:54,019 --> 00:11:58,790
perspective it was a great solution they

00:11:57,019 --> 00:12:00,769
still didn't do it because their tech

00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:03,529
people thought it was ridiculous but I

00:12:00,769 --> 00:12:06,110
did my part another I mean another

00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:08,839
example of that is that one of our

00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:11,269
clients came to us and he was

00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,860
overwhelmed and he had a very hard

00:12:11,269 --> 00:12:14,120
deadline that he had to hit because of

00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,009
the school launching for the next

00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,439
semester hard deadlines are of course

00:12:16,009 --> 00:12:19,850
the the you know most common problem

00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:23,470
that we that we struggle with as

00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:26,360
technologists a lot of the times and and

00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:27,769
we had to talk through how he was going

00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,360
to get this done because it was also a

00:12:27,769 --> 00:12:32,269
very smart and adept and

00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,639
forward-thinking web developer and he

00:12:32,269 --> 00:12:36,800
wanted to do everything really right and

00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,360
that was going to be a problem on the

00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,430
three to four month deadline that he had

00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,930
to launch by the next semester and one

00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:44,300
of the things that I had to do over time

00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:45,649
was talk him through that and how we're

00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,899
going to get through things and talk

00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:49,819
about de skopian not just he's scoping

00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:52,429
and featured he's scoping but also about

00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:54,589
how he could build it forward thinking

00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:57,649
and attack these problems after launch

00:12:54,589 --> 00:12:59,480
because again I knew from talking to him

00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:01,279
that his priorities for that deadline he

00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,679
had to hit that deadline and so anything

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,929
we had to do to make that work was what

00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,519
it was up to us even though he didn't

00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:08,809
get to do a lot of things that I as a

00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,529
technologist would have loved to help

00:13:08,809 --> 00:13:13,100
him do on the project empathy is a big

00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:15,020
part

00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:17,870
being a client of being a consultant and

00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:20,230
a technologist because you have to

00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:22,910
understand where they're coming from

00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:24,830
another important thing is that you want

00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:26,720
to make sure that when you're talking

00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:28,610
about these solutions you have all of

00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,130
the right people in the room obviously

00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:33,680
you want their technology staff and

00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:35,360
their design staff in the room because

00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,860
they're the people who have all of the

00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,330
information that you need to be able to

00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:43,850
build another did that come up wrong

00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,110
button business owners are important too

00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,460
though because they're the ones who

00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,810
understand the perspective of the

00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,030
business side of it versus the

00:13:47,810 --> 00:13:52,700
technology side they are the ones who

00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:54,680
are often the decision-makers this can

00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,180
come in a lot of different forms and

00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,710
realms depending on the client that

00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,330
you're working with but if all you've

00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,950
got is tech people and designers in the

00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:02,480
room I can guarantee you you don't have

00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,820
all of the people that you need in order

00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,940
to discover what this clients goals and

00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,440
priorities are another really important

00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,240
thing that gets kind of lost in the

00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:14,660
shuffle on a lot of these projects is

00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,950
the editorial team part of the reason

00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,600
that it gets lost in the shuffle is

00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:19,400
because a lot in a lot of these

00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,380
organizations those are just sort of the

00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,000
people who do the work every day they

00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,400
don't have a lot of representation in

00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,050
the leadership of the business but on

00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,760
the other hand they're the ones who do

00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:31,010
the work every day they're the ones who

00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,450
have to struggle with the CMS every day

00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,520
and they're the ones who probably know

00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:35,960
better than anyone on the leadership

00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,270
what the pain points and time-consuming

00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:41,450
parts of doing the work on the

00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:44,000
day-to-day basis is having the editorial

00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:46,460
team and or a leader from the editorial

00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,140
team in place is so important to making

00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,760
these projects work and and having them

00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,650
in place at the beginning is so

00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,460
important because they're the ones who

00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:57,830
understand that if the if the project is

00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,170
not built properly then nobody's going

00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:05,060
to want to use it a classic example of

00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:06,950
that is image-sharing so everybody wants

00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,840
like oh yeah we want to be able to take

00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:12,230
this one image and use it everywhere on

00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:14,420
the site that's great so you build an

00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:15,500
image library and it's basically at that

00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,720
point you're building a digital

00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,460
management system and then they're like

00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,290
oh we've got so many images we can't

00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,120
find anything and so you add all of this

00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,310
tagging and categorization and stuff

00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,880
like that but then it means that any

00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:28,230
time anybody ads in

00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,450
image to the site they've got to fill

00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:32,430
out like 15 fields so they can find the

00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:34,290
image and you know it's like the kind of

00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:36,150
thing that everybody thinks oh I'd be

00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:37,740
great if we had this image library and

00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:39,090
all of these tags and blah blah blah but

00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:41,370
they don't think about the fact that if

00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:42,960
nobody uses it it's useless and it's not

00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:45,870
only useless it's you're in a worse

00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,400
situation than you were before where you

00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:49,680
could just upload an image and use it

00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,060
and maybe you know once in a while you'd

00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,620
have to find the image in four places

00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,090
and replace it these are the kind of

00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,540
conversations that we have a lot with

00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:59,520
clients another classic one is

00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:01,350
automation versus curation of content

00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,180
because everybody wants to say oh I want

00:16:01,350 --> 00:16:05,550
every list of content on our site to be

00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:07,200
completely curated until they pass it

00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:10,020
down to the editorial staff who barely

00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,820
have time to enter the content that they

00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:15,000
enter on a day-to-day basis much less

00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:17,750
manage a 150 lists of how that content

00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,650
is brought forth and things like that

00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:22,260
thinking about that in getting the

00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:24,780
editorial staff involved in the

00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:27,690
discovery process super super important

00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:31,040
and a lot of times it really it's really

00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:33,510
key to the success or failure of things

00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,970
here's another quote from my colleague

00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:38,010
Jeff eatin successful consulting has as

00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,770
much in common with therapy as it does

00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:43,650
with technology it's not entirely

00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:46,140
accurate but there's there's definitely

00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:48,360
a grain of truth at it because having

00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:51,780
everyone in the room is just part of the

00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:53,010
problem but getting at the why of the

00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,500
project that you're building with

00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:57,000
everybody in the room is is another part

00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,590
of the problem and that's really a

00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,920
people problem much more than the

00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:04,680
technology problem and and you know

00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,350
drawing this stuff out of them has a lot

00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:11,339
of things in common with the counseling

00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:13,189
and therapy and stuff like them here are

00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:15,720
some discovery techniques that I've used

00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:18,540
they work for me and they work for my

00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,579
personality they may not work for other

00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:24,060
people but perhaps they'll give you some

00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:26,040
ideas of how we can pull information out

00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,830
of our clients and how we can make these

00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,060
groups of people work one seems recently

00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:33,540
obvious you want to ask a lot of

00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:36,090
questions for me one of the best parts

00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:37,650
of being a consultant and working with a

00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:39,900
lot of clients is that I really love

00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:45,060
learning about people's businesses

00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:48,120
excuse me the vagaries of how people's

00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:49,710
businesses work and the different ways

00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:52,230
in which people work together is

00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:54,360
endlessly fascinating to me how people

00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,670
make money how they're bit what their

00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,650
business models are in the end what

00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:00,900
their structures are in terms of how

00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:03,150
they work together I love all of this

00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:05,520
stuff and so when i'm in a when i'm in a

00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:07,160
discovery process and again if you've

00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,240
gone in without really any

00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,520
preconceptions in mind I'm just asking

00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,710
questions about anything just because I

00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:16,800
just think it's cool to learn about how

00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:19,500
people work together and so and and I

00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,420
don't like draw lines I'll just like

00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,370
asked all sorts of weird stuff all the

00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,810
time and it's like I was recently

00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,250
working with the American Booksellers

00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:27,720
Association and their a trade

00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:30,030
organization I spent a lot of time

00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,710
talking with them just about how they're

00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,540
funded and they came they talked about

00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,820
this really fascinating stuff about how

00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:38,640
you know about where their money comes

00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:41,070
from and how and how they serve there

00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,390
and how they serve their book stores and

00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:45,540
this led into a really interesting

00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:47,640
discussion about the relationship of

00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,290
bookstores to publishers and all of this

00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,720
sort of stuff it was really really cool

00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:53,700
but a lot of it just came just because I

00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,620
started talking with them not about the

00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,680
project or anything just about who they

00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:00,390
are and what they do and and and that's

00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,860
one way because a lot of people love

00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,330
talking about their own business they

00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:05,340
love talking about the places where they

00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:07,640
work so just asking questions can bring

00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:10,620
them out of a lot of that information

00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,960
this is an interesting one don't break

00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:15,840
the awkward silences one of the things

00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:18,030
that that therapists use and I think

00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,260
this is really what Eden was talking

00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:21,510
about when he told me that Klein

00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,250
consulting is like therapy is that a lot

00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:24,360
of times you'll talk and you're talking

00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,910
you're talking you get to a place where

00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,160
everyone's just staring at each other

00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:30,840
just let them do it eventually

00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:33,360
somebody's going to break the silence

00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,220
and it really shouldn't be you because

00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,800
the person who breaks the science maybe

00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:40,080
the person who proposes a solution who

00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:42,090
comes out with the core of what the

00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:45,090
problem that caused the awkward silences

00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:46,650
who is going to bring up the thing

00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:49,710
that's really behind the scenes of all

00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:52,510
of this let them let them hash it out

00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:55,000
just stand back and let them go

00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:56,620
you can ask lots of questions but on the

00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,600
other hand you've got to know when to

00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:01,540
stand back and let them talk it out to

00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:04,120
again a lot of times in these projects

00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,830
we come together and and we get a lot of

00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,600
people in who have conflicting views

00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:10,330
about what the end goals and priorities

00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,920
should be and sometimes you can direct

00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,540
them and sometimes you can just let them

00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,220
go at it and figure it out because a lot

00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,560
of times they might not even realize

00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:19,540
that the things that they have together

00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,980
are in conflict or that somebody else

00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,900
have the specific goals that were

00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,550
different than them you need to let them

00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:28,720
sort of talk that stuff out and figure

00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:30,790
it out and and sort it out facing

00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,260
politics head on this can be tough a lot

00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:34,510
of situations obviously are very

00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:36,040
political a lot of times you know you

00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,750
may be at a company that has all sorts

00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,400
of other business stuff going on behind

00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:41,890
the scenes that you don't know about but

00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:45,390
when you see that stuff you really need

00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:47,380
to get at the core of the reality of it

00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,490
obviously the reality of it can be

00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,730
different depending on who you're

00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:53,440
talking to and the the some of these

00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:55,030
things can be sensitive and stuff like

00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,380
that but on the other hand sitting

00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,450
around and pretending that none of this

00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:00,460
exists that this guy doesn't hate this

00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:02,170
guy because you know he stole this guy

00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:05,020
from over here and stuff like that it

00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:07,450
doesn't help you know sitting around and

00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:09,250
pretending that all of these people are

00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,720
really in it together when they're not

00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,820
which is another thing that we'll talk

00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:15,880
about a little later doesn't doesn't

00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:18,340
help anybody at all being honest with

00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,750
everybody is really important and at low

00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,330
about one of the things that we are

00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:24,100
really that we are really focused on is

00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,600
just being straightforward and honest

00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:27,280
with our clients and one of the things

00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,570
that's really amazing that comes out of

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,340
that is that they end up being

00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:32,170
straightforward and honest with us in a

00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:37,650
way that's really rare actually in a

00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:39,640
client and insulting relationship so

00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:41,710
obviously there's ways to handle this

00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,240
more and gently but ignoring the

00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:45,420
politics behind the project that you're

00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,070
on isn't really going to help anybody

00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:51,610
there's a lot of different there's a lot

00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:54,490
of different sort of philosophies about

00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:56,200
note-taking I was noticing me and even

00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:59,230
were actually on a project just recently

00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:01,480
and I noticed that he was furiously

00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:03,670
taking notes in Evernote and mind

00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,480
mapping and doing all of this and I had

00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:08,030
a notebook out

00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:10,370
and I think I took up two pages of notes

00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:12,230
I think I think three of them were just

00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:14,570
quotes that I found interesting on the

00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,280
client's website and one was an idea for

00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:17,840
a presentation that came out of the talk

00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:20,030
that we are having it's like it was

00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,380
stuff that was like interesting to me

00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:22,520
that came out of things that we're

00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:25,220
talking about it didn't really have

00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:28,549
anything to do with the project itself I

00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:30,559
would say that I don't focus on taking

00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:32,450
down every little detail because again

00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,790
I'm very big picture oriented when I go

00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:36,470
into these things but maybe you like

00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:37,850
taking down every little detail because

00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:39,620
it means that later you can start

00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:42,049
pulling them together and trying to see

00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:43,910
where the pieces fit together or what

00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:46,490
commonalities different things have I

00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:48,559
tend to just like let it all flow in and

00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,390
let it sit in the back of my brain over

00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,490
a couple of days and let the pathways

00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:54,559
kind of find themselves for the Eureka

00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:56,990
moment that makes me understand what's

00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,000
going on here or the pieces that form

00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:00,679
big themes that I would never really

00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,690
thought about I think if i had just like

00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:04,340
started writing that's one of those

00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:07,220
things that works for me it may not work

00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:09,080
for everybody but having some way to get

00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,870
down the things that are interesting or

00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:13,880
important to you is important again you

00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:15,770
may use the computer I like to write so

00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,390
that I can have my computer free to look

00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:19,220
at other things and stuff like that and

00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,990
I find that my brain responds

00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:23,660
differently to writing than it does to

00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:26,570
typing whatever you know what works for

00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,919
you is important but having a record of

00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:32,450
what's important to you is also

00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:34,790
important don't problem solve it's so

00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:38,000
easy for us as technologists when we

00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:39,440
find and I assume I didn't even ask I

00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,299
assume most of the people involved in

00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:46,690
here are involved in building websites

00:23:41,299 --> 00:23:49,309
on a day-to-day basis is that correct I

00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:52,130
did get into the coding track after all

00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:54,919
it's really easy for us as technology

00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:56,570
people to problem-solve because again we

00:23:54,919 --> 00:23:57,919
hear we hear a problem and we start

00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:59,090
thinking of solutions and then we want

00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,890
to get into it because we're excited

00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:03,169
because we're excited to potentially

00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:05,780
have solutions but again problem solving

00:24:03,169 --> 00:24:07,910
before you have everything out and a lot

00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:09,770
of times like the core problems may not

00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:12,080
even come out until the second day of a

00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:15,020
discovery thing is really dangerous and

00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:18,500
so again I try and just let the process

00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,100
go as long as I can just talking just

00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:21,620
figure

00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:25,100
who they are and what they are and and

00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:26,929
and getting it the core of again goals

00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:30,549
and priorities because coming out with

00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:35,059
that is really important and like I said

00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:37,880
let let the big picture find itself it's

00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:39,140
always it seems like really scary every

00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,940
time I go into one of these projects

00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,860
maybe this is going to be the time where

00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,960
I go through three days and suddenly I'm

00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,760
nowhere I've got nothing left than

00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,070
anything that I then I then I did when I

00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:51,530
started but but it's really interesting

00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:53,419
because a lot of a lot of clients they

00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:55,820
themselves get so involved in their

00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:57,380
day-to-day stuff that the big themes

00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:00,230
that drives them they don't even really

00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:02,630
realize and you sitting back watching

00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:04,490
them discuss this day to day stuff can

00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:05,960
pull that stuff out a lot easier than

00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:08,570
you then they can because you're much

00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:10,309
more separated from it let the big

00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:14,150
picture find itself and then we can

00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:16,669
drive into problem solving later that

00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:18,409
said there are a few technical things

00:25:16,669 --> 00:25:21,650
that are really important to get out of

00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:23,960
every discovery project and they're the

00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:26,929
kind of things that really really do

00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:29,780
impact things like server configuration

00:25:26,929 --> 00:25:31,340
and server architecture and stuff that

00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,230
you need to get right right at the

00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,659
beginning in order for everything else

00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:38,360
to move on from these are things like

00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:41,059
content sharing let's say they come in

00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,710
and and and they say we've got 20

00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:45,860
websites and we need to be able to

00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:48,169
display one story from one website on

00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:49,730
any of the other websites that's the

00:25:48,169 --> 00:25:51,620
kind of thing where it's like well are

00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:54,200
you going to go for a domain access or

00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:55,640
you're going to go for multi-site are

00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,740
you just going to feed RSS feeds

00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,419
everywhere getting to the core of those

00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,190
kinds of questions is super important

00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:02,840
because because they're the kind of

00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:04,539
stuff that you need to know before you

00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,070
can even start a single line of code

00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:09,140
what their third-party integrations are

00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:11,450
is really important having a list of

00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:13,730
that stuff again it gives you a big

00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:15,500
picture view of it from the technology

00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:20,710
side that you need to have before you

00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:24,440
move on SSO ldap stuff permission

00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:26,150
Incanto to deep but I want to know what

00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,590
their framework for that stuff is in

00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:29,270
their current organization and whether

00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:31,340
we're going to have to integrate with it

00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:32,900
at all these are the kinds of things

00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:35,360
that have to be done before

00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:37,430
our project build can even begin at all

00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:39,500
and while there aren't many of these

00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:41,290
purely technical things I do want to get

00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:44,150
out of the room with these guys be

00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:49,100
having them in hand before before we go

00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:52,310
anywhere else sometimes there are some

00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:55,490
red flags that you can have before we've

00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:58,610
or as you're just getting involved in a

00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:00,950
discovery project and spotting them

00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:03,560
early and figuring out how to deal with

00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:07,910
them is pretty important because

00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:09,920
otherwise I mean the best case scenario

00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:12,020
of not spotting one of these and getting

00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:13,970
into a really sticky situation is that

00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:16,870
you end up with a website that has

00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:19,460
nothing but carousels on the front page

00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:22,700
again I don't know how many times I can

00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:24,680
quote eaten in one talk but Eaton's

00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:26,360
great quote about carousels is that

00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,770
they're always the result of the world's

00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:29,510
worst knife fight in a meeting and

00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:32,380
everybody just gives up and says fine

00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:34,940
we'll just put everything up there um

00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,990
but you know in the worst case this can

00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,150
this can be the kind of stuff that

00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:40,790
really causes a project to fall apart in

00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:43,580
the end I think the classic and most

00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:45,740
most important example is the invisible

00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:50,230
stakeholder there the person that

00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:54,170
everybody talks about but isn't there

00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:56,540
they say you know oh yeah we're going to

00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:58,940
have to talk to George about that or oh

00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:01,190
yeah mary has that information will get

00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:03,080
back to you on that and you know their

00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:04,280
name is constantly coming up as somebody

00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:07,070
who has to be pulled into the

00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:10,310
discussions but they're not there that's

00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:11,900
bad you're in a situation where there's

00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:12,860
obviously somebody who's important

00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,300
enough that they're always on

00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:16,820
everybody's minds but if they're not

00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,560
there then the whole core of what you're

00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:21,640
after here is going to be extremely

00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:26,570
difficult to get to the center of

00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:28,610
handling this can can be up to trying to

00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:30,020
get them in trying to get into contact

00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:32,090
with them about the questions that

00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:35,000
you're having while the project is still

00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:37,340
going at least figuring out at least who

00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,080
they are and what their role is so that

00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,880
you can kind of surround the problem

00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:43,550
from all angles and understand what

00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,650
pieces are missing but identifying that

00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:46,340
that person exists is really really

00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,870
important

00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:51,350
to know about so that you can start

00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:54,740
managing it antagonistic political

00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:56,539
situations are hard to deal with they're

00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,580
even harder to deal with when you start

00:28:56,539 --> 00:29:01,490
truly empathizing with one side and not

00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:07,669
the other it happens it's tough I've

00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:10,250
done it but getting getting getting to a

00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:12,200
place where there's at least one common

00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:14,000
goal between all of these people or one

00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,919
thing that they can agree on is super

00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,539
important it's a lot of work and a lot

00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:20,330
of times it's work that you don't even

00:29:17,539 --> 00:29:23,450
have the ability to solve and spotting

00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:25,130
somebody in the team who seems like who

00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:27,110
seems like they have a measure of

00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:28,940
respect from the sides involved can be

00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:31,039
really helpful because you can pull them

00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:32,480
aside and say hey we really need to

00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:34,490
solve this can you help me get through

00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,529
with these people or can you pull them

00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,940
together and try and get them on the

00:29:36,529 --> 00:29:39,649
same page at least to some extent

00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:42,200
because this project isn't going to work

00:29:39,649 --> 00:29:43,760
if all these people are finding every

00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:46,850
decision that we have to make every step

00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:48,980
of the way there are different

00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:51,740
techniques for handling it but it's

00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:53,720
usually pretty easy to spot early on and

00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,370
again if you spot it early on then you

00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,690
can start thinking about it as you start

00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:59,960
going through the process and thinking

00:29:56,690 --> 00:30:02,360
about it as ways to handle it and just

00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,929
realizing that it's there and building

00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:08,270
stuff around it can be really important

00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:11,390
some clients are coming the same way

00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:13,730
that you do there you may have a very

00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:16,460
highly technical team that's running

00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:18,110
this on that side but but all they want

00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,490
to dive into are the server questions

00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:23,240
and how much RAM they need I actually

00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:24,919
had a client like this recently where he

00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,450
was the director of Technology and he

00:30:24,919 --> 00:30:28,399
really wanted to dive into all of the

00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:30,559
architectural questions very deeply

00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:33,110
without involving the rest of his team

00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,580
and I kept talking to him and they were

00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,990
in a situation where they had a lot of

00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:38,120
shared content and a lot of different

00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:41,690
sites that they were trying to integrate

00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:44,809
in a sort of separate but equal way and

00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:46,580
I had to keep coming back to him saying

00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:48,590
we have a lot of questions that we

00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:50,270
haven't answered yet can we bring some

00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:53,539
of these other people in to discuss them

00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:55,370
and sort them out and he would he would

00:30:53,539 --> 00:30:57,470
say oh yeah sure and then the next day

00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:59,540
we'd be back to diagramming his network

00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:02,250
architecture

00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:04,710
that that can be a problem just as it is

00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:06,570
with us diving too deeply into the weeds

00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:08,429
early on with a client that's diving too

00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:10,440
deeply in the weeds early on i wish i

00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:12,780
had spotted that in this client way

00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,970
earlier in our process and then I could

00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:16,740
have redirected it a lot better for

00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:18,330
instance when I had the client with an

00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,730
on-set with my client and I was able to

00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:23,220
meet with his other groups I could have

00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:24,960
I could have reached out to them gotten

00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:27,150
more contact information gotten closer

00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,470
with them so that I had other places

00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:31,350
that I could reach out to rather than

00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:33,090
this one person that was you know that

00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:35,340
was one of those things that I had to

00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:38,340
fight with later on in a project because

00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:39,900
I didn't see it but you know ultimately

00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:44,730
what again what we're talking about here

00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:47,490
is is that you need to realize that the

00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:49,470
client discovery process is a purse is a

00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:51,600
people problem you've got a technology

00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:53,520
project you're building a piece of

00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,740
technology but getting to the point

00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:57,900
where you know what and why you want to

00:31:55,740 --> 00:32:01,020
build is totally a people problem and

00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:03,809
even just going into your discovery with

00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:07,080
that in your mind is is going to help

00:32:03,809 --> 00:32:09,660
you immensely because if you do that and

00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,549
come out of it with all of the

00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,380
information you need then you can hand

00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:15,419
that off to your developers and that

00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,370
they have that then they can go and make

00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:19,290
the decisions about technology even the

00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:21,540
stuff that you haven't had to do really

00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:23,850
well when we did the American

00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:26,669
Booksellers Association project I did

00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:28,080
all of the discovery and helped them

00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:30,419
through a lot of the decision-making

00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:31,860
that led to an architecture for the

00:32:30,419 --> 00:32:33,960
build that we were doing in the

00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:36,419
migration and Dave Reed did that

00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:38,490
migration and as he was doing that

00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:40,140
migration he was saying hey you know

00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,760
based on all of the stuff that you've

00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,919
given me in about what they want to do

00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,860
and why and when and stuff I think this

00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,210
technology this over here that I knows a

00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,980
lot about that you didn't know anything

00:32:48,210 --> 00:32:51,990
about would be a really good fit for

00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,490
them and we talked it through and he was

00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:55,440
totally right but he could not have made

00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:57,450
that decision if I hadn't brought to him

00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:59,940
all of the information that he needed to

00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:02,480
know about why and what this project was

00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:04,919
and what its goals and priorities were

00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,960
that stuff that's the stuff that drives

00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:09,179
all of our projects so important to get

00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,799
done if you get it out together then we

00:33:09,179 --> 00:33:11,789
can all have a big high five at the end

00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,739
and

00:33:11,789 --> 00:33:15,690
everyone will have a lot of success and

00:33:13,739 --> 00:33:17,190
we'll party and then you can come to

00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:23,100
drupalcon and talk about how cool your

00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:24,450
project was so that's my presentation

00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:30,929
and I'll be happy to take any questions

00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:34,259
from anybody if they have them how do

00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:39,419
you know when the discovery processes is

00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:41,549
done is there finish um we typically do

00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:44,519
don't do much more than three days for

00:33:41,549 --> 00:33:46,979
these sometimes we'll do too but usually

00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:49,830
our discoveries are three days I found

00:33:46,979 --> 00:33:52,349
that it's usually it's usually a good

00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:56,729
amount of time I would actually say that

00:33:52,349 --> 00:34:01,080
sometimes or even reasonably often about

00:33:56,729 --> 00:34:02,669
into the early or middle second day we

00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:06,539
will probably have the information that

00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:09,329
we need and I'll say that's a gut

00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:11,159
feeling more than anything but again if

00:34:09,329 --> 00:34:13,500
I'm starting to see the trends if I'm

00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:14,790
starting to see the big picture and if

00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:15,960
I'm repeating it back to them and

00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:17,520
they're nodding their heads and they're

00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,530
saying yeah yeah that makes sense to me

00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,710
or you know based on what you all are

00:34:19,530 --> 00:34:24,750
saying I see you you know it seems like

00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:26,240
a lot of your focus is here you know is

00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:28,799
that really important to this project

00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:30,359
and then you know if we have some time

00:34:28,799 --> 00:34:33,270
left we actually will start diving into

00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:35,069
what we're going to do but but you know

00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:36,809
having having the time to make sure that

00:34:35,069 --> 00:34:39,540
you can get there is the important part

00:34:36,809 --> 00:34:51,270
but how do you know you're done you just

00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:53,040
kind of know sure oh so he's asking

00:34:51,270 --> 00:34:55,730
about paid discovery versus unpaid

00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:59,970
discovery we only do paid discovery and

00:34:55,730 --> 00:35:03,000
especially our arc are the classic way

00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:04,740
that will do this is that we will come

00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,380
to a client and they'll have you know

00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:09,210
something on the order of maybe not much

00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,920
more than we have 20 sites and we want

00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:12,690
to migrate them to Drupal and here's

00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,369
what platforms they're on right now and

00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,710
maybe here's what traffic there on and

00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:18,180
then maybe i'll get an hour with them in

00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:20,579
the sales process and ask them a few

00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:23,940
more questions and what we will usually

00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:25,170
do is pitch them the discovery as an

00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:27,089
individual project

00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:29,099
and then out of that discovery will come

00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:31,799
up with the information that they can

00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:33,420
take to another place to build if they

00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:35,640
want to but we get paid for the

00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:37,799
discovery it is an invoiced project and

00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:39,869
but what we found actually is that

00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:42,089
usually we can establish a really good

00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:43,710
rapport with the client and we will end

00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:46,049
up getting the build as well if we want

00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:48,930
it and in you know obviously at that

00:35:46,049 --> 00:35:50,579
point the client is is motivated to work

00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:51,750
with us because we've gone we understand

00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:52,859
their business and everything that

00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,690
they're going through and things like

00:35:52,859 --> 00:36:00,210
that I'm not a fan of the unpaid

00:35:54,690 --> 00:36:03,089
discovery yes two questions uh first one

00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:05,220
do you have any techniques for flesh or

00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:06,450
kind of pulling out those goals from

00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:09,000
from the organization that you're

00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:11,549
working with I mean one of the one of

00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,049
the things is that um all of the groups

00:36:11,549 --> 00:36:18,089
have their own goals and getting those

00:36:13,049 --> 00:36:20,700
out first is is a starting point finding

00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:24,390
commonalities there starts to build the

00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:27,780
big picture a lot of times there you'll

00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:29,369
start talking about excuse me you'll

00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:31,290
start talking to groups about what their

00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:33,290
goals are what happens in their group or

00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:37,319
what their business things are and

00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:39,119
you'll see certain themes develop that

00:36:37,319 --> 00:36:40,710
maybe they hadn't articulated as goals

00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,470
or hadn't thought about his goals but

00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:45,059
which really are goals for them as an

00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:47,130
organization but which they in their own

00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:48,960
little pockets hadn't figured out and

00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:51,240
that's when you start bringing that

00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,280
stuff up back to them saying you know I

00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:56,579
noticed that you all mentioned you know

00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:57,809
this kind of thing is a problem and if

00:36:56,579 --> 00:36:59,130
they start nodding their heads and like

00:36:57,809 --> 00:37:01,920
wow you're right and then you start

00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:03,150
writing that down or you know it seems

00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:05,099
like you all think this is really

00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:07,170
important or like this is all you all

00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:09,750
seem to think that this class of problem

00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:12,589
is a real bummer and they'll be like

00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:15,000
yeah you're right you're right and

00:37:12,589 --> 00:37:16,799
that's where you can start dry that's

00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,690
where your value really comes in because

00:37:16,799 --> 00:37:21,390
you've got the five thousand foot view

00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:24,690
and they've got the you know ten foot

00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:26,460
view and and starting to pull all of

00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:29,730
that stuff together from high up is

00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:33,450
really key to what you're trying to do

00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:35,609
as part of that process I think and and

00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:38,040
secondly after you're done this

00:37:35,609 --> 00:37:38,970
discovery process like what have have

00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,790
you created like

00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:43,860
have a list of 200 user stories or like

00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:46,740
what what if what have you got to pass

00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:50,340
on to the next phase usually what will

00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:53,390
have to pass on is um you know we'll

00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:57,390
have a document it'll be about 15 pages

00:37:53,390 --> 00:38:00,300
it'll a lot of it will be summary of of

00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:03,390
what we discussed it'll be our big

00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:05,910
picture view of the project it will have

00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:07,650
a lot of architecture stuff involved in

00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:09,360
it because again after we get involved

00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:11,670
with after we get all of this goals and

00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:13,830
priorities in place I will take it and

00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:15,690
say well based on what they've told me

00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:18,780
here is how i recommend that we build

00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:21,450
out this project and we usually have

00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:25,370
enough information to pull timelines and

00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:27,420
budgets together as well so i might say

00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:31,140
based on the information that you've

00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:34,020
given me i recommend that you that you

00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:36,000
build you know each of these sites

00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,650
individually with a content store on

00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,080
solar that they all have an API to

00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:41,940
access so that you can do federated

00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:44,010
search and then through this content

00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,870
store they can also pull out and they

00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:47,790
can also pull out stories from each of

00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:49,350
the individual sites because the

00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:51,270
business is deemed that it's important

00:38:49,350 --> 00:38:53,160
that while each site maintained their

00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:55,350
own identity they should be able to

00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,570
prioritize or bubble up stuff from the

00:38:55,350 --> 00:39:00,660
other sites that they wanted you know

00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:02,820
stuff like that the stuff that feeds

00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:05,220
from their priorities and goals but we

00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:08,880
have to talk about how to build it in a

00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:11,070
sustainable way will we will often get

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,660
into what modules will you use what

00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:14,010
version of Drupal will you use that's

00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,680
going to be a question that's going to

00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:18,660
start being a big one soon it's already

00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,180
people are starting to ask would you

00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:23,040
recommend that we do this now or would

00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:26,400
you recommend that we do it later well

00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:28,590
it depends how much do you need a solid

00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,840
web services foundation how much do you

00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:32,880
need to get it done by the end of the

00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,950
year you know all of these things feed

00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,810
into it and we'll have that document and

00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:38,250
it'll basically be you know here's what

00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:39,870
we've learned from you here's what we

00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:41,070
determined that you want need here's how

00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:43,350
we would recommend that you would build

00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:44,610
it if you want us to do it then here is

00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:46,320
how much time it would take and what it

00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:48,480
would cost basically is what we come out

00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:50,970
of it with so at that high of a level

00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,630
like you're able to come up with a

00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:56,080
budget with any great

00:39:52,630 --> 00:40:00,850
certainty with a reasonable amount of

00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:05,680
certainty yeah I would say so all right

00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:07,720
okay you mentioned kind of deal with

00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,850
Paul the political questions head-on

00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:11,500
yeah that works pretty well especially

00:40:09,850 --> 00:40:13,720
if you're an outside consultant yes

00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,610
that's right um have any perspective for

00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:18,340
insiders who are you know basically do

00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:21,700
the in-house discovery oh that's hard

00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:23,860
it's really hard actually not the CTOs

00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:26,110
pet project that had right and it's

00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:28,120
tough because um I was actually brought

00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:33,910
in on a project recently for just that

00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:35,890
reason where the the the CTO was dealing

00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:37,810
with a lot of rabble-rousing within his

00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:41,500
organization and within his board of

00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:43,450
directors about topic X and he didn't

00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,160
think that topic X was a good idea or he

00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:46,780
thought they should consider y or

00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,820
whatever and would you come in and help

00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:51,850
us do an analysis of our business in our

00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:53,200
situation and say eh what kind of stuff

00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:55,630
would you recommend to us but also

00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,640
specifically talked about topic XY and Z

00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:59,500
and it was interesting because when I

00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:02,110
presented that to their board they said

00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:04,120
you know this was stuff that had been

00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:06,400
sacrosanct for their board to discuss

00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:07,750
that they had just said no to one

00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,950
hundred percent every time it came up

00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:10,870
but as soon as it came out of my mouth

00:41:08,950 --> 00:41:12,310
they're sitting there talking about it

00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:14,830
and so you're right as a third party

00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:16,900
consultant we we have a lot of ways to

00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:21,580
dive through and cut through that stuff

00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:23,140
that you internally don't um and I don't

00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:25,000
have a good answer for you I'm sorry

00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:26,800
maybe it's just convinced into bringing

00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,750
the third bring in a third party person

00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,870
and actually sometimes you know

00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:34,000
sometimes you can use that person's

00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:35,950
confidence against them because if they

00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,180
really are that confident then why

00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:38,860
wouldn't they want to bring in a third

00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:40,810
party why wouldn't they want to bring in

00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:42,400
an expert to talk about it to confirm

00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:43,900
them because then they've got this

00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,120
platform on which they can shove

00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:47,650
everything through right but on the

00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,900
other hand a lot of times they actually

00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:52,720
know what the real deal is too so that

00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:54,580
doesn't help you either I don't I don't

00:41:52,720 --> 00:42:00,880
have a lot of good perspectives for you

00:41:54,580 --> 00:42:05,200
I'm sorry alright i'm also very internal

00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,730
i mean so i get a lot of pushback if we

00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,869
have a consultant in the con

00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:09,730
salton says we're going to do a

00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:11,859
discovery process and everybody's really

00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:14,560
happy about it and they participate

00:42:11,859 --> 00:42:16,150
fully but if I'm walking into the room I

00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,830
say okay first couple of days we're

00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:20,650
going to do a discovery process on this

00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:22,600
new project and there's a resistance to

00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:24,340
it it's like oh it's a waste of time we

00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,530
already know what the goals are do you

00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:29,080
have any sort of tips and tricks for

00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:32,560
pitching this to get people to buy into

00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:35,290
the process well I mean let's say they

00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,300
say to you oh I or we already know what

00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:39,790
the goals are so ask them what are the

00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:41,619
goals and get a list and then go to all

00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:43,150
of the other people involved and say hey

00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:44,710
it's my understanding that the goals for

00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:46,090
this project are XY and Z and that's

00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:48,580
what I've been told by this group over

00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:52,060
here that's building it is that right

00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:54,100
and you're from the implication that I'm

00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:56,320
getting is that it's probably not now

00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,880
you've got a reason to say oh wow that's

00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,170
weird that's what they told me maybe we

00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:02,230
should all get together and talk about

00:42:59,170 --> 00:43:03,670
it it probably won't ingratiate you with

00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:05,080
the group over here that thought that

00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:06,670
they were going to that that thought

00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:08,859
that they knew that they were doing but

00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:10,630
on the other hand it's probably going to

00:43:08,859 --> 00:43:12,580
ingratiate you with these groups over

00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:14,020
here that are like wow I'm really glad

00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:15,970
that this group over here didn't dive

00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:21,369
into a black hole and try and do that

00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:23,770
thing that's probably you know one thing

00:43:21,369 --> 00:43:25,780
that you could do but I understand again

00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:27,790
internally your politics are a lot

00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:30,600
different than mine are because I can

00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:32,859
say whatever I want to and walk away and

00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,510
not whatever I want to I can say

00:43:32,859 --> 00:43:38,230
whatever I want to get fired too of

00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:43,119
course but but but those those those

00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:45,190
dynamics are infinitely more complex

00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,900
than the ones that I have and a lot of

00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:49,630
times it will really depend on your own

00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:51,160
situation and navigating that a lot more

00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:56,650
carefully than i can probably sit here

00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:58,240
and talk about does anybody else have

00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:03,160
any questions somebody else seems to be

00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:05,619
going up there do you guys have a

00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:07,900
predefined agenda for your discovery

00:44:05,619 --> 00:44:09,970
process so you said three days do you

00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:12,520
give an agenda to the client we usually

00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:15,160
try we usually do a pretty loose agenda

00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:17,680
sort of about you know the first half

00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:19,600
the first the first quarter of the day

00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,829
we'll do introductions and who are you

00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,619
and what is your role in the

00:44:20,829 --> 00:44:26,019
object and then we'll dive into you know

00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:28,690
the topics will depend greatly on the

00:44:26,019 --> 00:44:30,670
project that's involved but maybe it'll

00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:35,799
be a inventory of the sites that they

00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:37,239
have or a let's let's let's you know why

00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:38,859
don't you take me through your site and

00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:40,599
let's look at what's there that can

00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:42,039
actually be really helpful because a lot

00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:43,779
of times they'll be like oh and so

00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:45,549
here's this page and god I hate this

00:44:43,779 --> 00:44:47,499
thing over here it drives me crazy or

00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:49,089
here's this page that has this bug that

00:44:47,499 --> 00:44:51,609
we've never been able to fix and and

00:44:49,089 --> 00:44:53,829
it's really horrible you'll get a lot of

00:44:51,609 --> 00:44:55,509
insight into their pain points just

00:44:53,829 --> 00:44:57,400
naturally because everybody loves

00:44:55,509 --> 00:44:58,690
complaining about their existing website

00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:01,959
especially when they're going to build a

00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:03,969
brand new one and a lot of that stuff

00:45:01,959 --> 00:45:06,249
will end up feeding questions that again

00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:07,869
now we start driving into the into the

00:45:06,249 --> 00:45:11,369
into the stuff that we're really there

00:45:07,869 --> 00:45:14,440
for the agenda tends to be sort of

00:45:11,369 --> 00:45:16,599
really really big topics that we may or

00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,519
may not get to but the one thing that's

00:45:16,599 --> 00:45:21,430
really useful in the agenda is you can

00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:22,660
say here's this really big topic and for

00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:24,599
this really big topic it's really

00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:27,069
important for these people to be here

00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:29,859
because you know when you're talking

00:45:27,069 --> 00:45:31,630
about the things like what kind of

00:45:29,859 --> 00:45:35,769
content are we going to share that's a

00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:37,749
different big problem then what I've

00:45:35,769 --> 00:45:39,880
heard you guys are using want to have an

00:45:37,749 --> 00:45:42,160
sso solution what you have in place

00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:44,140
right now where you're going to need to

00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,390
get the the system admin guys in there

00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:49,029
it and it also helps because it means

00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:50,469
that you don't have to say you know a

00:45:49,029 --> 00:45:52,119
lot of these stakeholders are usually

00:45:50,469 --> 00:45:54,279
really busy and very appreciative of the

00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:56,410
chance to say I can take two hours away

00:45:54,279 --> 00:45:59,170
from this and go catch up on the rest of

00:45:56,410 --> 00:46:00,430
my life that's so that is one part

00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:02,289
that's really good about having an

00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:06,699
agenda but again the agenda tends to be

00:46:02,289 --> 00:46:14,019
very broad and very generalized we don't

00:46:06,699 --> 00:46:16,089
dive into it too deeply hello hi so you

00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:17,920
talked to quite a bit about goals and

00:46:16,089 --> 00:46:20,709
defining goals across the organization

00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,779
and across different stakeholders how do

00:46:20,709 --> 00:46:25,359
you incorporate kind of like the the end

00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:27,459
user goals into that process so the

00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:32,019
people who actually be using the site

00:46:27,459 --> 00:46:34,599
and maybe not your client ideally those

00:46:32,019 --> 00:46:36,789
goals are built into their goals

00:46:34,599 --> 00:46:38,890
it's not always true I always like to

00:46:36,789 --> 00:46:41,589
joke that I've never seen a user study

00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:43,359
in which the users came out and said god

00:46:41,589 --> 00:46:45,309
I really wish I could have more talk

00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:49,380
more advertising that was targeted at me

00:46:45,309 --> 00:46:51,489
more closely so you know obviously

00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,859
sometimes those things aren't in

00:46:51,489 --> 00:46:55,150
opposition but they are different

00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:56,589
ideally they will be bringing those

00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:58,989
things up and there's a lot of those

00:46:56,589 --> 00:47:00,579
goals that we end up bringing up to them

00:46:58,989 --> 00:47:02,979
especially now with things like

00:47:00,579 --> 00:47:06,369
responsive with front end work with

00:47:02,979 --> 00:47:08,259
front end performance where you know

00:47:06,369 --> 00:47:12,130
that'll come out of our research either

00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:14,710
before or during but you know a lot of

00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:16,930
times it'll be like you know how is this

00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:19,329
important to you and they'll say you

00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:21,309
know oh no response is not important to

00:47:19,329 --> 00:47:22,989
us only five percent of our thing is

00:47:21,309 --> 00:47:24,339
mobile and then we'll say have you ever

00:47:22,989 --> 00:47:25,630
considered the fact that maybe the

00:47:24,339 --> 00:47:27,190
reason five percent of your thing as

00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:28,869
mobile is because when you bring it up

00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:30,400
on your website all you can see is this

00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:31,720
little logo in the corner and then you

00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,960
have to scroll and screwing everything

00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:36,220
down right we've we have a lot of those

00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,690
discussions although they're becoming

00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:41,680
rarer and rarer as time goes on

00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:43,569
obviously but if they don't bring them

00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:48,640
up I will usually bring them up as a

00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:50,680
matter of course but again you can't

00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,200
always control those priorities and at

00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,999
some level if they haven't determined

00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,890
that that stuff is their priority right

00:47:54,999 --> 00:47:59,529
now then it's kind of out of your hands

00:47:56,890 --> 00:48:01,210
I guess do you ever push for a component

00:47:59,529 --> 00:48:03,190
of like customer research to try to

00:48:01,210 --> 00:48:06,279
bring that into the conversation we

00:48:03,190 --> 00:48:10,690
definitely have it's usually for clients

00:48:06,279 --> 00:48:12,609
that are to some extent on what point in

00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:15,329
the process you come through like a lot

00:48:12,609 --> 00:48:18,039
of our projects they may already have

00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:19,779
wireframes and designs in place if that

00:48:18,039 --> 00:48:21,880
happens then there's not a lot of help

00:48:19,779 --> 00:48:24,099
we can do about things like consumer

00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:25,569
customer research if we come in really

00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:27,430
early like right at the very beginning

00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,930
and we're starting to build that part of

00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:31,569
our business a lot more now especially

00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:32,950
as we repeat with clients because they

00:48:31,569 --> 00:48:34,630
come back to us and say you did a great

00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:36,130
job doing the build-up for our website

00:48:34,630 --> 00:48:38,109
we're just trying to think about our

00:48:36,130 --> 00:48:40,829
next website then we start talking about

00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:44,200
that kind of stuff a lot user research

00:48:40,829 --> 00:48:46,030
all sorts of like content strategy stuff

00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:48,400
and responsive

00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:51,370
um stuff that will help establish those

00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:53,620
goals again earlier in the process as

00:48:51,370 --> 00:48:54,610
early as humanly possible but sometimes

00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:56,260
we just don't have that opportunity

00:48:54,610 --> 00:49:01,300
because we're just brought in to do the

00:48:56,260 --> 00:49:04,060
build cool all right thank you so after

00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:06,280
you've built up this working body of

00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:08,650
knowledge around the business operations

00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,990
how do you transfer that to the

00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:12,880
development team you know after the

00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:16,890
Solutions Architect engagement as a you

00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:19,270
know discovery right usually um we will

00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:21,460
they will have of course access to the

00:49:19,270 --> 00:49:23,230
document that we wrote but usually the

00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:25,810
the person who does the architecture

00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:27,130
will at least to some extent continue to

00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:28,900
be involved through the life of the

00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:32,100
project we've talked about different

00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:34,510
ways in which that can reveal itself

00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:36,250
there are certain architects who are

00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:38,320
interested in actually taking the

00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:40,150
project in becoming the PM going forward

00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:42,340
that has a lot of advantages in a lot of

00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:44,200
ways if they're you know if they're the

00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:46,780
kind of person who is good or interested

00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:48,190
in doing that it maintains an existing

00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:50,230
relationship with somebody some

00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:51,580
continuity between the people that

00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:53,320
they're working with for the client

00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:54,820
which is obviously helpful for them and

00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:56,200
you've got the body of knowledge that

00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:58,000
you can pass on to the developers

00:49:56,200 --> 00:50:00,160
especially if you yourself are a

00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,680
developer in the past and we only hire

00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,970
technical PMS we don't hire project

00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:05,650
managers who have never had any

00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:08,860
development experience before for the

00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:10,270
most part so because because of that

00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:13,600
very thing so they can communicate with

00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:15,550
the developers but even if the person is

00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:17,200
just tasked with you know a once a week

00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:19,150
meeting where they get together and say

00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:21,580
hey do you guys have any questions for

00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:23,020
me they say no or yes you know this part

00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:25,330
of what we've been doing doesn't make

00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,950
any sense or you know I noticed this

00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:28,090
part is missing did you mean to fill

00:50:26,950 --> 00:50:30,640
something in there that you never got

00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:33,250
around to or you know these two things

00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:35,080
were in opposition maybe was that

00:50:33,250 --> 00:50:38,920
something that got resolved later on or

00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:41,200
things like that but maintaining some

00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:44,440
level of presence in the project is

00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:46,180
important for us and we always do it we

00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,100
never just throw it over the wall in the

00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:50,830
walk away do you ever see yourself

00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:52,810
involved in requirements engineering or

00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:57,310
becoming more of a technical product

00:50:52,810 --> 00:50:59,650
owner as the project is a move short you

00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:00,760
mean in terms of

00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:02,560
we're plating some of that business

00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:04,570
value towards the project of

00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,220
implementation we usually do that as

00:51:04,570 --> 00:51:08,290
part of the project as part of what we

00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:10,500
deliver in the deliverable after the

00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:12,970
discovery we do talk a lot about

00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:15,730
implementation we talk about versions

00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:16,930
that we thought that we'd recommend one

00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:18,220
of the things that we talked a lot about

00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:20,700
with clients right now is whether

00:51:18,220 --> 00:51:23,230
decoupled make sense for them or not

00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:24,640
depending again on their goals and what

00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:25,660
kind of staff they have and what kind of

00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,720
stuff that they're trying to put

00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:30,370
together we don't we don't obviously get

00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:31,660
down into we're going to install these

00:51:30,370 --> 00:51:34,930
modules and you're going to have five

00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:36,550
views on this page but general concepts

00:51:34,930 --> 00:51:38,380
of their architecture and general big

00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:41,250
picture stuff will definitely get into

00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:43,600
as a part of the as a part of the

00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:45,510
requirements document that we build how

00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:49,120
deeply we get into the implementation

00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:51,670
once the dev build starts depends wildly

00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:53,320
on the project and staffing and who's

00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:54,580
involved in the project over here and

00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,080
who was involved in the project over

00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:57,850
here and stuff like that one of the

00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:00,460
things that's great about low about is

00:51:57,850 --> 00:52:03,160
that we don't have a rigid established

00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:04,570
process we tend to be very fluid

00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:07,570
depending on the client and their needs

00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:10,360
and so in a lot of those cases we'll

00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:16,870
just see how it how it plays out to be

00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:19,330
honest sure thank you yep and thanks

00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:22,080
everyone for coming I hope that this was

00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:22,080
useful to you

00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:29,380
and if you like this session or or

00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:31,180
dislike this session or any other

00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:35,830
session that you attended this week

00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:37,420
please go to the evaluation URL and and

00:52:35,830 --> 00:52:39,880
rate the session and leave comments as

00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:41,440
somebody who has previously organized

00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,570
drupalcon and been a track chair

00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,940
forgettable calm I cannot emphasize how

00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:49,000
much these evaluations are helpful to us

00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:51,580
in determining choices for speakers in

00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:53,110
the following years the stuff is really

00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:54,700
informative and really helpful with both

00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:59,080
for our speakers into the organizers

00:52:54,700 --> 00:53:02,560
thanks i'll upload my sides look on

00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:04,240
twitter i'll post it do they have a

00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:06,100
place on the session you're on the

00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:09,040
session notes to upload slides on the on

00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:13,290
the for the for the con they usually do

00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:13,290
