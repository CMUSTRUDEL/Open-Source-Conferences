Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: A "plain Drupal English" guide to the remaining Drupal 8 criticals
Publication date: 2015-05-13
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	At the time of DrupalCon LA, we will most likely have some number of critical Drupal 8 issues remaining. This talk will provide a run-down of what remains, providing some necesasry background/context, akin to the blog post at Webchick's "plain Drupal English" Guide to the Remaining Drupal 8 Critical Issues: DrupalCon Bogot√° Edition. The hope is that this will help people coming to the DrupalCon Sprints hit the ground running to help push us closer to release!
