Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Learnings from our launched Drupal 8 Core customer projects
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	Call us crazy, call us innovative: We're building customer websites already with Drupal 8 Core. Why? Because we believe that there is nothing better then learning by doing, so we jump into the shark pool and learn at the forefront how Drupal 8 Core works. Also we're using this as part of our various ways how we contribute, nothing better tests Drupal 8 for the future, then using it for what we will all use it in the future.

But of course it's not easy, Drupal 8 Core is not stable, contrib modules are not ready yet, so we cannot build everything we would like.

In this session I will present how we've approached the projects with having only Drupal 8 Core Alpha and Beta. Showing statements from our SiteBuilders, Frontend and Backend Developers, how it is for them to develop with D8, what they like, what they didn't like. And of course how we actually did it, the workarounds we had to find for missing Drupal 8 Core. And so much I can say: D8 is awesome capable even without any Contrib Modules.

Also it should take away the fear from Drupal 8 adoption, yes there are a lot of new things, yes they are things to change, but they are not as crazy as some of us are worried about.
