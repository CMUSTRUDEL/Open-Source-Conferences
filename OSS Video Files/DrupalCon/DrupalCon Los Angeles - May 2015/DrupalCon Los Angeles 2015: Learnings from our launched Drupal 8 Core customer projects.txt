Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Learnings from our launched Drupal 8 Core customer projects
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	Call us crazy, call us innovative: We're building customer websites already with Drupal 8 Core. Why? Because we believe that there is nothing better then learning by doing, so we jump into the shark pool and learn at the forefront how Drupal 8 Core works. Also we're using this as part of our various ways how we contribute, nothing better tests Drupal 8 for the future, then using it for what we will all use it in the future.

But of course it's not easy, Drupal 8 Core is not stable, contrib modules are not ready yet, so we cannot build everything we would like.

In this session I will present how we've approached the projects with having only Drupal 8 Core Alpha and Beta. Showing statements from our SiteBuilders, Frontend and Backend Developers, how it is for them to develop with D8, what they like, what they didn't like. And of course how we actually did it, the workarounds we had to find for missing Drupal 8 Core. And so much I can say: D8 is awesome capable even without any Contrib Modules.

Also it should take away the fear from Drupal 8 adoption, yes there are a lot of new things, yes they are things to change, but they are not as crazy as some of us are worried about.

hello and welcome to the next

00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:08,069
presentation and learnings from our

00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:14,790
launch Drupal 8 core customer projects

00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:17,850
and my name is Michael or people call me

00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:20,880
schnitzel and I'm head technology at the

00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:24,930
maze elapsed and we're company in Austin

00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,330
and Zurich and I'm ahead technology and

00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,400
was one of the co-founders and I'm

00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,050
usually the guy that yells at you at

00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,030
group pictures that you all should wait

00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,430
with me so I can take a picture of you

00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,570
and which also happened this morning so

00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,219
by the way you all looked really great

00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,980
and it's on flickr already so you can

00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:43,530
see the picture but not about group

00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:47,910
pictures about Drupal 8 living on the

00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:50,100
edge so our journey or why we even did

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:51,870
that so the first site we launched was

00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,020
our own which was pretty always the

00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:58,320
easiest and it was already a year ago so

00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:02,100
in april 2014 we launched the major labs

00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,690
in drupal 8 over at that time and it had

00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,939
two languages it was a completely

00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,700
redesigned so we did not only take our

00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:11,250
old design and did it on drupal 8 we

00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,470
also redesigned it completely and it was

00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:15,659
a pretty interesting journey because we

00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,409
didn't like in six weeks and so there

00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,909
was a lot of working on it figuring out

00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:22,530
fixing bugs on the go but what was

00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,840
really good is because it was our own

00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:27,509
site we could live with the box we could

00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,070
work around of the box and when we also

00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,400
decided that like some features we

00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,920
didn't put in and what it was we learned

00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,110
a lot of that and actually out of that

00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,689
came more business out of that so we

00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:43,710
were asked to help with Drupal calm

00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:45,450
which is a site owned by dreese and when

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,030
it's more like the business side of

00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,100
tuple to org so we have case studies up

00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,460
there and we have a lot of different

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,259
information or for business as for them

00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:58,020
to find about Drupal what is it why

00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:59,399
should I use it and stuff so because we

00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,740
like to live on the edge it's done in

00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,920
Drupal 8 and then we're actively working

00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,770
on it that was like in September 2014

00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,020
and at that point you already had a beta

00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,060
which was a bit easier and

00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,010
and it only has one language right now

00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,570
but we definitely want to add there are

00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:18,690
a lot of language spoken in the world so

00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:21,270
we want to do that the next one was the

00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,730
another client project it's for the

00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:30,690
Schweitzer my music is a shaft and it

00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:33,000
that was done in January 2015 wait the

00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:36,720
longest name ever the shrines and Shake

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:42,900
in mind so it's a it's like the Swiss

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:46,080
Society of like mine k sales of whatever

00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:50,370
so it's like a can't really tell you

00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:54,600
what is it in English whatever em yeah

00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:56,370
yes so um that wasn't done in January

00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:58,500
2015 and they came to us and said like

00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:00,030
we have already Drupal 6 site they had

00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,590
at that point and we said we wanted to

00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,170
it new and when you looked at the

00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:06,270
functionality that the site had and was

00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:09,450
basically a brochure site so it's like

00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:12,540
what who we are what do we do and 3 News

00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:15,180
entries done so we said okay let's try

00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,310
it and it actually has four languages

00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:19,740
you only can see two right now but we

00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,440
are installing more and that was really

00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,480
great and and yeah basically starting

00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,280
from that we just felt so we feel so

00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,709
comfortable if you play it so like every

00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:31,350
new site that is like super tiny like

00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:33,750
this one we launched two days ago which

00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:35,810
is our group the amazing group side it

00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,640
has to content types in three notes and

00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:40,440
because it's a one-pager site but it's

00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,380
just you can already use it it works

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,300
perfectly it's super great so yeah so we

00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,120
launched that and it's just right now

00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:49,740
it's our tool whenever you we need like

00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,959
a brochure side the small side we

00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:55,470
already do it in triple eight and and

00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,990
yeah we do more so and we have right now

00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:01,050
like three sites in development that we

00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:03,530
do about it and I want to tell you about

00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:07,920
what we learned of a different

00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:11,610
environment of different areas and to do

00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,370
it short and so yes it works and it's

00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:16,880
actually pretty great and it's really

00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:19,080
surprisingly great what you can do

00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,359
sometimes you have to be a bit creative

00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,950
and we will see them later because as

00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:23,370
most of you probably know there is not a

00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,400
lot of

00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:28,680
trip right now but the best is nobody

00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,120
wants to go back to Drupal 7 neither

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,250
site builders need a front that need a

00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:34,710
back end either I want to go back and we

00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,650
still have to because we still we

00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:39,930
usually build sites that are really big

00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:42,660
so and there is only way to do that in

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,250
Drupal 7 right now but them yeah so

00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,590
everybody's excited and I think that's

00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:50,550
great that we're looking ahead to a

00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:55,949
really interesting feature so let's look

00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:59,729
at the different type of users of Drupal

00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:03,150
how they reacted and the first of all

00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:05,310
are the editors I mean we build sites we

00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:07,020
implement them with I build them but at

00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,050
the end it's the editors that have to

00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:12,030
use it if they don't like it we won't

00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,630
have any success with Drupal 8 and the

00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:18,240
best days we didn't even tell them em in

00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:25,520
the beginning we didn't tell them if my

00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,520
slides now update no doesn't one lovely

00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:33,960
okay yes so yes we didn't tell the

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:38,340
editors that we actually use super late

00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,900
they knew Drupal 6 the sgt website and

00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,940
we just told them like there is a new

00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,410
Drupal and we didn't tell them it's of a

00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,979
better and stuff which was told them go

00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:48,960
there and edit and they didn't realize

00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:50,520
it that there is something new that

00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,260
there is a better because it's already

00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,300
so stable from an editor point of view

00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:56,280
that you can use it but they really

00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,919
liked it they like for example they

00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,900
really liked the new layout that like

00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:03,180
the publish stuff is on the right side

00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,949
and actually they have some other Drupal

00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,810
7 site so they asked us like can we also

00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:09,060
have that like we really like that that

00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:11,699
we now see the publish on the right side

00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,530
and like all the X's and like the new

00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:16,650
buttons and all that stuff that we did a

00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:19,949
lot about usability it's it's super

00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:21,330
great and so we like at the end had to

00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:23,010
explain that we had you know like it's

00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,360
that new triple 8 thingy and better

00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:25,940
because they wanted to have all their

00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,160
other sites that are really big also

00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,990
migrated to that new thing and so you

00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:32,640
need to explain them at the end that

00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:34,260
it's not ready yet whatever's and we can

00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,090
do it for the pressure side but not for

00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:38,370
all the other sites of course there are

00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,169
some themes that allow you in 2 / 7

00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:44,880
already use the new layout and be used

00:06:40,169 --> 00:06:46,560
at the end and but it's yeah it's we

00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,090
just gave it to them and we asked them

00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,280
how it is and they don't want to go back

00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:55,320
to Drupal 7 as well so that's cool let's

00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,120
talk about multilingual a really

00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,950
important part for us in Switzerland we

00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,570
have four official languages where

00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:06,090
English is none of them so actually it's

00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:08,729
five and and any website we do is has at

00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:12,780
least two languages so multilingual is a

00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:14,400
really important part for us and we

00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,909
worked ourselves on it I did a lot of

00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,940
things but everything and I say really

00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:24,139
every single string that you see is

00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:27,200
translatable out of core without

00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:30,000
installing any additional controls

00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:32,070
anybody that has installed or that the

00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,279
stun full translated website I mean

00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:36,570
really every single string translated in

00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:41,099
the Drupal 7 tight ends I've been

00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:44,039
installing around 27 modules and which

00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:47,460
sometimes with catchers and stuff so a

00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:48,779
lot of fun and so it's really like you

00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,460
installed you'll probably have four

00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:51,750
modules who install them and everything

00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:54,570
is automatically out of the box

00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:56,880
translatable and that was one of the big

00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:58,919
reasons why we do it right now because

00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:01,289
it just works like without multilingual

00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:03,090
capabilities we wouldn't use super late

00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:06,900
right now and I think that's a really

00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:08,550
big step forward that will also make any

00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:10,740
easier for all of you to start using

00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:15,270
Drupal 8 if you have multilang a website

00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:17,729
because it's no longer every Nesso i

00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:19,860
don't know if i can install that or if i

00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:22,820
can use that it's already there it

00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:26,190
supported by core so that's cool of

00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,750
course there are some issues and two of

00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,639
them that I'm really interested right

00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:34,140
now so the problem is that if you use

00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:36,479
browser negotiation so that Drupal gives

00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,120
you back the language based on your

00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,640
browser language if you haven't that

00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,690
installed your whole cache will not be

00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:48,240
running which is a bit bad so especially

00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,779
if it to 27 languages which we have on

00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,680
some site

00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:54,899
so I'm working on that right now to find

00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,730
a way to redirect to the right path

00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,189
prefix which then can be cash so there's

00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:02,100
some things and there's a really really

00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:04,499
old issue that is now reloaded basically

00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:07,680
it's that entity like translations and

00:09:04,499 --> 00:09:09,360
innovations it was a really bad issue in

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,430
the past with Drupal 7 already with Kahn

00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,769
translation with entities inflation it

00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:16,139
actually got a slightly bit worse so

00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:18,720
there are some people working actively

00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:20,970
right now to make aunty translation

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,100
which is the default translation method

00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,949
in Drupal 8 now work together with

00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:29,009
revisions because right now whenever you

00:09:25,949 --> 00:09:33,509
have revisions installed and you

00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:36,269
translate one single translation of a

00:09:33,509 --> 00:09:38,850
note it will copy all the translations

00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:41,370
for all the revisions so you not only

00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:45,329
end up in having a huge list of

00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:47,939
revisions if you revert back you cannot

00:09:45,329 --> 00:09:50,610
revert only by language so if i revert

00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:52,259
back to the german version like the

00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:54,180
English changes in there that I maybe

00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:57,420
didn't want to revert or also reverted

00:09:54,180 --> 00:10:00,149
so we have right now not enabled

00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,769
revisions at all on any our sites and if

00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:04,649
you use if you want to use that right

00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:06,600
now be careful the fun part is actually

00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:08,939
it's also broken in entity translation

00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:10,889
of Drupal 7 and revisions so if you do

00:10:08,939 --> 00:10:12,660
that already these days you probably

00:10:10,889 --> 00:10:14,850
know about these issues so it's the same

00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:17,519
of eight but they're actively working on

00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,259
it and with a lot of different ways and

00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,370
we really hope you're going to get that

00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:25,620
in and because without that it's just we

00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:27,870
are just at eighty percent of the whole

00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:29,899
translation with revisions which states

00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:33,540
with your clothes and all that stuff but

00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:35,370
overall multilingual works really great

00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:38,459
and it's and it's a pleasure to work

00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:40,139
with it and and to definitely see or to

00:10:38,459 --> 00:10:42,240
get free earn the fruits that we put the

00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:44,069
seeds in in like three years ago when we

00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,490
start or like even longer when we did

00:10:44,069 --> 00:10:51,029
the whole multilingual stuff let's go

00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:53,339
about site building and site building in

00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:56,040
Drupal a gives you this really comfy

00:10:53,339 --> 00:11:00,000
cozy feeling that it feels everything

00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:02,190
right and complete in Drupal 7 we have

00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,710
like content types and we have

00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:07,200
it attacked economies and we have users

00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:09,900
that have fields that's great if I need

00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:12,930
a new field for a user right just added

00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:15,420
but if I need a field for a menu link

00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:17,550
like I there is there is an entity but

00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,930
there is not so i have to like install

00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,480
another module which is called many

00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:24,450
attributions so i can inject the picture

00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,460
too many or if you want to do other like

00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:28,590
you want to add a field to a blog how

00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:30,510
crazy is that like who needs a field on

00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:33,150
a blog in triple seven that's also

00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:36,150
possible now in eight as everything is

00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:37,710
an entity you just do it you just add a

00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:41,510
field to the menu link you just add a

00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:44,130
field to a block and it just feels that

00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:47,340
greatness of like I can now have a

00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:49,380
system that every single pieces match

00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:51,630
together like I use a lot of the energy

00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:54,600
of you of saying to place a bag of Lego

00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:56,310
bricks to my clients and in seven it

00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,040
feels like they don't match together all

00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:01,140
the time in eight now they all match

00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,820
together the meaning you can build crazy

00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:04,680
houses interpolate now and you can

00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:07,080
probably go somewhere that you never can

00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,340
come back but I think that's not the

00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,260
system has to prevent that like the

00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:12,630
system should be able to do that and

00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:14,580
it's just it's so much easier to do

00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:16,230
things and like if if somebody wants

00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,360
understands the field system that has

00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,530
neverland's I building before you just

00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,570
have to explaining the differences

00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:24,030
between terms and contents and users and

00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:27,750
done that's it he can use it and that's

00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:30,930
really great one thing though that we

00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:33,870
saw in daily working you have now block

00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:36,030
instances so in Drupal 7 you place a

00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:38,370
block and it's placed there's a module

00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:40,080
that is called block clone that you can

00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:42,690
place the block a section time a second

00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,750
time in eight you have block instances

00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:48,510
which you can place the block multiple

00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:49,680
times from people that coming from seven

00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,570
to eight that's really confusing

00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,140
especially if you combine it with the

00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:56,760
custom block library so you create your

00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:59,940
custom block library which is like your

00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:01,860
common type you create a block out of

00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,720
that with your content and then you have

00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:07,380
to place it so it's like three steps

00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:09,960
after that and for people that started

00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,730
using that it's really confusing because

00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,380
there are a lot of steps of like in the

00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,930
past you just added your blog and you

00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:17,160
placed it done now you cannot do that

00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,770
because we have a really great system

00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:21,330
behind but it's a bit confusing so if

00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:23,339
you're gonna start using blocks really

00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:27,750
start using them and start using custom

00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:29,130
block libraries and but it's just like

00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,960
placing them is sometimes a bit

00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:33,870
confusing and stuff so maybe give it a

00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,850
time to figure out and I'm first play

00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:37,620
around and it on like I don't know

00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:40,050
simply test me start the side and play

00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:43,950
around with it and learn how to how how

00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:46,830
it works and of course there is a lot of

00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:49,500
country missing like when I look at the

00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:52,200
sites in Drupal 7 we have at least 50 60

00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,760
modules installed by contrib one of the

00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,680
reasons is like multilingual so I have

00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:58,350
put here for twenty seven modules anyway

00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:00,870
installed but there's just a lot of

00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:03,930
other things and and one a problem that

00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:05,910
we had for like the sgt website they

00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:08,399
wanted to have the news on the Hollander

00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:09,959
home page or on the front page but i

00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,300
will see not ordered by the created date

00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:14,010
I mean why not I mean I want to have

00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,720
their older news should be on top

00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:17,820
because it's more important than the

00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:19,500
newest news I mean yeah all the

00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:21,839
requirements of websites we have to fix

00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,940
them so sometimes you have to be really

00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,070
creative and in Drupal 7 I would have

00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,810
said hey there is no DQ we put not

00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:30,150
queuing and then you can order it while

00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:32,190
you go to drupal.org and you see the

00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:34,860
node q module and there's no Drupal 8 so

00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:36,930
you think about okay should I now pay my

00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,180
developers to poured it which obviously

00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:42,510
will be great actually there's a better

00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:44,970
way you just create a new block you put

00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:47,790
entity references in and you're done

00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:50,370
that's your node q you have now a block

00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:52,140
that only has entity references the

00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:54,120
editors can go and edit the block and

00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:56,850
add entity references they can order

00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,800
them really easy and you just put place

00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,300
the block on the home page and down if

00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,279
you need views because you need to do it

00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,770
additional things you can do that

00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:06,690
because a block is an entity views can

00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:08,820
burp of entities and dereferences it's

00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:11,579
our relations and everything so it's the

00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:13,500
the piece of using the different blocks

00:15:11,579 --> 00:15:15,899
putting them together and you don't need

00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,390
a country module and that happens to

00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:20,220
also a lot so there's a lot of things

00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:22,440
that we say there's a module for that

00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,209
but not in Drupal 8 so we cannot do it

00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,220
and then you start to dig deeper and

00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:28,050
think about it and learn and you realize

00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:29,560
I don't even need a country module

00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,660
anymore

00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:35,140
because I can build it with what Drupal

00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:38,980
ships me already if I use it and in the

00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:43,360
right way or if I use it in a.m creative

00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:45,190
way so that's really cool of course that

00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,700
system doesn't fix everything that note

00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:51,130
q does not you can like do even more but

00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,710
there is maybe a single module that just

00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:56,290
lets you shuffle the sorting or that

00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:58,150
lets you automatically in checked when

00:15:56,290 --> 00:16:00,520
you create an entity you can say inject

00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:02,830
that into that anti reference block or

00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:04,839
something but there's just tiny modules

00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:07,390
that can also be used for other things

00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:10,450
and I think that will be interesting to

00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:12,400
see how the node q module as an example

00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:14,110
if that will change maybe the node q

00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,660
module will actually not be any code

00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:18,250
will just be shaped configuration so

00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:21,250
that when you install it it adds you a

00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:24,160
co a block that has entity references

00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:27,460
and so I think that will be some changes

00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,710
how we probably can make country my

00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:32,440
tools because as a community we still

00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:34,900
want to have something like node q on

00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:36,790
drupal.org we cannot expect from

00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:39,010
everybody to understand the entity

00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:40,480
system well enough to build something

00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:43,150
themselves so we want to ship something

00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,980
like that but probably it's not going to

00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:46,720
be code it's just going to be some

00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,040
configuration that we ship that is

00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,380
installed and then you have your new

00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:55,000
node node q block that completely uses

00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:58,450
core one other thing and we are just

00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,010
really having that is SEO and so we have

00:16:58,450 --> 00:17:03,040
actually a sister company that only does

00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:06,970
SEO and it's a bit of sad part so

00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:10,720
there's nothing in Drupal 8 right now

00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:12,910
that supports like any SEO so like our

00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,860
system company they do like an on-site

00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:17,439
reviews when we do a new website and we

00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:19,870
get the lowest rating from them because

00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:23,170
there is like there's not a lot in there

00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:25,630
and like there are no redirects of like

00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:28,179
and there's a lot of country modules in

00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:33,400
seven that provide you that I just think

00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:35,320
as a CMS these days when we ship

00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,250
something we should have at least a

00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,929
minimum amount of SEO the technical SEO

00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:43,090
that is shaped automatically so if

00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:47,020
somebody just uses to plate

00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:48,610
he has at least average SEO rating

00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:51,070
another completely bad and that we

00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:55,210
expand to expect him to download new

00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:58,120
modules because yeah we see SEO is

00:17:55,210 --> 00:18:00,640
getting more important every day and so

00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,870
we should provide it and I'm I don't

00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,370
have a list of all the things that are

00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:06,970
broken right now because we do a lot of

00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:08,350
them in code and custom stuff but I

00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,900
think that would be may be interesting

00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:13,539
to get some people and that are

00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:17,080
interested in SEO to like proposed like

00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:22,299
a standard Drupal aid SEO thing and to

00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:24,370
work in that but yes overall and Drupal

00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:26,679
8 Drupal 7 site builders pick it up in

00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:28,480
two hours like I just had last week

00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:31,350
somebody that has never worked in Drupal

00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,270
8 before and I gave her the

00:18:31,350 --> 00:18:36,370
specifications that we need and she went

00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:39,070
energy created the content types

00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:40,179
creative use credit blocks there's maybe

00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:42,340
some things that you have to learn about

00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:43,960
the new ways but it's like two hours of

00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,419
like reading and throwing around and

00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:49,480
playing and destroying and trying that's

00:18:46,419 --> 00:18:51,700
it like you don't need more because the

00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,440
UI is still the same the ways you do

00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:56,230
stuff is still the same it just feels

00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,200
more it feels complete and everybody

00:18:56,230 --> 00:19:00,789
that I've seen using it tells me that's

00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,120
so much better and I hear that from

00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:06,610
inside of us but also from other

00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:11,020
companies that tried it out so I think

00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:13,679
that's really cool that we kept all the

00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:16,090
systems of seven and didn't change and

00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:20,409
from a UI from a site building point of

00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:22,770
view how stuff works which leads us into

00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:24,700
the configuration management and

00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:27,580
configuration management is basically

00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:29,470
the thing we've all waited for and it's

00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:33,460
like the most it's like the most

00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:35,950
exciting thing because especially the

00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:37,779
bigger the sides get the harder it is to

00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,720
handle features and all these things and

00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:42,730
features was never intended to do that

00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,740
so it's super exciting and everybody

00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,960
likes to use it the problem is and and

00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:50,049
that's what I feel but I also hear it

00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:53,830
from others we don't provide any help to

00:19:50,049 --> 00:19:55,419
use it right now there is no UI there is

00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,380
a UI but it doesn't tell you how to use

00:19:55,419 --> 00:19:58,660
it there

00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:01,240
no there is some documentation of

00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:03,100
drupal.org but it's it's more like how

00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:05,770
it technically works but it's not like

00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:07,900
how should I use that system now and I

00:20:05,770 --> 00:20:09,400
think we have built one of the best

00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:12,010
configuration management systems that

00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,930
everybody else is super jealous about

00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:17,620
like I talk to people from Adobe and

00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:19,870
they said like we throw like endless

00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:22,390
amount of developer hours and take they

00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:24,160
are not able to do that and what we have

00:20:22,390 --> 00:20:27,010
right now but I think we have to make

00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,840
sure that of all the people we made

00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:30,940
everybody super excited that one day the

00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,990
first time use it they don't get sad and

00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:36,760
don't use it so one problem is for

00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:39,370
example there is no real workflow for

00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:41,590
deaf staging production it supports it

00:20:39,370 --> 00:20:43,270
there are sections here I've just was at

00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:47,220
one but there's no real documentation

00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:51,310
about it then we have a staging folder

00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:54,820
that is not the staging environment of

00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:57,280
your site it's like the import/export so

00:20:54,820 --> 00:21:01,960
it's super interesting then we have an

00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:03,610
active folder which is empty okay it

00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,260
comes from a history I know that but I

00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:07,270
think we have to fix these things like

00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,730
we have to remove the stuff that is just

00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:11,560
like because you I saw people that first

00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:13,810
time use Drupal 8 and they call me and

00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,550
say like I have an active configuration

00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:19,750
folder and it's empty what did I do

00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:21,190
wrong and they they don't know they

00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,480
cannot figure out an ID tell him yeah

00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:24,040
you know looked at it's the history that

00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,350
like there was the past there was an

00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,520
active config folder and throws and it's

00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:29,590
now not used anymore it's on the

00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,570
database and like if you use convict

00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:35,160
devil module it will be used and tasting

00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:38,800
like well are you crazy like so yes and

00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:41,830
there's also no way because in every

00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:43,720
where you read we say now we can prevent

00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:46,000
or we can now have worked wells where we

00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:49,000
don't do any changes on life the problem

00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,490
is core doesn't allow us to prevent

00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,260
changes in life there is a module that

00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:58,180
can do that but it's not tripped with

00:21:53,260 --> 00:22:00,160
coralee so um I think that's things that

00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:03,130
we should think about of okay maybe we

00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:07,660
should provide them or at least like

00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:08,860
create a list of of cmi things or

00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:11,440
configuration management

00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:14,080
there's another problem like if you need

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,570
to merge SI mi changes and we see that

00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,200
every day happening that you cannot

00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:22,960
merge SI mi changes inside of drupal

00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,660
because SI mi is like it's the law all

00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,610
the time so if you have like a field

00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:29,500
that is not in si mi and you synchronize

00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:31,600
it it will be deleted in your Active

00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:34,030
Directory in your active configuration

00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,470
it's not how features use to work that

00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:37,750
it's not just like the additional stuff

00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:41,350
it's actually removed it will show you

00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:46,150
but it's a bit strange so like the whole

00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:48,370
m urging needs to happen get and or

00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:50,500
there is rush config merge that helps

00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,880
you doing that but it's just again it's

00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,580
something you have to teach and I had

00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:57,640
multiple times where my developers

00:22:54,580 --> 00:23:00,220
because of just not knowing they take

00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:02,799
their configuration put it on death and

00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:05,980
import it and remove just something that

00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,929
another def just did because they didn't

00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:09,309
know how to use it specifically so

00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:12,669
there's a lot of things missing so

00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:14,230
overall it's really frustrating to work

00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:15,910
with a system that everybody is super

00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:19,230
happy about and we don't really provide

00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:19,230
any information yes

00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:31,380
yes so drush merge josh config merge you

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,030
can point it to another site and we'll

00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:35,400
take the configuration down merge it

00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:37,050
with viewers and export it again and

00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:38,880
create a kid comment if you want that

00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:42,210
and then it pushes it again so there are

00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,710
some things yes so it's a bit really

00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,970
frustrating and sometimes but I mean we

00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:48,090
wouldn't be the Drupal community if you

00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:49,770
could fix that and I think we should we

00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:56,520
should fix it and we should do that so

00:23:49,770 --> 00:24:00,330
there is one old m88 issue I'm sorry

00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:03,330
sorry to Alex fathered Jess just hate me

00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:05,400
but M yes so there is I didn't want to

00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:08,640
create a new one actually but so there's

00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,680
an old drupal issue that describes

00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,310
basically what i said and that we should

00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:17,190
document the gate config workflow and of

00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:20,070
how should we do things it doesn't have

00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:22,440
to be that has to be the way but I think

00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:24,240
we could find a workflow that works in

00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,150
ninety-five percent of all use cases and

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,890
if you just follow that you will be

00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:31,680
happy because right now we don't do

00:24:28,890 --> 00:24:34,050
anything in people on earth the other

00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:36,690
thing and I just did it so I think we

00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:38,940
should rename the staging folder with

00:24:36,690 --> 00:24:41,370
everybody I talked to they think the

00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:44,190
staging folder is an environment so they

00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:45,900
think if I put it in there it will end

00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:47,970
up in my staging environment and it's

00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,310
not the case the staging folder is

00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:52,080
actually the import export folder and we

00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:55,020
can call it think we can call it import

00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:58,740
whatever and I know it's for its its we

00:24:55,020 --> 00:25:01,050
are close to RC but M will have to talk

00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,610
about it and then the next thing is that

00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:04,320
I don't think we should have an active

00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:06,540
directory like if we ship with an active

00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,700
directory that is empty don't create one

00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,650
there's ways in Drupal that like if you

00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,650
install config devil that we tell the

00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:15,120
users hey you should create like go into

00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:17,040
your settings PHP and create a folder

00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:19,050
that we can actually do the other things

00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:22,260
but shipping with something that we

00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:26,810
never use I think that's not how to play

00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:30,260
twerps okay so much about cmi ranting

00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:33,060
it's great it's great like we you you

00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:34,560
develop your side you make a call config

00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,670
export you go on your left side in the

00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,260
importing

00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:40,590
is there then you realize oh yes I i

00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:42,420
changed that text format i change the

00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:43,830
order which something i would definitely

00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:47,190
have forgotten about when i used

00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:50,520
features so it's super great but in the

00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:52,920
daily use things just fail abit I mean

00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,670
but it's better I mean yeah we can tell

00:25:52,920 --> 00:26:00,330
your clients it's better software so

00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:04,800
let's go to the back end and it's all

00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:07,230
pay all the way and so it's everything

00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,410
about object oriented I have to say we

00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:12,380
so much like it it's so much better and

00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:14,610
I think it's a lot of people told me

00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,670
that they learned may be objective

00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:20,790
oriented in school ones but now in

00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:23,190
Drupal 8 when you look at it it makes

00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:24,660
the first time sense like that whole

00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:27,480
examples that you learned about like

00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:29,850
yeah a dog is of type the rhythm and the

00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,470
dog has an ADD method barking and stuff

00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:33,240
and you're like okay thank you but now

00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:36,030
show me code like I want to see in real

00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:39,270
life go to Drupal 8 and it's there and

00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:41,670
you ruined you realize why do we need

00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:45,090
interfaces you realize why do we need

00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:48,660
all the object oriented stuff and and

00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:50,610
it's it's just really cool em but it

00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:53,910
doesn't stop there we have an entity API

00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:56,370
that you can really use no language on

00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:58,170
the line none anymore that people don't

00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:59,580
know what it is about but everybody

00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:02,670
tells me how to do it so I do it but I

00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:05,790
don't know why and we have plugins and

00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:08,400
which are really great just like a block

00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,900
is now a file and it's all in there like

00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,730
if you need a block you just create a

00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,410
file you declare it whatever you need it

00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:16,650
it's done and I like each single block

00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:18,960
is a single file and you have services

00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:22,230
so I can hack cold without hacking core

00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,870
if I don't like something I just change

00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:27,960
it with my country modules and I replace

00:27:24,870 --> 00:27:33,990
it without touching anything so it's

00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:36,210
super great I think it's from from from

00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:39,270
a way of like changing and using core

00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:40,950
it's much more like a framework now than

00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:43,380
it used to be in Drupal 7 I think that's

00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:45,600
super great and of course it's

00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,280
concerning as well and for people that

00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,340
don't really know about about objective

00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,799
or in programming

00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:52,179
and what I've seen for my site builders

00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,460
that generally don't have a lot of

00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:56,590
programming knowledge they pick it up

00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:59,230
they look at example code they look at

00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:03,309
other code and they maybe don't exactly

00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:06,100
know what the namespace is in PHP but if

00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:09,610
if you just use existing code and they

00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:11,400
will use it and another thing is you

00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:16,150
really have to use an idea now and

00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:17,559
without support by your editor that can

00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:19,360
tell you that the class is already

00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:22,149
client you find somewhere else or you

00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:25,360
forgot namespace or whatever you just

00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:26,919
end up in a lot of times go to the

00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,620
Drupal to the actual browser window

00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:33,330
refresh and it will show you a network

00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:35,830
that has nothing to do with PHP like am

00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:38,049
writing code wrong it's just like howdy

00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:40,149
how you used it and an ID makes it

00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:42,940
faster makes it easier to find stuff and

00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:45,610
so i really suggest if you want to use

00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:47,830
triple eight use an ide and we you all

00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:49,659
use phpstorm no plug for ph resume there

00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:51,610
are others they just have really great

00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:54,789
rupal integration actually I've moved

00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:56,830
and they're so talk to them but so it's

00:28:54,789 --> 00:29:00,039
just important then now also our

00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:02,380
front-end and they all use phpstorm for

00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:07,240
development the past we used and sellin

00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:09,880
em know what is called sublime text yes

00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:12,669
and but now we just use PHP stone for

00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:15,669
everything and the same also if you

00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:19,059
don't know how to debug it can get

00:29:15,669 --> 00:29:20,799
really hard in seven it was sometimes

00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:23,710
really easy okay it's probably there and

00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:27,070
I just put a TPM in there now in eight

00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:29,919
you do that and it's never cold and then

00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:31,990
it's over and then you study debugger

00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,760
and then you can actually go into it in

00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:35,860
seven I think there was a lot of time

00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,080
yeah yeah let's just try put the DPM and

00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,340
we'll see if it works I think that's not

00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,390
really working right now in eight

00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:46,690
anymore and so teach your developers how

00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:48,820
to use it that debugger set up their

00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:50,710
systems spend the time we really spent

00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,750
the time we have confident pages that

00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:54,640
explain how debuggers work and stuff and

00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:57,309
now everybody can debug and it just

00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,549
makes their lives so much easier and to

00:29:57,309 --> 00:30:01,180
use that another problem and we just

00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:03,940
actually

00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:07,210
talk before was about that most examples

00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:09,220
you will find online with blogs or

00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:12,010
whatever their most probably obsolete

00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:14,890
because code changed already so there's

00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:16,840
a lot of code that you will find about

00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:18,580
blogs and people talking about it since

00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,990
two years like a blog post that is

00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:22,180
written about through about Drupal 8

00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:24,430
like how to do things two years ago it

00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:28,210
will not work anymore so it's just

00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:29,500
something you have to know that it may

00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:31,090
be will point you in to the right

00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,620
direction but if you copy paste the code

00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:36,030
that is probably there it's not going to

00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:40,330
work and there is a really good example

00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:43,150
module that explains you most of the

00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:45,520
things but because we use object

00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:48,370
oriented programming we have interfaces

00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:51,010
now and interfaces define us like a

00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:53,710
block has to look like it defines us

00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:57,100
programmatically what do we have to do

00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:59,500
to use a class and your IDE will tell

00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:03,130
you if you forgot to declare a method

00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:07,630
and stuff so if using Opie it helps you

00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:11,170
to to use rupal eight correct and so and

00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:13,330
that's really great and it's a bit I

00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:15,190
think it just takes time to play gets

00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:17,440
more stable there will be new blog post

00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:18,670
that will probably work but we had a lot

00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,400
of time that I searched something at

00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:24,490
copy paste it and doesn't work and then

00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:26,440
you're back at square one again but

00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:29,050
another interesting thing is that non

00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:31,330
Jubal developers taking chester start

00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:33,520
working right away so I have people in

00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:36,250
Zurich we have a tuple user group and

00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:38,770
now to see many people show up and they

00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:41,710
say I'm a drupal developer now because

00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:46,470
they say Drupal is not specifically

00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:48,910
symphony it's like a dialect of PHP and

00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:51,520
and they can use it because they

00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:54,070
understand all these things that like

00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:57,280
drupal 8 now uses and it's much better

00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:59,320
so we are not any more worried about

00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:02,530
like hiring people that never worked

00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:06,040
with Drupal anymore if they can develop

00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:07,930
PHP in like an object-oriented way they

00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,840
can be there now Drupal developers and

00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:13,270
we use so many different libraries and

00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,250
external stuff that all others already

00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:17,590
use so it will be for

00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:19,630
is much better to work with and of

00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:22,120
course it will take our developers that

00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:25,120
right now can deploy at the develop in

00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:27,880
the Drupal way to learn the other way

00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,570
the way how PHP does it but i think it's

00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:35,050
a it's an important change that we are

00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:37,030
not longer drupal view PHP and amount of

00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:38,710
people that we can take in from that and

00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:42,340
get help and their understand how things

00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:44,380
work is so much bigger so i think i

00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:50,080
really look forward to whatever comes

00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:54,370
out of that let's talk about custom

00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:56,380
modules and so in drupal 7 there's all

00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:59,650
the question like okay what should i

00:32:56,380 --> 00:33:01,330
declare as a hook like at which point in

00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:03,580
my country module should i right hook

00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:06,310
pick it up because maybe some other

00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:09,520
module wants to hook into me my country

00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:11,530
module and do things the problem is now

00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,660
with eight we don't already have hooks

00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:15,670
we have plugins we have services we have

00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:18,670
a lot of different things so i think

00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:21,250
it's really important or it's really

00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:23,380
hard to architecture now country modules

00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:25,990
for people that don't have a lot of core

00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:28,570
knowledge they will not know how to

00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:30,490
architecture their country module like

00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:32,740
what do i create as a plugin what is a

00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:34,840
service what is still a hook because the

00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:37,180
hooks are still there so it's like just

00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:39,700
more complex I don't know how that

00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:42,130
should work but I like that happened in

00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,500
like triple def days we had like people

00:33:42,130 --> 00:33:47,830
that are just really into core where

00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:50,290
come three people came to them and and

00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:51,760
ask them okay how should I architecture

00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,470
so there was something like a country

00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,260
architecture mentoring hours or whatever

00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:58,300
it is so I think like as a as a

00:33:56,260 --> 00:34:00,670
community we have to make sure that all

00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:02,920
the country of developers they use the

00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:05,470
system correctly and we do not create

00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,750
country modules that are not used as we

00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:09,280
can use core because the people will now

00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:12,669
learn how to use core and they should

00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,139
also know how to use con trip so I don't

00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:15,850
know how that exactly will work but I

00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:20,169
think it's just like if you have a

00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:23,080
contract developer that starts to import

00:34:20,169 --> 00:34:24,820
the module from seven to eight and it's

00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,980
really important that they read into the

00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,950
architecture of plug-in services and all

00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:30,929
these things to make it right

00:34:28,950 --> 00:34:38,010
do not maybe do it twice or maybe three

00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:40,619
times next topic front end and I think

00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:44,730
that slide says everything and it's

00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:46,440
great like twig it's at the beginning

00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:50,339
which I've said it's a small step it's a

00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:53,220
small change but how we develop now

00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:56,339
front end does so much change we give so

00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:58,680
much more power our front-end deaths so

00:34:56,339 --> 00:35:02,400
it's actually a lot of non code change

00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:04,560
now the front end they really feel to be

00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,210
empowered to work in Drupal if they need

00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,040
a change of class they just do it if

00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:12,119
they need to change the diff over there

00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:13,829
and they just do it and it's easier we

00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:16,560
have better debugging functions you can

00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:19,349
now finally realize where the hook

00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:21,750
suggests a theme suggestions are you see

00:35:19,349 --> 00:35:23,790
them in line so it's just great to use

00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:26,220
it and we just start to love and that's

00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:29,910
one of the really big reasons why we

00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:33,030
don't want to go back to seven and and

00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:35,130
actually Drupal core itself is so great

00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:37,950
we don't need a contrabass theme anymore

00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:39,900
like we use right now 47 we use Omega

00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:42,240
not for the whole way adding stuff but

00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:44,430
just for a resetting resetting it to

00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:48,450
html5 resetting it to like all the

00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:51,480
craziness that some core thing does

00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:53,940
because core is five years old and so

00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:56,130
just not how we do things anymore so I

00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,440
think it's really great that we don't

00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:00,750
need a country based theme anymore as a

00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,680
company that builds our own grid systems

00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:06,510
incest and and other libraries if you

00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:08,099
still need a layout system I mean you

00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:11,730
will still be able to there will be

00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:15,930
still contrabass themes by the community

00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:18,109
but um it's just for us it was necessary

00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:18,109
anymore

00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:27,150
one other thing and I think it's a

00:36:24,569 --> 00:36:30,480
hidden superpower that is not really

00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:33,240
teach bike or but it's extends and

00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:37,440
blocks and it's on it's something that

00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:40,079
is supported by 28 m and I give it a

00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:41,940
small example everybody can use it let's

00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,859
say we have a task to our front-end devs

00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,500
we should remove the h1 on the front

00:36:43,859 --> 00:36:48,210
page normal thing because the h1 is

00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:52,020
coming from somewhere else or at you

00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:55,380
know whatever so you have your page HTML

00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:58,349
that wig and we see here there is the h1

00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:01,770
in there that is printed in Drupal 7

00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:04,349
what we would do we copy the page HTML

00:37:01,770 --> 00:37:07,380
the twig into page desha frontal HT

00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:11,250
mother twig and you do everything again

00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:13,859
all the things here and removed here two

00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:15,869
months later you add another region you

00:37:13,859 --> 00:37:18,530
only put it to page HTML the trick you

00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:20,839
forget it in front you go to the front

00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:24,540
arrivals broken whatever doesn't work

00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:26,280
drazi see all whatever law like hundred

00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:28,140
times and do you realize oh damn there

00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:33,000
is a page lot from that age mullet wig

00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:38,089
that I forgot about look at that that's

00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:41,970
my page front HTML which says it extends

00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:45,140
the page HTML twig and it declares a

00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:49,290
block that is empty so what happened in

00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:51,240
here that is default is not there but in

00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:55,890
my page rotation of the trade i define

00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:58,410
that as a block around my h1 and in my

00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:01,799
page dash their front i say that block

00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:04,380
is empty but everything else is exactly

00:38:01,799 --> 00:38:07,770
the same and i can also do that another

00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:10,079
way i can define a block in my page HTML

00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:12,869
the trick that is empty and extend it in

00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:15,750
my front it works in both ways but we

00:38:12,869 --> 00:38:18,450
have now a system that it can build like

00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:19,920
extent of course you can like extend of

00:38:18,450 --> 00:38:21,720
extender of X and X then it doesn't

00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,790
prevent your doing crazy things but like

00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:27,329
the default things are just much easier

00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:30,000
and that's like one of the examples that

00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:32,040
I see the front and now finally like it

00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,910
because before we just throw them some

00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:37,250
PHP code at them and say like my word

00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:39,440
now we give them twig and they can use

00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:42,680
it and we can use all of twigs

00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:48,530
functionality we can use in court poet

00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:50,510
now so let's go to upgrading because

00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:52,490
everybody that ever started a Drupal 8

00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:53,869
side and then realize that two months

00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:56,060
later there's a new beta version but I

00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:58,790
just put my beta version on top of it

00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:01,100
and then there's like luckily you see

00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:02,930
some text because most of time you see

00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:06,650
just a white page and like nobody tells

00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:10,070
you what is broken so before beta 9 it's

00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:13,210
really hard and i gave a talk in through

00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:16,460
pecan austin and how to upgrade and

00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:20,540
Drupal sites and it's basically you have

00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:25,190
to figure out it yourself and after beta

00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:28,790
9 there's a project / idea of

00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:31,160
head-to-head which basically means that

00:39:28,790 --> 00:39:33,770
on Drupal the dog / projects /

00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:38,030
head-to-head it's a whole module but it

00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:41,510
just as a bag of scripts that allow you

00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:44,230
to upgrade between head-to-head so all

00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:46,790
the people that now have Drupal 8

00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:48,440
production sites running they all have

00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:50,750
the same problem they have to upgrade it

00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:53,750
so instead of everybody doing it itself

00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:55,520
we now do it all together and like we're

00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:57,619
contributing to it or other contributing

00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,570
to it so whenever there is a new head

00:39:57,619 --> 00:40:01,490
and you need to upgrade something in

00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:03,050
their database layer you need to upgrade

00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:05,930
something in the config layer or

00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:07,609
whatever there will be a couple of days

00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:09,710
later or maybe a couple of weeks there

00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:11,810
will be a script there that allows you

00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:13,609
to run that and it will do it and the

00:40:11,810 --> 00:40:14,990
best is the beta 2 better is nothing

00:40:13,609 --> 00:40:18,800
else than running all the scripts

00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:21,500
between the head-to-head so we somehow

00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,440
have something like a de facto beta beta

00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:27,590
upgrade path it's not like supported by

00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:29,480
core so it won't and also won't be out

00:40:27,590 --> 00:40:31,670
at the same time as you probably will be

00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:35,420
soon when we fix all the crepe lockers

00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:39,260
but it's a way to use it and in the past

00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:40,760
I said all the time you can use it but

00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,890
you cannot upgrade it yet so now I'm

00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:44,650
saying you can use it and you can

00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:47,170
continue use it m

00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:49,029
but of course sometimes you have to

00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:50,980
understand things it's not like I don't

00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:53,140
suggest that to everybody but if you can

00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:55,510
recode if you can t barcode it's it's

00:40:53,140 --> 00:41:00,099
it's possible to upgrade your sites

00:40:55,510 --> 00:41:01,900
without spending 68 hours to upgrade a

00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:05,680
site between beta versions which we

00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:08,500
actually spent multiple times and so I

00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:10,450
had core developers working on like or

00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:12,339
like my back and developers working two

00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:16,930
weeks to our create sites I mean they

00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:19,779
learned a lot that's at least what they

00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:22,839
said they said I learned a lot about

00:41:19,779 --> 00:41:24,760
core like they know now more things but

00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:26,950
sometimes you just like you don't like

00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:31,779
to spend the time so yeah so that you

00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:33,609
said Khan trip what triple is like in

00:41:31,779 --> 00:41:36,309
seven it's that's what the great part is

00:41:33,609 --> 00:41:38,470
like if I need I don't know and if I

00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:41,200
need a shop in so drupal commerce if i

00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:43,029
need organic like some forum system with

00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:45,339
groups I so organic groups like all

00:41:43,029 --> 00:41:50,680
these modules that make Drupal what it

00:41:45,339 --> 00:41:53,500
is we're getting there and so some con

00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:56,170
trip is already existing some Drupal 8

00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:57,789
some modules are already ported because

00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:59,319
there are a lot of production or a lot

00:41:57,789 --> 00:42:01,779
of agencies running production sites

00:41:59,319 --> 00:42:03,760
that are also upgraded country the

00:42:01,779 --> 00:42:06,250
problem is there is no real way to know

00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,559
if it works if you just visit the two

00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:11,950
pilot org project page so you can maybe

00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:14,799
see there is a eight branch you maybe

00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:17,319
know how how old it is but there is no

00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:18,970
passing test information or whatever so

00:42:17,319 --> 00:42:21,819
it's really hard to know will that work

00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:23,589
so basically you just try it out so

00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:25,029
maybe make a clone of your side make it

00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:27,430
back up before you before you install it

00:42:25,029 --> 00:42:30,579
and then you run it and maybe it works

00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:32,529
maybe doesn't fun is most of time if

00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:35,109
it's broken it's not really hard to fix

00:42:32,529 --> 00:42:36,910
it most of the time it's like some small

00:42:35,109 --> 00:42:39,369
change in a configuration some small

00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:42,700
change and like I don't know renaming

00:42:39,369 --> 00:42:45,730
things or whatever and so it's not super

00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:47,319
hard if the modules maybe three years

00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:48,700
old in this eight then it probably will

00:42:47,319 --> 00:42:51,579
be really hard but if it's like a month

00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:53,109
old or two months old which most da

00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:54,880
country bar and there is a new beta

00:42:53,109 --> 00:42:57,410
version and you upgraded it's not really

00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,540
hard to upgrade it if you do please

00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:01,940
the Patriot I think we are a community

00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:04,280
we like when you do the work why should

00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:06,500
somebody else do the work so contribute

00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:08,270
the patch give it to everybody that the

00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:12,050
module maintainer came committed in and

00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:14,030
we're we're all ready to use it but of

00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:16,190
course it's really hard to know which

00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:18,860
modules are in which state and there are

00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:22,010
two links that I suggest one of them is

00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:24,110
by barrier or social rosenberger he is

00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:25,700
also Swiss guy and he works at empty

00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:28,910
systems and he created a page that is

00:43:25,700 --> 00:43:32,420
called the eight status and which runs

00:43:28,910 --> 00:43:33,950
the simple tests as well so it takes out

00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,930
information about the simple test and it

00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:38,810
shows you per country module if it

00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:41,300
currently passes it doesn't the passing

00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:43,850
doesn't tell you it will work but it's

00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:46,880
at least more information about it and

00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:48,890
then there was blue spark come and that

00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:51,110
also do a top 100 contributed modules

00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:56,150
and they tell you like if there is at

00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:59,030
least and and a module or an eight

00:43:56,150 --> 00:44:00,590
branch in which stated is so it's easier

00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:02,660
to go there and find your modules

00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:04,190
instead of going to Drupal a dork to

00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:06,640
like search through all the modules and

00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:09,560
figure out if there is something and

00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:12,830
overall we try to use not any country

00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:15,890
modules at all but of course there is

00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:18,980
things like path auto which is not in

00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:20,720
core it's already ported and we have

00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:22,730
like global redirect which is something

00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:25,130
that we use a lot because of SEO reason

00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:28,100
so it's all there most of them are there

00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:29,930
and that are like essential to run a

00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:32,660
side these days but of course the really

00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:34,550
big ones I don't know like Commerce and

00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:38,330
the whole like organic groups i

00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:44,720
mentioned and all other things they

00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:48,320
they're nowhere right now migration it's

00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:53,030
not done yet and we have a migration

00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:55,370
between six and eight that works out of

00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:57,890
core and there is a Muslim migration

00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:59,330
path from seven to eight that is not yet

00:44:57,890 --> 00:45:02,630
committed so we're really close to

00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:05,210
finish that and so which basically means

00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:09,380
you cannot use it right now for sites

00:45:05,210 --> 00:45:10,789
that um if you want to migrate like it

00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,410
will be really hard to up

00:45:10,789 --> 00:45:16,910
rate or to use Drupal 8 4 already

00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:19,369
migration sites but we had our own like

00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:21,199
we migrated the Amaze labs from the from

00:45:19,369 --> 00:45:22,609
the form 2 / 7 side to Drupal 8 site and

00:45:21,199 --> 00:45:24,890
we had to migrate all the blog posts

00:45:22,609 --> 00:45:26,959
because we realized writing copy pasting

00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:28,339
them all of them is a bit too crazy but

00:45:26,959 --> 00:45:32,419
we actually wrote two hundred lines of

00:45:28,339 --> 00:45:34,699
custom code that's it we just install

00:45:32,419 --> 00:45:38,059
services on Drupal 7 exposed all the

00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:40,249
older blog posts as Jason we loaded the

00:45:38,059 --> 00:45:43,429
Chasen there's a Jason person in PHP a

00:45:40,249 --> 00:45:46,309
and you just make like a for each and

00:45:43,429 --> 00:45:47,630
the entity API you just fill your nodes

00:45:46,309 --> 00:45:50,479
with all the information you get from

00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:54,439
the chasin you call note Savin done

00:45:50,479 --> 00:45:57,529
let's say it's now because it's so easy

00:45:54,439 --> 00:45:59,449
to use the entity API to use the systems

00:45:57,529 --> 00:46:01,669
it's not a lot of work to write your

00:45:59,449 --> 00:46:03,349
custom migration and the code is on

00:46:01,669 --> 00:46:06,559
there if you go to our maze labs github

00:46:03,349 --> 00:46:08,630
page it's there you can use it and there

00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:12,019
are other companies that also do that so

00:46:08,630 --> 00:46:14,119
if you just need to like my great a

00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:18,709
small subset of your side it's really

00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:20,329
easy and so because we decided we were

00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:21,739
going to rebuild the configuration

00:46:20,329 --> 00:46:24,109
anyway so all the content types and all

00:46:21,739 --> 00:46:25,999
stuff we did by hand inside building

00:46:24,109 --> 00:46:27,739
anyway we didn't want to migrate that we

00:46:25,999 --> 00:46:30,380
just needed a content and it was super

00:46:27,739 --> 00:46:33,229
easy done like it was to underline of

00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:37,099
code six hours of a back-end developer

00:46:33,229 --> 00:46:40,189
and we had our own aggression but of

00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:43,189
course we want to know like what is my

00:46:40,189 --> 00:46:45,289
mo like and when can i upgrade my site I

00:46:43,189 --> 00:46:47,689
talked before like how to find my

00:46:45,289 --> 00:46:49,640
modules but sometimes you just want to

00:46:47,689 --> 00:46:52,279
know okay what is the state of my sight

00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:54,979
so there is a service or a website that

00:46:52,279 --> 00:46:56,839
is called d8 upgraded org you can copy

00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:58,279
paste all the modules you're using on

00:46:56,839 --> 00:47:00,679
your current through plus 7 site and

00:46:58,279 --> 00:47:02,509
they will inform you what the current

00:47:00,679 --> 00:47:05,929
status is so at one point you probably

00:47:02,509 --> 00:47:07,519
get an even say now it's ready but it

00:47:05,929 --> 00:47:09,469
depends on like if you still want to use

00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:12,289
this in country modules and stuff and so

00:47:09,469 --> 00:47:14,479
so it will take from time and but that

00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:17,059
website will probably help you to know

00:47:14,479 --> 00:47:19,489
about the status of you if when can I

00:47:17,059 --> 00:47:23,019
start to build through Paul eight sites

00:47:19,489 --> 00:47:23,019
of my existing Drupal 7

00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:33,349
so I think we should all start using it

00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:35,660
and it's really great it works pretty

00:47:33,349 --> 00:47:38,720
well there are some things that you have

00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:41,180
to consider first use it if you build a

00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:44,810
new site if you want to operate aside i

00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:46,369
would suggest to wait till like the two

00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:48,380
plus seven to eight is actually in there

00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:50,540
but if you're building a new site it's

00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:53,390
no problem or if you need to migrate

00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:56,330
only some content like if you rebuild

00:47:53,390 --> 00:47:59,750
the whole side it's no problem and also

00:47:56,330 --> 00:48:02,420
if you don't need any heavy country

00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:04,880
modules if you depend on the country

00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:06,260
module it's not ported yet it's probably

00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,960
going to be hard to do that I mean you

00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:10,790
can do it and you can pay your back and

00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:13,700
developers to port it and that's great

00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:14,990
the a Drupal but if you just want to do

00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:17,720
it and you want to get it fast on it

00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:19,880
will be really hard so if you are if you

00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:21,560
plan to build a brochure side one thing

00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:23,119
that I call it's like hey we are dead in

00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:25,580
that company we maybe have a blog post

00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:27,560
you have a team page these are our

00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:29,930
clients whatever like a default default

00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:32,119
brochure site you can perfectly do that

00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:34,220
if you played it works it runs we have

00:48:32,119 --> 00:48:37,490
four of them running rebuilding more so

00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:40,730
I think it's really great and we should

00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:43,210
all try and if you find a bug it's going

00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:45,290
to happen right an issue on drupal.org

00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:47,599
maybe even better write a patch

00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:50,270
contributed and we're all going to make

00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:53,300
it faster running to get ropa laid out

00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:56,330
too for all of us use it because I can

00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:58,099
tell you if you start using it you don't

00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:59,810
want to go back really you don't want to

00:48:58,099 --> 00:49:03,109
go back and all you developers also

00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:05,830
don't want to so if you want to know

00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:08,000
more of your if you wanna need help

00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:09,710
there's a group superdork that was

00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:11,750
started up the Drupal def days it's

00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:14,420
really empty right now but it's

00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:16,970
basically an a group on drupal.org about

00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:19,190
Drupal 8 production sites where we want

00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:21,080
to like share information and stuff it

00:49:19,190 --> 00:49:25,580
just starts right now so if you already

00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:27,349
are M using Drupal 8 in production maybe

00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:32,020
join there and we can have a discussion

00:49:27,349 --> 00:49:34,619
about it and there's also above a buffs

00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:39,599
here which is

00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:44,130
at 3 45 and at the room I've are a true

00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:46,380
media current em yes so which will tell

00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:49,249
you about or we can talk about it what

00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:51,779
you're using what we're not using yes

00:49:49,249 --> 00:50:01,049
basically optimization and other

00:49:51,779 --> 00:50:03,180
question ports thank you yes can you

00:50:01,049 --> 00:50:05,839
walk to the microphone that we have it

00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,839
on the recording

00:50:11,079 --> 00:50:18,549
so just a quick update on the status of

00:50:15,069 --> 00:50:20,049
the d7 to d8 migration I'm one of the

00:50:18,549 --> 00:50:21,670
people that's working on that we're

00:50:20,049 --> 00:50:24,519
going to be sprinting a lot on that on

00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:26,499
friday hopefully some news should be

00:50:24,519 --> 00:50:29,190
coming out of that pretty soon awesome

00:50:26,499 --> 00:50:32,079
so it is definitely in works i've done a

00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:35,789
d7 d8 migration using the migrate

00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:38,680
plugins so it's it's coming along

00:50:35,789 --> 00:50:41,739
certainly still not as far along as the

00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:45,489
d6 stuff is okay great awesome thanks

00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:50,130
for the work so my name is Keith to

00:50:45,489 --> 00:50:52,779
chant or my user name is Katie chant and

00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:55,390
if you have any questions about that

00:50:52,779 --> 00:50:58,119
stuff come and find me or come sprint

00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:59,650
with us on friday so can we send you DP

00:50:58,119 --> 00:51:02,140
dumps off to plus seven and you will do

00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:09,039
it depends on how much you want to pay

00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:10,839
me I don't know I have stickers I really

00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:12,519
enjoy your talk oh thank you I was

00:51:10,839 --> 00:51:14,950
wondering if you have anything to share

00:51:12,519 --> 00:51:17,559
about performance insights and maybe I'm

00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:19,150
like external caching like varnish or

00:51:17,559 --> 00:51:22,119
something else yes as it relates to the

00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:24,640
eight so there is a much better

00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:27,789
integration of external systems actually

00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:31,239
the whole like performance settings page

00:51:27,789 --> 00:51:33,789
has changed to actually explain you what

00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:36,160
the different settings are and page

00:51:33,789 --> 00:51:37,690
cache is now a module the internal page

00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:40,900
cache so if you don't use it you just

00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:43,499
disable it and and there i think the

00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:47,709
varnish module actually also works and

00:51:43,499 --> 00:51:49,989
so it can help you purge stuff and so so

00:51:47,709 --> 00:51:51,969
we all the slides running we have monish

00:51:49,989 --> 00:51:53,650
in front you have max-age headers and

00:51:51,969 --> 00:51:55,839
all the things there's one really

00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:58,719
interesting thing inside of Triple Eight

00:51:55,839 --> 00:52:01,180
there are cash tags and cash tax could

00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:03,969
theoretically also be used by varnish

00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:06,279
because varnish can also use hashtags so

00:52:03,969 --> 00:52:08,469
you could invalidate based on this cache

00:52:06,279 --> 00:52:10,779
tags there is no module right now that

00:52:08,469 --> 00:52:12,819
does that but I know we had a ball on

00:52:10,779 --> 00:52:14,170
Monday with the fastly guys because

00:52:12,819 --> 00:52:16,269
they're using varnish and do a lot of

00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:19,509
things they are really interested to

00:52:16,269 --> 00:52:21,789
have a Drupal 8 module that exposes all

00:52:19,509 --> 00:52:24,210
the tags to their server or to their

00:52:21,789 --> 00:52:26,580
system that you can basically

00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:29,390
invalidate by tags which would make so

00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:32,910
much more sense than just like URLs and

00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:34,080
so overall it works and there is a

00:52:32,910 --> 00:52:36,690
module for it you probably want to

00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:38,880
install it but there's not a lot of more

00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:41,010
if you need any more but I think that's

00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:45,540
the default yes do you think the area is

00:52:41,010 --> 00:52:48,180
much lower battery if you use it m if

00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:50,550
you configure it and it's purdy fold its

00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:52,770
contributed faster like you decide is

00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:54,720
faster because we have you mode caching

00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:57,720
we have whole page caching we have

00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:59,580
invalidation Prakash tags so log like

00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:01,050
whenever you change your node all the

00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:03,119
page cache is deleted and that God

00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:07,320
happens currently through plus 7 so yes

00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:10,470
it's better hi I think just on the

00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:12,839
varnish thing the invalidating by cash

00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:15,030
tags might be in the commercial version

00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:17,070
of varnish I'm not sure anyway that's

00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:18,630
that's not my question but are you mean

00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:22,140
the commercial version of varnish yeah

00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:24,420
oh yeah that could be I don't know okay

00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:26,760
that's what I heard so I've just got a

00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:28,770
question about layouts like you know a

00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:31,520
lot of people in Drupal 7 News panels or

00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:34,890
guestlist rate and those kinds of tools

00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:37,950
how did you manage to do layouts and yes

00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:40,320
typical so this place we'd already has a

00:53:37,950 --> 00:53:44,190
running version actually you sings more

00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:46,380
than a year ago so SF felicias and

00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:47,849
Felicia's whatever is username is M he

00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:49,560
is constantly using it so you can

00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:51,780
already use this play so we don't use

00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:53,880
this place we'd we use a lot of panels

00:53:51,780 --> 00:53:56,130
and penalize er we actually ended up

00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:58,230
with just using templates again because

00:53:56,130 --> 00:54:00,420
it's so much easier for now for the--

00:53:58,230 --> 00:54:02,280
murs to load fields and didn't put them

00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:04,470
in twig files that it used to be in PHP

00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:07,320
template so we don't really feel the

00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:10,560
need of using and penalize her anymore

00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:13,710
and it's actually doesn't exist but one

00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:16,440
of the missing things that that is in

00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:17,940
cord you cannot create pages that you

00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,700
cannot create a landing page and put

00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:22,680
blocks there and so you have no Tori I

00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:25,170
views there is a module the page my

00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:27,599
natural so there will be page miniature

00:54:25,170 --> 00:54:31,619
itself not like shipped within panels or

00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:33,359
see tools and that X pacifically

00:54:31,619 --> 00:54:35,339
supports that and there is a version on

00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:36,180
it and Tim plank it works on it and it

00:54:35,339 --> 00:54:38,609
actually works in

00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:41,369
use it on some of our sites so that

00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:45,210
definitely works but it's not whole

00:54:41,369 --> 00:54:47,700
panels as you know it but we have like a

00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:49,500
context API in core so they will

00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,780
leverage that we have a layout API

00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:53,250
over-leveraged that so again it's like

00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:54,960
 provides as all these things and

00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:59,190
we just have to like pull them together

00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:03,030
and yes so that's what we're using page

00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:04,890
when I trafficking can you go back to

00:55:03,030 --> 00:55:07,559
the slide with the node ID for the

00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:28,260
removal of active direct yes I have a

00:55:07,559 --> 00:55:36,630
patch directive yes okay okay any more

00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:40,829
questions yes yes yes security good

00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:44,579
point so the security team currently

00:55:40,829 --> 00:55:49,020
does not care is the wrong word but does

00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:51,420
not review anything in Drupal 8 so like

00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:54,390
drupal gettin also existed in eight

00:55:51,420 --> 00:55:57,240
there was no security announcement there

00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:59,250
was nothing that pushed you saying you

00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:02,849
should update your drupal head side

00:55:59,250 --> 00:56:04,619
because it was also in there and so

00:56:02,849 --> 00:56:07,980
security could be a concerning thing

00:56:04,619 --> 00:56:11,369
because if there is a security patch

00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:13,799
found it it's posted publicly in the

00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:16,980
drupal issue queue anybody can find that

00:56:13,799 --> 00:56:20,339
can write an script that uses that issue

00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:22,740
or that had that hole and hex all the

00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:25,890
Drupal 8 sites right now and so it's

00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:29,130
just something to know what we do our

00:56:25,890 --> 00:56:31,200
hosting environment is built that every

00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:33,660
single side is completely separate for

00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:37,470
others so if one side gets hacked it

00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:39,299
cannot heck the other sites and from a

00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:41,849
database from a file structure from

00:56:39,299 --> 00:56:43,349
basically everything and so on I think

00:56:41,849 --> 00:56:46,349
that's just important to know because

00:56:43,349 --> 00:56:48,210
the the chance that you do plate side is

00:56:46,349 --> 00:56:49,090
heck is getting heck is probably higher

00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:53,380
than in seven

00:56:49,090 --> 00:56:55,210
and so to to keep it in one place and

00:56:53,380 --> 00:57:00,190
make daily backups and all these things

00:56:55,210 --> 00:57:03,400
and but we decided that the risk is not

00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:05,680
that high because we think that trooper

00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:09,010
seven itself is already super stable I

00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:10,600
mean we only had one really critical

00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:12,730
issue in the last seven years and I

00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:14,740
don't expect anything happened right now

00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:16,270
in eight of course that is also

00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:17,950
depending on that we run through /

00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:20,350
Seventeen's a long time so there's a lot

00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:22,090
of things happened in the past and I

00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:24,040
think we've if when you know these

00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:25,690
things that's basically you can live

00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:28,630
with it and you can work with it and you

00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:30,790
can create stuff around but yes it's not

00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:35,290
reviewed anything at all good point

00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:37,420
thank you ok that's it I'm going to keep

00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:40,830
you longer if you're around have more

00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:40,830
questions just hit me thanks

00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:02,180
hey

00:59:58,099 --> 01:00:01,099
