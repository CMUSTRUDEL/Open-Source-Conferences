Title: DrupalCon Los Angeles 2015: Scaling Your Business Starts with the Right Spreadsheets
Publication date: 2015-05-12
Playlist: DrupalCon Los Angeles - May 2015
Description: 
	Starting a Drupal shop takes engineering experience, guts, and intuition. Those instincts can help you get a successful business off the ground, but growing a business from a handful of contractors to a team of 15, or even 150, employees requires data-driven decision making. Consider the following questions:

What's the right volume and mix of client projects to afford hiring staff dedicated to specific practice areas, such as user experience, design, and backend engineering?
What's the weighted value, or pipeline value, of all work under contract plus likely new business and ongoing support contracts?
What's your billable hours target for a particular month based upon staff availability, training, and internal resource needs?
What's your projected "effective billing rate" for the next 6 months based upon the value of all contracts, technical debt, etc.?
In this session, we will review tools and techniques, namely some really awesome spreadsheets, for staying on top of these questions. Don't reinvent the wheel! Join us to collaborate and share management tools that will help you make better long-term decisions for your business. Learn how ThinkShout became the 9th Fastest Growing Private Company in Portland in its third year, as well as how Forum One has grown to become one of the largest and most established Drupal companies in the United States.
